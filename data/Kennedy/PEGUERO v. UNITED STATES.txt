We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict overwhether a district court's failure to advise a defendant of hisright to appeal as required by the Federal Rules of CriminalProcedure provides a basis for collateral relief even whenthe defendant was aware of his right to appeal when the trialcourt omitted to give the advice. Compare, e. g., Thompsonv. United States, 111 F. 3d 109 (CA11 1997) (defendant enti-tled to relief even if he knew of his right to appeal throughother sources); United States v. Sanchez, 88 F. 3d 1243(CADC 1996) (same); Reid v. United States, 69 F. 3d 688(CA2 1995) (per curiam) (same), with Tress v. United States,87 F. 3d 188 (CA7 1996) (defendant not entitled to relief if heknew of his right to appeal); United States v. Drummond,903 F. 2d 1171 (CA8 1990) (same). We hold that a districtcourt's failure to advise the defendant of his right to appealdoes not entitle him to habeas relief if he knew of his rightand hence suffered no prejudice from the omission.Petitioner Manuel Peguero pleaded guilty to conspiracyto distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.

He alleged his counsel was ineffective for various reasons, including the failure to file a notice of appealpursuant to petitioner's request. App. 63, 65. The DistrictCourt appointed new counsel, who filed an amended motionadding a claim that at the sentencing proceeding the trialcourt violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a)(2)by failing to advise petitioner of his right to appeal his sen-tence. This last claim gives rise to the question before us.The District Court held an evidentiary hearing. Peti-tioner testified that, upon being sentenced, he at once askedhis lawyer to file an appeal. App. 139. Consistent withpetitioner's testimony, the District Court found that, although the sentencing court had failed to advise petitionerof his right to appeal the sentence, petitioner knew of hisright to appeal when the sentencing hearing occurred.No. 1:CR-90-97-01 (MD Pa., July 1, 1997), App. 168, 184.The court also credited the testimony of petitioner's trialcounsel that petitioner told counsel he did not want to takean appeal because he hoped to cooperate with the Government and earn a sentence reduction. Id., at 180-181; cf. Fed.Rule Crim. Proc. 35(b) ("The court, on motion of the Government made within one year after the imposition of thesentence, may reduce a sentence to reflect a defendant's subsequent, substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense").Relying on our holding in United States v. Timmreck,441 U. S. 780 (1979), the District Court rejected petitioner'sclaim that any violation of Rule 32, without regard to prejudice, is enough to vacate a sentence under $ 2255.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed theruling. It held that the Rule 32(a)(2) violation was subjectto harmless-error review and that, because petitioner wasaware of his right to appeal, the purpose of the Rule hadbeen served and petitioner was not entitled to relief. Judgt.order reported at 142 F. 3d 430 (1998), App. 192, 194-195.We granted certiorari. 524 U. S. 982 (1998).In 1992, when petitioner was sentenced, Federal Rule ofCriminal Procedure 32(a)(2) provided:"Notification of Right To Appeal.--After imposing sentence in a case which has gone to trial on a plea of notguilty, the court shall advise the defendant of the de-fendant's right to appeal, including any right to appealthe sentence, and of the right of a person who is unableto pay the cost of an appeal to apply for leave to appealin forma pauperis. There shall be no duty on the courtto advise the defendant of any right of appeal after sentence is imposed following a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, except that the court shall advise the defendantof any right to appeal the sentence. If the defendant sorequests, the clerk of the court shall prepare and fileforthwith a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant."Current Rule 32(c)(5) likewise imposes on the district courtthe duty to advise the defendant at sentencing of any rightto appeal.The requirement that the district court inform a defendantof his right to appeal serves important functions. It willoften be the case that, as soon as sentence is imposed, thedefendant will be taken into custody and transported elsewhere, making it difficult for the defendant to maintaincontact with his attorney. The relationship between thedefendant and the attorney may also be strained aftersentencing, in any event, because of the defendant's disappointment over the outcome of the case or the terms ofthe sentence. The attorney, moreover, concentrating on526US1 Unit: $U27 [10-02-99 17:33:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN27Cite as: 526 U. S. 23 (1999)Opinion of the Courtother matters, may fail to tell the defendant of the rightto appeal, though months later the attorney may think thathe in fact gave the advice because it was standard practiceto do so. In addition, if the defendant is advised of theright by the judge who imposes sentence, the defendant willrealize that the appeal may be taken as of right and withoutaffront to the trial judge, who may later rule upon a motionto modify or reduce the sentence. See Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 35. Advising the defendant of his right at sentencingalso gives him a clear opportunity to announce his intentionto appeal and request the court clerk to file the notice ofappeal, well before the 10-day filing period runs. See Rule32(c)(5) ("If the defendant so requests, the clerk of the courtmust immediately prepare and file a notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant"); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(b) (establishing 10-day period for filing appeal, which may be extendedfor 30 days by district court for "excusable neglect").These considerations underscore the importance of theadvice which comes from the court itself. Trial judges mustbe meticulous and precise in following each of the requirements of Rule 32 in every case. It is undisputed, then, thatthe court's failure to give the required advice was error.A violation of Rule 32(a)(2), however, does not entitle adefendant to collateral relief in all circumstances. Our precedents establish, as a general rule, that a court's failure togive a defendant advice required by the Federal Rules is asufficient basis for collateral relief only when the defendantis prejudiced by the court's error. In Hill v. United States,368 U. S. 424 (1962), for example, the District Court violatedthe then-applicable version of Rule 32(a) by failing to makeexplicit that the defendant had an opportunity to speak inhis own behalf. The defendant did not allege that he hadbeen "affirmatively denied an opportunity to speak," that theDistrict Judge had been deprived of any relevant information, or that the defendant "would have had anything at allto say if he had been formally invited to speak." Id., at 429.526US1 Unit: $U27 [10-02-99 17:33:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN28 PEGUERO v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe defendant established only "a failure to comply with theformal requirements of the Rule," ibid., and alleged no prejudice; on these premises, the Court held the defendant wasnot entitled to collateral relief, id., at 428-429.So, also, in United States v. Timmreck, collateral relief wasunavailable to a defendant who alleged only that the DistrictCourt " `fail[ed] to comply with the formal requirements' "of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure bynot advising him of a mandatory special parole term towhich he was subject. 441 U. S., at 785. The defendantdid not argue "that he was actually unaware of the specialparole term or that, if he had been properly advised by thetrial judge, he would not have pleaded guilty." Id., at 784.Having alleged no prejudice, defendant's "only claim [was]of a technical violation of the Rule" insufficient to justifyhabeas relief. Ibid.In this case, petitioner had full knowledge of his right toappeal, hence the District Court's violation of Rule 32(a)(2)by failing to inform him of that right did not prejudice him.The fact of the violation, standing alone, Hill and Timmreckinstruct, does not entitle petitioner to collateral relief.Our decision in Rodriquez v. United States, 395 U. S. 327(1969), does not hold otherwise. In Rodriquez, the Courtheld that when counsel fails to file a requested appeal, adefendant is entitled to resentencing and to an appeal without showing that his appeal would likely have had merit.Id., at 329-330. Without questioning the rule in Rodriquez,we conclude its holding is not implicated here because of theDistrict Court's factual finding that petitioner did not request an appeal. While Rodriquez did note the sentencingcourt's failure to advise the defendant of his right to appeal,it did so only in the course of rejecting the Government'sbelated argument that the case should be remanded for factfinding to determine the reason counsel had not filed the appeal. The court's failure to advise the defendant of his right526US1 Unit: $U27 [10-02-99 17:33:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN29Cite as: 526 U. S. 23 (1999)Opinion of the Courtwas simply one factor--in combination with the untimelinessof the Government's request and the lengthy proceedingsand delay the defendant had already endured--that led theCourt to conclude that it was "just under the circumstances"to accord the petitioner final relief at that time without further proceedings. Id., at 331-332. This limited and factspecific conclusion does not support a general rule that acourt's failure to advise a defendant of the right to appealautomatically requires resentencing to allow an appeal.Petitioner and his amicus would distinguish Timmreck(and, presumably, Hill) on the ground that the defendant inTimmreck had the opportunity to raise his claim on directappeal but failed to do so, whereas the absence of the "judicial warning [required by Rule 32(a)(2)] may effectivelyundermine the defendant's ability to take a direct appeal."Brief for Petitioner 20. This argument, however, providesno basis for holding that a Rule 32(a)(2) oversight, thoughnonprejudicial, automatically entitles the defendant to habeas relief. Even errors raised on direct appeal are subjectto harmless-error review. Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rulesof Criminal Procedure prohibits federal courts from grantingrelief based on errors that "d[o] not affect substantial rights."See Rule 52(a) ("Any error, defect, irregularity or variancewhich does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded"); see also Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487U. S. 250, 254-255 (1988) ("[A] federal court may not invokesupervisory power to circumvent the harmless-error inquiryprescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a). . . .Rule 52 is, in every pertinent respect, as binding as any statute duly enacted by Congress, and federal courts have nomore discretion to disregard the Rule's mandate than theydo to disregard constitutional or statutory provisions").Accordingly, we hold that petitioner is not entitled tohabeas relief based on a Rule 32(a)(2) violation when hehad independent knowledge of the right to appeal and so526US1 Unit: $U27 [10-02-99 17:33:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN30 PEGUERO v.
