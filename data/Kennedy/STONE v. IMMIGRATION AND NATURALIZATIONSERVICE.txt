We consider whether the filing of a timely motion forreconsideration of a decision by the Board of ImmigrationAppeals tolls the running of the 90-day period for seekingjudicial review of the decision.IPetitioner, Marvin Stone, is a citizen of Canada and a busi-nessman and lawyer by profession. He entered the UnitedStates in 1977 as a nonimmigrant visitor for business and hassince remained in the United States.On January 3, 1983, Stone was convicted of conspiracy andmail fraud, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $$ 371 and 1341. Heserved 18 months of a 3-year prison term. In March 1987,after his release, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) served him with an order to show cause why heshould not be deported as a nonimmigrant who had remainedin the United States beyond the period authorized by law.In January 1988, after a series of hearings, an Immigration Judge ordered Stone deported. The IJ concluded thatunder the regulations in effect when Stone entered theUnited States, an alien on a nonimmigrant for business visa514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT389Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the Courtcould remain in the country for an initial period not to exceedsix months with the privilege of seeking extensions, whichcould be granted in 6-month increments. 8 CFR $ 214.2(b) (1977). The IJ ordered deportation under 8 U. S. C.$ 1251(a)(2) (now $ 1251(a)(1)(B) (1988 ed., Supp. V)) based onpetitioner's testimony that he had remained in the UnitedStates since 1977 without seeking any extension. The IJdenied Stone's application for suspension of deportationunder 8 U. S. C. $ 1254(a)(1), concluding that Stone's conviction of mail fraud and 18-month incarceration barred him, asa matter of law, from establishing "good moral character" asrequired by $ 1254. See $ 1101(f)(7).Stone's administrative appeals were as follows: he appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which affirmedthe IJ's determinations and dismissed the appeal on July 26,1991; he filed a "Motion to Reopen and/or to Reconsider"with the BIA in August 1991; on February 3, 1993, some17 months later, the BIA denied the reconsideration motionas frivolous.Judicial review was sought next. The record does notgive the precise date, but, sometime in February or March1993, Stone petitioned the Court of Appeals for the SixthCircuit for review of both the July 26, 1991, deportationorder and the February 3, 1993, order denying reconsideration. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for wantof jurisdiction to the extent the petition sought review of theJuly 26, 1991, order, the underlying deportation determination. The court held that the filing of the reconsiderationmotion did not toll the running of the 90-day filing period forreview of final deportation orders. 13 F. 3d 934, 938-939(1994). We granted certiorari, 511 U. S. 1105 (1994), to resolve a conflict among the Circuits on the question, compareAkrap v. INS, 966 F. 2d 267, 271 (CA7 1992), and Nocon v.INS, 789 F. 2d 1028, 1033 (CA3 1986) (agreeing that the filingof a reconsideration motion does not toll the statutory timelimit for seeking review of a deportation order), with Fleary514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT390 STONE v.

INS,351 F. 2d 401, 402-403 (CA9 1965) (holding that a petition toreview a deportation order is timely if filed within the statu-tory period following the disposition of a timely filed reconsideration motion). We now affirm.IIASection 106(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act(INA) specifies that "a petition for review [of a final deportation order] may be filed not later than 90 days after thedate of the issuance of the final deportation order, or, inthe case of an alien convicted of an aggravated felony, notlater than 30 days after the issuance of such order." 8U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(1) (1988 ed. and Supp. V). The clause per-taining to an "aggravated felony" is not a factor in the analysis, petitioner's offense not being within that defined term.See $ 1101(a)(43). He had the benefit of the full 90-day filingperiod. There is no dispute that a deportation order "be-come[s] final upon dismissal of an appeal by the Board ofImmigration Appeals," 8 CFR $ 243.1 (1977), and, the partiesagree, the 90-day period started on July 26, 1991.The parties disagree, however, regarding the effect thatpetitioner's later filing of a timely motion to reconsider hadon the finality of the order. Petitioner contends that atimely motion to reconsider renders the underlying ordernonfinal, and that a petition seeking review of both the orderand the reconsideration denial is timely if filed (as this petition was) within 90 days of the reconsideration denial. TheINS argues that the finality and reviewability of an orderare unaffected by the filing of a motion to reconsider or toreopen. In its view the Court of Appeals had jurisdictionto review the denial of the motion to reconsider but not toreview the original order.514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT391Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the CourtWe considered the timeliness of a review petition wherethere is a motion to reconsider or reopen an agency's orderin ICC v. Locomotive Engineers, 482 U. S. 270 (1987). TheInterstate Commerce Commission's governing statute provided that, with certain exceptions, judicial review of ICCorders would be governed by the Hobbs Administrative Or-ders Review Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2341et seq. See LocomotiveEngineers, 482 U. S., at 277. We held that "the timely peti-tion for administrative reconsideration stayed the running ofthe Hobbs Act's limitation period until the petition had beenacted upon by the Commission."Id., at 284. Our conclusion, we acknowledged, was in some tension with the language of both the Hobbs Act, which permits an aggrievedparty to petition for review "within 60 days after [the] entry"of a final order, 28 U. S. C. $ 2344, and of 49 U. S. C. $ 10327(i),"which provides that, `[n]otwithstanding' the provision authorizing the Commission to reopen and reconsider its orders($ 10327(g)), `an action of the Commission . . . is final on thedate on which it is served, and a civil action to enforce, enjoin, suspend, or set aside the action may be filed after thatdate.' " Locomotive Engineers, supra, at 284. We foundthe controlling language similar to the corresponding provision of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.$ 704, which provides that "agency action otherwise finalis final for the purposes of this section [entitled `ActionsReviewable'] whether or not there has been presented ordetermined an application for . . . any form of reconsideratio[n]"-- "language [that] has long been construed . . . merelyto relieve parties from the requirement of petitioning for rehearing before seeking judicial review . . . but not to preventpetitions for reconsideration that are actually filed from rendering the orders under reconsideration nonfinal." Locomotive Engineers, supra, at 284-285 (citation omitted).In support of that longstanding construction of the APAlanguage, we cited dicta in two earlier cases, AmericanFarm Lines v. Black Ball Freight Service, 397 U. S. 532, 541514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT392 STONE v. INSOpinion of the Court(1970); CAB v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 367 U. S. 316, 326-327(1961), and the holding in Outland v. CAB, 284 F. 2d 224, 227(CADC 1960), a decision cited with approval in both BlackBall and Delta. Outland justified treating orders as nonfinal for purposes of review during the pendency of a motionfor reconsideration in terms of judicial economy: "[W]hen theparty elects to seek a rehearing there is always a possibilitythat the order complained of will be modified in a way whichrenders judicial review unnecessary." Outland, supra, at227.As construed in Locomotive Engineers both the APA andthe Hobbs Act embrace a tolling rule: The timely filing of amotion to reconsider renders the underlying order nonfinalfor purposes of judicial review. In consequence, pendencyof reconsideration renders the underlying decision not yetfinal, and it is implicit in the tolling rule that a party whohas sought rehearing cannot seek judicial review until therehearing has concluded. 4 K. Davis, Administrative LawTreatise $ 26:12 (2d ed. 1988); United Transportation Unionv. ICC, 871 F. 2d 1114, 1118 (CADC 1989); Bellsouth Corp. v.FCC, 17 F. 3d 1487, 1489-1490 (CADC 1994). Indeed, thoseCircuits that apply the tolling rule have so held. SeeFleary, 950 F. 2d, at 711-712 (deportation order not reviewable during pendency of motion to reopen); Hyun JoonChung v. INS, 720 F. 2d 1471, 1474 (CA9 1984) (same).Section 106 of the INA provides that "[t]he procedure prescribed by, and all the provisions of chapter 158 of title 28,shall apply to, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedurefor, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation . . . ."8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a) (1988 ed. and Supp. V). The referenceto chapter 158 of Title 28 is a reference to the Hobbs Act.In light of our construction of the Hobbs Act in LocomotiveEngineers, had Congress used that Act to govern review ofdeportation orders without further qualification, it wouldfollow that the so-called tolling rule applied.514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT393Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the CourtThe INS, however, proffers a different reading of Locomo-tive Engineers. Relying on our statement that the provision of the APA, 5 U. S. C. $ 704, has been construed "not toprevent petitions for reconsideration that are actually filedfrom rendering the orders under reconsideration nonfinal,"482 U. S., at 285 (emphasis supplied), the INS understandsLocomotive Engineers to set forth merely a default rulefrom which agencies may choose to depart. It argues thatit did so here.If the case turned on this theory, the question would arisewhether an agency subject to either the APA or the HobbsAct has the authority to specify whether the finality of itsorders for purposes of judicial review is affected by the filingof a motion to reconsider. The question is not presentedhere. Both the Hobbs Act and the APA are congressionalenactments, and Congress may alter or modify their application in the case of particular agencies. We conclude thatin amending the INA Congress chose to depart fromthe ordinary judicial treatment of agency orders underreconsideration.BCongress directed that the Hobbs Act procedures wouldgovern review of deportation orders, except for 10 specifiedqualifications. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a). Two of those ex-ceptions are pertinent. The first, contained in $ 106(a)(1) ofthe INA, provides an alien with 90 days to petition for re-view of a final deportation order (30 days for aliens convictedof an aggravated felony), instead of the Hobbs Act's 60-dayperiod. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). Thesecond and decisive exception is contained in $ 106(a)(6), aprovision added when Congress amended the INA in 1990.The section provides:"[W]henever a petitioner seeks review of an order underthis section, any review sought with respect to a motion to reopen or reconsider such an order shall be514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT394 STONE v. INSOpinion of the Courtconsolidated with the review of the order." 8 U. S. C.$ 1105a(a)(6).By its terms, $ 106(a)(6) contemplates two petitions for review and directs the courts to consolidate the matters. Thewords of the statute do not permit us to say that the filingof a petition for reconsideration or reopening dislodges theearlier proceeding reviewing the underlying order. Thestatute, in fact, directs that the motion to reopen or reconsider is to be consolidated with the review of the order, notthe other way around. This indicates to us that the actionto review the underlying order remains active and pendingbefore the court. We conclude that the statute is best understood as reflecting an intent on the part of Congress thatdeportation orders are to be reviewed in a timely fashionafter issuance, irrespective of the later filing of a motion toreopen or reconsider.Were a motion for reconsideration to render the underlying order nonfinal, there would be, in the normal course, onlyone petition for review filed and hence nothing for the judiciary to consolidate. As in Locomotive Engineers itself, review would be sought after denial of reconsideration, andboth the underlying order and the denial of reconsiderationwould be reviewed in a single proceeding, insofar, at least,as denial of reconsideration would be reviewable at all. SeeLocomotive Engineers, 482 U. S., at 280. Indeed, the NinthCircuit, which before the 1990 amendment had held thatpendency of a reconsideration motion did render a deportation order nonfinal, understood that the tolling rule contemplates just one petition for review: "Congress visualized asingle administrative proceeding in which all questions relating to an alien's deportation would be raised and resolved,followed by a single petition in a court of appeals for judicialreview . . . ." Yamada v. INS, 384 F. 2d 214, 218 (CA9 1967).The tolling rule is hard to square with the existence of twoseparate judicial review proceedings.514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT395Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the CourtUnder the no-tolling rule, by contrast, two separate peti-tions for review will exist in the normal course. An orderwould be final when issued, irrespective of the later filing of areconsideration motion, and the aggrieved party would seekjudicial review of the order within the specified period.Upon denial of reconsideration, the petitioner would file aseparate petition to review that second final order. Becauseit appears that only the no-tolling rule could give rise totwo separate petitions for review simultaneously before thecourts, which it is plain $ 106(a)(6) contemplates, it wouldseem that only that rule gives meaning to the section.Although the consolidation provision does not mention tolling, see post, at 408 (Breyer, J., dissenting), tolling wouldbe the logical consequence if the statutory scheme providedfor the nonfinality of orders upon the filing of a reconsideration motion. Locomotive Engineers' conclusion as to tollingfollowed as a necessary consequence from its conclusionabout finality. Finality is the antecedent question, and as tothat matter the consolidation provision speaks volumes. Allwould agree that the provision envisions two petitions forreview. See post, at 408 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Becauseonly "final deportation order[s]" may be reviewed, 8 U. S. C.$ 1105a(a)(1), it follows by necessity that the provision requires for its operation the existence of two separate finalorders, the petitions for review of which could be consolidated. The two orders cannot remain final and hence thesubject of separate petitions for review if the filing of thereconsideration motion rendered the original order nonfinal.It follows that the filing of the reconsideration motion doesnot toll the time to petition for review. By speaking to finality, the consolidation provision does say quite a bit abouttolling.Recognizing this problem, petitioner at oral argumentsought to give meaning to $ 106(a)(6) by offering a differentversion of what often might occur. Petitioner envisioned analien who petitioned for review of a final deportation order,514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT396 STONE v. INSOpinion of the Courtand, while the petition was still pending, went back to theagency to seek its reconsideration or, if new evidence hadarisen, reopening. If, upon denial of reconsideration or re-opening, the alien sought review, and the review of the original order were still pending, $ 106(a)(6) would apply and thetwo petitions would be consolidated. The dissent relies onthe same assumed state of events. Seepost, at 409-410.That construct, however, is premised on a view of finalityquite inconsistent with the tolling rule petitioner himselfproposes. If, as petitioner advocates, the filing of a timelypetition for reconsideration before seeking judicial reviewrenders the underlying order nonfinal, so that a reviewingcourt would lack jurisdiction to review the order until afterdisposition of the reconsideration motion, one wonders howa court retains jurisdiction merely because the petitioner delays the reconsideration motions until after filing the petitionfor judicial review of the underlying order. The policy supporting the nonfinality rule--that "when the party elects toseek a rehearing there is always a possibility that the ordercomplained of will be modified in a way which renders judicial review unnecessary," Outland, 284 F. 2d, at 227--applieswith equal force where the party seeks agency rehearingafter filing a petition for judicial review. Indeed, the Courtof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, whose decision in Outland we cited in support of our construction inLocomotive Engineers, has so held in the years following ourdecision. See Wade v. FCC, 986 F. 2d 1433, 1434 (1993) (percuriam) ("The danger of wasted judicial effort . . . ariseswhether a party seeks agency reconsideration before, simultaneous with, or after filing an appeal or petition for judicialreview") (citations omitted). The Wade holding rested on,and is consistent with, our decision in a somewhat analogouscontext that the filing of a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure59 motion to alter or amend a district court's judgment stripsthe appellate court of jurisdiction, whether the Rule 59 motion is filed before or after the notice of appeal. See Griggs514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT397Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the Courtv. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 61 (1982)(per curiam). Our decision, based on a construction of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4), noted the "theoreti-cal inconsistency" of permitting the district court to retainjurisdiction to decide the Rule 59 motion while treating thenotice of appeal as "adequate for purposes of beginning theappeals process."Griggs, supra, at 59.We need not confirm the correctness of the Wade decision,but neither should we go out of our way to say it is incorrect,as petitioner and the dissent would have us do. The incon-sistency in petitioner's construction of $ 106(a)(6) is the sameinconsistency that we noted in Griggs. Petitioner assumesthat a reconsideration motion renders the underlying ordernonfinal if the motion is filed before a petition for review, butthat finality is unaffected if the reconsideration motion isfiled one day after the petition for review. It is implausiblethat Congress would direct different results in the two circumstances. At any rate, under petitioner's constructionthe consolidation provision would have effect only in therarest of circumstances.When Congress acts to amend a statute, we presume itintends its amendment to have real and substantial effect.See Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U. S. 330, 339 (1979) (Courtmust construe statute to give effect, if possible, to everyprovision); Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 109-111(1990) (same). Had Congress intended review of INS ordersto proceed in a manner no different from review of otheragencies, as petitioner appears to argue, there would havebeen no reason for Congress to have included the consolidation provision. The reasonable construction is that theamendment was enacted as an exception, not just to state analready existing rule. Section 106(a)(6) is an explicit exception to the general applicability of the Hobbs Act procedures,so it must be construed as creating a procedure differentfrom normal practice under the Act. We conclude, as didthe Court of Appeals, see 13 F. 3d, at 938, and the Seventh514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT398 STONE v. INSOpinion of the CourtCircuit, see Akrap, 966 F. 2d, at 271, that the consolidationprovision Congress inserted when it amended the Act in 1990is best understood as reflecting its expectation that in theparticular context of INS deportation orders the normal tolling rule will not apply. CUnderlying considerations of administrative and judicialefficiency, as well as fairness to the alien, support our conclusion that Congress intended to depart from the conventionaltolling rule in deportation cases.Deportation orders are self-executing orders, not depend-ent upon judicial enforcement. This accounts for the automatic stay mechanism, the statutory provision providing thatservice of the petition for review of the deportation orderstays the deportation absent contrary direction from thecourt or the alien's aggravated felony status. See 8 U. S. C.$ 1105a(a)(3). The automatic stay would be all but a neces-sity for preserving the jurisdiction of the court, for theagency might not otherwise refrain from enforcement. In-deed, the INA provides that "nothing in this section [Judicialreview of orders of deportation and exclusion] shall be con-strued to require the Attorney General to defer deportationof an alien after the issuance of a deportation order becauseof the right of judicial review of the order granted by thissection." 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(8) (1988 ed., Supp. V). Andit has been the longstanding view of the INS, a view wepresume Congress understood when it amended the Act in1990, that a motion for reconsideration does not serve to staythe deportation order. 8 CFR $ 3.8 (1977). Cf. Delta AirLines, 367 U. S., at 325-327 (certificate of public convenienceand necessity effective when issued though not final for purposes of judicial review because of pendency of reconsidera-tion motion).Were the tolling rule to apply here, aliens subject to de-portation orders might well face a Hobson's choice: petitionfor agency reconsideration at the risk of immediate deporta514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT399Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the Courttion, or forgo reconsideration and petition for review to ob-tain the automatic stay. The choice is a hard one in deportation cases, in that the consequences of deportation areso final, unlike orders in some other administrative contexts.Once an alien has been deported, the courts lack jurisdiction to review the deportation order's validity. See 8U. S. C. $ 1105a(c). This choice is one Congress might nothave wished to impose on the alien.An alien who had filed for agency reconsideration mightseek to avoid immediate deportation by seeking a judicialstay. At oral argument, petitioner suggested a habeas corpus action as one solution to the dilemma. Even on the assumption that a habeas corpus action would be available, see$ 1105a(a) (Exclusiveness of procedure), the solution is unsatisfactory. In evaluating those stay applications the courtswould be required to assess the probability of the alien's prevailing on review, turning the stay proceedings into collateral previews of the eventual petitions for review--indeed apreview now implicating the district court, not just the courtof appeals. By inviting duplicative review in multiplecourts, the normal tolling rule would frustrate, rather thanpromote, its stated goal of judicial economy.From an even more fundamental standpoint, the policiesof the tolling rule are at odds with Congress' policy in adopting the judicial review provisions of the INA. The tollingrule reflects a preference to postpone judicial review to ensure completion of the administrative process. Reconsideration might eliminate the need for judicial intervention, andthe resultant saving in judicial resources ought not to bediminished by premature adjudication. By contrast, Congress' "fundamental purpose" in enacting $ 106 of the INAwas "to abbreviate the process of judicial review . . . in orderto frustrate certain practices . . . whereby persons subject todeportation were forestalling departure by dilatory tacticsin the courts." Foti v. INS, 375 U. S. 217, 224 (1963). Congress' concern reflected the reality that "in a deportation514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT400 STONE v. INSOpinion of the Courtproceeding . . . as a general matter, every delay works tothe advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely toremain in the United States." INS v. Doherty, 502 U. S. 314,321-325 (1992). Congress' intent in adopting and thenamending the INA was to expedite both the initiation andthe completion of the judicial review process. The tollingrule's policy of delayed review would be at odds with thecongressional purpose.The dissent does not dispute that a principal purpose ofthe 1990 amendments to the INA was to expedite petitionsfor review and to redress the related problem of successiveand frivolous administrative appeals and motions. In theImmigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101-649, 104 Stat. 5048,Congress took five steps to reduce or eliminate these abuses.First, it directed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations limiting the number of reconsideration and reopeningmotions that an alien could file. $ 545(b). Second, it instructed the Attorney General to promulgate regulationsspecifying the maximum time period for the filing of thosemotions, hinting that a 20-day period would be appropriate.See ibid. Third, Congress cut in half the time for seekingjudicial review of the final deportation order, from 180 to90 days. See ibid. Fourth, Congress directed the AttorneyGeneral to define "frivolous behavior for which attorneysmay be sanctioned" in connection with administrative appeals and motions. See $ 545(a). In the dissent's view, afifth measure, the consolidation provision, was added for noapparent reason and bears no relation to the other amendments Congress enacted at the same time. It is more plausible that when Congress took the first four steps to solve aproblem, the fifth--the consolidation provision--was alsopart of the solution, and not a step in the other direction.By envisioning that a final deportation order will remainfinal and reviewable for 90 days from the date of its issuanceirrespective of the later filing of a reconsideration motion,Congress' amendment eliminates much if not all of the incen514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT401Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the Courttive to file a meritless reconsideration motion, and, like theother amendments adopted at the same time, expedites thetime within which the judicial review process of the deporta-tion order begins.DA consideration of the analogous practice of appellatecourt review of district court judgments confirms the correctness of our construction of Congress' language. Theclosest analogy to the INS' discretionary petition for agencyreconsideration is the motion for relief from judgment underFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). The effect of Rule60(b) motions (at least when made more than 10 days afterjudgment, an exception discussed below), on the finality andappealability of district court judgments is comparable to theeffect of reconsideration motions on INS orders. With theexception noted, the filing of a Rule 60(b) motion does nottoll the running of the time for taking an appeal, see Fed.Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b); 11 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Prac-tice and Procedure $ 2871 (1973) (Wright & Miller), and thependency of the motion before the district court does notaffect the continuity of a prior-taken appeal. Seeibid.And last but not least, the pendency of an appeal does notaffect the district court's power to grant Rule 60 relief. SeeStandard Oil Co. of Cal. v. United States, 429 U. S. 17, 18-19(1976) (per curiam); Wright & Miller $ 2873 (1994 Supp.). Alitigant faced with an unfavorable district court judgmentmust appeal that judgment within the time allotted by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4, whether or not the liti-gant first files a Rule 60(b) motion (where the Rule 60 motionis filed more than 10 days following judgment). Either be-fore or after filing his appeal, the litigant may also file a Rule60(b) motion for relief with the district court. The denial ofthe motion is appealable as a separate final order, and if theoriginal appeal is still pending it would seem that the courtof appeals can consolidate the proceedings. In each of theserespects, the practice of litigants under Rule 60(b) is, under514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT402 STONE v. INSOpinion of the Courtour construction, identical to that of aliens who file motionsfor reconsideration before the BIA. In each case two separate postdecision appeals are filed.For reasons not relevant here, in 1991 the Rules of Appellate Procedure were amended to provide that Rule 60(b) motions filed within 10 days of a district court's judgment dotoll the time for taking an appeal. See Fed. Rule App. Proc.4(a)(4)(F). That amendment added Rule 60(b) motions filedwithin 10 days of judgment to a list of other post-trial motions that toll the running of the time for appeal, a list thatincludes Rule 59 motions to alter or amend a judgment. SeeFed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(4)(C). A consideration of this provision of the appellate rules is quite revealing. The list ofpost-trial motions that toll the time for appeal is followed,and hence qualified, by the language interpreted in Griggs,language that provides in express terms that these motionsalso serve to divest the appellate court of jurisdiction wherethe motions are filed after appeal is taken.The language of Rule 4 undermines the dissent's relianceon a presumption that appellate court jurisdiction once asserted is not divested by further proceedings at the trial oragency level. See post, at 410. Indeed, the practice is mostoften to the contrary where appellate court review of districtcourt judgments subject to post-trial motions is concerned.See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(4) (specifying that the majorityof postjudgment motions filed with the district court divestthe appellate court of jurisdiction that had once existed). Adistrict court judgment subject to one of these enumeratedmotions, typified by Rule 59, is reviewable only after, and inconjunction with, review of the denial of the post-trial motion, and just one appeal pends before the appellate court atany one time.In short, the Rules of Appellate Procedure evince a consistent and coherent view of the finality and appealability ofdistrict court judgments subject to post-trial motions. Themajority of post-trial motions, such as Rule 59, render the514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT403Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the Courtunderlying judgment nonfinal both when filed before an appeal is taken (thus tolling the time for taking an appeal),and when filed after the notice of appeal (thus divesting theappellate court of jurisdiction). Other motions, such as Rule60(b) motions filed more than 10 days after judgment, do notaffect the finality of a district court's judgment, either whenfiled before the appeal (no tolling), or afterwards (appellatecourt jurisdiction not divested). Motions that do toll thetime for taking appeal give rise to only one appeal in whichall matters are reviewed; motions that do not toll the timefor taking an appeal give rise to two separate appellate proceedings that can be consolidated.EOur colleagues in dissent agree that the consolidation provision envisions the existence of two separate petitions forreview. See post, at 408. To give the provision meaningwhile at the same time concluding that the tolling rule applies, the dissent is compelled to conclude that a reconsideration motion before the BIA renders the original order nonfinal if made before a petition for judicial review is filed butdoes not affect the finality of the order if filed afterwards.See post, at 413-414. The hybrid tolling rule the dissentsuggests has no analogue at all in the appellate court-districtcourt context. On the contrary, as we have just observed,the uniform principle where appellate review of districtcourt judgments is concerned is that motions that tollproduce but one appeal, motions that do not toll produce two.It is only by creating this new hybrid that the dissent cangive meaning to the consolidation provision, and avoid theHobson's choice for the alien. While litigants who practicebefore the district courts and the BIA will have familiaritywith both types of post-trial motions discussed above, andwill have no difficulty practicing under the rule we announcetoday, practitioners would have no familiarity with the hy514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT404 STONE v. INSOpinion of the Courtbrid tolling rule the dissent is compelled to devise in orderto give the consolidation provision meaning.It is worthwhile pausing to consider just how many stepsthe dissent must take to reconcile the consolidation provisionwith the tolling rule it prefers. The dissent's constructionwould require that the Court conclude, without any briefing,that our decision inGriggs does not apply to agency review.The dissent would as well disrupt administrative law in gen-eral by overturning the practice of the Court of Appeals withthe most experience reviewing agency decisions when facedwith agency reconsideration motions made after petition forreview (the District of Columbia Circuit), thereby resolvinga circuit split without any briefing or argument. See post,at 412. Our construction avoids each of these extraordinarysteps. It creates a practice parallel to that of appellatecourts reviewing district court judgments subject to pendingRule 60(b) motions filed more than 10 days after judgmentand requires us to take no firm position on whether Griggsapplies to agency review where tolling does occur.But the full import of our decision in Griggs, and the concomitant problem addressed in Wade, are in some sense secondary to our fundamental point of dispute with the dissent.In our view the consolidation provision reflects Congress' intent to depart from the normal tolling rule in this context,whereas on the dissent's view it does not. Congress itselfwas explicit in stating that the consolidation provision is anexception to the applicability of the Hobbs Act procedures,see supra, at 393, and it took the deliberate step of amendingthe Act in 1990 to add the provision. The challenge for thedissent is not, then, just to give the consolidation provisionsome work to do that is consistent with the tolling rule, butto give it some work as an exception to the applicability ofthe Hobbs Act procedures, a meaning that explains why Congress might have taken trouble to add it. The dissent's construction of the consolidation provision gives it effect, if any,only in what must be those rare instances where aliens first514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT405Cite as: 514 U. S. 386 (1995)Opinion of the Courtpetition for judicial review and then seek agency reconsider-ation. And, more important, its construction cannot accountfor Congress' decision to amend the Act in 1990 to providethat the Hobbs Act procedures, which in the normal courseinclude the tolling rule, shall apply "except" for the consoli-dation provision.FWhatever assessment Congress might have made in enact-ing the judicial review provisions of the INA in the first instance, we conclude from the consolidation provision addedin 1990 that it envisioned two separate petitions filed to review two separate final orders. To be sure, it would havebeen preferable for Congress to have spoken with greaterclarity. Judicial review provisions, however, are jurisdic-tional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity totheir terms. As we have explained:"Section 106(a) is intended exclusively to prescribe andregulate a portion of the jurisdiction of the federalcourts. As a jurisdictional statute, it must be construedboth with precision and with fidelity to the terms bywhich Congress has expressed its wishes." Cheng FanKwok v. INS, 392 U. S. 206, 212 (1968).This is all the more true of statutory provisions specifyingthe timing of review, for those time limits are, as we haveoften stated, "mandatory and jurisdictional," Missouri v.Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990), and are not subject to equitable tolling. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 26(b).* * *The consolidation provision in $ 106(a)(6) reflects Congress'understanding that a deportation order is final, and reviewable, when issued. Its finality is not affected by the subse-quent filing of a motion to reconsider. The order being finalwhen issued, an alien has 90 days from that date to seekreview. The alien, if he chooses, may also seek agency re514us2$47l 05-29-98 20:17:01 PAGES OPINPGT406 STONE v.

Wherethe original petition is still before the court, the court shallconsolidate the two petitions. See 8 U. S. C. $ 1105a(a)(6)(1988 ed., Supp. V).Because Stone's petition was filed more than 90 days afterthe issuance of the BIA's July 26, 1991, decision, the Courtof Appeals lacked jurisdiction to review that order.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
