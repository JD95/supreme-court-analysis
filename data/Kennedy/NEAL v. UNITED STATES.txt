The policy of sentencing drug offenders based on theamount of drugs involved, straightforward enough in itssimplest formulation, gives rise to complexities, requiringus again to address the methods for calculating the weightof LSD sold by a drug trafficker. We reject petitioner'scontention that the revised system for determining LSDamounts under the United States Sentencing Guidelinesrequires reconsideration of the method used to determine*Peter Goldberger and Barbara E.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtstatutory minimum sentences, and we adhere to our formerdecision on the subject.ILSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is such a powerful nar-cotic that the average dose contains only 0.05 milligrams ofthe pure drug. The per-dose amount is so minute that inmost instances LSD is transferred to a carrier medium andsold at retail by the dose, not by weight. In the typical case,pure LSD is dissolved in alcohol or other solvent, and theresulting solution is applied to paper or gelatin. The solventevaporates; the LSD remains. The dealer cuts the paper orgel into single-dose squares for sale on the street. Usersingest the LSD by swallowing or licking the squares ordrinking a beverage into which the squares have beenmixed.In 1988, petitioner Meirl Neal was arrested for selling11,456 doses of LSD on blotter paper. The combined weightof the LSD and the paper was 109.51 grams. Following aguilty plea in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, petitioner was convicted of one countof possession of LSD with intent to distribute it, in violationof 21 U. S. C. $ 841, and one count of conspiracy to possessLSD with intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U. S. C.$ 846. At the initial sentencing, the method for determiningthe weight of the illegal mixture or substance was the sameunder the Guidelines and the statute directing minimum sen-tences. The determinative amount was the whole weight ofthe blotter paper containing the drug. See United StatesSentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2D1.1, DrugQuantity Table, n. * (Nov. 1987) (1987 USSG). Because thetotal weight of the LSD and blotter paper exceeded 10grams, the District Court found petitioner subject to the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence specified in 21 U. S. C.$ 841(b)(1)(A)(v). Under the version of the SentencingGuidelines then in effect, the indicated sentence was evengreater than the statutory minimum: The quantity of the516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT287Cite as: 516 U. S. 284 (1996)Opinion of the Courtdrugs and petitioner's prior convictions resulted in a Guide-lines sentencing range of 188 to 235 months' imprisonment,even after an adjustment for petitioner's acceptance of re-sponsibility for the crime. The District Court imposed concurrent sentences of 192 months' imprisonment on eachcount, to be followed by five years of supervised release.In November 1993, the United States Sentencing Commission revised the method of calculating the weight of LSD inthe Sentencing Guidelines. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual, App. C., Amdt. 488 (Nov. 1995)(1995 USSG). Departing from its former approach of weighing the entire mixture or substance containing LSD, theamended Guideline instructed courts to give each dose ofLSD on a carrier medium a constructive or presumed weightof 0.4 milligrams. Id., $ 2D1.1(c), n. (H). The revisedGuideline was retroactive, id., App. C, Amdt. 502, and onemonth later petitioner filed a motion to modify his sentence,see 18 U. S. C. $ 3582(c)(2). He contended that the weightof the LSD attributable to him under the amended Guidelines was 4.58 grams (11,456 doses516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT288 NEAL v.

Under the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, penalties depended upon whetheror not a drug was classified as a narcotic. Chagrined bythe resulting sentencing disparities, Congress amended thenarcotics laws in 1984 to calculate penalties by the weight ofthe pure drug involved. SeeChapman, 500 U. S., at 460-461. Focusing on the pure drug, however, often allowed retail traffickers, who supplied street markets with mixed ordiluted drugs ready for consumption, to receive sentences516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT289Cite as: 516 U. S. 284 (1996)Opinion of the Courtlighter than what Congress deemed necessary. Id., at 461.In passing the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570,100 Stat. 3207, "Congress adopted a `market-oriented' ap-proach to punishing drug trafficking, under which the totalquantity of what is distributed, rather than the amount ofpure drug involved, is used to determine the length ofthe sentence."Chapman, supra, at 461; H. R. Rep. No. 99-845, pt. 1, pp. 11-12, 17 (1986). The Act provided formandatory minimum sentences based on the weight of "amixture or substance containing a detectable amount" ofvarious controlled substances, including LSD. 21 U. S. C.$$ 841(b)(1)(A)(i)-(viii) and (B)(i)-(viii). Trafficking in 10grams or more of a mixture or substance containingLSD earns the offender at least 10 years in prison.$ 841(b)(1)(A)(v).In Chapman, we interpreted the provision of the Act thatprovided a mandatory minimum sentence of five years fortrafficking in an LSD "mixture or substance" that weighedone gram or more, see $ 841(b)(1)(B)(v). We construed "mixture" and "substance" to have their ordinary meaning,observing that the terms had not been defined in the statute or the Sentencing Guidelines and had no distinctivecommon-law meaning. 500 U. S., at 461-462. Reasoningthat the "LSD is diffused among the fibers of the paper . . .[and] cannot be distinguished from the blotter paper, noreasily separated from it," id., at 462, we held that theactual weight of the blotter paper, with its absorbed LSD, isdeterminative under the statute, id., at 468.Petitioner contends that the method approved in Chapman is no longer appropriate. In his view, the Commissionintended its dose-based method to supplant the actualweight method used in Chapman, and we should not presume that the Commission would recognize two inconsistentschemes for sentencing LSD traffickers, cf. 1995 USSG$ 2D1.1, comment., backg'd (stating purposes of making offense levels in $ 2D1.1 "proportional to the levels established516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT290 NEAL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtby statute" and providing "a logical sentencing structure fordrug offenses"). Petitioner concedes, as he must, that theCommission does not have the authority to amend the stat-ute we construed inChapman. He argues, nonetheless,that the Commission is the agency charged with interpretation of penalty statutes and expert in sentencing matters, soits construction of $ 841(b)(1) should be given deference.See Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Congress intended theCommission's rulemaking to respond to judicial decisions indeveloping a coherent sentencing regime, seeBraxton v.United States, 500 U. S. 344, 348 (1991), so, petitioner contends, deference is appropriate even though the Commission's interpretation postdated Chapman. In the alternative, he urges that we reassess Chapman in light of theCommission's revised method, which was formed from careful study of retail drug markets. Although Chapman established that the weight of the blotter paper must be taken intoaccount, it did not address how courts should do so. TheCommission has filled the gap, petitioner maintains, by assigning a constructive weight to the LSD and carrier foreach dose.While acknowledging that the Commission's expertise andthe design of the Guidelines may be of potential weight andrelevance in other contexts, we conclude that the Commission's choice of an alternative methodology for weighing LSDdoes not alter our interpretation of the statute in Chapman.In any event, principles of stare decisis require that we adhere to our earlier decision.The Commission was born of congressional disenchantment with the vagaries of federal sentencing and of the parole system. Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 366(1989) (discussing the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 and itslegislative history). The Commission is directed to "establish sentencing policies and practices for the Federal criminaljustice system" that meet congressional goals set forth in 18516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT291Cite as: 516 U. S. 284 (1996)Opinion of the CourtU. S. C. $ 3553(a)(2) and that, within a regime of individual-ized sentencing, eliminate unwarranted disparities in punishment of similar defendants who commit similar crimes. See28 U. S. C. $$ 991(b)(1)(A)-(B). Congress also charged theCommission with the duty to measure and monitor the effectiveness of various sentencing, penal, and correctional prac-tices. $ 991(b)(2). In fulfilling its mandate, the Commissionhas the authority to promulgate, review, and revise bindingguidelines to "establish a range of determinate sentences forcategories of offenses and defendants according to variousspecified factors, among others."Mistretta, supra, at 368(internal quotation marks omitted); see 28 U. S. C. $$ 994(a),(b), (c), and (o).Like 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1), the Sentencing Guidelines calibrate the punishment of drug traffickers according to thequantity of drugs involved in the offense. From their inception in 1987, the Guidelines have used a detailed Drug Quantity Table as a first step in determining the sentence. See1995 USSG $ 2D1.1(c); 1987 USSG $ 2D1.1. The currentTable has 17 tiers, each with specified weight ranges for different controlled substances. The weight ranges reflect theCommission's assessment of equivalent culpability amongdefendants who traffic in different types of drugs, and soall defendants in the same tier are assigned the same baseoffense level. See 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1(c). Once the baseoffense level is adjusted for other factors, it yields a specificsentencing range depending on the defendant's criminal history. See 1995 USSG $ 1B1.1.Although the mandatory-minimum statute and the Guidelines both turn upon drug quantities, the Commission itselfhas noted that "mandatory minimums are both structurallyand functionally at odds with sentencing guidelines and thegoals the guidelines seek to achieve." United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to Congress: MandatoryMinimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System26 (Aug. 1991).516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT292 NEAL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court"The sentencing guidelines system is essentially a sys-tem of finely calibrated sentences. For example, as thequantity of drugs increases, there is a proportional in-crease in the sentence. In marked contrast, the mandatory minimums are essentially a flat, tariff-like approachto sentencing. Whereas guidelines seek a smooth continuum, mandatory minimums result in `cliffs.' The`cliffs' that result from mandatory minimums compromise proportionality, a fundamental premise for justpunishment, and a primary goal of the Sentencing Reform Act." Id., at iii.Despite incongruities between the Guidelines and the man-datory sentencing statute, the Commission has sought tomake the Guidelines parallel to the scheme of $ 841(b)(1) inmost instances. See 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1, comment., n. 10("The Commission has used the sentences provided in,and equivalences derived from, the statute (21 U. S. C.$ 841(b)(1)), as the primary basis for the guideline sen-tences"). As a general rule, the Commission adopts thesame approach to weighing drugs as the statute does: "Un-less otherwise specified, the weight of a controlled substanceset forth in the table refers to the entire weight of any mix-ture or substance containing a detectable amount of the controlled substance." 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1(c), n. (A); see also1995 USSG $ 2D1.1, comment., n. 1 (" `Mixture or substance'as used in this guideline has the same meaning as in 21U. S. C. $ 841, except as expressly provided"); 1987 USSG$ 2D1.1, n. * (weighing rule intended to be "[c]onsistent withthe provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act"). For most narcotics, there will be no inconsistency in the calculations ofdrug quantities.After study of the LSD trade, however, the Commissionin 1993 decided it could no longer follow that general rulefor LSD offenses and fulfill the statutory directive to pro-mote proportionate sentencing. The Commission determined that "[b]ecause the weights of LSD carrier media vary516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT293Cite as: 516 U. S. 284 (1996)Opinion of the Courtwidely and typically far exceed the weight of the controlledsubstance itself, . . . basing offense levels on the entire weightof the LSD and carrier medium would produce unwarranteddisparity among offenses involving the same quantity ofactual LSD (but different carrier weights), as well as sentences disproportionate to those for other, more dangerouscontrolled substances, such as PCP." 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1,comment., backg'd. To remedy the problem, the Commis-sion revised its Guideline to provide:"In the case of LSD on a carrier medium (e. g., a sheet ofblotter paper), do not use the weight of the LSD/carriermedium. Instead, treat each dose of LSD on the carriermedium as equal to 0.4 mg of LSD for the purposesof the Drug Quantity Table." 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1(c),n. (H).Under the amendment, a court determines the defendant'sbase offense level in the Drug Quantity Table by multiplyingthe number of doses of LSD involved by 0.4 milligrams.The Commission submitted the amendment to Congress,which did not disapprove it in the 180 days allotted by stat-ute. See 28 U. S. C. $ 994(p). The amended Guideline tookeffect on November 1, 1993, and was in force when petitionerwas resentenced.As a threshold matter, it is doubtful that the Commissionintended the constructive-weight method of the Guidelinesto displace the actual-weight method thatChapman requiresfor statutory minimum sentences. The commentary, whichis the authoritative construction of the Guidelines absentplain inconsistency or statutory or constitutional infirmity,Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36, 38 (1993), states thatthe new method is to be used "for purposes of determiningthe base offense level." 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1, comment.,backg'd. The next paragraph of the commentary repeatsthe point: The new method will make "the offense level forLSD on a carrier medium . . . [less than] that for the same516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT294 NEAL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtnumber of doses of PCP," "harmonize offense levels for LSDoffenses with those for other controlled substances," and"avoid an undue influence of varied carrier weight on theapplicable offense level."Ibid. This would be obscurelanguage to choose if the Commission were attempting aninterpretation of the statute as well as a revision of theGuidelines, for offense levels are not relevant to themandatory-minimum calculation.Furthermore, after a catalog of reasons for adopting thedose-based method, the Commission ends with the observa-tion that "[n]onetheless, this approach does not override theapplicability of `mixture or substance' for the purpose ofapplying any mandatory minimum sentence (see Chapman;$ 5G1.1(b))." Ibid. The citation of Chapman in tandemwith $ 5G1.1(b), which advises that "[w]here a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum ofthe applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence," suggests thatthe Guidelines calculation is independent of the statutorycalculation, and that the statute controls if they conflict.The Commission seems to do no more than acknowledge that,whether or not its method would be preferable for the statute and Guideline alike, it has no authority to override thestatute as we have construed it.Were we, for argument's sake, to adopt petitioner's viewthat the Commission intended the commentary as an interpretation of $ 841(b)(1), and that the last sentence of the commentary states the Commission's view that the dose-basedmethod is consistent with the term "mixture or substance"in the statute, he still would not prevail. The Commission'sdose-based method cannot be squared with Chapman. TheGuideline does take into account some of the weight of thecarrier medium (because the average weight of an LSD doseis 0.05 milligrams, 0.35 of the Commission's constructiveweight per dose of 0.4 milligrams is attributable to the medium, see 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1, comment., backg'd), but we516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT295Cite as: 516 U. S. 284 (1996)Opinion of the Courtheld in Chapman that $ 841(b)(1) requires "the entire mix-ture or substance . . . to be weighed when calculating thesentence." 500 U. S., at 459. In these circumstances, weneed not decide what, if any, deference is owed the Commission in order to reject its alleged contrary interpretation.Once we have determined a statute's meaning, we adhere toour ruling under the doctrine ofstare decisis, and we assessan agency's later interpretation of the statute against thatsettled law.Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502 U. S. 527, 536-537(1992); Maislin Industries, U. S., Inc. v. Primary Steel, Inc.,497 U. S. 116, 131 (1990).Our reluctance to overturn precedents derives in partfrom institutional concerns about the relationship of the Judiciary to Congress. One reason that we give great weightto stare decisis in the area of statutory construction is that"Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of itslegislation." Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736(1977). We have overruled our precedents when the intervening development of the law has "removed or weakenedthe conceptual underpinnings from the prior decision, orwhere the later law has rendered the decision irreconcilablewith competing legal doctrines or policies." Patterson v.McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989) (citationsomitted). Absent those changes or compelling evidencebearing on Congress' original intent, NLRB v. Longshoremen, 473 U. S. 61, 84 (1985), our system demands that weadhere to our prior interpretations of statutes. Entrustedwithin its sphere to make policy judgments, the Commissionmay abandon its old methods in favor of what it has deemeda more desirable "approach" to calculating LSD quantities,cf. 1995 USSG $ 2D1.1, comment., backg'd. We, however, donot have the same latitude to forsake prior interpretationsof a statute. True, there may be little in logic to defend thestatute's treatment of LSD; it results in significant disparityof punishment meted out to LSD offenders relative to othernarcotics traffickers. (Although the number of doses peti516us2$20L 10-22-98 12:32:35 PAGES OPINPGT296 NEAL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttioner sold seems high, the quantities of other narcotics adefendant would have to sell to receive a comparable sentence under the statute yield far more doses, see UnitedStates v. Marshall, 908 F. 2d 1312, 1334 (CA7 1990) (Posner,J., dissenting), aff 'd sub nom. Chapman v. United States, 500U. S. 453 (1991).) Even so, Congress, not this Court, has theresponsibility for revising its statutes. Were we to alter ourstatutory interpretations from case to case, Congress wouldhave less reason to exercise its responsibility to correct stat-utes that are thought to be unwise or unfair.Like Chapman, this case involves a petitioner who soldLSD on blotter paper, the "carrier of choice" involved in "thevast majority of cases." 500 U. S., at 466. Just as we de-clined in Chapman to entertain "hypothetical cases . . . involving very heavy carriers and very little LSD" in resolvinga due process challenge, ibid., we do not address how$ 841(b)(1) should be applied in those cases.We hold that $ 841(b)(1) directs a sentencing court to takeinto account the actual weight of the blotter paper with itsabsorbed LSD, even though the Sentencing Guidelinesrequire a different method of calculating the weight of anLSD mixture or substance. The judgment of the Court ofAppeals is affirmed.
