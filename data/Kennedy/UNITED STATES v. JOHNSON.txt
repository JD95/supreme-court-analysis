An offender had been serving time in federal prison formultiple felonies when two of his convictions were declared invalid. As a result, he had served too much prisontime and was at once set free, but a term of supervised release was yet to be served on the remaining convictions.The question becomes whether the excess prison time shouldbe credited to the supervised release term, reducing itslength. Bound by the text of the controlling statute, 18U. S. C. $ 3624(e), we hold that the supervised release termremains unaltered.Respondent Roy Lee Johnson was convicted in 1990 ontwo counts of possession with an intent to distribute controlled substances, 84 Stat. 1260, 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a), ontwo counts of use of a firearm in connection with a drugtrafficking crime, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c) (1994 ed. and Supp. IV),*Edward M. Chikofsky, Barbara E. Bergman, and Henry J.

S. 53 (2000)Opinion of the Courtand on one count of possession of a firearm by a convictedfelon, $ 922(g). He received a sentence of 171 months' imprisonment, consisting of three concurrent 51-month termson the $ 841(a) and $ 922(g) counts, to be followed by twoconsecutive 60-month terms on the $ 924(c) counts. In addi-tion, the District Court imposed a mandatory 3-year termof supervised release for the drug possession offenses. See21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. III). The Court ofAppeals, though otherwise affirming respondent's convictions and sentence, concluded the District Court erred insentencing him to consecutive terms of imprisonment forthe two $ 924(c) firearm offenses. United States v. Johnson,25 F. 3d 1335, 1337-1338 (CA6 1994) (en banc). On remandthe District Court modified the prisoner's sentence to a termof 111 months.After our decision in Bailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137(1995), respondent filed a motion under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 tovacate his $ 924(c) convictions, and the Government did notoppose. On May 2, 1996, the District Court vacated thoseconvictions, modifying respondent's sentence to 51 months.He had already served more than that amount of time, sothe District Court ordered his immediate release. His termof supervised release then went into effect. This disputeconcerns its length.In June 1996, respondent filed a motion requesting theDistrict Court to reduce his supervised release term by 2.5years, the extra time served on the vacated $ 924(c) convictions. The District Court denied relief, explaining thatpursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 3624(e) the supervised release commenced upon respondent's actual release from incarceration, not before. Granting respondent credit, the court observed, would undermine Congress' aim of using supervisedrelease to assist convicted felons in their transitions to community life.A divided Court of Appeals reversed. 154 F. 3d 569 (CA61998). The court accepted respondent's argument that his529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN56 UNITED STATES v. JOHNSONOpinion of the Courtterm of supervised release commenced not on the day he leftprison confines but earlier, when his lawful term of imprisonment expired. Id., at 571. Awarding respondent credit forthe extra time served, the court further concluded, wouldprovide meaningful relief because supervised release, whileserving rehabilitative purposes, is also "punitive in nature."Ibid. Judge Gilman dissented, agreeing with the positionof the District Court.Id., at 572-573.The Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusionson the question presented. Compare United States v.Blake, 88 F. 3d 824, 825 (CA9 1996) (supervised releasecommences on the date defendants "should have been re-leased, rather than on the dates of their actual release"),with United States v. Jeanes, 150 F. 3d 483, 485 (CA5 1998)(supervised release cannot run during any period of imprisonment); United States v. Joseph, 109 F. 3d 34 (CA1 1997)(same); United States v. Douglas, 88 F. 3d 533, 534 (CA81996) (same). We granted certiorari to resolve the question,527 U. S. 1062 (1999), and we now reverse.Section 3583(a) of Title 18 authorizes, and in some in-stances mandates, sentencing courts to order supervisedrelease terms following imprisonment. On the issue pre-sented for review--whether a term of supervised releasebegins on the date of actual release from incarceration oron an earlier date due to a mistaken interpretation of federal law--the language of $ 3624(e) controls. The statuteprovides in relevant part:"A prisoner whose sentence includes a term of super-vised release after imprisonment shall be released bythe Bureau of Prisons to the supervision of a probationofficer who shall, during the term imposed, supervisethe person released to the degree warranted by the con-ditions specified by the sentencing court. The term ofsupervised release commences on the day the person isreleased from imprisonment and runs concurrently withany Federal, State, or local term of probation or super529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN57Cite as: 529 U. S. 53 (2000)Opinion of the Courtvised release or parole for another offense to which theperson is subject or becomes subject during the termof supervised release. A term of supervised releasedoes not run during any period in which the person isimprisoned in connection with a conviction for a Federal,State, or local crime unless the imprisonment is for aperiod of less than 30 consecutive days."The quoted language directs that a supervised releaseterm does not commence until an individual "is releasedfrom imprisonment." There can be little question aboutthe meaning of the word "release" in the context of imprisonment. It means "[t]o loosen or destroy the force of;to remove the obligation or effect of; hence to alleviateor remove; . . . [t]o let loose again; to set free from re-straint, confinement, or servitude; to set at liberty; to let go."Webster's New International Dictionary 2103 (2d ed. 1949).As these definitions illustrate, the ordinary, commonsensemeaning of release is to be freed from confinement. To sayrespondent was released while still imprisoned diminishesthe concept the word intends to convey.The first sentence of $ 3624(e) supports our construction.A term of supervised release comes "after imprisonment,"once the prisoner is "released by the Bureau of Prisons tothe supervision of a probation officer." Supervised releasedoes not run while an individual remains in the custody ofthe Bureau of Prisons. The phrase "on the day the personis released," in the second sentence of $ 3624(e), suggests astrict temporal interpretation, not some fictitious or con-structive earlier time. The statute does not say "on theday the person is released or on the earlier day when heshould have been released." Indeed, the third sentenceadmonishes that "supervised release does not run during anyperiod in which the person is imprisoned."The statute does provide for concurrent running of super-vised release in specific cases. After the operative phrase"released from imprisonment," $ 3624(e) requires the con529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN58 UNITED STATES v. JOHNSONOpinion of the Courtcurrent running of a term of supervised release with termsof probation, parole, or with other, separate terms of supervised release. The statute instructs that concurrency is per-mitted not for prison sentences but only for those other typesof sentences given specific mention. The next sentence inthe statute does address a prison term and does allow concurrent counting, but only for prison terms less than 30 daysin length. When Congress provides exceptions in a statute,it does not follow that courts have authority to create others.The proper inference, and the one we adopt here, is thatCongress considered the issue of exceptions and, in the end,limited the statute to the ones set forth. The 30-day exception finds no application in this case; each of respondent'ssentences, to which the term of supervised release attached,exceeded that amount of time. Finally, $ 3583(e)(3) does nothave a substantial bearing on the interpretive issue, for thisdirective addresses instances where conditions of supervisedrelease have been violated, and the court orders a revocation.Our conclusi on finds further support in 18 U. S. C.$ 3583(a), which authorizes the imposition of "a term of supervised release after imprisonment." This provision, too,is inconsistent with respondent's contention that confinementand supervised release can run at the same time. The statute's direction is clear and precise. Release takes place onthe day the prisoner in fact is freed from confinement.The Court of Appeals reasoned that reduction of respondent's supervised release term was a necessary implementation of $ 3624(a), which provides that "[a] prisoner shall bereleased by the Bureau of Prisons on the date of the expiration of the prisoner's term of imprisonment . . . ." All concede respondent's term of imprisonment should have endedearlier than it did. It does not follow, however, that theterm of supervised release commenced, as a matter of law,once he completed serving his lawful sentences. It is truethe prison term and the release term are related, for thelatter cannot begin until the former expires. Though inter529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN59Cite as: 529 U. S. 53 (2000)Opinion of the Courtrelated, the terms are not interchangeable. The Court ofAppeals was mistaken in holding otherwise, and the textof $ 3624(e) cannot accommodate the rule the Court of Ap-peals derived. Supervised release has no statutory function until confinement ends. Cf. United States v. Granderson, 511 U. S. 39, 50 (1994) (observing that "terms ofsupervised release . . . follow up prison terms"). The ruleof lenity does not alter the analysis. Absent ambiguity, therule of lenity is not applicable to guide statutory interpretation. Cf. Gozlon-Peretz v. United States, 498 U. S. 395, 410(1991).While the text of $ 3624(e) resolves the case, we observethat our conclusion accords with the statute's purpose anddesign. The objectives of supervised release would be unfulfilled if excess prison time were to offset and reduceterms of supervised release. Congress intended supervised release to assist individuals in their transition tocommunity life. Supervised release fulfills rehabilitativeends, distinct from those served by incarceration. See$ 3553(a)(2)(D); United States Sentencing Commission,Guidelines Manual $$ 5D1.3(c), (d), (e) (Nov. 1998); see alsoS. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 124 (1983) (declaring that "the primarygoal [of supervised release] is to ease the defendant's transition into the community after the service of a long prisonterm for a particularly serious offense, or to provide rehabilitation to a defendant who has spent a fairly short periodin prison for punishment or other purposes but still needssupervision and training programs after release"). Sentencing courts, in determining the conditions of a defendant'ssupervised release, are required to consider, among otherfactors, "the nature and circumstances of the offense andthe history and characteristics of the defendant," "theneed . . . to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; . . . to protect the public from further crimes of thedefendant; and . . . to provide the defendant with needededucational or vocational training, medical care, or other cor529US1 Unit: $U33 [10-04-01 09:21:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN60 UNITED STATES v. JOHNSONOpinion of the Courtrectional treatment." 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a). In the instantcase, the transition assistance ordered by the trial court required respondent, among other conditions, to avoid possess-ing or transporting firearms and to participate in a drug dependency treatment program. These conditions illustratethat supervised release, unlike incarceration, provides individuals with postconfinement assistance. Cf. Gozlon-Peretz,supra, at 407 (describing "[s]upervised release [a]s a uniquemethod of postconfinement supervision invented by theCongress for a series of sentencing reforms"). The Courtof Appeals erred in treating respondent's time in prison asinterchangeable with his term of supervised release.There can be no doubt that equitable considerations ofgreat weight exist when an individual is incarcerated be-yond the proper expiration of his prison term. The statutory structure provides a means to address these concernsin large part. The trial court, as it sees fit, may modify anindividual's conditions of supervised release. $ 3583(e)(2).Furthermore, the court may terminate an individual's supervised release obligations "at any time after the expiration ofone year . . . if it is satisfied that such action is warrantedby the conduct of the defendant released and the interest ofjustice." $ 3583(e)(1). Respondent may invoke $ 3583(e)(2)in pursuit of relief; and, having completed one year of super-vised release, he may also seek relief under $ 3583(e)(1).The statute, by its own necessary operation, does not re-duce the length of a supervised release term by reason ofexcess time served in prison. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
