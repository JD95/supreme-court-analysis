" `The  trial  Court,  in  balancing  the  proved  aggravators and  mitigators,  emphasizes  to  the  Supreme  Court  that 

it  only  relied  upon  those  proven  statutory  aggravators. The trial Court's remarks at the sentencing hearing, and 
the  language  in  the  original  sentencing  order  explain why such high weight was given to the statutory aggra-
vator  of  multiple  murder,  and  further  support  the  trial Court's  personal  conclusion  that  the  sentence  is  appro-
priate  punishment  for  this  offender  and  these  crimes.' "

tenced  under  $ 924(c).  The  question  here  is  whether  Congress'  1998 
reformulation of $ 924(c) rendered their sentences excessive.  The 1998 
alteration responded primarily to Bailey v.  United States, 516 U. S. 137, 
which  held  that  $ 924(c)(1)'s  ban  on  "use"  of  a  firearm  did  not  reach 
"mere possession" of a weapon, id., at 144.  In addition to bringing pos-
session within the statute's compass, Congress increased the severity of 

$ 924(c)  sentences  by  changing  "once  mandatory  sentences  into  manda-
tory minimum  sentences," United States  v.  O'Brien, 560 U. S. 218, 232, 
and  by  elevating  the  sentences  for  brandishing  and  discharging  a  fire-
arm and for repeat offenses.  Congress also restructured the provision, 
"divid[ing]  what  was  once  a  lengthy  principal  sentence  into  separate 
subparagraphs,"  id.,  at  227,  and  it  added  the  "except"  clause  at  issue. 
Pp. 15-18. 

(b)  The  leading  portion  of  the  "except"  clause  now  prefacing, 

$ 924(c)(1)(A) refers to a "greater minimum sentence . . .  otherwise pro-
vided  by  [$ 924(c)  itself]";  the  second  segment  of  the  clause  refers  to  a 
greater  minimum  provided  outside  $ 924(c)  "by  any  other  provision  of 
law."  To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is "otherwise 
provided . . . by any other provision of law," the key question is: other-
wise  provided  for  what?  Most  courts  have  answered:  for  the  conduct 

$ 924(c) proscribes, i. e., possessing a firearm in connection with a predi-
cate crime. 

Abbott  and  Gould  disagree.  Gould  would  apply  the  "except"  clause 
whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater mini-
mum  sentence.  Abbott argues that the minimum sentence "otherwise 
provided"  must  be  one  imposed  for  the  criminal  transaction  that  trig-
gered  $ 924(c) or,  in the  alternative,  for  a firearm  offense involving  the 
same firearm that triggered $ 924(c).  These three interpretations share 
a  common,  but  implausible,  premise:  that  Congress  in  1998  adopted  a 
less aggressive mode of applying $ 924(c), one that significantly reduced 
the severity of the provision's impact on defendants.  The pre-1998 ver-
sion  of  $ 924(c)  prescribed  a  discrete  sentence  to  be  imposed  on  top  of 
the  sentence  received  for  the  predicate  crime  or  any  separate  firearm 
conviction.  It is unlikely that Congress meant a prefatory clause, added 
in  a  bill  dubbed  "An  Act  [t]o  throttle  criminal  use  of  guns,"  to  effect  a 
departure  so  great  from  $ 924(c)'s  original  insistence  that  sentencing 
judges  impose  additional  punishment  for  $ 924(c)  violations.  Abbott's 
and Gould's readings would undercut that same bill's primary objective: 
to  expand  $ 924(c)'s  coverage  to  reach  firearm  possession.  Their  read-
ings would also result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did not 
intend.  Section 924(c), as they construe it, would often impose no pen-
alty at all for the conduct that provision makes independently criminal. 
Stranger still, the worst offenders would often secure shorter sentences 

10  ABBOTT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Syllabus 
than less grave offenders, because the highest sentences on other counts 
of  conviction  would  be  most  likely  to  preempt  $ 924(c)  sentences.  Ab-
bott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may take account of any 
anomalies  and  order  appropriate  adjustments.  While a  judge  exercis-
ing discretion  under  18 U. S. C.  $ 3553(a)  would  not  be required  to  sen-
tence a more culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that 
Congress  had  such  a  cure  in  mind  in  1998,  seven  years  before  United 
States v.  Booker, 543 U. S. 220, held that district courts have discretion 
to  depart  from  the  Sentencing  Guidelines  based  on  $ 3553(a).  Abbott 
and  Gould  alternatively  contend  that  Congress  could  have  anticipated 
that  the  then-mandatory  Guidelines  would  resolve  disparities  by  pre-
scribing  a  firearm  enhancement  to  the  predicate  sentence.  But  Con-
gress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it amended 

$ 924(c)  to  impose  a  penalty  even  when  the  predicate  crime  itself  pre-
scribed a firearm enhancement.  Between 1984 and 1998, Congress ex-
panded the reach or increased the severity of $ 924(c) four times, never 
suggesting  that  a  Guidelines  firearm  enhancement  might  suffice  to  ac-
complish $ 924(c)'s objective.  Nor is there any indication that Congress 
was contemplating the Guidelines' relationship to $ 924(c) when it added 
the "except" clause.  Pp. 18-24. 

(c)  The  Government's  reading--that  the  "except"  clause  is  triggered 
only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct violat-
ing  $ 924(c)--makes  far  more  sense.  It  gives  effect  to  statutory  lan-
guage  commanding  that  all  $ 924(c)  offenders  shall  receive  additional 
punishment  for  their  violation  of  that  provision,  a  command  reiterated 
three  times:  First,  the  statute  states  that  the  $ 924(c)(1)  punishment 
"shall" be imposed "in addition to" the penalty for the predicate offense, 

$ 924(c)(1)(A); second, $ 924(c) demands a discrete punishment even if the 
predicate  crime  itself  "provides  for  an  enhanced  punishment  if  com-
mitted  by  the  use  of  a  deadly  or  dangerous  weapon  or  device,"  ibid.; 
third,  $ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii)  rules  out  the  possibility  that  a  $ 924(c)  sentence 
might "run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment."  Inter-
preting  the  "except"  clause  to  train  on  conduct  offending  $ 924(c)  also 
makes sense as a matter of syntax.  The clause is a proviso, most natu-
rally read to refer to the conduct $ 924(c) proscribes.  See United States 
v.  Morrow, 266 U. S. 531, 534-535.  There is strong contextual support 
for  the  view  that  the  "except"  clause  was  intended  simply  to  clarify 

$ 924(c).  At the same time Congress added the clause, it made the rest 
of  $ 924(c)  more  complex,  dividing  its  existing  sentencing  prescriptions 
into four paragraphs, and adding new penalties for brandishing and dis-
charging a firearm.  Congress thought the restructuring might confuse 
sentencing judges: It added the "except" clause's initial part, which cov-
ers greater minimums provided "by this subsection," to instruct judges

Syllabus 
not to stack ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandish-
ing  the  same  weapon.  In  referencing  greater  minimums  provided  by 
"any  other  provision  of  law,"  the  second  portion  of  the  clause  simply 
furnishes  the  same  no-stacking  instruction  for  cases  in  which  $ 924(c) 
and  a  different  statute  both  punish  conduct  offending  $ 924(c).  Con-
gress  likely  anticipated  such  cases  when  framing  the  "except"  clause, 
for  the  bill  that  reformulated  $ 924(c)'s  text  also  amended  18  U. S. C. 

$ 3559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons convicted 
of "firearms possession (as described in section 924(c))."  This interpre-
tation  does  not  render  the  "except"  clause's  second  part  effectively 
meaningless.  Though  $ 3559(c)  is  the  only  existing  statute,  outside  of 

$ 924(c)  itself,  that  the  Government  places  within  the  "except"  clause, 
the "any other provision of law" portion installs a safety valve for addi-
tional sentences that Congress may codify outside $ 924(c) in the future. 
Neither United  States v.  Gonzales, 520  U. S.  1, nor Republic  of Iraq  v. 
Beaty, 556 U. S. 848, warrants a different conclusion.  Pp. 24-28.

refers  to  "a  greater  minimum  sentence  .  .  .  otherwise  pro-vided."  "[O]therwise  provided"  for  what,  the  courts  below 

asked;  their  answer,  for  conduct  offending  $ 924(c),  i. e.,  pos-sessing  a  firearm  in  connection  with  a  crime  of  violence  or 
drug-trafficking crime. A  defendant  is  not  spared  from  a  separate,  consecutive 
sentence  for  a  $ 924(c)  conviction,  the  lower  courts  deter-mined,  whenever  he  faces  a  higher  mandatory  minimum  for 
a  different  count  of  conviction.  Instead,  according  to  the courts  below  and  the  Government  here,  the  "except"  clause 
applies  only  when  another  provision--whether  contained within  or  placed  outside  $ 924(c)--commands  a  longer  term 
for  conduct  violating  $ 924(c).  For  example,  the  manda-tory  minimum  sentence  for  a  $ 924(c)  offense  is  five  years, 
but  if  the  firearm  is  brandished,  the  minimum  rises  to seven  years,  and  if  the  firearm  is  discharged,  to  ten  years. 

$ 924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (iii).  A defendant who possessed, bran-dished, and discharged a firearm in violation of $ 924(c) would 
thus face a mandatory minimum term of ten years. We hold, in  accord  with the  courts below, and in line with 
the  majority  of  the  Courts  of  Appeals,  that  a  defendant  is subject  to  a  mandatory,  consecutive  sentence  for  a  $ 924(c) 
conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a  higher mandatory  minimum on  a different count 
of conviction.  Under the "except" clause as we comprehend it,  a  $ 924(c)  offender  is  not  subject  to  stacked  sentences  for 
violating  $ 924(c).  If  he  possessed,  brandished,  and  dis-charged  a  gun,  the  mandatory  penalty  would  be  10  years, 
not  22.  He  is,  however,  subject  to  the  highest  mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in $ 924(c), unless another 
provision  of  law  directed  to  conduct  proscribed  by  $ 924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.

ing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime.  Ab-bott's  case  was  tried  to  a  jury  in  the  Eastern  District  of 

Pennsylvania,  which convicted  him on  the  $ 924(c)  count and three  others:  two  predicate  trafficking  counts,  21  U. S. C. 

$$ 841,  846,  and  being  a  felon  in  possession  of  a  firearm,  18 U. S. C. $ 922(g).  Given Abbott's extensive criminal history, 
his  felon-in-possession  conviction  triggered  a  15-year  man-datory  minimum  under  the  Armed  Career  Criminal  Act 
(ACCA),  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e).  The  District  Court  sentenced Abbott  to the  15 years  mandated by  ACCA,  and  to  an addi-
tional  five  years  for  the  $ 924(c)  violation,  yielding  a  total prison term of 20 years.

Gould's indictment listed seven separate drug and firearm charges.  In  return  for  Gould's  agreement  to  plead  guilty, 

the Government dropped all but two: one $ 924(c) offense and one  predicate  drug-trafficking  crime.  The  latter,  for  con-
spiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, car-ried  a  ten-year  mandatory  minimum  under  $ 841(b)(1)(A). 
Firearm  involvement  was  not  an  element  of  that  offense. The  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Northern  District 
of Texas imposed a sentence of 11 years and five months for the  trafficking  offense  and  an  additional  five  years  for  the 

$ 924(c) violation, for a total of 16 years and five months. On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged the five-year con-
secutive  sentence  each  received  under  $ 924(c).  Abbott urged  that  ACCA's  15-year  mandatory  minimum  triggered 

$ 924(c)'s  "except"  clause,  because  ACCA  qualified  as  "[an]-other provision of law" that  "provided" a  "greater minimum 
sentence."  Gould said the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking crime. 

The  United States  Court of  Appeals  for  the Third  Circuit affirmed  Abbott's  sentence,  concluding  that  the  "except" 

1 Abbott received ten years on each drug-trafficking count.  Those sen-
tences, imposed concurrently, did not alter his total term of imprisonment 
and do not figure in this litigation.

Congress  enacted  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(c)  as  part  of  the  Gun Control  Act  of  1968,  82  Stat.  1213.  The  "except"  clause, 

which did  not  appear in $ 924(c) as originally composed,  was introduced  by  statutory  amendment  in  1998.  See  An  Act 
[t]o throttle  criminal use  of guns,  112  Stat.  3469.  We  begin by  setting  out  $ 924(c),  first  as  it  read  before  1998,  then  as 
amended that year. The earlier version read in relevant part: 

"Whoever,  during  and  in  relation  to  any  crime  of  vio-lence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of vio-

that  imposed  for  the  crime  of  violence  or  drug  traffick-ing  crime  in  which  the  firearm  was  used  or  carried." 

$ 924(c)(1) (1994 ed.) (footnote omitted). 
If  this  pre-1998  text  governed,  all  agree,  separate  counts  of conviction  would  have  no  preemptive  force,  and  Abbott  and 

Gould  would  have  been  correctly  sentenced  under  $ 924(c). The question we confront is whether Congress' 1998 reform-
ulation of $ 924(c) rendered the sentences imposed on Abbott and Gould excessive. 

The 1998 alteration responded primarily to our decision in Bailey v.  United States, 516 U. S. 137 (1995).  In proscribing 
"use"  of  a  firearm,  Bailey  held,  $ 924(c)(1)  did  not  reach "mere  possession"  of  the  weapon. 

Id.,  at  144.  Congress legislated  a  different  result;  in  the  1998  revision,  "colloqui-

ally  known  as  the  Bailey  Fix  Act,"  the  Legislature  brought 

17 Cite as: 562 U. S. 8 (2010)

possession  within  the  statute's  compass.  United  States  v. 
O'Brien,  560  U. S.  218,  233  (2010)  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted). In  addition  to  the  change  prompted  by 

Bailey,  Congress 
increased  the  severity  of  $ 924(c)  sentences  in  two  other respects:  The  1998  revision  "changed  what  were  once  man-

datory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences, " 
O'Brien,  560  U. S.,  at  232;  and  it  elevated  the  sentences for  brandishing  and  discharging  a  firearm  and  for  repeat 

offenses.  Congress  also  restructured  the  provision,  "divid-[ing]  what  was  once  a  lengthy  principal  sentence  into  sep-
arate subparagraphs."  Id., at 227.  And it added the prefa-tory "except" clause at issue in the cases now before us.  As 
amended, $ 924(c)(1)(A) prescribes: 

"Except  to  the  extent  that  a  greater  minimum  sen-
tence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other  provision  of  law,  any  person  who,  during  and  in 

relation  to  any  crime  of  violence  or  drug  trafficking crime  (including  a  crime  of  violence  or  drug  trafficking 
crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if com-
mitted  by  the  use  of  a  deadly  or  dangerous  weapon  or 
device)  for  which  the  person  may  be  prosecuted  in  a 
court  of  the United  States,  uses or  carries  a  firearm,  or 
who,  in  furtherance  of  any  such  crime,  possesses  a  fire-
arm,  shall,  in  addition  to  the  punishment  provided  for 
such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime-- 

"(i)  be  sentenced  to  a  term  of  imprisonment  of  not 
less than 5 years; 

"(ii)  if  the  firearm  is  brandished,  be  sentenced  to  a 
term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and 

"(iii)  if  the  firearm  is  discharged,  be  sentenced  to  a 
term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years." 

The 1998 reformulation, furthermore, removed to separate 
paragraphs  the  provisions  commanding  higher  penalties  for 

18  ABBOTT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
especially  destructive  weapons  and  "second  or  subsequent" offenses.  See  $ 924(c)(1)(B),  (C).

3  While  leaving  the  pen-

alties  for  high ly  destructive  weapons  unchanged,  the revision  raised  the  base  punishment  for  "second  or  subse-

quent" offenses from 20 years to 25.  Ibid.  The reformula-tion  also  transferred  the  bar  on  concurrent  sentences  to 

$ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii): 

"[N]o  term  of  imprisonment  imposed  on  a  person under  this  subsection  shall  run  concurrently  with  any 

other  term  of  imprisonment  imposed  on  the  person,  in-cluding any term of imprisonment imposed for the crime 
of  violence  or  drug  trafficking  crime  during  which  the firearm was used, carried, or possessed." 

B 
The leading portion of the "except" clause, which now pre-faces  $ 924(c)(1)(A),  refers  to  a  "greater  minimum  sentence 

.  .  .  otherwise  provided  by  this  subsection,"  i. e.,  by  $ 924(c) itself;  the  second  segment  of  the  clause  refers  to  a  greater 
minimum  provided  outside  $ 924(c)  "by  any  other  provision of  law."  Beyond  debate,  the  latter  instruction  does  not  re-

"(B)  If  the  firearm  possessed  by  a  person  convicted  of  a  violation  of 
this subsection-- 

"(i)  is  a  short-barreled  rifle,  short-barreled  shotgun,  or  semiautomatic 
assault weapon, the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment 
of not less than 10 years; or 

"(ii)  is a machinegun or a destructive device, or is equipped with a fire-
arm  silencer  or  firearm  muffler,  the  person  shall  be  sentenced  to  a  term 
of imprisonment of not less than 30 years.

years; and 

"(ii)  if the firearm involved is a machinegun or a destructive device, or 
is  equipped  with  a  firearm  silencer  or  firearm  muffler,  be  sentenced  to 
imprisonment for life."

Opinion of the Court 
lieve a $ 924(c) offender of additional punishment "simply be-
cause  a  higher  mandatory  minimum  sentence  exists  in  the 
United  States  Code."  Brief  for  Petitioner  in  No.  09-479, 
p.  19  (hereinafter  Abbott  Brief).  Were  it  otherwise,  the 
statute's  ascending  series  of  minimums,  set  out  in 

$ 924(c)(1)(A)-(C), would  have  no work  to do;  the  only  possi-
ble $ 924(c) sentence would be the Code's highest--life.  The 
"except" clause, it is therefore undisputed, "has to have some 
understood referent to be  intelligible."  United  States  v. 
Parker,  549  F.  3d  5,  11  (CA1  2008).  What  should  that  ref-
erent be?  As we comprehend the clause, to determine 
whether a greater minimum sentence is "otherwise provided 
. . . by any  other provision of law," the key question one must 
ask  is:  otherwise  provided  for  what?  As  earlier  noted,  see 
supra,  at  13,  most  courts,  in  line  with  the  courts  below  and 
the Government, have answered: for the conduct $ 924(c) pro-
scribes, i. e., possessing a firearm in connection with a predi-
cate crime. 

Abbott  and  Gould  disagree  and  offer  diverse  readings. 
Gould  principally  would  apply  the  "except"  clause  to  pre-
clude  a  $ 924(c)  sentence  whenever  "any  of  a  defendant's 
counts  of convictio[n]  at  sentencing"  require  a  greater  mini-
mum  sentence.  Brief  for  Petitioner  in  No.  09-7073,  p.  14 
(hereinafter Gould Brief). 

In  lieu  of  Gould's  position  that  any  greater  minimum  sen-
tence  on  a  different  count  of  conviction  will  do,  Abbott 

advances  a  somewhat  narrower  "transactional  approach." 
Any sentence imposed on the defendant fits the bill, he urges, 
so long as the sentence was imposed "because of the criminal 
transaction  that  triggered  $ 924(c)  in  the  first  place."  Ab-
bott  Brief  10.  Accord  United  States  v.  Williams,  558  F.  3d 
166, 171 (CA2 2009). 

Abbott also tenders an alternative construction: The mini-
mum  sentence  "otherwise  provided"  must  be  for  a  firearm 
offense--for  example,  Abbott's  felon-in-possession  charge-- 

20  ABBOTT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
involving the same firearm that triggered $ 924(c).4  Conced-ing  that  this  reading  is  "not  commanded  by  the  [statute's] 

plain  language,"  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  24,  Abbott  asserts  that  it advances  $ 924(c)'s  goal--to  discourage  bearing  arms  in  fur-
therance  of  crime--while  avoiding  the  imposition  of  "two consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for the single use 
of a single firearm," Abbott Brief 47 (emphasis omitted). The  three  interpretations  just  described  share  a  common 
premise.  In  adding  the  "except"  clause  in  1998,  all  three posit,  Congress  adopted  a  less  aggressive  mode  of  applying 

$ 924(c),  one  that  significantly  reduced  the  severity  of  the provision's impact on defendants.  Like the courts below, we 
regard this premise as implausible.  As earlier observed, see supra, at 15-16, the pre-1998 version of $ 924(c) prescribed a 
discrete  sentence--punishment  to  be  imposed  regardless  of the sentence received for the predicate crime or any separate 
firearm  conviction.  Abbott  and  Gould  think  the  "except" clause  installed,  instead,  a  modest  scheme  designed  simply 
to ensure that all $ 924(c) offenders "serve at least 5 years in prison."  Gould Brief 5; see Abbott Brief 10.  We doubt that 
Congress  meant  a  prefatory  clause,  added  in  a  bill  dubbed "An Act [t]o throttle criminal use of guns," to effect a depar-
ture  so  great  from  $ 924(c)'s  longstanding  thrust,  i. e.,  its  in-sistence  that  sentencing  judges  impose 

additional  punish-ment for $ 924(c) violations. 

Were we to accept any of the readings proposed by Abbott or  Gould,  it  bears  emphasis,  we  would  undercut  that  same 
bill's  primary  objective:  to  expand  $ 924(c)'s  coverage  to reach  firearm  possession.  In  1999,  more  than  half  of  those 
who  violated  $ 924(c)  in  connection  with  a  drug-trafficking offense received a mandatory minimum of ten years or more 
for  that  trafficking  offense.  Letter  from  Glenn  R.  Schmitt, United States Sentencing Commission, to Supreme Court Li-
brary (Nov. 10, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court's case file). 

4 Because  Gould's  only  firearm-related  offense  is  his  $ 924(c)  offense, 
Gould's sentence would stand under Abbott's alternative construction. 

21 Cite as: 562 U. S. 8 (2010) 
Opinion of the Court 
Congress,  however,  imposed  only  a  five-year  minimum  for firearm  possession  "in  furtherance  of "  a  drug  offense.  As 

construed  by  Abbott  and  Gould,  the  amendment  to  include firearm possession as a $ 924(c) offense would spare the most 
serious drug offenders from any discrete punishment for the very firearm activity the amendment targeted.  "We are dis-
inclined  to  say  that  what  Congress  imposed  with  one  hand 
. . . it withdrew  with  the  other . . . ."   Logan  v.  United 
States, 552 U. S. 23, 35 (2007). 

Abbott's  and  Gould's  proposed  readings,  moreover,  would result  in  sentencing  anomalies  Congress  surely  did  not  in-

tend.  We note  first that  $ 924(c),  as they  construe it, would 
often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that provision 
makes independently criminal.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.  For ex-
ample, an individual who sold enough drugs to receive a tenyear  minimum  sentence  under  $ 841(b)(1)(A)  could,  so  far  as 

$ 924(c) is concerned, possess or even brandish a gun without 
incurring any additional punishment. 

Stranger  still,  under  the  Abbott  and  Gould  readings,  the 
worst  offenders  would  often  secure  the  shortest  sentences. 
Consider  two  defendants  convicted  of  trafficking  in  cocaine. 
The first possesses 500 grams and is subject to a mandatory 
minimum  of  five  years,  $ 841(b)(1)(B);  the  second  possesses 
five kilograms and is subject to a mandatory minimum of ten 
years,  $ 841(b)(1)(A).  Both  brandish  firearms,  calling  for  a 
sentence  of  seven  years  under  $ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).  The  first 
defendant,  under  all  readings,  will  spend  at  least  12  years 
in  prison.  The  second  defendant's  ten-year  drug  minimum, 
according to  Abbott and Gould, triggers  the  "except" clause 
and  wipes  out  that  defendant's  $ 924(c)  penalty;  though  the 
more  culpable  of  the  two,  the  second  defendant's  minimum 
term  would  be  just  ten  years.  Brief  for  United  States  40. 
Like  the  Third  Circuit  below,  "[w]e  are  confident  that  Con-
gress did not intend such a bizarre result."  574 F. 3d, at 209. 

Abbott's alternative construction, which homes in on other 
firearm  offenses,  gives  rise  to  similar  oddities.  On  this 

22  ABBOTT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
reading,  Abbott's  15-year  ACCA  sentence  for  being  a  felon in  possession  would  preempt  his  five-year  $ 924(c)  sentence, 

and  his  minimum  term  would  be  15  years,  rather  than  20.5 But  if  ACCA  were  not  at  issue,  Abbott's  minimum  term 
would be the same 15 years: his five-year $ 924(c) sentence on 
top  of his  ten-year drug sentence.  Qualification as a career 
criminal would carry no consequence. 

Nor  does  Abbott's  second  construction  necessarily  pro-
mote  more  equitable  outcomes.  Suppose,  for  example,  that 
a  career  criminal  sold  drugs  together  with  a  first-time  of-
fender,  and  both  brandished  firearms  in  the  process.  The 
first-time  offender,  lacking  a  felon-in-possession  conviction, 
would  serve  a  seven-year  $ 924(c)  sentence  on  top  of  a  tenyear  drug  sentence,  for  a  total  of  17  years.  But  the  career 
criminal's  ACCA  sentence  would  preempt  the  $ 924(c)  sen-
tence; he would serve only 15 years. 

Abbott  and  Gould  respond  that  sentencing  judges  may 
take account of such anomalies and order appropriate adjust-
ments.  We observe first that no correction or avoidance ap-
pears  possible  for  the  anomaly  that,  while  $ 924(c)  "defines 
a  standalone  crime,"  a  $ 924(c)  sentence  would  be  wiped  out 
by  a  wholly  separate  and  independent  conviction.  United 
States v.  Easter, 553 F. 3d 519, 526 (CA7 2009) (per curiam) 
("A  determination  of  guilt  that  yields  no  sentence  is  not  a 
judgment of conviction at all.").  We do, however, agree that 
a  judge  exercising  discretion  under  18  U. S. C.  $ 3553(a) 
"would  [not]  be  required  to  sentence"  a  more  culpable  de-
fendant  to  a  lesser  term;  the  judge  could  increase  that  de-
fendant's  sentence  for  a  predicate  crime  to  make  up  for 

$ 924(c)'s failure to effect any enlargement of the time served. 
United States v. Whitley, 529 F. 3d 150, 155 (CA2 2008).  But 
we  doubt  Congress  had  such  a  cure  in  mind  in  1998,  seven 
years  before  we  held,  in  United  States  v.  Booker,  543  U. S. 

5 ACCA sentences may run concurrently with drug sentences.

Opinion of the Court 
220 (2005), that district courts have discretion to depart from 
the Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of $ 3553(a). 

Abbott  and  Gould  alternatively  contend  that  Congress 
could  have  anticipated  that  the  then-mandatory  Guidelines 
would  resolve  disparities.  See  Abbott  Brief  32-35;  Gould 
Brief 30-32.  On this view, the "except" clause ensures that 
a $ 924(c) offender incurs a minimum sentence of considerable 
length; the Guidelines would then control, elevating that sen-
tence based on firearm possession or use.  See United States 
Sentencing  Commission,  Guidelines  Manual  $$ 2D1.1(b)(1), 
2K2.1(b)(5)  (Nov.  1998)  (increasing  offense  level  for  defend-
ants  who  use  or  possess  firearms  in  course  of  violent  crime 
or  drug  trafficking);  $$ 2D1.1(b)(1),  2K2.1(b)(6)  (Nov.  2009) 
(same). 

We  do  not  gainsay  that  Abbott  and  Gould  project  a  ra-
tional, less harsh, mode of sentencing.  But we do not think 
it was  the  mode Congress ordered.  Congress  expressly  re-
jected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it amended $ 924(c) 
in the same law that created the Sentencing Commission and 
the  Guidelines.  $ 1005,  98  Stat.  2138.  Four  years  earlier, 
in  Busic  v.  United  States,  446  U. S.  398,  404  (1980),  we  had 
read $ 924(c) to impose  no penalty when the  predicate  crime 
itself  prescribed  a  firearm  enhancement;  similarly,  Abbott 
and  Gould  now  read  $ 924(c)  to  impose  no  penalty  when  the 
Guidelines prescribe a firearm enhancement to the predicate 
sentence.  The  1984  legislation  "repudiated"  Busic,  clarify-
ing  that  $ 924(c)  applied  even  when  the  predicate  crime  al-
ready "provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by 
the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device."  United 
States  v.  Gonzales,  520  U. S.  1,  10  (1997)  (internal  quotation 
marks omitted). 

Between  1984  and  1998,  Congress  expanded  the  reach  or 
increased  the  severity  of  $ 924(c)  on  four  occasions,  never 
suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement might suf-

fice  to  accomplish  $ 924(c)'s  objective.6  Nor  is  there  the slightest  indication  that  Congress  was  contemplating  the 

Guidelines'  relationship  to  $ 924(c)  when  it  added  the  "ex-cept" clause in the 1998 amendments.

7 

The  "except"  clause,  we  note,  would  have  been  a  most haphazard  way  to  achieve  a  Guidelines-driven  rollback  of 

$ 924(c).  If  Congress  wanted  to  ensure  that  $ 924(c)  offend-ers "receive at least five years in prison," and to rely on the 
Guidelines  for  the  rest,  Abbott  Brief  10,  there  was  an  obvi-ous  solution:  Congress  could  have  excised  all  prescriptions 
ordering  that  $ 924(c)  sentences  shall  run  consecutively  to other  sentences.  Without  such  a  requirement, 

all  defend-ants  would  benefit  from  a  minimum-plus-Guidelines  re-

gime--not  just  the  most  culpable  offenders.  Congress  did not adopt that obvious solution, we think, because it did not 
want the Guidelines to supplant $ 924(c). 

C 
The  Government's  reading  of  the  "except"  clause,  we  are convinced,  makes  far  more  sense  than  the  interpretations 

urged  by  Abbott  and  Gould.  In  imposing  a  sentence  for  a $ 924(c) violation "[e]xcept to the extent that a greater mini-

creasing  sentences  for  certain  firearms  and  adding  drug  trafficking  as  a 
predicate  felony);  Anti-Drug  Abuse  Act  of  1988,  $ 6460,  102  Stat.  4373- 
4374  (increasing  sentences);  Crime  Control  Act  of  1990,  $ 1101,  104  Stat. 
4829 (same); Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, 
1994, Pub. L. 103-322, $ 110102(c), 108 Stat. 1998 (same). 

7 For those who take legislative history into account, it is as silent as is 

the  statute's  text.  The  sole  reference  to  the  "except"  clause  appears  in 
the statement of one witness at a Senate hearing.  See Hearing on S. 191 
before  the  Senate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary,  105th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  38 
(1997)  (statement  of  Thomas  G.  Hungar)  ("[B]y  adding  an  introductory 
clause  authorizing  imposition  of  stiffer  minimum  sentences  if  required 
under other provisions of law, S. 191 eliminates any potential inconsistency 
with other statutes.").

Opinion of the Court 
mum sentence is otherwise provided . . . by any other provi-sion of law," Congress meant: 

"[I]f  another  provision  of  the  United  States  Code  man-dates  a  punishment  for  using,  carrying,  or  possessing  a 
firearm  in  connection  with  a  drug  trafficking  crime  or crime  of  violence,  and  that  minimum  sentence  is  longer 
than  the  punishment  applicable  under  Section  924(c), then  the  longer  sentence  applies."  Brief  for  United 
States 17. 
This  reading  gives  effect  to  the  statutory  language  com-
manding  that  all  $ 924(c)  offenders  shall  receive  additional punishment  for  their  violation  of  that  provision,  a  com-

mand  reiterated  three  times.  First,  the  statute  states  that the  punishment  specified  in  $ 924(c)(1)  "shall"  be  imposed 
"in  additi on  to"  the  penalty  for  the  predicate  offense. $ 924(c)(1)(A).  Second,  after 

Busic,  $ 924(c)  demands  a  dis-
crete punishment even if the predicate crime itself "provides 
for  an  enhanced  punishment  if  committed  by  the  use  of a  deadly  or  dangerous  weapon  or  device."  $ 924(c)(1)(A). 

Third, $ 924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that a $ 924(c) 
sentence might "run concurrently with any other term of im-
prisonment."  We doubt that Congress, having retained this 
thrice-repeated instruction, would simultaneously provide an 
exception  severely  limiting  application  of  the  instruction. 
Cf. Greenlaw v.  United States, 554 U. S. 237, 251 (2008) ("We 
resist  attributing  to  Congress  an  intention  to  render  a  stat-
ute so internally inconsistent."). 

Interpreting  the  "except"  clause  to  train  on  conduct  of-
fending $ 924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.  The 
"except"  clause  is  not  a  standalone  enactment,  or  even 
standalone sentence.  Rather,  it  precedes and qualifies 

$ 924(c)(1)(A)'s  principal  clause,  which  punishes  the  posses-
sion  of  a  firearm  in  connection  with  specified  predicate 
crimes.  The  "grammatical  and  logical  scope"  of  a  proviso, 

26  ABBOTT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
we have held, "is confined to the subject-matter of the princi-
pal  clause"  to  which  it  is  attached.  United  States  v.  Mor-
row, 266 U. S. 531, 534-535 (1925).  As a proviso attached to 

$ 924(c),  the  "except"  clause  is  most  naturally  read  to  refer 
to  the  conduct  $ 924(c)  proscribes.  Accord  United  States  v. 
Villa, 589 F. 3d 1334, 1343 (CA10 2009). 

There is strong contextual support for our view that Con-
gress intended the "except" clause to serve simply as a clari-
fication  of  $ 924(c),  not  as  a  major  restraint  on  the  statute's 
operation.  At  the  same  time  Congress  added  the  "except" 
clause,  it made the  rest of $ 924(c)  more complex.  The 1998 
revision  divided  the  statute's  existing  sentencing  prescrip-
tions  into  four  paragraphs  in  lieu  of  one,  and  added  new 
penalties  for  brandishing  and  discharg ing  a  firearm. 

$ 924(c)(1)(A)-(D).  We  know  that  Congress  thought  the  re-
structuring  might  confuse  sentencing  judges:  Warding  off 
confusion,  all  agree,  was  the  Legislature's  sole  objective  in 
adding  the  initial  part  of  the  "except"  clause,  which  covers 
greater minimums provided "by this subsection."  That por-
tion of the clause instructs judges to pick the  single  highest 
sentence  stipulated  for  a  $ 924(c)  violation  within  $ 924(c)  it-
self, and not to stack ten  years for discharging a gun on top 
of  seven  for  brandishing  the  same  weapon,  whenever  a  de-
fendant does both. 

In  referencing  greater  minimums  provided  by  "any  other 
provision  of  law,"  we  think,  the  second  portion  of  the  "ex-
cept"  clause  simply  furnishes  the  same  no-stacking  instruc-
tion  for  cases  in  which  $ 924(c)  and  a  different  statute  both 
punish  conduct  offending  $ 924(c).  Congress  likely  antici-
pated  such  cases  when  the  "except"  clause  was  framed  in 
1998,  for  the  bill  that  reformulated  the  text  of  $ 924(c)  did 
just  one  thing  more:  It  amended  18  U. S. C.  $ 3559(c)  to 
command  a  life  sentence  when  certain  repeat  felons  are 
convicted  of  "firearms  possession  (as  described  in  section 
924(c))."  $ 1(b), 112 Stat. 3470. 

Cite as: 562 U. S. 8 (2010)  27 

Opinion of the Court 
Our interpretation, Abbott and Gould protest, renders the second  part  of  the  "except"  clause  effectively  meaningless. 

Section 3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of $ 924(c) itself,  the  Government  places  within  the  "except"  clause. 
Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  32-35,  42-44.8  But  $ 3559(c)  already  im-poses a life sentence.  A defendant would find little comfort 
in knowing that no $ 924(c) sentence, say five years or seven, will be tacked on to his $ 3559(c) life term. 

As  Courts  of  Appeals  have  observed,  however,  the  "any other provision of law" portion of the "except" clause installs 
a  "safety  valve."  United  States  v.  Studifin,  240  F.  3d  415, 423  (CA4  2001).  It  "allow[s]  for  additional  $ 924(c)  sen-
tences,"  akin  to  the  sentence  prescribed  in  $ 3559(c),  that Congress  may  codify  outside  $ 924(c)  "in  the  future."  574 
F. 3d, at 208.  We do not regard this allowance as "implausi-ble."  See Abbott Brief 22; Gould Brief 21.  As the Govern-
ment  points  out,  "there  is  nothing  unusual  about  Congress prescribing  mandatory  minimum  penalties  for  substantive 
offenses  codified  in  other  provisions."  Brief  for  United States 22.  See, e. g., $ 3559(c) (prescribing penalties for vio-
lations  of,  inter  alia,  49  U. S. C.  $ 46502  and  18  U. S. C. $$ 1111, 2111, 2113, and 2118); $ 3559(d) (prescribing penalties 
for  violations  of,  inter  alia,  18  U. S. C.  $$ 2422,  2423,  and 2251);  18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)  (prescribing  penalty  for  violation 
of  $ 922(g)).  See  also  18  U. S. C.  $ 924( j)(1)  (prescribing  a nonmandatory  penalty  of  death  for  individuals  who  commit 
murder with a firearm in the course of a $ 924(c) offense). Our  decisions  in 

Gonzales  and  Republic  of  Iraq  v.  Beaty, 556  U. S.  848  (2009),  do  not  warrant  a  different  conclusion. 

We  observed  in  Gonzales  that  "the  word  `any'  [ordinarily] has  an  expansive  meaning."  520  U. S.,  at  5  (holding  that

plicit[ly]  reference"  $ 924(c),  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  27;  a  statute  will fit the bill

all the elements of a $ 924(c) offense. 

28  ABBOTT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
"any other term of imprisonment" includes terms imposed by state  courts  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  See  also 

Beaty, 556 U. S., at 856 (the word "any" in "any other provi-sion of law"  was "no  warrant  to limit  the  class  of provisions 
of  law").  But  our  decision  on  the  petitions  of  Abbott  and Gould  does  not  turn  on  artificial  confinement  of  the  phrase 
"any other provision of law."  We rely, instead, on the differ-ent direction Congress prescribed for the "except" clause: It 
applies only when "a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided."  "In  the  contest  between  reading"  that  phrase 
"to refer  to penalties for the  [$ 924(c)] offense in question or to penalties for any [other] offense [a defendant commits], we 
believe  the  former  is  the  most  natural."  Easter,  553  F.  3d, at 526.

30  LOS  ANGELES  COUNTY  v.  HUMPHRIES 

Opinion of the Court 
bility on municipalities, but because it would have imposed such liability 
solely based on the acts of others.  The Court, on the basis of the statu-
tory  text  and  the  legislative  history,  went  on  to  explain  what  acts  are 
the  municipality's  own  for  purposes  of  liability.  The  Court  held  that 
"a municipality cannot be held liable" solely for the acts of others, e. g., 
"solely because it employs a tortfeasor," 436 U. S., at 691, but it may be 
held  liable  "when  execution  of  a  government's  policy  or  custom  .  .  .  in-
flicts the injury," id., at 694.  Pp. 34-36. 

(b)  Section 1983, read in light of Monell's understanding of the legis-
lative history, explains why claims for prospective relief, like claims for 
money damages, fall within the scope of the "policy or custom" require-
ment.  Nothing  in  $ 1983  suggests  that  the  causation  requirement 
should change with the form of relief sought.  In fact, the text suggests 
the opposite when it provides that a person who meets $ 1983's elements 
"shall  be  liable  .  .  .  in  an  action  at  law,  suit  in  equity,  or  other  proper 
proceeding for redress."  Thus, as Monell explicitly stated, "[l]ocal gov-
erning bodies . . . can be sued directly under $ 1983 for monetary, declar-
atory, or injunctive relief where, as here, the action that is alleged to be 
unconstitutional implements or executes" a policy or custom.  436 U. S., 
at 690.  To find the "policy or custom" requirement inapplicable in pro-
spective relief cases would also undermine Monell's logic.  For whether 
an action or omission is a municipality's "own" has to do with the nature 
of the  action or  omission,  not with  the nature  of the relief that is  later 
sought in court.  Pp. 36-37. 

(c)  Respondents'  arguments  to  the  contrary  are  unconvincing.

Opinion of the Court 
suing  a  municipal  entity  under  42  U. S. C.  $ 1983  must  show that their injury was caused by a municipal policy or custom. 

The case before the Court in Monell directly involved mone-tary damages.  The question presented is whether the "pol-
icy or custom" requirement also applies when plaintiffs seek prospective  relief,  such  as  an  injunction  or  a  declaratory 
judgment.  We conclude that it does so apply. 

I 
The  case  arises  out  of  the  following  circumstances:  The California  Child  Abuse  and  Neglect  Reporting  Act,  Cal. 

Penal  Code  Ann.  $ 11164  et  seq.  (West  Rev.  Supp.  2010),  re-quires  law  enforcement  and  other  state  agencies  to  investi-
gate allegations of child abuse.  These agencies must report to  the  California  Department  of  Justice  all  instances  of  re-
ported  child  abuse  the  agency  finds  "not  unfounded,"  even if  they  are  "inconclusive  or  unsubstantiated."  $$ 11169(a), 
11170(a)(3).  The statute requires the department to include all  these  reports  in  a  Child  Abuse  Central  Index  (Index), 
where they remain available to various state agencies for at least 10 years.  $ 11170(a).  The statute also says that if 

"a  report  has  previously  been  filed  which  subsequently proves to be unfounded, the Department of Justice shall 
be  notified  in  writing  of  that  fact  and  shall  not  retain the report."  $ 11169(a). 

The  statute,  however,  does  not  set  forth  procedures  for  re-viewing  whether  a  previously  filed  report  is  unfounded,  or 
for  allowing  individuals  to  challenge  their  inclusion  in  the Index.  Nor, up until the time of this lawsuit, had California 
or  Los  Angeles  County  created  any  such  procedures.  But cf. $ 11170(a)(2) ("The submitting agencies are responsible for 
the  accuracy,  completeness,  and  retention  of  the  reports  de-scribed in this section"). 

The  two  plaintiffs  in  this  case  were  initially  accused  of child abuse.  But they were later exonerated.  They sought 
to  have  their  names  removed  from  the  Index.  Unable  to 

32  LOS  ANGELES  COUNTY  v.  HUMPHRIES 

Opinion of the Court 
convince  the  Los  Angeles  Sheriff 's  Department  to  remove them, they filed this $ 1983 case against the attorney general 

of California, the Los Angeles County sheriff, two detectives in  the  sheriff 's  department, and  the  County of Los Angeles. 
They  sought  damages,  an  injunction,  and  a  declaration  that the  defendants  had  deprived  them  of  their  constitutional 
rights  by  failing  to  create  a  procedural  mechanism  through 
which  one  could  contest  inclusion  on  the  Index.  See  U.  S. Const.,  Amdt.  14;  Rev.  Stat.  $ 1979,  42  U. S. C.  $ 1983.  The 

District Court for the Central District of California granted summary  judgment  to  all  of  the  defendants  on  the  ground 
that  California  had  not  deprived  the  plaintiffs  of  a  constitu-
tionally  protected  "liberty"  interest.  But  on  appeal  the 
Ninth Circuit disagreed. 

The  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  the  Fourteenth  Amendment 
required the State to provide those included on the list notice 
and  " `some  kind  of  hearing.' "  554  F.  3d  1170,  1201  (2009). 
Thus the  Circuit held that the  plaintiffs were entitled  to de-
claratory relief,  and  it  believed that (on  remand) they  might 
prove damages as well.  Ibid. 

The  Ninth  Circuit  also  held  that  the  plaintiffs  were  pre-
vailing parties, thereby entitled to approximately $600,000 in 
attorney's fees.  42 U. S. C. $ 1988(b) (providing for payment 
of  attorney's  fees  to  parties  prevailing  on  $ 1983  claims). 
See  No.  05-56467 (June  22,  2009),  App.  to Pet.  for  Cert.  1-4 
(hereinafter  First  Fee  Order);  No.  05-56467  (Dec.  2,  2009), 
App. to Reply to Brief in Opposition 1-2 (hereinafter Second 
Fee  Order).  The  Ninth  Circuit  wrote  that  Los  Angeles 
County  must  pay  approximately  $60,000  of  this  amount. 
First Fee Order 3; Second Fee Order 2. 

Los Angeles County denied that it was liable and therefore 
that  it  could  be  held  responsible  for  attorney's  fees.  It  ar-
gued  that,  in  respect  to  the  county,  the  plaintiffs  were  not 
prevailing parties.  That is because the county is a municipal 
entity.  Under  Monell's  holding  a  municipal  entity  is  liable 
under $ 1983 only if a municipal "policy or custom" caused a

Opinion of the Court 
plaintiff  to  be  deprived  of  a  federal  right.  436  U. S.,  at  694 (emphasis added).  And it was 

state policy, not county policy, 
that brought about any deprivation here. The  Ninth  Circuit  responded  to  this  argument  as  follows: 

First, it said that county policy might be responsible for the deprivation.  It  "is  possible,"  the  Ninth  Circuit  said,  that 
the  county,  "[b]y  failing  to"  "creat[e]  an  independent  proce-
dure that would allow" the plaintiffs "to challenge their list-ing[,] . . .  adopted  a  custom  and  policy  that  violated"  the 

plaintiffs'  "constitutional  rights."  554  F.  3d,  at  1202.  Sec-ond, it said that "because this issue is not clear based on the 
record  before  us  on  appeal . . . we  remand  to  the  district 
court  to  determine  the  County's  liability  under  Monell." 
Ibid.  Third,  it  saw  no  reason  to  remand  in  respect  to  the 
county's  obligation  to  pay  $60,000  in  attorney's  fees.  That, 
it  wrote,  is  because  "in  our  circuit  . . .  the  limitations  to 
liability  established  in  Monell  do  not  apply  to  claims  for 
prospective  relief,"  such  as  the  declaratory  judgment  that 
the  Circuit  had  ordered  entered.  First  Fee  Order  3-4  (cit-
ing Chaloux v.  Killeen, 886 F. 2d 247, 250 (CA9 1989); Truth 
v.  Kent  School  Dist.,  542  F.  3d  634,  644  (CA9  2008);  empha-
sis added). 

The  county  then  asked  us  to  review  this  last-mentioned 
Ninth  Circuit  holding,  namely,  the  holding  that  Monell's 
"policy  or  custom"  requirement  applies  only  to  claims  for 
damages  but  not  to  claims  for  prospective  relief.  Because 
the  Courts  of  Appeals  are  divided  on  this  question,  we 
granted the county's petition for certiorari.  Compare Reyn-
olds v.  Giuliani, 506 F. 3d 183, 191 (CA2 2007) (holding that 
Monell's "policy or custom" requirement applies to claims for 
prospective relief as well as claims for damages); Dirrane v. 
Brookline  Police  Dept.,  315  F.  3d  65,  71  (CA1  2002)  (same);

Greensboro,  64  F. 3d  962,  967,  n.  6  (CA4  1995)  (applying  the 
Monell  requirement  to  a  prospective  relief  claim);  Church 
v.  Huntsville,  30  F.  3d  1332,  1347  (CA11  1994)  (same),  with 

34  LOS  ANGELES  COUNTY  v.  HUMPHRIES 

Opinion of the Court 
Chaloux,  supra,  at  251  (holding  that  Monell  does  not  apply to prospective relief claims).  See also Gernetzke v.  Kenosha 

Unified  School  Dist.  No.  1,  274  F.  3d  464,  468  (CA7  2001) (reserving  the  question  but  noting  the  "predominant"  view 
that "Monell's holding applies regardless of the nature of the relief sought"). 

We conclude that Monell's holding applies to $ 1983 claims against  municipalities  for  prospective  relief  as  well  as  to 
claims for damages.  II 

A 
We begin with $ 1983 itself, which provides: 

"Every person who, under color of any [state] statute, ordinance,  regulation,  custom,  or  usage  .  .  .  subjects,  or 

causes  to  be  subjected,  any  .  .  .  other  person . . .  to  the  deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Constitution 
and  laws  [of  the  United  States],  shall  be  liable  to  the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other 
proper proceeding for redress."  (Emphasis added.) 
In  1961,  in  Monroe  v.  Pape,  365  U. S.  167,  this  Court  held that  municipal  entities  were  not  "person[s]"  under  $ 1983. 

The  Court  based  this  conclusion  on  the  history  of  the  Civil Rights Act of 1871's enactment.  It noted that Congress re-
jected  an  amendment  (called  the  Sherman  amendment)  that would  have  made  municipalities  liable  for  damage  done  by 
private  persons  " `riotously  and  tumultuously  assembled.' " 
Id.,  at  188-190,  and  n.  38  (quoting  Cong.  Globe,  42d  Cong., 1st Sess., 663 (1871)).  This rejection, the Court thought, re-

flected  a  determination  by  the  1871  House  of  Representa-tives that " `Congress had no constitutional power to impose 
any  obligation  upon  county  and  town  organizations,  the mere  instrumentality  for  the  administration  of  state  law.' " 
365  U. S.,  at  190  (quoting  Cong.  Globe,  supra,  at  804  (state-ment  of  Rep.  Poland);  emphasis  added).  The  Court  con-
cluded  that  Congress  must  have  doubted  its  "constitutional

Opinion of the Court 
power  .  .  .  to  impose  civil  liability  on  municipalities."  365 U. S.,  at  190.  And  for  that  reason,  Congress  must  have  in-

tended  to  exclude  municipal  corporations  as  $ 1983  defend-ants.  The  statute's  key  term  "person"  therefore  did  not 
cover municipal entities.  Id., at 191. Sixteen years later, in 

Monell, the Court reconsidered the 
question  of  municipal  liability.  After  reexamining  the  1871 
legislative  history  in  detail,  the  Court  concluded  that  Con-gress  had  rejected  the  Sherman  amendment,  not  because  it 

would  have  imposed  liability  upon  municipalities,  but  be-cause  it  would  have  imposed  liability  upon  municipalities 
based  purely  upon  the  acts  of  others.  That  is  to  say,  the 
rejected amendment would have imposed liability upon local 
governments "without regard to whether a local government 
was in any way at fault for the breach of the peace for which 
it  was  to  be  held  for  damages."  436  U. S.,  at  681,  n.  40 
(emphasis  added).  In  Monell's  view  Congress  may  have 
thought that it lacked the power to impose that kind of indi-
rect  liability  upon  municipalities,  id.,  at  679,  but  "nothing 
said  in  debate  on  the  Sherman  amendment  would  have  pre-
vented holding a municipality liable . . . for  its own violations 

of the Fourteenth Amendment," id., at 683 (emphasis added). 
The Court, overruling Monroe, held that municipalities were 
"persons" under $ 1983.  436 U. S., at 690. 

The Court also concluded that a municipality could not be 
held  liable  under  $ 1983  solely  because  it  employed  a  tort-
feasor.  The  Court's  conclusion  rested  on  "the  language  of 

$ 1983,  read  against  the  background  of  the  same  legislative 
history."  Id., at 691.  Section 1983's causation language im-

poses  liability  on  a  " `person  who  .  .  .  shall  subject,  or  cause 
to  be  subjected,  any  person' "  to  a  deprivation  of  federal 
rights.  Ibid. (quoting 17 Stat. 13; emphasis deleted).  That 
language,  the  Court  observed,  could  not  "be  easily  read  to 
impose  liability  vicariously  .  .  .  solely  on  the  basis  of  the 
existence  of  an  employer-employee  relationship  with  a  tort-
feasor."  436 U. S., at 692.  The statute's legislative history, 

36  LOS  ANGELES  COUNTY  v.  HUMPHRIES 

Opinion of the Court 
in  particular  the  constitutional  objections  that  had  been raised  to  the  Sherman  amendment,  supported  this  conclu-

sion.  Id., at 692-694, and n. 57. For these reasons, the Court concluded that a municipality 
could  be  held  liable  under  $ 1983  only  for  its  own  violations of federal law. 

Id., at 694.  The Court described what made a violation a municipality's own violation: 

"Local governing bodies, therefore, can be sued directly under $ 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive re-
lief  where,  as  here,  the  action  that  is  alleged  to  be  un-constitutional  implements  or  executes  a  policy  state-
ment,  ordinance,  regulation,  or  decision  officially adopted  and  promulgated  by  that  body's  officers.  .  .  . 
[They can also be sued for] deprivations visited pursuant to governmental `custom' even though such a custom has 
not  received  formal  approval  through  the  body's  offi-cial  decisionmaking  channels." 

Id.,  at  690-691  (foot-note omitted). 

The Court has also included the terms "usage" and "practice" as customs for which liability is appropriate.  See 

ibid.  The length  of  this  list  of  types  of  municipal  action  leads  us  here 

to use a shorthand term "policy or custom," but when we do so, we mean to refer to the entire list.  See 

id., at 694 (using the  shorthand  "policy  or  custom");  see  also,  e. g.,  Fitzgerald 

v.  Barnstable  School  Comm.,  555  U. S.  246,  257-258  (2009) (using  the  phrase  "custom,  policy,  or  practice,"  to  describe 
municipal liability under $ 1983). In sum, in Monell the Court held that "a municipality can-
not  be  held  liable"  solely  for  the  acts  of  others,  e. g.,  "solely because it employs a tortfeasor."  436 U. S., at 691.  But the 
municipality may be held liable "when execution of a govern-ment's 

policy or  custom . .  .  inflicts the injury."  Id.,  at 694 (emphasis added). 

B 
The  language  of  $ 1983  read  in  light  of  Monell's  under-standing  of  the  legislative  history  explains  why  claims  for 

37 Cite as: 562 U. S. 29 (2010) 
Opinion of the Court 
prospective relief, like claims for money damages, fall within the  scope  of  the  "policy  or  custom"  requirement.  Nothing 

in the text of $ 1983 suggests that the causation requirement contained in the statute should change with the form of relief 
sought.  In fact, the text suggests the opposite when it pro-vides  that  a  person  who  meets  $ 1983's  elements  "shall  be 
liable  .  .  .  in  an  action  at  law,  suit  in  equity,  or  other  proper proceeding  for  redress."  Thus,  as 

Monell  explicitly  stated, "[l]ocal  governing  bodies  .  .  .  can  be  sued  directly  under 

$ 1983 for monetary, declaratory, or injunctive relief where, as  here, the  action  that  is  alleged  to  be  unconstitutional  im-
plements  or  executes"  a  policy  or  custom.  436  U. S.,  at  690 (emphasis  added). 

Monell  went  on  to  quote  this  Court's statement  in  a  1973  case,  Kenosha  v.  Bruno,  412  U. S.  507, 

513,  to  the  effect  that  the  Congress  that  enacted  $ 1983  did not  intend  the  " `generic  word  "person" . . .  to have  a  bifur-
cated  application  to  municipal  corporations  depending  on the nature of the relief sought against them.' "  436 U. S., at 
701,  n.  66  (emphasis  added).  Monell  added  that  "[n]othing we  say  today  affects"  this  pre-Monell  "conclusion."  Ibid. 

Monell's  logic  also  argues  against  any  such  relief-based bifurcation.  The 

Monell  Court  thought  that  Congress  in-tended  potential  $ 1983  liability  where  a  municipality's  own 

violations were at issue but not where only the violations of others  were  at  issue.  The  "policy  or  custom"  requirement 
rests  upon  that  distinction  and  embodies  it  in  law.  To  find the  requirement  inapplicable  where  prospective  relief  is  at 
issue  would  undermine  Monell's  logic.  For  whether  an  ac-tion or omission is a municipality's "own" has to do with the 
nature  of  the  action  or  omission,  not  with  the  nature  of  the relief that is later sought in court. 

C 
The Humphrieses' (hereinafter respondents) arguments to the  contrary are unconvincing.  Respondents  correctly  note 

that  by  the  time  Monell  reached  the  Supreme  Court  only the plaintiffs' damages claim remained live.  See 

id., at 661. 

38  LOS  ANGELES  COUNTY  v.  HUMPHRIES 

Opinion of the Court 
From this fact they conclude that the Court's holding applies directly  only  to  claims  for  monetary  damages.  A  holding, 

however,  can  extend  through  its  logic  beyond  the  specific facts of the particular case.  It does so here. 

Respondents  add that  not  only  did  Monell  involve a  dam-ages claim, but its holding rests upon the concern that munic-
ipalities  might  have  to  pay  large  damages  awards.  The 
Court  so  suggests  when  it  points  out  that  municipalities should  not  be  liable  for  an  employee's  wrongful  acts,  simply 

by applying agency-based principles of respondeat superior. But as we have pointed out, the Court's rejection of 

respon-
deat superior liability primarily rested not on the municipal-
ity's  economic  needs,  but  on  the  fact  that  liability  in  such  a 
case  does  not  arise  out  of  the  municipality's  own  wrongful 
conduct. 

Respondents  further  claim  that,  where  prospective  relief 
is  at  issue,  Monell  is  redundant.  They  say  that  a  court 
cannot grant prospective relief against a municipality unless 
the  municipality's  own  conduct  has  caused  the  violation. 
Hence,  where  such  relief  is  otherwise  proper,  the  Monell 
requirement  "shouldn't  screen  out  any  case."  Tr.  of  Oral 
Arg. 48. 

To  argue  that  a  requirement  is  necessarily  satisfied,  how-
ever,  is  not  to  argue  that  its  satisfaction  is  unnecessary.  If 
respondents are right, our holding may have limited practical 
significance.  But that possibility does not provide us with a 
convincing reason to sow confusion by adopting a bifurcated 
relief-based  approach  to  municipal  liability  that  the  Court 
has previously rejected. 

Finally,  respondents  make  the  mirror-image  argument 
that  applying  Monell's  requirement  to  prospective  relief 
claims will leave some set of ongoing constitutional violations 
beyond  redress.  Despite  the  fact  that  four  Circuits  apply 
Monell's  requirement  to  prospective  relief,  however,  re-
spondents  have  not  presented  us  with  any  actual  or  hypo-
thetical example that provides serious cause for concern.

* * * 
For  these  reasons,  we  hold  that  Monell's  "policy  or  cus-tom"  requirement  applies  in  $ 1983  cases  irrespective  of 

whether  the  relief  sought  is  monetary  or  prospective.  The Ninth  Circuit's  contrary  judgment  is  reversed,  and  the  case 
is  remanded  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

Congress  has,  however,  exempted  certain  categories  of service  and  individuals  from  FICA's  demands.  As  relevant 

here,  Congress  has  excluded  from  taxation  "service  per-formed  in  the  employ  of . . . a  school,  college,  or  university 
. . . if such service is performed by a student who is enrolled and  regularly  attending  classes  at  such  school,  college,  or 
university."  $ 3121(b)(10)  (2006  ed.).  The  Social  Security 
Act, which governs workers' eligibility for benefits, contains a  corresponding  student  exception  materially  identical  to 

$ 3121(b)(10).  42 U. S. C. $ 410(a)(10). Since 1951, the Treasury Department has applied the stu-
dent  exception  to  exempt  from  taxation  students  who  work 
for  their  schools  "as  an  incident  to  and  for  the  purpose  of

from  the  little  that  $ 3121  provides.  In  any  event,  the statutory  text  still  would  offer  no  insight  into  how  Con-
gress  intended  predominance  to  be  determined  or  whether Congress  thought  that  medical  residents  would  satisfy  the 
requirement. To the extent Congress has specifically addressed medical 
residents in $ 3121, moreover, it has expressly excluded these doctors from exemptions they might otherwise invoke.  See 

$$ 3121(b)(6)(B),  (7)(C)(ii)  (excluding  medical  residents  from exemptions  available  to employees  of the  District of Colum-

residents from FICA's reach in the first place. In  sum,  neither  the  plain  text  of  the  statute  nor  the  Dis-
trict  Court's  interpretation  of  the  exemption  "speak[s]  with the precision necessary to say definitively whether [the stat-

ment for loans and leases nationwide; it is not intended to estimate other 
conceivable  expenses  associated  with  maintaining  a  car.  Maintenance 
expenses are the province of the separate "Operating Costs" deduction. 
A  person  who  owns  a  car  free  and  clear  is  entitled  to  the  "Operating 
Costs"  deduction  for  all  driving-related  expenses.  But  such  a  person 
may not claim the "Ownership Costs" deduction, because that allowance 
is  for  the  separate  costs  of  a  car  loan  or  lease.  The  IRS's  Collection 
Financial Standards reinforce this conclusion by making clear that indi-
viduals  who  have  a  car  but  make  no  loan  or  lease  payments  may  take 
only the operating-costs deduction.  Because Ransom owns  his vehicle 
outright,  he incurs  no expense  in  the "Ownership  Costs"  category,  and 
that  expense  amount  is  therefore  not  "applicable"  to  him.  Pp.  71-73. 

(c)  Ransom's  arguments  to  the  contrary--an  alternative  interpreta-
tion of the key word "applicable," an objection to the Court's view of the

Opinion of the Court 
In Chapter 13 proceedings, the means test provides a for-mula  to  calculate  a  debtor's  disposable  income,  which  the 

debtor  must  devote  to  reimbursing  creditors  under  a  court-approved  plan  generally  lasting  from  three  to  five  years. 

$$ 1325(b)(1)(B)  and  (b)(4).1  The  statute  defines  "disposable income"  as  "current  monthly  income"  less  "amounts  reason-
ably  necessary  to  be  expended"  for  "maintenance  or  sup-
port,"  business  expenditures,  and  certain  charitable  contri-butions.  $$ 1325(b)(2)(A)(i)  and  (ii).  For  a  debtor  whose 

income  is  above  the  median  for  his  State,  the  means  test identifies  which  expenses  qualify  as  "amounts  reasonably 
necessary  to  be  expended."  The  test  supplants  the  preBAPCPA  practice  of  calculating  debtors'  reasonable  ex-
penses  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  which  led  to  varying  and 
often  inconsistent  determinations.  See,  e.

Finally,  consideration  of  BAPCPA's  purpose  strengthens our  reading  of  the  term  "applicable."  Congress  designed 

the  means  test  to  measure  debtors'  disposable  income  and, in that way, "to ensure that [they] repay creditors the maxi-
mum  they  can  afford."  H.  R.  Rep.,  at  2.  This  purpose  is best achieved by interpreting the means test, consistent with 
the  statutory  text,  to  reflect  a  debtor's  ability  to  afford  re-payment.  Cf.

Opinion of the Court 
Financial  Standards'  treatment  of  the  car-ownership  deduc-tion  reinforces  our  conclusion  that,  under  the  statute,  a 

debtor seeking to claim this deduction must make some loan or lease payments.

7 

Because  Ransom  owns  his  vehicle  free  and  clear  of  any encumbrance, he incurs no expense in the "Ownership Costs" 

category  of  the  Local  Standards.  Accordingly,  the  car-ownership  expense  amount  is  not  "applicable"  to  him,  and 
the Ninth Circuit correctly denied that deduction. 

III 
Ransom's  argument  to  the  contrary  relies  on  a  different interpretation  of  the  key  word  "applicable,"  an  objection  to 

our view of the scope of the "Ownership Costs" category, and a  criticism  of  the  policy  implications  of  our  approach.  We 
do not think these claims persuasive. 

A 
Ransom first offers another understanding of the term "ap-plicable."  A debtor, he says, determines his "applicable" de-

ductions by locating the box in each National or Local Stand-ard table that corresponds to his geographic location, income, 
family  size,  or  number  of  cars.  Under  this  approach,  a debtor "consult[s] the table[s] alone" to determine his appro-
priate  expense  amounts.  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  16. Because he has one car, Ransom argues that his "applicable" 
allowance is the sum listed in the first column of the "Owner-

7 Because the dissent appears to misunderstand our use of the Collection 
Financial Standards, and because it may be important for future cases to 
be  clear  on  this  point,  we  emphasize  again  that  the  statute  does  not 
"incorporat[e]" or otherwise "impor[t]" the IRS's guidance.  Post,

out either referring to IRS guidelines for using the tables or imposing  pre-existing  assumptions  about  how  [they]  are  to

and  whether  it  is  applicable  to  Ransom;  and  so  we  are brought back full circle to our prior analysis. 

B 
Ransom  next  argues  that  viewing  the  car-ownership  de-duction  as  covering  no  more  than  loan  and  lease  payments 

is  inconsistent  with  a  separate  sentence  of  the  means  test that  provides:  "Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this 
clause,  the  monthly expenses  of the  debtor shall  not  include any  payments  for  debts."  $ 707(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).  The  carownership  deduction  cannot  comprise  only

not  a  penny  of  loan  or  lease  costs.  On  Ransom's  view,  for example, a debtor entering bankruptcy might purchase for a 

song a junkyard car--"an old, rusted pile of scrap metal [that would]  si[t]  on  cinder  blocks  in  his  backyard,"

claims in a federal habeas petition.  The District Court denied his peti-
tion.  A  Ninth  Circuit  panel  affirmed,  but  the  en  banc  court  reversed. 
Initially it questioned whether 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)--which, as amended 
by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 
limits the availability of federal habeas relief for claims previously "ad-
judicated  on  the  merits"  in  state  court--applied  to  Richter's  petition, 
since  the  State  Supreme  Court  issued  only  a  summary  denial.  But  it 
found  the  state-court  decision  unreasonable  anyway.  In  its  view,  trial 
counsel was deficient in failing to consult blood evidence experts in plan-
ning  a  trial  strategy  and  in  preparing  to  rebut  expert  evidence  the 
prosecution might--and later did--offer.

standard has a substantial range of reasonable applications.  The ques-
tion  under  $ 2254(d)  is  not  whether  counsel's  actions  were  reasonable, 
but  whether  there  is  any  reasonable  argument  that  counsel  satisfied 
Strickland's deferential standard.  Pp. 104-105. 

(2)  The Ninth Circuit erred in holding that because Richter's at-
torney  had  not  consulted  forensic  blood  experts  or  introduced  expert 
evidence, the State Supreme Court could not reasonably have concluded 
counsel provided adequate representation. 

A  state  court  could  reasonably  conclude  that  a  competent  attorney 
could elect a strategy that did not require using blood evidence experts. 
Rare are the situations in which the latitude counsel enjoys will be lim-
ited to any one technique or approach.  There were any number of ex-
perts whose insight might have been useful to the defense.  Counsel is 
entitled to balance limited resources in accord with effective trial tactics 
and strategies.  In finding otherwise the Ninth Circuit failed to "recon-
struct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct" and "evaluate 
the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time."  Strickland,

room,  unconscious  and  bleeding.  Klein  and  Johnson  each had  been  shot  twice.  Johnson  recovered;  Klein  died  of  his 

wounds. Johnson  gave  investigators  this  account:  After  falling 
asleep, he awoke to find Richter and Branscombe in his bed-room, at  which  point Branscombe  shot  him.  Johnson heard 
more  gunfire  in  the  living  room  and  the  sound  of  his  assail-
ants leaving.  He got  up, found Klein bleeding on the living room couch, and called 911.  A gun safe, a pistol, and $6,000 

cash, all of which had been in the bedroom, were missing. Evidence  at  the  scene  corroborated  Johnson's  account. 
Investigators  found  spent  shell  casings  in  the  bedroom 
(where Johnson said he had been shot) and in the living room 
(where  Johnson  indicated  Klein  had  been  shot).  In  the  liv-
ing room there were two casings, a .32 caliber and a .22 cali-
ber.  One  of  the  bullets  recovered  from  Klein's  body  was  a 
.32 and the other was a .22.  In the bedroom there were two 
more casings, both .32 caliber.  In addition detectives found 
blood  spatter  near  the  living  room  couch  and  bloodstains  in 
the  bedroom.  Pools  of  blood  had  collected  in  the  kitchen 
and  the  doorway  to  Johnson's  bedroom.  Investigators  took 
only  a  few  blood  samples  from  the  crime  scene.  One  was 
from  a  blood  splash  on  the  wall  near  the  bedroom  doorway, 
but no sample was taken from the doorway blood pool itself. 

Investigators searched Richter's residence and found John-
son's  gun  safe,  two  boxes  of  .22-caliber  ammunition,  and  a 
gun  magazine loaded with cartridges of the  same brand and 
type  as  the  boxes.  A  ballistics  expert  later  concluded  the 
.22-caliber  bullet  that  struck  Klein  and  the  .22-caliber  shell 
found  in  the  living  room  matched  the  ammunition  found  in 
Richter's home and bore markings consistent with the model 
of gun for which the magazine was designed. 

Richter  and  Branscombe  were  arrested.  At  first  Richter 
denied involvement.  He would later admit taking Johnson's 
pistol and disposing of it and of the .32-caliber weapon Brans-
combe  used  to  shoot  Johnson  and  Klein.  Richter's  counsel

Opinion of the Court 
Klein had been shot outside the living room and then moved to  the  couch,  given  the  patterns  of  blood  on  Klein's  face,  as 

well as other evidence including "high velocity" blood spatter near  the  couch  consistent  with  the  location  of  a  shooting. 
The  prosecution  also  offered  testimony  from  a  serologist. She  testified  the  blood  sample  taken  near  the  pool  by  the 
bedroom door could be Johnson's but not Klein's. 

Defense counsel's cross-examination probed weaknesses in the  testimony  of  these  two  witnesses.  The  detective  who 

testified  on blood patterns  acknowledged that his  inferences were  imprecise,  that  it  was  unlikely  Klein  had  been  lying 
down on the  couch when shot, and that he  could not  say the 
blood  in  the  living  room  was  from  either  of  Klein's  wounds. 
Defense counsel elicited from the serologist a concession that 
she  had  not  tested  the  bedroom  blood  sample  for  crosscontamination.  She said that if the year-old sample had de-
graded,  it  would  be  difficult  to  tell  whether  blood  of  Klein's 
type was also present in the sample. 

For the defense, Richter's attorney called seven witnesses. 
Prominent among these was Richter himself.  Richter testi-
fied he and Branscombe returned to Johnson's house just be-
fore  the  shootings  in  order  to  deliver  something  to  one  of 
Johnson's  roommates.  By  Richter's  account,  Branscombe 
entered  the  house  alone  while  Richter  waited  in  the  drive-
way;  but  after  hearing  screams  and  gunshots,  Richter  fol-
lowed  inside.  There  he  saw  Klein  lying  not  on  the  couch 
but  in  the  bedroom  doorway,  with  Johnson  on  the  bed  and 
Branscombe standing in the middle of the room.  According 
to  Richter,  Branscombe  said  he  shot  at  Johnson  and  Klein 
after they attacked him.  Other defense witnesses provided 
some  corroboration  for  Richter's  story.  His  former  girl-
friend,  for  instance,  said  she  saw  the  gun  safe  at  Richter's 
house shortly before the shootings. 

The  jury  returned  a  verdict  of  guilty  on  all  charges. 
Richter  was  sentenced  to  life  without  parole.  On  appeal, 
his conviction was affirmed.  People

There  was,  furthermore,  sufficient  conventional  circum-stantial evidence pointing to Richter's guilt.  It included the 

gun  safe  and  ammunition  found  at  his  home;  his  flight  from the  crime  scene;  his  disposal  of  the  .32-caliber  gun  and  of 
Johnson's  pistol;  his  shifting  story  concerning  his  involve-ment;  the  disappearance  prior  to  the  arrival  of  the  law  en-
forcement officers of the .22-caliber weapon that killed Klein; the improbability of Branscombe's not being wounded in the 
shootout  that  resulted  in  a  combined  four  bullet  wounds  to Johnson  and  Klein;  and  the  difficulties  the  intoxicated  and 
twice-shot  Johnson  would  have  had  in  carrying  the  body  of a  dying  man  from  bedroom  doorway  to  living  room  couch, 
not  to  mention  the  lack  of  any  obvious  reason  for  him  to  do so.  There  was  ample  basis  for  the  California  Supreme

Afterwards,  Moore  and  one  of  his  accomplices  told  two people--Moore's  brother  and  the  accomplice's  girlfriend-- 
about the crimes.  According to Moore's brother, Moore and his accomplice admitted: 

" [T]o  make  an  example  and  put  some  scare  into Mr.  Rogers . . . ,  they  had  blind-folded  him  [and]  duct 
taped  him and put  him in  the  trunk of the  car  and took him  out  to  a  place  that's  a  little  remote . . .  .   [T]heir 

intent  was  to  leave  him  there  and  make  him  walk home . . . .  

. . . . . 
"[Moore] had taken the revolver from Lonnie and at the time he had taken it, Mr. Rogers had slipped backwards 

on the mud and the gun discharged."  App. 157-158. 
Moore  and  his  accomplice  repeated  this  account  to  the police.  On  the  advice  of  counsel  Moore  agreed  to  plead  no 

contest  to  felony  murder  in  exchange  for  a  sentence  of 300  months,  the  minimum  sentence  allowed  by  law  for  the 
offense. Moore  later  filed  for  postconviction  relief  in  an  Oregon 
state  court,  alleging  that  he  had  been  denied  his  right  to effective assistance of counsel.  He complained that his law-
yer had not filed a motion to suppress his confession to police in  advance of the  lawyer's  advice that  Moore  considered be-
fore accepting the plea offer.  After an evidentiary hearing, the  Oregon  court  concluded  a  "motion  to  suppress  would 
have  been  fruitless"  in  light  of  the  other  admissible  confes-sion by Moore, to which two witnesses could testify.

another  confession.  True,  Moore's  brother  and  the  girl-friend  of  his  accomplice  might  have  changed  their  accounts 

in  a  manner  favorable  to  Moore.  But  the  record  before  the state  court  reveals  no  reason  to  believe  that  either  witness 
would  violate  the  legal  obligation  to  convey  the  content  of Moore's confession.  And to the extent that his accomplice's 
girlfriend  had  an  ongoing  interest  in  the  matter,  she  might 
have  been  tempted  to  put  more  blame,  not  less,  on  Moore. Then, too, the accomplices themselves might have decided to 

implicate Moore to a greater extent than his own confession did,  say  by  indicating  that  Moore  shot  the  victim  deliber-
ately,  not  accidentally.  All  these  possibilities  are  specula-
tive.  What counsel knew at the time was that the existence 
of the two witnesses to an additional confession posed a seri-
ous strategic concern. 

Moore's prospects at trial were thus anything but certain. 
Even  now,  he does  not  deny  any  involvement  in  the  kidnap-
ing and killing.  In these circumstances, and with a potential 
capital  charge  lurking,  Moore's  counsel  made  a  reasonable 
choice to opt for a quick plea bargain.  At the very least, the 
state court would not have been unreasonable to so conclude.

corroborated,  the  fiance  had  not  reported  the  confession  for a long period of time, the State had indicated that both con-

fessions were essential to its case, and the fiance potentially "had a motive to lie."  499 U. S., at 300.  Moore's plea agree-
ment, by contrast, ended the government's investigation well before  trial,  yet  the  evidence  against  Moore  was  strong. 
The accounts of Moore's second confession to his brother and 
his  accomplice's  girlfriend  corroborated  each  other,  were given to people without apparent reason to lie, and were re-

ported without delay. The State gave no indication that its felony-murder prose-
cution  depended  on  the  admission  of  the  police  confession, 
and  Moore  does  not  now  deny  that  he  kidnaped  and  killed 
Rogers.  Given  all  this,  an  unconstitutional  admission  of 
Moore's  confession  to  police  might  well  have  been  found 
harmless  even  on  direct  review  if  Moore  had  gone  to  trial 
after the denial of a suppression motion.

Opinion of the Court 
Government  contractors.  Contract  employees  play  an  im-
portant  role  in  NASA's  mission,  and  their  duties  are  func-
tionally equivalent to those performed by civil servants. 

One  NASA  facility,  the  Jet  Propulsion  Laboratory  (JPL) 
in  Pasadena,  California,  is  staffed  exclusively  by  contract 
employees.  NASA  owns  JPL,  but  the  California  Institute 
of  Technology  (Cal  Tech)  operates  the  facility  under  a  Gov-
ernment  contract.  JPL  is  the  lead  NASA  center  for  deepspace  robotics  and  communications.  Most  of  this  country's 
unmanned  space  missions--from  the  Explorer  1  satellite  in 
1958 to the Mars Rovers of today--have been developed and 
run  by  JPL.  JPL  scientists  contribute  to  NASA  earthobservation  and  technology-development  projects.  Many 
JPL employees also engage in pure scientific research on top-
ics like "the star formation history of the universe" and "the 
fundamental properties of quantum fluids."  App. 64-65, 68. 

Twenty-eight  JPL  employees  are  respondents  here. 
Many of them have  worked  at the  lab for  decades, and none 
has  ever  been  the  subject  of  a  Government  background  in-
vestigation.  At  the  time  when  respondents  were  hired, 
background checks were standard only for federal civil serv-
ants.  See  Exec.  Order  No.  10450,  3  CFR  936  (1949-1953 
Comp.).  In  some  instances,  individual  contracts  required 
background checks for  the employees  of federal contractors, 
but no blanket policy was in place. 

The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate this 
two-track  approach  to  background  investigations.  In  2004, 
a  recommendation  by  the  9/11  Commission  prompted  the 
President  to  order  new,  uniform  identification  standards  for 
"[f]ederal  employees,"  including  "contractor  employees."

Turning  first  to  SF-85,  the  Court  of  Appeals  noted  re-

tional  right  to  informational  privacy."  530  F.  3d,  at  878. 
But  the  court  determined  that  the  "group  of  questions 
concerning  illegal  drugs"  required  closer  scrutiny.  Ibid.

This  is  a  reasonable,  and  indeed  a  humane,  approach,  and respondents  do  not  dispute  the  legitimacy  of  the  Govern-

ment's decision to use  drug treatment as a mitigating factor in  its  contractor  credentialing  decisions.  Respondents'  ar-
gument  is  that,  if  drug  treatment  is  only  used  to  mitigate, then the Government should change the mandatory phrasing 
of SF-85--"Include [in your answer] any treatment or coun-
seling  received"--so  as  to  make  a  response  optional.  App. 94.  As  it  stands,  the  mandatory  "treatment  or  counseling" 

question is unconstitutional, in respondents' view, because it is "more intrusive than necessary to satisfy the government's 
objective."  Brief  for  Respondents  26;  530  F.  3d,  at  879

was the subject of unlawful retaliation is an artificially narrow reading. 
A  common  usage  of  the  term  "person  aggrieved"  avoids  both  of  these 
extremes.  The Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes suit to 
challenge  a  federal  agency  by  any  "person . . .  adversely  affected  or 
aggrieved . . . within the meaning of a relevant statute," 5 U. S. C. $ 702,

would  follow.  For  example,  a  shareholder  would  be  able  to sue a company for firing a valuable employee for racially dis-

criminatory reasons, so long as he could show that the value of  his  stock  decreased  as  a  consequence.  At  oral  argument 
Thompson acknowledged that such a suit would not lie, Tr. of Oral  Arg.  5-6.  We  agree,  and  therefore  conclude  that  the 
term "aggrieved" must be construed more narrowly than the 
outer boundaries of Article III. At  the  other  extreme  from  the  position  that  "person  ag-

grieved"  means  anyone  with  Article  III  standing,  NAS  ar-gues that it is a term of art that refers only to the employee 
who engaged in the protected activity.  We know of no other 
context  in  which  the  words  carry  this  artificially  narrow 
meaning,  and  if  that  is  what  Congress  intended  it  would 
more naturally have said  "person claiming to have been  dis-
criminated  against"  rather  than  "person  claiming  to  be  ag-
grieved."  We see no basis in text or prior practice for limit-
ing  the  latter  phrase  to  the  person  who  was  the  subject  of 
unlawful  retaliation.  Moreover,  such  a  reading  contradicts 
the  very  holding  of  Trafficante,

charged,  and  in  retaliation  for  accounts  she  gave  of  the  two episodes, prison officials placed her, shackled and handcuffed,

sought judgment  as a matter  of law, pursuant  to  Rule 50(a),

(Agreement)  provides,  in relevant  part, that  McCoy is  eligi-ble for "Preferred rates," but that to keep such rates he has 
to  meet  certain  conditions,  including  making  "at  least  the required minimum payments when due on [his] Account and

such  a  case,  $ 226.9(c)(1)  is  best  read  to  require  that  notice

In  short,  Regulation  Z  is  unclear  with  respect  to  the  cru-cial interpretive question: whether the interest-rate increase 
at issue in this case constitutes a "change in terms" requiring 
notice.  We  need  not  decide  which  party's  interpretation  is 
more  persuasive,  however;  both  are  plausible,  and  the  text 
alone  does  not  permit  a  more  definitive  reading.  Accord-
ingly, we  find  Regulation Z  to be ambiguous  as to the  ques-
tion  presented,  and  must  therefore  look  to  the  Board's  own 
interpretation of the regulation for guidance in deciding this 
case.  See  Coeur

Coy's.  The  Comment  begins:  "No  notice  of  a  change  in terms  need  be  given  if  the  specific  change  is  set  forth 
initially"  in  the  agreement.  We  do  not  find  that  the  Com-ment's  addition  of  the  modifier  "specific"  to  the  word

Opinion of the Court 
Much  of  the  concern  centered  around  vaccines  against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTP), which were blamed 

for  children's  disabilities  and  developmental  delays.  This led  to  a  massive  increase  in  vaccine-related  tort  litigation. 
Whereas between  1978  and 1981  only nine products-liability suits  were  filed  against  DTP  manufacturers,  by  the  mid-
1980's  the  suits  numbered  more  than  200  each  year.6  This destabilized  the  DTP  vaccine  market,  causing  two  of  the 
three domestic  manufacturers to  withdraw;  and  the  remain-ing  manufacturer,  Lederle  Laboratories,  estimated  that  its 
potential tort liability exceeded its annual sales by a factor of 200.

7  Vaccine shortages arose when Lederle had production 

problems in 1984.8 Despite  the  large  number  of  suits,  there  were  many  com-

plaints  that  obtaining  compensation  for  legitimate  vaccine-inflicted  injuries was  too  costly  and  difficult.

9  A  significant 

number  of  parents  were  already  declining  vaccination  for their children,

10  and concerns about compensation threatened 

to  depress  vaccination  rates  even  further.11  This  was  a source of concern to public health officials, since vaccines are 

effective  in  preventing  outbreaks  of  disease  only  if  a  large percentage of the population is vaccinated.

Successful claimants receive compensation for medical, re-

training expenses; diminished earning capacity; pain and suf-
fering; and $250,000 for vaccine-related deaths.21  Attorney's

vaccine  caused  Hannah's  disabilities,  and  that  Lederle  was subject  to  strict  liability,  and  liability  for  negligent  design, 
under Pennsylvania common law.31 Wyeth  removed  the  suit  to  the  United  States  District 
Court  for  the  Eastern  District  of  Pennsylvania,  which granted Wyeth summary judgment on the strict-liability and 
negligence design-defect claims, holding that the Pennsylva-nia  law  providing  those  causes  of  action  was  pre-empted  by

We set forth again the statutory text at issue: 

"No vaccine  manufacturer shall be liable in  a civil ac-tion  for  damages  arising  from  a  vaccine-related  injury 

or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after  October  1,  1988,  if  the  injury  or  death  resulted 
from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by 
proper directions and warnings." 34 
The  "even  though"  clause  clarifies  the  word  that  precedes it.  It  delineates  the  preventative  measures  that  a  vaccine 

manufacturer must

for  "defective  manufacture,  defective  directions  or  warning, and  defective  design."  It  seems  that  the  statute  fails  to 

mention  design-defect  liability  "by  deliberate  choice,  not  in-advertence."  Barnhart

vided,  the  entire  "even  though"  clause  is  a  useless  append-age.

49  It would suffice to say "if the injury or death resulted 

from side effects that were unavoidable"--full stop. 

III 
The  structure  of  the  NCVIA  and  of  vaccine  regulation  in general reinforces what the text of $ 300aa-22(b)(1) suggests. 

A vaccine's license spells out the manufacturing method that must be followed and the directions and warnings that must 
accompany  the  product.50  Manufacturers  ordinarily  must obtain  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration's  (FDA)  approval 
before  modifying  either.51  Deviations  from  the  license  thus provide objective evidence of manufacturing defects or inad-
equate  warnings.  Further  objective  evidence  comes  from the FDA's regulations--more than 90 of them 

52--that perva-

sively  regulate  the  manufacturing  process,  down  to  the  re-quirements  for  plumbing  and  ventilation  systems  at  each 

manufacturing  facility.53  Material  noncompliance  with  any one  of  them,  or  with  any  other  FDA  regulation,  could  cost 
the manufacturer its regulatory-compliance defense.54 Design  defects,  in  contrast,  do  not  merit  a  single  mention 
in  the  NCVIA  or  the  FDA's  regulations.  Indeed,  the  FDA has never even spelled out in regulations the criteria it uses 
to  decide  whether  a  vaccine  is  safe  and  effective  for  its  in-tended  use.

55  And  the  decision  is  surely  not  an  easy  one. 

Drug  manufacturers  often  could  trade  a  little  less  efficacy 

49 That is true regardless of whether $ 300aa-22(b)(1) incorporates com-
ment  k.

adverse  reactions." 58  The  Program  is  to  set  priorities  for 
federal  vaccine  research,  and  to  coordinate  federal  vaccine 
safety and efficacy testing.59  The Act requires vaccine man-
ufacturers  and  healthcare  providers  to  report  adverse  side 
effects,60  and  provides  for  monitoring  of  vaccine  safety 
through  a  collaboration  with  eight  managed-care  organiza-
tions.61  And  of  course  whenever  the  FDA  concludes  that  a 
vaccine is unsafe, it may revoke the license.62 

These  provisions  for  federal  agency  improvement  of  vac-
cine design, and for federally prescribed compensation, once 
again suggest that $ 300aa-22(b)(1)'s  silence regarding 
design-defect  liability  was  not  inadvertent.  It  instead  re-
flects  a  sensible  choice  to  leave  complex  epidemiological 
judgments  about  vaccine  design  to  the  FDA  and  the  Na-
tional Vaccine Program rather than juries.63 

And  finally, the  Act's structural quid

Opinion of the Court 
case-specific  showing  that  "no  feasible  alternative  design" 
existed;  Congress  therefore  must  have  intended  $ 300aa- 
22(b)(1)  to  require  that  showing.68  The  syllogism  ignores 
unhelpful  statements  in  the  1986  Report  and  relies  upon  a 
term of art that did not exist in 1986. 

Immediately  after  the  language  quoted  by  the  dissent, 
the  1986  Report  notes  the  difficulty  a  jury  would  have  in 
faithfully  assessing  whether  a  feasible  alternative  design 
exists when an innocent "young child, often badly injured or 
killed,"  is  the  plaintiff.69  Eliminating  that  concern  is  why 
the  1986  Report's  authors  "strongly  believ[e]  that  Com-
ment  k  is  appropriate  and  necessary  as  the  policy  for  civil 
actions  seeking  damages  in  tort." 70  The  dissent's interpre-
tation of $ 300aa-22(b)(1)  and its  version  of "the  principle  in 
Comment  K"  adopted  by  the  1986  Report  leave  that  con-
cern unaddressed. 

The dissent buries another unfavorable piece of legislative 
history.  Because  the  1986  Report  believes  that  $ 300aa- 
22(b)(1)  should  incorporate  "the  principle  in  Comment  K" 
and  because  the  Act  provides  a  generous  no-fault  compen-
sation  scheme,  the  1986  Report  counsels  injured  parties 
who  cannot  prove  a  manufacturing  or  labeling  defect  to 
"pursue  recompense  in  the  compensation  system,  not  the 
tort  system." 71  That  counsel  echoes  our  interpretation  of 

$ 300aa-22(b)(1). 

Not to worry, the  dissent retorts, a Committee Report by 
a later Congress "authoritative[ly]" vindicates its interpreta-

visions) "may not": 

"(1)  Assess  rail  transportation  property  at  a  value that  has  a  higher  ratio  to  the  true  market  value  of  the 

rail  transportation  property  than  the  ratio  that  the  as-sessed  value  of  other  commercial  and  industrial  prop-
erty in the same assessment jurisdiction has to the true market  value  of  the  other  commercial  and  industrial 
property. "(2)  Levy  or  collect  a  tax  on  an  assessment  that  may 
not be made under paragraph (1) of this subsection. "(3)  Levy  or  collect  an  ad  valorem  property  tax  on

property in the same assessment jurisdiction. "(4)  Impose  another  tax  that  discriminates  against  a

The  following  subsection  confers  jurisdiction  on  federal courts to "prevent a violation" of $ 11501(b) notwithstanding 

the  Tax  Injunction  Act,  28  U. S. C.  $ 1341,  which  ordinarily prohibits federal courts from enjoining the collection of state

DOT's basic objectives.  It phased in passive restraint requirements to 
give manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and develop bet-
ter systems; it worried that requiring airbags would cause a public back-
lash;  and  it  was  concerned  about  airbag  safety  and  cost.  Finally,  the 
Government's current understanding was that a tort suit insisting upon 
airbag  use  would  " ` "stan[d]  as  an  obstacle  to  the  accomplishment  and 
execution of these objectives." ' "  529 U. S., at 883.  Pp. 330-332. 

(c)  Like  the  regulation  in  Geier,  the  instant  regulation  leaves  the 
manufacturer  with  a  choice,  and  the  tort  suit  here  would  restrict  that 
choice.  But  in  contrast  to  Geier,  the  choice  here  is  not  a  significant 
regulatory objective.  The regulation's history resembles the history of 
airbags to some degree.  DOT rejected a regulation requiring lap-and-
shoulder  belts  in  rear  seats  in  1984.  But  by  1989,  changed  circum-
stances  led  DOT  to  require  manufacturers  to  install  lap-and-shoulder 
belts  for  rear  outer  seats  but  to  retain  a  manufacturer  choice  for  rear 
inner seats.  Its reasons for doing so differed considerably from its 1984 
reasons  for  permitting  a  choice  of  passive  restraint.  It  was  not  con-
cerned  about  consumer  acceptance;  it  thought  that  lap-and-shoulder 
belts  would  increase  safety  and  did  not  pose  additional  safety  risks; 
and  it  was  not  seeking  to  use  the  regulation  to  spur  development  of 
alternative safety devices.  Instead, DOT thought that the requirement 
would  not  be  cost  effective.  That  fact  alone  cannot  show  that  DOT 
sought  to  forbid  common-law  tort  suits.  For  one  thing,  DOT  did  not 
believe  that  costs  would  remain  frozen.  For  another,  many  federal 
safety  regulations  embody  a  cost-effectiveness  judgment.  To  infer 
pre-emptive intent from the mere existence of such a cost-effectiveness 
judgment would eliminate the possibility that the agency seeks only to 
set  forth  a  minimum  standard.  Finally,  the  Solicitor  General  repre-
sents  that  DOT's  regulation  does  not  pre-empt  this  tort  suit.  As  in 
Geier, "the agency's own views should make a difference," 529 U. S., at 
883,  and  DOT  has  not  expressed  inconsistent  views  on  this  subject.

fornia  tort  suit  against  Mazda.  They  claimed  that  Mazda should  have  installed  lap-and-shoulder  belts  on  rear  aisle 

seats, and that Thanh died because Mazda equipped her seat with a lap belt instead. 

The California  trial court dismissed  this  tort claim  on  the basis  of the  pleadings.  And  the  California  Court  of Appeal 
affirmed.  The  appeals  court  noted  that  in  Geier  v.  Ameri-
can Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000), this Court consid-ered whether a different portion of (an older version of ) Fed-

eral  Motor  Vehicle  Safety  Standard  208  (FMVSS  208)--a portion  that  required  installation  of  passive  restraint  de-
vices--pre-empted  a  state  tort  suit  that  sought  to  hold  an 
auto  manufacturer  liable  for  failure  to  install  a  particular 
kind  of  passive  restraint,  namely,  airbags.  We  found  that 
the federal regulation intended to assure manufacturers that 
they would retain a choice of installing any of several differ-
ent passive restraint devices.  And the regulation sought to 
assure them that they would not have to exercise this choice 
in  favor  of  airbags.  For  that  reason  we  thought  that  the 
federal regulation  pre-empted a  state  tort  suit that,  by  pre-
mising tort liability on a failure to install airbags, would have 
deprived  the  manufacturers  of  the  choice  that  the  federal 
regulation had assured them.  Id., at 874-875. 

The  court  saw  considerable  similarity  between  this  case 
and Geier.  The federal regulation at issue here gives manu-
facturers a choice among two different kinds of seatbelts for 
rear inner seats.  And a state lawsuit that premises tort lia-
bility  on  a  failure  to  install  a  particular  kind  of  seatbelt, 
namely,  lap-and-shoulder  belts,  would  in  effect  deprive  the 
manufacturer  of  that  choice.  The  court  concluded  that,  as 
in Geier, the federal regulation pre-empts the state tort suit.

In Geier, we considered a portion of an earlier (1984) ver-sion  of  FMVSS  208.  That  regulation  required  manufactur-
ers  to  equip  their  vehicles  with  passive  restraint  systems, thereby providing occupants with automatic accident protec-
tion.  49  Fed.  Reg.  28983  (1984).  But  that  regulation  also gave manufacturers a choice among several different passive 
restraint systems, including airbags and automatic seatbelts. 
Id.,  at  28996.  The  question  before  the  Court  was  whether the  Act,  together  with  the  regulation,  pre-empted  a  state 

tort  suit  that  would  have  held  a  manufacturer  liable  for  not installing  airbags.  529  U. S.,  at  865.  By  requiring  manu-
facturers  to  install  airbags  (in  order  to  avoid  tort  liability) the  tort  suit  would  have  deprived  the  manufacturers  of  the 
choice among passive restraint systems that the federal reg-ulation gave them.  See 

Hillsborough County v.  Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 713 (1985) ("[S]tate 

laws can be pre-empted by federal regulations as well as by federal statutes"). 

We  divided  this  basic  pre-emption  question  into  three subsidiary  questions.  529  U. S.,  at  867.  First,  we  asked 
whether  the  statute's  express  pre-emption  provision  pre-empted the  state  tort suit.  That  statutory clause  says that 
"no  State"  may  "establish,  or  .  .  .  continue  in  effect  .  .  .  any 
safety  standard  applicable  to  the  same  aspect  of  perform-ance"  of  a  motor  vehicle  or  item  of  equipment  "which  is  not 

identical  to  the  Federal  standard."  15  U. S. C.  $ 1392(d) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added).  We had previously held  that a 
word  somewhat  similar  to  "standard,"  namely,  "require-ments" (found in a similar statute), included within its scope 
state  "common-law  duties,"  such  as  duties  created  by  state

Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state law that "stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execu-

tion  of  the  full  purposes  and  objectives"  of  a  federal  law  is pre-empted. 

Hines  v.  Davidowitz,  312  U. S.  52,  67  (1941). See  ibid.  (federal  statute  can  pre-empt  a  state  statute);  Ci-

pollone  v.  Liggett  Group,  Inc.,  505  U. S.  504  (1992)  (federal statute can pre-empt  a state tort suit); Fidelity Fed.  Sav. & 
Loan  Assn.  v.  De  la  Cuesta,  458  U. S.  141  (1982)  (federal regulation  can  pre-empt  a  state  statute);  Geier,  supra  (fed-
eral  regulation  can  pre-empt  a  state  tort  suit).  In  Geier, we  found  that  the  state  law  stood  as  an  " `obstacle'  to  the 
accomplishment" of a significant federal regulatory objective, namely,  the  maintenance  of manufacturer  choice.  529  U. S., 
at 886.  We must decide whether the same is true here. 

A 
At  the  heart  of  Geier  lies  our  determination  that  giving auto manufacturers a choice among different kinds of passive 

restraint  devices  was  a  significant  objective  of  the  federal regulation.  We  reached  this  conclusion  on  the  basis  of  our 
examination  of  the  regulation,  including  its  history,  the promulgating  agency's  contemporaneous  explanation  of  its 
objectives, and the agency's current views of the regulation's pre-emptive effect. 

The  history  showed  that  the  Department  of  Transporta-tion  (DOT)  had  long  thought  it  important  to  leave  manufac-
turers with a choice.  In 1967, DOT required manufacturers to  install  manual  seat  belts. 

Id.,  at  875;  32  Fed.  Reg.  2408, 2415  (1967).  Because  many  car  occupants  did  not  "buckle 

up,"  DOT  began  to  require  passive  protection,  such  as  air-bags or automatic seatbelts, but without "favor[ing]" or "ex-
pect[ing]" the use of airbags.  Geier, supra, at 875 (internal 

331 Cite as: 562 U. S. 323 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
quotation  marks  omitted);  35  Fed.  Reg.  16927  (1970).  DOT subsequently  approved  the  use  of  ignition  interlocks,  which 

froze  the  ignition  until  the  occupant  buckled  the  belt,  as  a substitute  for  passive  restraints. 

Geier,  supra,  at  876;  37 
Fed.  Reg.  3911  (1972).  But  the  interlock  devices  were  un-popular  with  the  public,  and  Congress  soon  forbade  the 

agency to make them a means  of compliance.  Geier, supra, 
at  876;  Motor  Vehicle  and  Schoolbus  Safety  Amendments  of 1974,  $ 109,  88  Stat.  1482  (previously  codified  at  15  U. S. C. 

$ 1410b  (1988  ed.)).  DOT  then  temporarily  switched  to  the use  of  demonstration  projects,  but  later  it  returned  to  man-
dating  passive  restraints,  again  leaving  manufacturers  with 
a  choice  of  systems.  Geier,  supra,  at  876-877;  see  49  Fed. 
Reg. 28962. 

DOT's contemporaneous explanation of its 1984 regulation 
made  clear  that  manufacturer  choice  was  an  important 
means  for  achieving  its  basic  objectives.  The  1984  regula-
tion gradually phased in passive restraint requirements, ini-
tially requiring manufacturers to equip only 10% of their new 
fleets  with  passive  restraints.  DOT  explained  that  it  in-
tended its phasing period partly to give manufacturers time 
to improve  airbag technology  and to develop "other, better" 
passive  restraint  systems.  Geier,  529  U. S.,  at  879.  DOT 
further  explained  that  it  had  rejected  an  " `all  airbag' "  sys-
tem.  Ibid.  It  was  worried  that  requiring  airbags  in  most 
or  all  vehicles  would  cause  a  public  backlash,  like  the  back-
lash  against  interlock  devices.  Ibid.  DOT  also  had  con-
cerns  about  the  safety  of  airbags,  for  they  could  injure  out-
of-place  occupants,  particularly  children.  Id.,  at  877-878. 
And,  given  the  cost  of  airbags,  vehicle  owners  might  not 
replace  them  when  necessary,  leaving  occupants  without 
passive  protection.  Ibid.  The  regulation  therefore  "delib-
erately  sought  variety--a  mix  of  several  different  passive 
restraint  systems."  Id.,  at  878.  DOT  hoped  that  this  mix 
would lead to better information about the devices' compara-
tive effectiveness and to the eventual development of "alter-

332  WILLIAMSON  v.  MAZDA  MOTOR  OF  AMERICA,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 
native,  cheaper,  and  safer  passive  restraint  systems."  Id., at 879. 

Finally,  the  Solicitor  General  told  us  that  a  tort  suit  that insisted  upon  use  of  airbags,  as  opposed  to  other  federally 
permissible  passive  restraint  systems,  would  "stan[d]  as  an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objec-
tives."  Id., at 883 (quoting Brief for United States as Ami-
cus  Curiae  in  Geier  v.  American  Honda  Motor  Co.,  O. T. 1999, No. 98-1811, pp. 25-26 (hereinafter United States Brief 

in Geier);  internal quotation marks  omitted).  And  we  gave weight to the Solicitor General's view in light of the fact that 
it  " `embodie[d]  the  Secretary's  policy  judgment  that  safety would  best  be  promoted  if  manufacturers  installed 

alterna-tive protection systems in their fleets rather than one partic-

ular system in every car.' "  529 U. S., at 881 (quoting United States Brief in Geier 25-26). 

Taken  together,  this  history,  the  agency's  contemporane-ous  explanation,  and  the  Government's  current  understand-
ing  of  the  regulation  convinced  us  that  manufacturer  choice was  an  important  regulatory  objective.  And  since  the  tort 
suit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of that objec-tive, we found the tort suit pre-empted. 

B 
We  turn  now  to  the  present  case.  Like  the  regulation  in 
Geier,  the  regulation  here  leaves  the  manufacturer  with  a choice.  And,  like  the  tort  suit  in  Geier,  the  tort  suit  here 

would restrict  that choice.  But unlike  Geier, we  do not  be-lieve  here  that  choice  is  a  significant  regulatory  objective. 

We  concede  that  the  history  of  the  regulation  before  us resembles  the  history  of  airbags  to  some  degree.  In  1984, 
DOT rejected a regulation that would have required the use of lap-and-shoulder belts  in  rear seats.  49  Fed. Reg. 15241. 
Nonetheless,  by  1989  when  DOT  promulgated  the  present regulation,  it  had  "concluded  that  several  factors  had 
changed."  54 Fed. Reg. 46258. 

333 Cite as: 562 U. S. 323 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
DOT  then  required  manufacturers  to  install  a  particular kind  of  belt,  namely,  lap-and-shoulder  belts,  for  rear  outer 

seats.  In  respect  to  rear  inner  seats,  it  retained  manufac-turer choice as to which kind of belt to install.  But its 1989 
reasons  for  retaining  that  choice  differed  considerably  from its 1984 reasons for permitting manufacturers a choice in re-
spect  to  airbags.  DOT  here  was  not  concerned  about  con-sumer  acceptance;  it  was  convinced  that  lap-and-shoulder 
belts  would  increase  safety;  it  did  not  fear  additional  safety risks  arising  from  use  of  those  belts;  it  had  no  interest  in 
ensuring  a  mix  of  devices;  and,  though  it  was  concerned about additional costs, that concern was diminishing. 

In respect to consumer acceptance, DOT wrote that if 

"people  who  are  familiar  with  and  in  the  habit  of  wear-ing lap/shoulder belts in the front seat find lap/shoulder 

belts in the rear seat, it stands to reason that they would be  more  likely  to  wear  those  belts  when  riding  in  the 
rear seat."  53 Fed. Reg. 47983 (1988). 
In  respect  to  safety,  DOT  wrote  that,  because  an  increas-ing number of rear seat passengers wore seatbelts, rear seat 

lap-and-shoulder belts would have "progressively greater ac-tual safety benefits."  54 Fed. Reg. 46257. 

It added: 

"[S]tudies  of  occupant  protection  from  1968  forward show that the lap-only safety belts installed in rear seat-

ing  positions  are  effective  in  reducing  the  risk  of  death and  injury. . . . However, the  agency  believes  that  rearseat lap/shoulder safety belts would be even more effec-tive." 

Ibid. 

Five  years  earlier,  DOT  had  expressed  concern  that  lap-and-shoulder  belts  might  negatively  impact  child  safety  by 

interfering with the use of certain child car seats that relied upon  a  tether.  But  by  1989,  DOT  found  that  car-seat  de-
signs "had shifted away" from tethers.  53 Fed. Reg. 47983. And  rear  lap-and-shoulder  belts  could  therefore  offer  safety 

334  WILLIAMSON  v.  MAZDA  MOTOR  OF  AMERICA,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 
benefits  for  children  old  enough  to  use  them  without  dimin-ishing  the  safety  of  smaller  children  in  car  seats. 

Id.,  at 
47988-47989  ("[T]he  agency  believes  that  this  proposal  for rear seat lap/shoulder belts would offer benefits for children 

riding in some types of booster seats, would have no positive or  negative  effects  on  children  riding  in  most  designs  of 
car  seats  and  children  that  are  too  small  to  use  shoulder 
belts,  and  would  offer  older  children  the  same  incremental safety protection [as adults]").  Nor did DOT seek to use its 

regulation  to  spur  the  development  of  alternative  kinds  of rear  aisle  or  middle  seat  safety  devices.  See  54  Fed.  Reg. 
46257. Why  then  did  DOT  not  require  lap-and-shoulder  belts  in 
these seats?  We have found some indication that it thought use  of  lap-and-shoulder  belts  in  rear  aisle  seats  could  cause 
"entry  and  exit  problems  for  occupants  of  seating  positions 
to  the  rear"  by  "stretch[ing]  the  shoulder  belt  across  the aisleway," 

id.,  at  46258.  However,  DOT  encouraged  manu-
facturers to address this issue through innovation: 

"[I]n  those  cases  where  manufacturers  are  able  to  de-
sign  and  install  lap/shoulder  belts  at  seating  positions adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the aisle-

way's purpose of allowing access to more rearward seat-ing positions[, the agency] encourages the manufacturers 
to do so."  Ibid. 
And  there  is  little  indication  that  DOT  considered  this matter  a  significant  safety  concern.  Cf.  Letter  from  Philip 

R.  Recht,  Chief  Counsel,  National  Highway  Traffic  Safety 
Admin., to Roger Matoba (Dec. 28, 1994), App. to Reply Brief 
for  Petitioners  2  ("With  respect  to  your  concerns  about 
the  safety  of  shoulder  safety  belts  which  cross  an  aisle,  I 
note that such belts do not in fact prevent rearward passen-
gers  from  exiting  the  vehicle.  Such  passengers  may  .  .  . 
g[o]  under  or  over  the  belt.  They  may  also  move  the  belt 
aside"). 

335 Cite as: 562 U. S. 323 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
The more important reason why DOT did not require lap-and-shoulder  belts  for  rear  inner  seats  was  that  it  thought 

that  this  requirement  would  not  be  cost  effective.  The agency  explained  that  it  would  be  significantly  more  expen-
sive  for  manufacturers  to  install  lap-and-shoulder  belts  in rear  middle  and  aisle  seats  than  in  seats  next  to  the  car 
doors.  54  Fed.  Reg.  46258.  But  that  fact--the  fact  that DOT  made  a  negative  judgment  about  cost-effectiveness-- 
cannot by itself show that DOT sought to forbid common-law tort  suits  in  which  a  judge  or  jury  might  reach  a  different 
conclusion. For  one  thing,  DOT  did  not  believe  that  costs  would  re-
main  frozen.  Rather  it  pointed  out  that  costs  were  falling as  manufacturers  were  "voluntarily  equipping  more  and 
more  of  their  vehicles  with  rear  seat  lap/shoulder  belts." Ibid.  For another thing, many, perhaps most, federal safety 
regulations  embody  some  kind  of  cost-effectiveness  judg-ment.  While  an  agency  could  base  a  decision  to  pre-empt 
on  its  cost-effectiveness  judgment,  we  are  satisfied  that  the rulemaking  record  at  issue  here  discloses  no  such  pre-
emptive  intent.  And  to  infer  from  the  mere  existence  of such  a  cost-effectiveness  judgment  that  the  federal  agency 
intends to bar States from imposing stricter standards would treat  all  such  federal  standards  as  if  they  were 

maximum standards, eliminating the possibility that the federal agency 

seeks only to set forth a minimum standard potentially sup-plemented through state tort law.  We cannot reconcile this 
consequence with a statutory saving clause that foresees the likelihood  of  a  continued  meaningful  role  for  state  tort  law. 
Supra, at 328-329. Finally,  the  Solicitor  General  tells  us  that  DOT's  regula-
tion  does  not  pre-empt  this  tort  suit.  As  in  Geier,  "the agency's  own  views  should  make  a  difference."  529  U. S., 
at 883. 

"Congress has delegated to DOT authority to implement the statute; the subject matter is technical; and the rele-

336  WILLIAMSON  v.  MAZDA  MOTOR  OF  AMERICA,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 
vant history and background are complex and extensive. 
The  agency  is  likely  to  have  a  thorough  understanding 
of  its  own  regulation  and  its  objectives  and  is  `uniquely 
qualified'  to  comprehend  the  likely  impact  of  state  re-
quirements."  Ibid. 

There  is  "no  reason  to  suspect  that  the  Solicitor  General's 
representation  of  DOT's  views  reflects  anything  other  than 
`the  agency's  fair  and  considered  judgment  on  the  matter.' " 
Id.,  at  884  (quoting  Auer  v.  Robbins,  519  U. S.  452,  462 
(1997)). 

Neither has DOT expressed inconsistent views on this sub-
ject.  In Geier, the Solicitor General pointed out that "state 
tort law does not conflict with a federal `minimum standard' 
merely because state  law imposes a  more stringent  require-
ment."  United  States  Brief  in  Geier  21  (citation  omitted). 
And  the  Solicitor  General  explained  that  a  standard  giving 
manufacturers  "multiple  options  for  the  design  of "  a  device 
would  not  pre-empt  a  suit  claiming  that  a  manufacturer 
should have chosen one particular option, where "the Secre-
tary  did  not  determine  that  the  availability  of  options  was 
necessary  to  promote  safety."  Id.,  at  22;  see  Brief  for 
United States as Amicus Curiae in Wood  v.  General Motors 
Corp.,  O.  T.  1989,  No.  89-46,  p.  15.  This  last  statement  de-
scribes the present case. 

In  Geier,  then,  the  regulation's  history,  the  agency's  con-
temporaneous explanation, and its consistently held interpre-
tive  views  indicated  that  the  regulation  sought  to  maintain 
manufacturer  choice  in  order  to  further  significant  regula-
tory  objectives.  Here,  these  same  considerations  indicate 
the  contrary.  We  consequently  conclude  that,  even  though 
the  state tort  suit may restrict the  manufacturer's choice,  it 
does  not  "stan[d]  as  an  obstacle  to  the  accomplishment  .  .  . 
of  the  full  purposes  and  objectives"  of  federal  law.  Hines, 
312 U. S., at 67.  Thus, the regulation does not pre-empt this 
tort action.

where  the  victim  was  interviewed  after  the  event  in  a  room  separate 
from  her  husband  and  "deliberately  recounted,  in  response  to  police 
questioning," the past events.  Id., at 830.  Here, the context is a nondomestic  dispute,  with  the  "ongoing  emergency"  extending  beyond  an 
initial victim to a potential threat to the responding police and the pub-
lic.  This context requires additional  clarification of what Davis meant 
by "the primary  purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assist-
ance to meet an ongoing emergency."  Id., at 822.  Pp. 352-359. 

(b)  To  make  the  "primary  purpose"  determination,  the  Court  must 
objectively evaluate the circumstances in which the encounter between 
the  individual  and  the  police  occurs  and  the  parties'  statements  and 
actions.  Pp. 359-370. 

(1)  The  primary  purpose  inquiry  is  objective.  The  circumstances 
in which an encounter occurs--e. g., at or near a crime scene versus at a 
police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwards--are clearly 
matters  of  objective  fact.  And  the  relevant  inquiry  into  the  parties' 
statements  and  actions  is  not  the  subjective  or  actual  purpose  of  the 
particular  parties,  but  the  purpose  that  reasonable  participants  would 
have  had,  as  ascertained  from  the  parties'  statements  and  actions  and 
the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.  P. 360. 

(2)  The  existence  of  an  "ongoing  emergency"  at  the  time  of  the 
encounter  is  among  the  most  important  circumstances  informing  the 
interrogation's "primary purpose."  See, e. g.,  Davis, 547 U. S., at  828- 
830.  An  emergency  focuses  the  participants  not  on  "prov[ing]  past 
events  potentially  relevant  to  later  criminal  prosecution,"  id.,  at  822, 
but  on  "end[ing]  a  threatening  situation,"  id.,  at  832.  The  Michigan 
Supreme  Court  failed  to  appreciate  that  whether  an  emergency  exists 
and  is  ongoing  is  a  highly  context-dependent  inquiry.  An  assessment 
of  whether  an  emergency  threatening  the  police  and  public  is  ongoing 
cannot narrowly focus on whether the threat to the first victim has been 
neutralized  because  the  threat  to  the  first  responders  and  public  may 
continue.  The  State  Supreme  Court  also  did  not  appreciate  that  an 
emergency's  duration  and  scope  may  depend  in  part  on  the  type  of 
weapon involved; the court below relied on Davis and Hammon, where 
the assailants used their fists, as controlling the scope of an emergency 
involving  a  gun.  A  victim's  medical  condition  is  important  to  the  pri-
mary  purpose  inquiry  to  the  extent  that  it  sheds  light  on  the  victim's 
ability to have any purpose at all in responding to police questions and 
on the likelihood that any such purpose would be a testimonial one.  It 
also provides important context for first responders to judge the exist-
ence  and  magnitude  of  a  continuing  threat  to  the  victim,  themselves, 

346  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Syllabus 
and the public.  This does not mean that an emergency lasts the entire 
time  that  a  perpetrator  is  on  the  loose,  but  trial  courts  can  determine 
in the first instance when an interrogation transitions from nontestimo-
nial  to  testimonial.  Finally,  whether  an  ongoing  emergency  exists  is 
simply one factor informing the ultimate inquiry regarding an interroga-
tion's  "primary  purpose."  Another  is  the  encounter's  informality. 
Formality  suggests  the  absence  of  an  emergency,  but  informality  does 
not  necessarily  indicate  the  presence  of  an  emergency  or  the  lack  of 
testimonial intent.  The facts here--the questioning occurred in an ex-
posed, public area, before emergency medical services arrived, and in a 
disorganized  fashion--distinguish  this  case  from  Crawford's  formal 
station-house interrogation.  Pp. 361-366. 

(3)  The statements and actions of both the declarant and interroga-
tors also provide objective evidence of the interrogation's primary pur-
pose.  Looking  to  the  contents  of  both  the  questions  and  the  answers 
ameliorates problems that could arise from looking solely to one partici-
pant, since both interrogators and declarants may have mixed motives. 
Police officers' dual responsibilities as both first responders and criminal 
investigators  may  lead  them  to  act  with  different  motives  simultane-
ously  or  in  quick  succession.  And  during  an  ongoing  emergency,  vic-
tims  may  want  the  threat  to  end,  but  may  not  envision  prosecution. 
Alternatively,  a  severely  injured  victim  may  have  no  purpose  at  all  in 
answering questions.  Taking into account such injuries does not make 
the inquiry  subjective.  The inquiry  still  focuses on  the understanding 
and purpose of a reasonable victim in the actual victim's circumstances, 
which  prominently  include  the  victim's  physical  state.  Objectively  as-
certaining  the  primary  purpose  of  the  interrogation  by  examining 

the  statements  and  actions  of  all  participants  is  also  consistent  with 
this  Court's  prior  holdings.  E. g.,  Davis,  547  U. S.,  at  822-823,  n.  1. 
Pp. 367-370. 

(c)  Here, the circumstances of the encounter as well as the statements 
and  actions  of  Covington  and  the  police  objectively  indicate  that  the 
interrogation's  "primary  purpose"  was  "to  enable  police  assistance  to 
meet  an  ongoing  emergency,"  547  U. S.,  at  822.  The  circumstances  of 
the interrogation involved an armed shooter, whose motive for and loca-
tion  after  the  shooting  were  unknown  and  who  had  mortally wounded 
Covington within a few blocks and a few minutes of the location where 
police  found  Covington.  Unlike  the  emergencies  in  Davis  and  Ham-
mon, this dispute's potential scope and thus the emergency encompassed 
a  potential  threat  to  the  police  and  the  public.  And  since  this  case 
involved  a  gun,  the  physical  separation  that  was  sufficient  to  end  the 
emergency in Hammon was not necessarily sufficient to end the threat

Syllabus 
here.  Informed  by  the  circumstances  of  the  ongoing  emergency,  the 
Court now turns to determining the "primary purpose of the interroga-
tion" as evidenced by the statements and actions of Covington and the 
police.  The circumstances of the encounter  provide important context 
for  understanding  Covington's  statements  to  the  police.  When  he  re-
sponded  to  their  questions,  he  was  lying  in  a  gas  station  parking  lot 
bleeding  from  a  mortal  gunshot  wound,  and  his  answers  were  punctu-
ated with  questions about  when  emergency medical services  would ar-
rive.  Thus,  this Court  cannot say that a person in his situation  would 
have had a "primary purpose" "to establish or prove past events poten-
tially relevant to later criminal prosecution."  Ibid.  For their part, the 
police responded to a call that a man had been shot.  They did not know 
why,  where,  or  when  the  shooting  had  occurred;  the  shooter's  location; 
or anything else about the crime.  They asked exactly the type of ques-
tions necessary to enable them "to meet an ongoing emergency."  Ibid. 
Nothing in Covington's responses indicated to the police that there was 
no emergency or that the emergency had ended.  Finally, this situation 
is  more  similar  to  the  informal,  harried  911  call  in  Davis  than  to  the 
structured,  station-house  interview  in  Crawford.  The  officers  all  ar-
rived  at  different  times;  asked,  upon  arrival,  what  had  happened;  and 
generally  did not  conduct  a  structured  interrogation.  The  informality 
suggests  that  their  primary  purpose  was  to  address  what  they  consid-
ered to be an ongoing emergency, and the circumstances lacked a formal-
ity that would have alerted Covington to or focused him on the possible 
future prosecutorial use of his statements.  Pp. 370-378.

Opinion of the Court 
State's  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  to  consider  whether the  Confrontation  Clause  barred  the  admission  at  trial  of 

Covington's  statements  to  the police.  We  hold  that  the  cir-cumstances  of  the  interaction  between  Covington  and  the 
police  objectively  indicate  that  the  "primary  purpose  of  the interrogation"  was  "to  enable  police  assistance  to  meet  an 
ongoing  emergency."  Davis,  547  U. S.,  at  822.  Therefore, Covington's identification and description of the shooter and 
the location of the shooting were not testimonial statements, and their admission at Bryant's trial did not violate the Con-
frontation Clause.  We vacate the judgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan and remand. 

I 
Around  3:25  a.m.  on April  29,  2001, Detroit,  Michigan, po-lice  officers  responded  to  a  radio  dispatch  indicating  that  a 

man  had  been  shot.  At  the  scene,  they  found  the  victim, Anthony Covington, lying on the ground next to his car in a 
gas station parking lot.  Covington had a gunshot wound to his  abdomen,  appeared  to  be  in  great  pain,  and  spoke  with 
difficulty. The  police  asked  him  "what  had  happened,  who  had  shot 
him,  and  where  the  shooting  had  occurred."  483  Mich.,  at 143, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71.  Covington stated that "Rick" shot 
him  at  around  3  a.m.  Id.,  at  136,  and  n.  1,  768  N.  W.  2d, at  67,  and  n.  1.  He  also  indicated  that  he  had  a  conversa-
tion  with  Bryant,  whom  he  recognized  based  on  his  voice, through  the  back  door  of  Bryant's  house.  Covington  ex-
plained  that  when  he  turned  to  leave,  he  was  shot  through the  door  and  then  drove  to  the  gas  station,  where  police 
found him. Covington's conversation with the police ended within 5 to 
10 minutes when emergency medical services arrived.  Cov-ington  was  transported  to  a  hospital  and  died  within  hours. 
The  police  left  the  gas  station  after  speaking  with  Coving-ton, called for backup, and traveled to Bryant's house.  They

Opinion of the Court 
did  not  find  Bryant  there  but  did  find  blood  and  a  bullet  on 
the back porch and an apparent bullet hole in the back door. 
Police  also  found  Covington's  wallet  and  identification  out-
side the house. 

At trial, which occurred prior to our decisions in Crawford, 
541 U. S. 36, and Davis, 547 U. S. 813, the police officers who 
spoke with Covington at the gas station testified about what 
Covington  had  told  them.  The  jury  returned  a  guilty  ver-
dict  on  charges  of  second-degree  murder,  being  a  felon  in 
possession  of  a  firearm,  and  possession  of  a  firearm  during 
the commission of a felony. 

Bryant  appealed,  and  the  Michigan  Court  of  Appeals  af-
firmed  his  conviction.  No.  247039,  2004  WL  1882661  (Aug. 
24,  2004)  (per  curiam).  Bryant  then  appealed  to  the  Su-
preme Court of Michigan, arguing  that the  trial  court  erred 
in  admitting  Covington's  statements  to  the  police.  The  Su-
preme  Court  of  Michigan  eventually  remanded  the  case  to 
the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of our 2006 
decision  in  Davis.  477  Mich.  902,  722  N.  W.  2d  797  (2006). 
On  remand,  the  Court  of  Appeals  again  affirmed,  holding 
that Covington's statements were properly admitted because 
they  were  not  testimonial.  No.  247039,  2007  WL  675471 
(Mar.  6,  2007)  (per  curiam).  Bryant  again  appealed  to  the 
Supreme  Court  of  Michigan,  which  reversed  his  conviction. 
483 Mich. 132, 768 N. W. 2d 65. 

Before  the  Supreme  Court  of  Michigan,  Bryant  argued 
that  Covington's  statements  to  the  police  were  testimonial 
under Crawford and Davis and were therefore inadmissible. 
The  State,  on  the  other  hand,  argued  that  the  statements 
were admissible  as  "excited  utterances" under  the  Michigan 
Rules of Evidence.  483 Mich., at 142, and n. 6, 768 N. W. 2d, 
at  70,  and  n.  6.  There  was  no  dispute  that  Covington  was 
unavailable  at  trial  and  Bryant  had  no  prior  opportunity  to 
cross-examine  him.  The  court  therefore  assessed  whether 
Covington's statements to the police identifying and describ-

351 Cite as: 562 U. S. 344 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
ing  the  shooter  and  the  time  and  location  of  the  shooting were  testimonial  hearsay  for  purposes  of  the  Confrontation 

Clause.  The court concluded that the circumstances "clearly indicate that the `primary purpose' of the questioning was to 
establish the facts of an event that had already occurred; the `primary purpose' was not to enable police assistance to meet 
an  ongoing  emergency."  Id.,  at  143,  768  N.  W.  2d,  at  71. The court explained that, in its view, Covington was describ-
ing past events and as such, his "primary purpose in making these  statements  to  the  police  .  .  .  was  .  .  .  to  tell  the  police 
who had  committed  the  crime  against  him, where  the  crime had  been  committed,  and  where  the  police  could  find  the 
criminal."  Id., at 144, 768 N. W. 2d, at 71.  Noting that the officers' actions did not suggest that they perceived an ongo-
ing  emergency  at  the  gas  station,  the  court  held  that  there was in fact no ongoing emergency.  Id., at 145-147, 768 N. W. 
2d,  at  71-73.  The  court  distinguished  the  facts  of  this  case from those in Davis, where we held a declarant's statements 
in a 911 call to be nontestimonial.  It instead analogized this case  to  Hammon  v.  Indiana,  which  we  decided  jointly  with 
Davis and in which we found testimonial a declarant's state-
ments to police just after an assault.  See 547 U. S., at 829- 832.  Based on this analysis, the Supreme Court of Michigan 

held  that  the  admission  of  Covington's  statements  consti-tuted  prejudicial  plain  error  warranting  reversal  and  or-
dered  a  new  trial.  483  Mich.,  at  151-153,  768  N.  W.  2d,  at 75-76.  The  court  did  not  address  whether,  absent  a  Con-
frontation Clause bar, the statements' admission would have been  otherwise  consistent  with  Michigan's  hearsay  rules  or 
due process.1 

1 The  Supreme  Court  of  Michigan  held  that  the  question  whether  the 
victim's  statements  would  have  been  admissible  as  "dying  declarations" 
was  not  properly  before  it  because  at  the  preliminary  examination,  the 
prosecution,  after  first  invoking  both  the  dying  declaration  and  excited 
utterance  hearsay  exceptions,  established  the  factual  foundation  only  for 

352  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
The  majority's  opinion  provoked  two  dissents,  both  of which  would  have  held  Covington's  statements  admissible 

because  they  were  made  in  circumstances  indicating  that their "primary purpose" was to assist police in addressing an 
ongoing emergency.  Id., at 157, 768 N. W. 2d, at 79 (opinion of Weaver, J.); 

id., at 157-159, 768 N. W. 2d, at 79 (opinion of Corrigan,  J.).  Justice  Corrigan's  dissent  explained  that  the 

time  and  space  between  "the  onset  of  an  emergency  and statements about that emergency clearly must be considered 
in context."  Id., at 161, 768 N. W. 2d, at 80.  Justice Corri-gan  concluded  that  the  objective  circumstances  of  Coving-
ton's interaction  with police rendered this  case more similar to  the  nontestimonial  statements  in 

Davis  than  to the  testi-monial statements in Crawford.  483 Mich., at 164, 768 N. W. 

2d, at 82. We granted  certiorari  to determine  whether the  Confron-
tation  Clause  barred  admission  of  Covington's  statements. 559 U. S. 970 (2010). 

II 
The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment states: "In  all  criminal  prosecutions,  the  accused  shall  enjoy  the 

right . . . to  be  confronted  with  the  witnesses  against  him." The  Fourteenth  Amendment  renders  the  Clause  binding  on 
the  States.  Pointer  v.  Texas,  380  U. S.  400,  403  (1965).  In 
admission of the statements as excited utterances.  The trial court ruled 
that  the  statements  were  admissible  as  excited  utterances  and  did  not 
address  their  admissibility  as  dying  declarations.  483  Mich.,  at  153-154, 
768 N. W. 2d, at 76-77.  This occurred prior to our 2004 decision in Craw-
ford  v.  Washington,  541  U. S.  36,  where  we  first  suggested  that  dying 
declarations, even if testimonial, might be admissible as a historical excep-
tion to the Confrontation Clause.  Id., at 56, n. 6; see also Giles v.  Califor-
nia, 554 U. S. 353, 358-359 (2008).  We noted  in Crawford that we "need 
not  decide  in  this  case  whether  the  Sixth  Amendment  incorporates  an 
exception for testimonial dying declarations."  541 U. S., at 56, n. 6.  Be-
cause of the State's failure to preserve its argument with regard to dying 
declarations,  we  similarly  need  not  decide  that  question  here.  See  also 
post, p. 395 (Ginsburg,

Opinion of the Court 
Ohio  v.  Roberts,  448  U. S.  56,  66  (1980),  we  explained  that the confrontation right does not bar admission of statements 

of an  unavailable  witness  if  the statements  "bea[r] adequate `indicia  of  reliability.' "  We  held  that  reliability  can  be  es-
tablished if "the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception,"  or  if  it  does  not  fall  within  such  an  exception, 
then  if  it  bears  "particularized  guarantees  of  trustworthi-
ness."  Ibid. Nearly  a  quarter  century  later,  we  decided 

Crawford  v. 
Washington, 541 U. S. 36.  Petitioner Michael Crawford was prosecuted  for stabbing a man  who had allegedly  attempted 

to rape his wife, Sylvia.  Sylvia witnessed the stabbing, and 
later  that  night,  after  she  and  her  husband  were  both  ar-
rested, police interrogated her about  the incident.  At trial, 
Sylvia  Crawford  claimed  spousal  privilege  and  did  not  tes-
tify,  but  the  State  introduced  a  tape  recording  of  Sylvia's 
statement to the police in an effort to prove that the stabbing 
was  not  in  self-defense,  as  Michael  Crawford  claimed.  The 
Washington  Supreme  Court  affirmed  Crawford's  conviction 
because it found Sylvia's statement to be reliable, as required 
under  Ohio  v.  Roberts.  We  reversed,  overruling  Ohio  v. 
Roberts.  541  U. S.,  at  60-68;  see  also  Davis,  547  U. S.,  at 
825, n. 4. 

Crawford  examined  the  common-law  history  of  the  con-
frontation  right  and  explained  that  "the  principal  evil  at 
which  the  Confrontation  Clause  was  directed  was  the  civillaw  mode  of  criminal  procedure,  and  particularly  its  use  of 
ex  parte  examinations  as  evidence  against  the  accused." 
541  U. S.,  at  50.  We  noted  that  in  England, pretrial  exami-
nations  of  suspects  and  witnesses  by  government  officials 
"were  sometimes  read  in  court  in  lieu  of  live  testimony." 
Id.,  at  43.  In light  of this  history,  we  emphasized  the  word 
"witnesses"  in  the  Sixth  Amendment,  defining  it  as  "those 
who `bear testimony.' "  Id., at 51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An 
American  Dictionary  of  the  English  Language  (1828)).  We 
defined  "testimony"  as  " `[a]  solemn  declaration  or  affirma-

354  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
tion  made  for  the  purpose  of  establishing  or  proving  some 
fact.' "  541  U. S.,  at  51  (quoting  Webster).  We  noted  that 
"[a]n  accuser  who  makes  a  formal  statement  to  government 
officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes 
a  casual  remark  to  an  acquaintance  does  not."  Ibid.  We 
therefore  limited  the  Confrontation  Clause's  reach  to  testi-
monial statements and held that in order for testimonial evi-
dence  to  be  admissible,  the  Sixth  Amendment  "demands 
what  the  common  law  required:  unavailability  and  a  prior 
opportunity  for  cross-examination."  Id.,  at  68.  Although 
"leav[ing]  for  another  day  any  effort  to  spell  out  a  compre-
hensive  definition of  `testimonial,' "  Crawford  noted  that  "at 
a  minimum"  it  includes  "prior  testimony  at  a  preliminary 
hearing,  before  a  grand  jury,  or  at  a  former  trial;  and  .  .  . 
police  interrogations."  Ibid.  Under  this  reasoning,  we 
held that Sylvia Crawford's statements in the course of police 
questioning were testimonial and  that  their admission  when 
Michael Crawford "had no opportunity to cross-examine her" 
due  to spousal  privilege  was  "sufficient  to make  out  a  viola-
tion of the Sixth Amendment."  Ibid. 

In  2006,  the  Court  in  Davis  v.  Washington  and  Hammon 
v.  Indiana,  547  U. S.  813,  took  a  further  step  to  "determine 
more  precisely  which  police  interrogations  produce  testi-
mony"  and  therefore  implicate  a  Confrontation  Clause  bar. 
Id., at 822.  We explained that when Crawford said that 

" ` i nterrogati ons by law enforcement officers fa l l 
squarely  within  [the]  class'  of  testimonial  hearsay,  we 
had  immediately  in  mind  (for  that  was  the  case  before 
us)  interrogations  solely  directed  at  establishing  the 
facts  of  a  past  crime,  in  order  to  identify  (or  provide 
evidence  to  convict)  the  perpetrator.  The  product  of 
such interrogation, whether reduced to a writing signed 
by  the  declarant  or  embedded  in  the  memory  (and  per-
haps  notes)  of  the  interrogating  officer,  is  testimonial." 
Davis, 547 U. S., at 826.

Opinion of the Court 
We  thus  made  clear  in  Davis  that  not  all  those  questioned by  the  police  are  witnesses  and  not  all  "interrogations  by 

law enforcement officers," Crawford, 541 U. S., at 53, are sub-ject to the Confrontation Clause.

Davis  and  Hammon  were  both  domestic  violence  cases. In  Davis,  Michelle  McCottry  made  the  statements  at  issue 

to a 911 operator during a domestic disturbance with Adrian Davis,  her  former  boyfriend.  McCottry  told  the  operator, 
" `He's  here  jumpin'  on  me  again,' "  and,  " `He's  usin'  his fists.' "  547 U. S., at 817.  The operator then asked McCot-
try  for  Davis'  first  and  last  names  and  middle  initial,  and  at 
that point in the conversation McCottry reported that Davis had  fled  in  a  car. 

Id.,  at  818.  McCottry  did  not  appear  at 
Davis'  trial,  and  the  State  introduced  the  recording  of  her conversation with the 911 operator. 

Id., at 819. 
In  Hammon,  decided  along  with  Davis,  police  responded 
to a domestic disturbance  call at the  home of Amy and Her-shel  Hammon,  where  they  found  Amy  alone  on  the  front 

porch.  Ibid.  She  appeared  " `somewhat  frightened,' "  but told them " `nothing was the matter.' " 

Ibid. (quoting Ham-
mon  v.  State,  829  N.  E.  2d  444,  446-447  (Ind.  2005)).  She gave  the  police  permission  to  enter  the  house,  where  they 

saw a gas heating unit with the glass front shattered on the floor.  One  officer  remained  in  the  kitchen  with  Hershel, 
while another officer talked to Amy in the living room about 
what had happened.  Hershel  tried several times to partici-pate in Amy's conversation with the police and became angry 

when  the  police  required  him  to  stay  separated  from  Amy. 547  U. S.,  at  819-820.  The  police  asked  Amy  to  fill  out  and

Id.,  at  820.  Amy  did  not  appear  at  Her-
shel's trial, so the police officers who spoke with her testified as  to  her  statements  and  authenticated  the  affidavit. 

Ibid. 
The trial court admitted the affidavit as a present sense im-
pression  and  admitted  the  oral  statements  as  excited  utter-ances  under  state  hearsay  rules. 

Ibid.  The  Indiana  Su-
preme  Court  affirmed  Hammon's  conviction,  holding  that Amy's oral statements were not testimonial and that the ad-

mission of the affidavit, although erroneous because the affi-davit was testimonial, was harmless. 

Hammon v.  State, 829 
N. E. 2d, at 458-459. To  address  the  facts  of  both  cases,  we  expanded  upon  the 

meaning of "testimonial" that we first employed in Crawford 
and  discussed  the  concept  of  an  ongoing  emergency.  We explained: 

"Statements are nontestimonial when made in the 
course  of  police  interrogation  under  circumstances  ob-
jectively  indicating  that  the  primary  purpose  of  the  in-terrogation  is  to  enable  police  assistance  to  meet  an 

ongoing  emergency.  They  are  testimonial  when  the circumstances  objectively  indicate  that  there  is  no  such 
ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events poten-
tially  relevant  to  later  criminal  prosecution."  Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. 

Examining  the  Davis  and  Hammon  statements  in  light  of 
those  definitions,  we  held  that  the  statements  at  issue  in 
Davis  were  nontestimonial  and  the  statements  in  Hammon 
were testimonial.  We distinguished the statements in 
Davis  from  the  testimonial  statements  in  Crawford  on  sev-
eral grounds, including that the victim in Davis was "speak-
ing  about  events  as  they  were  actually  happening,  rather 

357 Cite as: 562 U. S. 344 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
than  `describ[ing]  past  events,' "  that  there  was  an  ongoing emergency,  that  the  "elicited  statements  were  necessary  to 

be  able  to  resolve  the  present  emergency,"  and  that  the statements  were  not  formal.  547  U. S.,  at  827.  In  Ham-
mon,  on  the  other  hand,  we  held  that,  "[i]t  is  entirely  clear from the circumstances that the interrogation was part of an 
investigation  into  possibly  criminal  past  conduct."  Id.,  at 829.  There  was  "no  emergency  in  progress." 

Ibid.  The officer  questioning  Amy  "was  not  seeking  to  determine . . .  

`what  is  happening,'  but  rather  `what  happened.' "  Id.,  at 830.  It  was  "formal  enough"  that  the  police  interrogated 
Amy in a room separate from her husband where, "some time after  the  events  described  were  over,"  she  "deliberately  re-
counted,  in  response  to  police  questioning,  how  potentially criminal  past  events  began  and  progressed." 

Ibid.  Be-cause  her  statements  "were  neither  a  cry  for  help  nor  the 

provision of information enabling officers immediately to end a  threatening  situation,"  id.,  at  832,  we  held  that  they  were 
testimonial. Davis did not "attemp[t] to produce an exhaustive classifi-
cation of all conceivable statements--or even all conceivable statements in response to police interrogation--as either tes-
timonial  or  nontestimonial."  Id.,  at  822.3  The  basic  pur-

3 Davis explained that 911 operators "may at least be agents of law en-
forcement when they conduct interrogations of 911 callers," and therefore 
"consider[ed] their acts to be acts of the police" for purposes of the opinion. 
547  U. S.,  at  823,  n.  2.  Davis  explicitly  reserved  the  question  "whether 
and  when  statements  made  to  someone  other  than  law  enforcement  per-
sonnel are `testimonial.' "  Ibid.  We have no need to decide that question 
in  this  case  either  because  Covington's  statements  were  made  to  police 
officers.  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
pose  of  the  Confrontation  Clause  was  to  "targe[t]"  the  sort 
of  "abuses"  exemplified  at  the  notorious  treason  trial  of  Sir 
Walter Raleigh.  Crawford, 541 U. S., at 51.  Thus, the most 
important  instances  in  which  the  Clause  restricts  the  intro-
duction  of  out-of-court  statements  are  those  in  which  state 
actors are involved in a  formal, out-of-court interrogation of 
a  witness  to  obtain  evidence  for  trial.4  See  id.,  at  43-44. 
Even where such an interrogation is conducted with all good 
faith,  introduction  of  the  resulting  statements  at  trial  can 
be  unfair  to  the  accused  if  they  are  untested  by  crossexamination.  Whether formal or informal, out-of-court 
statements  can  evade  the  basic  objective  of  the  Confronta-
tion  Clause,  which  is  to  prevent  the  accused  from  being  de-
prived  of  the  opportunity  to  cross-examine  the  declarant 
about statements taken for use at trial.  When, as in Davis, 
the  primary  purpose  of  an  interrogation  is  to  respond  to  an 
"ongoing  emergency,"  its  purpose  is  not  to  create  a  record 
for trial and thus is not within the scope of the Clause.  But 
there may be other circumstances, aside from ongoing emer-
gencies,  when  a  statement  is  not  procured  with  a  primary 
purpose  of  creating  an  out-of-court  substitute  for  trial  tes-
timony.  In  making  the  primary  purpose  determination, 
standard  rules  of  hearsay,  designed  to  identify  some  statetaken under oath, unlike ex parte depositions or affidavits, were generally 
not  considered  substantive  evidence  upon  which  a  conviction  could  be 
based"). 

4 Contrary  to  the  dissent's  excited  suggestion,  nothing  in  this  opinion 

casts "favorable light," post, at 389, on the conduct of Sir Walter Raleigh's 
trial or other 16th- and 17th-century English treason trials.  The dissent 
is correct that such trials are "unquestionably infamous," post, at 390, and 
our decision here confirms, rather than undermines, that assessment.  See 
also  n.  17,  infra.  For  all  of  the  reasons  discussed  in  Justice

ments as reliable, will be relevant.  Where no such primary 
purpose  exists,  the  admissibility  of  a  statement  is  the  con-
cern of state and federal rules of evidence, not  the Confron-
tation Clause.5 

Deciding this case also requires further explanation of the 
"ongoing emergency" circumstance addressed in Davis.  Be-
cause  Davis  and  Hammon  arose  in  the  domestic  violence 
context, that was the situation "we had immediately in mind 
(for  that  was  the  case  before  us)."  547  U. S.,  at  826.  We 
now  face  a  new  context:  a  nondomestic  dispute,  involving  a 
victim found  in  a  public  location, suffering  from  a fatal  gun-
shot  wound,  and  a perpetrator  whose location  was unknown 
at the time the police located the victim.  Thus, we confront 
for the first time circumstances in which the "ongoing emer-
gency"  discussed  in  Davis  extends  beyond  an  initial  victim 
to  a potential  threat  to the  responding  police  and the  public 
at large.  This new context requires us to provide additional 
clarification  with  regard  to  what  Davis  meant  by  "the  pri-
mary  purpose  of  the  interrogation  is  to  enable  police  assist-
ance to meet an ongoing emergency."  Id., at 822. 

III 
To  determine  whether  the  "primary  purpose"  of  an  inter-
rogation  is  "to  enable  police  assistance  to  meet  an  ongoing 
emergency,"  ibid.,  which  would  render  the  resulting  state-
ments  nontestimonial,  we  objectively  evaluate  the  circum-
stances  in  which  the  encounter  occurs  and  the  statements 
and actions of the parties. 

5 See Davis v.  Washington, 547 U. S. 813, 823-824 (2006) (explaining the 
question  before  the  Court  as  "whether  the  Confrontation  Clause  applies 
only to testimonial hearsay" and answering in the affirmative because "[a] 
limitation  so  clearly  reflected  in  the  text  of  the  constitutional  provision 
must fairly be said to  mark  out not merely its  `core,'  but its perimeter").

Opinion of the Court 

A 
The  Michigan  Supreme  Court  correctly  understood  that this  inquiry  is  objective.

6  483  Mich.,  at  142,  768  N.  W.  2d, 

at  70.  Davis  uses  the  word  "objective"  or  "objectively"  no fewer  than  eight  times  in  describing  the  relevant  inquiry. 

See 547 U. S., at 822, 826-828, 830-831, and n. 5; see, e. g., id., at  826  ("The  question  before  us  in 

Davis,  then,  is  whether, objectively  considered,  the  interrogation  that  took  place  in 

the course of the 911 call produced testimonial statements"). "Objectively" also appears in the definitions of both testimo-
nial  and  nontestimonial  statements  that  Davis  established. 
Id., at 822. An objective analysis of the circumstances of an encounter 

and  the  statements  and  actions  of  the  parties  to  it  provides the most accurate assessment of the "primary purpose of the 
interrogation."  The  circumstances  in  which  an  encounter occurs--

e. g.,  at  or  near  the  scene  of  the  crime  versus  at  a police station, during an ongoing emergency or afterwards-- 

are  clearly  matters  of  objective  fact.  The  statements  and actions  of  the  parties  must  also  be  objectively  evaluated. 
That  is,  the  relevant  inquiry  is  not  the  subjective  or  actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, 
but  rather  the  purpose  that  reasonable  participants  would have  had,  as  ascertained  from  the  individuals'  statements 
and  actions  and  the  circumstances  in  which  the  encounter occurred.

6 Bryant suggests that Michigan is arguing for "a subjective analysis of 
the  intent  of  the  interrogator's  questioning."  Brief  for  Respondent  12. 
We do not read Michigan's brief to be arguing for a subjective inquiry, and 
any such argument would be in error.  We do not understand the dissent 
to disagree that the inquiry is objective. 

7 This  approach  is  consistent  with  our  rejection  of  subjective  inquiries 

in other areas of criminal law.  See, e. g., Whren v. United States, 517 U. S. 
806,  813  (1996)  (refusing  to  evaluate  Fourth  Amendment  reasonableness 
subjectively  in  light  of  the  officers'  actual  motivations);  New  York  v. 
Quarles,  467  U. S.  649,  655-656,  and  n.  6  (1984)  (holding  that  an  officer's 
subjective motivation is irrelevant to determining the applicability of the

B 
As  our recent  Confrontation Clause  cases have  explained, the  existence  of  an  "ongoing  emergency"  at  the  time  of  an 

encounter between an individual and the police is among the most  important  circumstances  informing  the  "primary  pur-
pose"  of  an  interrogation.  See  id.,  at  828-830;  Crawford, 541  U. S.,  at  65.  The  existence  of  an  ongoing  emergency  is 
relevant  to determining  the primary purpose of the  interro-gation  because  an  emergency  focuses  the  participants  on 
something other than "prov[ing] past events potentially rele-vant  to  later  criminal  prosecution." 

8  Davis,  547  U. S.,  at 

822.  Rather, it focuses them on "end[ing] a threatening situ-ation."  Id.,  at  832.  Implicit  in  Davis  is  the  idea  that  be-

cause the prospect of fabrication in statements given for the primary purpose of resolving that  emergency is  presumably 
significantly  diminished,  the  Confrontation  Clause  does  not require  such  statements  to  be  subject  to  the  crucible  of 
cross-examination. This  logic  is  not  unlike  that  justifying  the  excited  utter-
ance  exception  in  hearsay  law.  Statements  "relating  to  a startling  event  or  condition  made  while  the  declarant  was 
under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condi-tion," Fed. Rule Evid. 803(2); see also Mich. Rule Evid. 803(2) 
(2010),  are  considered  reliable  because  the  declarant,  in  the excitement, presumably cannot form a falsehood.  See 

Idaho 

public  safety  exception  to  Miranda  v.  Arizona,  384  U. S.  436  (1966)); 
Rhode Island v.  Innis, 446 U. S. 291, 301-302 (1980) (holding that a police 
officer's  subjective  intent  to  obtain  incriminatory  statements  is  not  rele-
vant to determining whether an interrogation has occurred). 

8 The  existence  of  an  ongoing  emergency  must  be  objectively  assessed 

from  the  perspective  of  the  parties  to  the  interrogation  at  the  time,  not 
with the benefit of hindsight.  If the information the parties knew at the 
time of the encounter would lead a reasonable person to believe that there 
was  an  emergency,  even  if  that  belief  was  later  proved  incorrect,  that  is 
sufficient  for  purposes  of  the  Confrontation  Clause.  The  emergency  is 
relevant to the "primary purpose of the interrogation" because of  the ef-
fect it has on the parties' purpose, not because of its actual existence. 

362  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
v.  Wright,  497  U. S.  805,  820  (1990)  ("The  basis  for  the `excited  utterance'  exception . . . is  that  such  statements 

are given under circumstances that eliminate the  possibility of fabrication, coaching, or confabulation . . .  "); 5 J. Weinstein 
&  M.  Berger,  Weinstein's  Federal  Evidence  $ 803.04[1] (J.  McLaughlin  ed.,  2d  ed.  2010)  (same);  Advisory  Commit-
tee's  Notes  on  Fed.  Rule  Evid.  803(2),  28  U. S. C.  App., p.  371  (same).  An  ongoing  emergency  has  a  similar  effect 
of  focusing  an  individual's  attention  on  responding  to  the emergency.

9 

Following our precedents, the court below correctly began its analysis with the circumstances in which Covington inter-

acted  with  the  police.  483  Mich.,  at  143,  768  N.  W.  2d,  at 71.  But  in  doing  so,  the  court  construed 

Davis  to  have  de-cided more than it did and thus  employed an unduly narrow 

understanding  of  "ongoing  emergency"  that  Davis  does  not require. 

9 Many other exceptions to the hearsay rules similarly rest on the belief 
that  certain  statements  are,  by  their  nature,  made  for  a  purpose  other 
than  use in  a  prosecution  and therefore  should  not be  barred  by  hearsay 
prohibitions.  See, e. g., Fed. Rules Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) (statement by a coconspirator  during  and  in  furtherance  of  the  conspiracy);  803(4)  (state-
ments  for purposes  of  medical  diagnosis  or treatment);  803(6)  (records  of 
regularly  conducted  activity);  803(8)  (public  records  and  reports);  803(9) 
(records  of  vital  statistics);  803(11)  (records  of  religious  organizations); 
803(12) (marriage, baptismal, and similar certificates); 803(13) (family rec-
ords);  804(b)(3)  (statement  against  interest);  see  also  Melendez-Diaz  v. 
Massachusetts, 557 U. S. 305, 324 (2009) ("Business and public records are 
generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under 
an  exception  to  the  hearsay  rules,  but  because--having  been  created  for 
the administration  of an entity's affairs  and not for the purpose  of estab-
lishing  or  proving  some  fact  at trial--they  are  not testimonial");  Giles v. 
California,  554  U. S.,  at  376  (noting  in  the  context  of  domestic  violence 
that  "[s]tatements  to  friends  and  neighbors  about  abuse  and  intimidation 
and  statements  to  physicians  in  the  course  of  receiving  treatment  would 
be  excluded,  if  at  all,  only  by  hearsay  rules");  Crawford,  541  U. S.,  at  56 
("Most of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their nature 
were not testimonial--for example, business records or statements in fur-
therance of a conspiracy").

Opinion of the Court 
First,  the  Michigan  Supreme  Court  repeatedly  and  incor-rectly asserted that 

Davis "defined" " `ongoing emergency.' " 
483 Mich., at 147, 768 N. W. 2d, at 73; see also id., at 144, 768 N.  W.  2d,  at  71-72.  In  fact, 

Davis  did  not  even  define  the 
extent  of  the  emergency  in  that  case.  The  Michigan  Su-preme  Court  erroneously  read 

Davis  as  deciding  that  "the 
statements made after the defendant stopped assaulting the 
victim  and  left  the  premises  did  not  occur  during  an  `on-going  emergency.' "  483  Mich.,  at  150,  n.  15,  768  N.  W.  2d, 

at  75,  n.  15.  We  explicitly  explained  in  Davis,  however, that we were asked to review only the testimonial nature of 
Michelle  McCottry's  initial  statements  during  the  911  call; 
we  therefore  merely  assumed  the  correctness  of  the  Wash-
ington  Supreme  Court's  holding  that  admission  of  her  other 
statements  was  harmless,  without  deciding  whether  those 
subsequent  statements  were  also  made  for  the  primary 

purpose  of  resolving an ongoing  emergency.  547 U. S., 
at 829. 

Second,  by  assuming that  Davis  defined the  outer bounds 
of "ongoing emergency," the Michigan Supreme Court failed 
to appreciate that whether an emergency exists and is ongo-
ing  is  a  highly  context-dependent  inquiry.  See  Brief  for 
United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  20.  Davis  and  Hammon 
involved domestic violence, a known and identified perpetra-
tor,  and,  in  Hammon,  a  neutralized  threat.  Because  Davis 
and Hammon were domestic violence cases, we focused only 
on the threat to the victims and assessed the ongoing emer-
gency  from the  perspective of  whether  there was a continu-
ing threat to them.  547 U. S., at 827, 829-830. 

Domestic  violence  cases  like  Davis  and  Hammon  often 
have a narrower zone of potential victims than cases involv-
ing  threats  to  public  safety.  An  assessment  of  whether  an 
emergency  that  threatens  the  police  and  public  is  ongoing 
cannot  narrowly  focus  on  whether  the  threat  solely  to  the 
first  victim  has  been  neutralized  because  the  threat  to  the 
first responders and public may continue.  See 483 Mich., at 

364  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
164, 768 N. W. 2d, at 82 (Corrigan, J., dissenting) (examining the  threat  to  the  victim,  police,  and  the  public);  Brief  for 

United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  19-20  ("An  emergency posed by an unknown shooter who remains at large does not 
automatically abate just because the police can provide secu-rity to his first victim"). 

The Michigan Supreme  Court also did  not appreciate  that 
the duration and scope of an emergency may depend in part on the type of weapon employed.  The court relied on 

Davis 
and Hammon, in which the assailants used their fists, as con-trolling the scope of the emergency here, which involved the 

use of a gun.  The problem with that reasoning is clear when 
considered in light of the assault on Amy Hammon.  Hershel 
Hammon was armed only with his fists when he attacked his 
wife,  so  removing  Amy  to  a  separate  room  was  sufficient  to 
end  the  emergency.  547  U. S.,  at  830-832.  If  Hershel  had 
been  reported  to  be  armed  with  a  gun,  however,  separation 
by a  single  household  wall might not  have  been sufficient  to 
end the emergency.  Id., at 819. 

The  Michigan  Supreme  Court's  failure  to  focus  on  the 
context-dependent nature of our Davis decision also led it to 
conclude  that  the  medical  condition  of  a  declarant  is  irrele-
vant.  483 Mich., at 149, 768 N. W. 2d, at 74 ("The Court said 
nothing at all that would remotely suggest that whether the 
victim was in need of medical attention was in any way rele-
vant  to  whether  there  was  an  `ongoing  emergency' ").  But 
Davis  and  Hammon  did  not  present  medical  emergencies, 
despite  some  injuries  to  the  victims.  547  U. S.,  at  818,  820. 
Thus,  we  have  not  previously  considered,  much  less  ruled 
out, the relevance of a victim's severe injuries to the primary 
purpose inquiry. 

Taking into account the victim's medical state does not, as 
the  Michigan  Supreme  Court  below  thought,  "rende[r]  nontestimonial" "all statements made while the police are ques-
tioning a seriously injured complainant."  483 Mich., at 149, 
768  N.  W.  2d,  at  74.  The  medical  condition  of  the  victim  is 

365 Cite as: 562 U. S. 344 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
important to the primary purpose inquiry to the extent that 
it sheds light on the ability of the victim to have any purpose 
at all in responding to police questions and on the likelihood 
that  any  purpose  formed  would necessarily  be  a  testimonial 
one.  The  victim's  medical  state  also  provides  important 
context for first responders to judge the existence and mag-
nitude  of  a  continuing  threat  to  the  victim,  themselves,  and 
the public. 

As  the Solicitor  General's brief  observes, Brief for  United 
States  as  Amicus  Curiae  20,  and  contrary  to  the  Michigan 
Supreme  Court's  claims,  483  Mich.,  at  147,  768  N.  W.  2d,  at 
73,  none  of  this  suggests  that  an  emergency  is  ongoing  in 
every place or even just surrounding the victim for the entire 
time  that  the  perpetrator  of  a  violent  crime  is  on  the  loose. 
As we recognized  in Davis, "a conversation which begins as 
an interrogation to determine the need for emergency assist-
ance"  can  "evolve  into  testimonial  statements."  547  U. S., 
at  828  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  This  evolution 
may  occur  if,  for  example,  a  declarant  provides  police  with 
information  that  makes  clear  that  what  appeared  to  be  an 
emergency is not  or is no longer an emergency or that what 
appeared  to  be  a  public  threat  is  actually  a  private  dispute. 
It  could  also  occur  if  a  perpetrator  is  disarmed,  surrenders, 
is  apprehended,  or,  as  in  Davis,  flees  with  little  prospect  of 
posing a threat to the public.  Trial courts can determine in 
the first instance when any transition from nontestimonial to 
testimonial  occurs,10  and  exclude  "the  portions  of  any  state-

10 Recognizing  the  evolutionary  potential  of  a  situation  in  criminal  law 
is  not  unique  to  the  Confrontation  Clause  context.  We  noted  in  Davis 
that "[j]ust as, for Fifth Amendment purposes, `police officers can and will 
distinguish  almost  instinctively  between  questions  necessary  to  secure 
their own safety or the safety of the public and questions designed solely 
to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect,' . . . trial courts will recognize 
the point at which, for Sixth Amendment purposes, statements in response 
to  interrogations  become  testimonial."  547  U. S.,  at  829  (quoting  New 
York  v.  Quarles, 467 U. S., at 658-659). 

366  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
ment that have become testimonial, as they do, for example, 
with unduly prejudicial portions of otherwise admissible evi-
dence."  Id., at 829. 

Finally,  our  discussion  of  the  Michigan  Supreme  Court's 
misunderstanding  of  what  Davis  meant  by  "ongoing  emer-
gency"  should  not  be  taken  to  imply  that  the  existence  vel 
non of an ongoing emergency is dispositive of the testimonial 
inquiry.  As  Davis  made  clear,  whether  an  ongoing  emer-
gency  exists  is  simply  one  factor--albeit  an  important  fac-
tor--that  informs  the  ultimate  inquiry  regarding  the  "pri-
mary  purpose"  of  an  interrogation.  Another  factor  the 
Michigan  Supreme  Court  did  not  sufficiently  account  for  is 
the  importance  of  informality  in  an  encounter  between  a 
victim  and  police.  Formality  is  not  the  sole  touchstone  of 
our  primary  purpose  inquiry  because,  although  formality 
suggests  the  absence  of  an  emergency  and  therefore  an  in-
creased likelihood that the purpose of the interrogation is to 
"establish  or  prove  past  events  potentially  relevant  to  later 
criminal prosecution," id., at 822, informality does not neces-
sarily  indicate  the  presence  of  an  emergency  or  the  lack  of 
testimonial  intent.  Cf.  id.,  at  826  (explaining  that  Confron-
tation  Clause  requirements  cannot  "readily  be  evaded"  by 
the  parties  deliberately  keeping  the  written  product  of  an 
interrogation  informal "instead  of  having the  declarant  sign 
a  deposition").  The  court  below,  however,  too  readily  dis-
missed  the  informality  of  the  circumstances  in  this  case 
in a single brief footnote and in fact seems to have suggested 
that  the  encounter  in  this  case  was  formal.  483  Mich.,  at 
150, n. 16, 768 N. W. 2d, at 75, n. 16.  As we explain further 
below,  the  questioning  in  this  case  occurred  in  an  exposed, 
public  area,  prior  to  the  arrival  of  emergency  medical  serv-
ices,  and  in  a  disorganized  fashion.  All  of  those  facts  make 
this case distinguishable from the formal station-house inter-
rogation in Crawford.  See Davis, 547 U. S., at 827.

Opinion of the Court 

C 
In addition to the circumstances in which an encounter oc-curs,  the  statements  and  actions  of  both  the  declarant  and 

interrogators provide objective evidence of the primary pur-pose  of  the  interrogation.  See, 

e. g.,  ibid.  ("[T]he  nature  of what was 
asked and answered in Davis, again viewed objec-tively,  was such that  the  elicited statements were necessary 

to be able to resolve the present emergency, rather than sim-ply to learn (as in Crawford) what had happened in the past" 
(first  emphasis  added)).  The  Michigan  Supreme  Court  did, at  least briefly,  conduct  this  inquiry.  483  Mich.,  at  144-147, 
768 N. W. 2d, at 71-73. As the Michigan Supreme  Court correctly recognized, id., 
at  140,  n.  5,  768  N.  W.  2d,  at  69,  n.  5,  Davis  requires  a  com-bined  inquiry  that  accounts  for  both  the  declarant  and  the 
interrogator.11  In  many  instances,  the  primary  purpose  of 

11 Some  portions  of  Davis,  however,  have  caused  confusion  about 
whether  the  inquiry  prescribes  examination  of  one  participant  to  the  ex-
clusion of the other.  Davis' language indicating that a statement's testi-
monial or nontestimonial nature derives from "the primary purpose of the 
interrogation,"  547  U. S.,  at  822  (emphasis  added),  could  be  read  to  sug-
gest  that  the  relevant  purpose  is  that  of  the  interrogator.  In  contrast, 
footnote  1  in  Davis  explains,  "it  is  in  the  final  analysis  the  declarant's 
statements,  not  the  interrogator's  questions,  that  the  Confrontation 
Clause requires us to evaluate."  Id., at 822-823, n. 1.  Bryant draws on 
the footnote to argue that the primary purpose inquiry must be conducted 
solely from  the perspective of the declarant,  and argues against adoption 
of a purpose-of-the-interrogator perspective.  Brief for Respondent 
10-13;  see  also  Brief  for  Richard  D.  Friedman  as  Amicus  Curiae  5-15. 
But  this  statement  in  footnote  1  of  Davis  merely  acknowledges  that  the 
Confrontation  Clause  is  not  implicated  when  statements  are  offered  "for 
purposes  other  than  establishing  the  truth  of  the  matter  asserted." 
Crawford, 541 U. S., at 60, n. 9.  An interrogator's questions, unlike a de-
clarant's answers, do not assert the truth of any matter.  The language in 
the footnote was not meant to determine how the courts are to assess the 
nature of the declarant's purpose, but merely to remind readers that it is 
the  statements,  and  not  the  questions,  that  must  be  evaluated  under  the 
Sixth Amendment. 

368  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
the  interrogation  will  be  most  accurately  ascertained  by looking  to  the  contents  of  both  the  questions  and  the  an-

swers.  To  give  an  extreme  example,  if  the  police  say  to  a victim,  "Tell  us  who  did  this  to  you  so  that  we  can  arrest 
and prosecute them," the victim's response that "Rick did it" appears purely accusatory because by virtue of the phrasing 
of  the  question,  the  victim  necessarily  has  prosecution  in 
mind when she answers. The  combined  approach  also  ameliorates  problems  that 

could arise from looking solely to one participant.  Predomi-nant  among  these  is  the  problem  of  mixed  motives  on  the 
part of both interrogators and declarants.  Police officers in 
our  society  function  as  both  first  responders  and  criminal 
investigators.  Their  dual  responsibilities  may  mean  that 
they  act  with  different  motives  simultaneously  or  in  quick 
succession.  See  New  York  v.  Quarles,  467  U. S.  649,  656 
(1984)  ("Undoubtedly  most  police  officers  [deciding  whether 
to give Miranda warnings in a possible emergency situation] 
would  act  out  of  a  host  of  different,  instinctive,  and  largely 
unverifiable  motives--their  own  safety,  the  safety  of others, 
and  perhaps  as  well  the  desire  to  obtain  incriminating  evi-
dence  from  the  suspect");  see  also  Davis,  547  U. S.,  at  839 
(Thomas,

Opinion of the Court 
ing  questions  posed;  the  answers  may  be  simply  reflexive. 
The  victim's  injuries  could  be  so  debilitating  as  to  prevent 
her from thinking sufficiently clearly to understand whether 
her statements are for the purpose of addressing an ongoing 
emergency or  for the  purpose  of future  prosecution.12  Tak-
ing  into  account  a  victim's  injuries  does  not  transform  this 
objective  inquiry  into  a  subjective  one.  The  inquiry  is  still 
objective  because  it  focuses  on  the  understanding  and  pur-
pose of a reasonable victim in the circumstances of the actual 
victim--circumstances  that  prominently include  the  victim's 
physical state. 

The  dissent  suggests,  post,  at  381-382,  that  we  intend  to 
give controlling weight to the "intentions of the police," post, 
at 382.  That is a misreading of our opinion.  At trial, the de-
clarant's statements, not the interrogator's questions, will be 
introduced  to  "establis[h]  the  truth  of the  matter  asserted," 
Crawford,  541  U. S.,  at 60, n.  9,  and must therefore  pass the 
Sixth  Amendment  test.  See  n.  11,  supra.  In  determining 
whether  a  declarant's  statements  are  testimonial,  courts 
should look to all of the relevant circumstances.  Even Jus-
tice

370  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
should not be unjustifiably restrained from consulting all rel-evant  information,  including  the  statements  and  actions  of 

interrogators. Objectively ascertaining the primary purpose of the inter-
rogation by examining the statements and actions of all par-ticipants  is  also  the  approach  most  consistent  with  our  past 
holdings.  E. g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 822-823, n. 1 (noting that "volunteered  testimony"  is  still  testimony  and  remains  sub-
ject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause). 

IV 
As  we  suggested  in  Davis,  when  a  court  must  determine whether  the  Confrontation  Clause  bars  the  admission  of  a 

statement at trial, it should determine the "primary purpose of  the  interrogation"  by  objectively  evaluating  the  state-
ments and actions of the parties to the encounter, in light of the  circumstances  in  which  the  interrogation  occurs.  The 
existence of an emergency or the parties' perception that an emergency  is  ongoing  is  among  the  most  important  circum-
stances  that  courts  must  take  into  account  in  determining whether  an  interrogation  is  testimonial  because  statements 
made  to  assist  police  in  addressing  an  ongoing  emergency presumably  lack  the  testimonial  purpose  that  would  subject 
them to the requirement of confrontation.13  As  the context of this  case brings  into  sharp  relief,  the  existence  and dura-

13 Of course the Confrontation Clause is not the only bar to admissibility 
of  hearsay  statements  at  trial.  State  and  federal  rules  of  evidence  pro-
hibit the introduction of  hearsay, subject  to exceptions.  Consistent with 
those rules, the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-
ments may constitute a further bar to admission of, for example, unreliable 
evidence.  See Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U. S. 37, 53 (1996) (plurality opin-
ion) ("[E]rroneous evidentiary rulings can, in combination, rise to the level 
of  a  due  process  violation");  Dutton  v.  Evans,  400  U. S.  74,  96-97  (1970) 
(Harlan,  J.,  concurring  in  result)  ("[T]he  Fifth  and  Fourteenth  Amend-
ments' commands that federal and state trials, respectively, must be con-
ducted in accordance with due process of law" are the "standard" by which 
to "test federal and state rules of evidence").

tion of an emergency depend on the type and scope of danger posed to the victim, the police, and the public. 

Applying  this  analysis  to  the  facts  of  this  case  is  more difficult than in 

Davis because we do not have the luxury of 
reviewing  a  transcript  of  the  conversation  between  the  vic-tim  and  the  police  officers.  Further  complicating  our  task 

is the fact that the trial in this case occurred before our deci-
sions in Crawford and Davis.  We therefore review a record that was not developed to ascertain the "primary purpose of 

the interrogation." We first examine the circumstances in which the interroga-
tion occurred.  The parties disagree over whether there was 
an  emergency  when  the  police  arrived  at  the  gas  station. 
Bryant  argues,  and  the  Michigan  Supreme  Court  accepted, 
483  Mich.,  at  147,  768  N.  W.  2d,  at  73,  that  there  was  no 
ongoing  emergency  because  "there . . . was  no  criminal  
conduct  occurring.  No  shots  were  being  fired,  no  one  was 
seen  in  possession  of  a  firearm,  nor  were  any  witnesses 
seen cowering in fear or running from the scene."  Brief for 
Respondent  27.  Bryant,  while  conceding  that  "a  serious  or 
life-threatening  injury  creates  a  medical  emergency  for  a 
victim,"  id.,  at  30,  further  argues  that  a  declarant's  medi-
cal  emergency  is  not  relevant  to  the  ongoing  emergency 
determination. 

In  contrast,  Michigan  and  the  Solicitor  General  explain 
that  when  the  police  responded  to  the  call  that  a  man  had 
been  shot  and  found  Covington  bleeding  on  the  gas  station 
parking lot, "they did not know who Covington was, whether 
the shooting had occurred at the gas station or at a different 
location,  who  the  assailant  was,  or  whether  the  assailant 
posed  a  continuing  threat  to  Covington  or  others."  Brief 
for United States as Amicus Curiae 15;  Brief for Petitioner 
16; see also id., at 15 ("[W]hen an officer arrives on the scene 
and  does  not  know  where  the  perpetrator  is,  whether  he  is 
armed,  whether  he  might  have  other  targets,  and  whether 
the violence might continue at the scene or elsewhere, inter-

rogation  that  has  the  primary  purpose  of  establishing  those 
facts to assess the situation is designed to meet the ongoing 
emergency and is nontestimonial"). 

The Michigan Supreme Court stated that the police asked 
Covington,  "what  had  happened,  who  had  shot  him,  and 
where  the  shooting  had  occurred."  483  Mich.,  at  143,  768 
N. W. 2d, at 71.  The joint appendix contains the transcripts 
of  the  preliminary  examination,  suppression  hearing,  and 
trial  testimony  of  five  officers  who  responded  to  the  scene 
and  found Covington.  The  officers'  testimony is  essentially 
consistent  but,  at  the  same  time,  not  specific.  The  officers 
basically agree  on  what information  they  learned  from  Cov-
ington,  but  not  on  the  order  in  which  they  learned  it  or  on 
whether Covington's statements were in response to general 
or detailed questions.  They all agree that the first question 
was "what happened?"  The answer was either "I was shot" 
or "Rick shot me." 14 

As  explained  above,  the  scope  of  an  emergency  in  terms 
of  its  threat  to  individuals  other  than  the  initial  assailant 
and victim will often depend on the type of dispute involved. 
Nothing Covington said to the police indicated that the cause 
of  the  shooting  was  a  purely  private  dispute  or  that  the 
threat from the shooter had ended.  The record reveals little 
about  the  motive  for  the  shooting.  The  police  officers  who 
spoke  with  Covington  at  the  gas  station  testified  that  Cov-
ington did not tell them what words Covington and Rick had 

14 See  App.  76  (testimony  of  Officer  McCallister);  id.,  at  101,  113-114 
(testimony  of  Sgt.  Wenturine);  id.,  at  127,  131-133  (testimony  of  Officer 
Stuglin).  Covington  told them  that Rick had  shot him  through the back 
door of Rick's house, id., at 127-128 (testimony of Officer Stuglin), located 
at  the  corner  of  Pennsylvania  and  Laura,  id.,  at  102  (testimony  of  Sgt. 
Wenturine),  and  that  Covington  recognized  Rick  by  his  voice,  id.,  at  128 
(testimony  of  Officer  Stuglin).  Covington  also  gave  them  a  physical  de-
scription of Rick.  Id., at 84-85, 93-94 (testimony of Officer McCallister); 
id.,  at  103,  115  (testimony  of  Sgt.  Wenturine);  id.,  at  134  (testimony  of 
Officer Stuglin).

Opinion of the Court 
exchanged prior to the shooting.15  What Covington did tell the  officers  was  that  he  fled  Bryant's  back  porch,  indicating 

that  he  perceived  an  ongoing  threat.16  The  police  did  not know,  and  Covington  did  not  tell  them,  whether  the  threat 
was  limited  to  him.  The  potential  scope  of  the  dispute  and therefore  the  emergency  in  this  case  thus  stretches  more 
broadly  than  those  at  issue  in  Davis  and  Hammon  and  en-
compasses  a  threat  potentially  to  the  police  and  the  public. This  is  also  the  first  of  our  postCrawford  Confrontation 
Clause cases to involve a gun.  The physical separation that was  sufficient  to  end  the  emergency  in 

Hammon  was  not 
necessarily  sufficient  to  end  the  threat  in  this  case;  Coving-ton was shot through the back door of Bryant's house.  Bry-

ant's  argument  that  there  was  no  ongoing  emergency  be-cause  "[n]o  shots  were  being  fired,"  Brief  for  Respondent 
27,  surely  construes  ongoing  emergency  too  narrowly.  An 
emergency does not last only for the time between when the 
assailant pulls the trigger and the bullet hits the victim.  If 
an  out-of-sight  sniper  pauses  between  shots,  no  one  would 

15 See id., at 114 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine) ("Q Did he tell you what 
Rick  said?  A  He  said  they  were  having  a  conversation.  Q  Did  he  tell 
you what Rick said?  A He did not" (paragraph breaks omitted)); see also 
id., at 79 (testimony of Officer McCallister); id., at 128 (testimony of Offi-
cer Stuglin). 

16 See id., at 127-128 (testimony of Officer Stuglin) ("A He said he'd went 

up, he went up to the back door of a house; that a person he said he knew, 
and he was knocking and he was knocking on the door he said he'd talked 
to somebody through the door.  He said he recognized the voice.  Q Did 
he  say  who  it  was  that  he  recognized  the  voice  of?  A  That's  [when] 
he  told  me  it  was,  he  said  it  was  Rick  a/k/a  Buster.  Q  And  did  he  say 
what  the  conversation  was  about  at  the door?  A  I  don't,  I  don't  believe 
so.  Q  All  right.  And  did  he  say  what  happened  there,  whether  or  not 
they had a conversation or not, did he say what ended up happening?  A He 
said what happened was that he heard a shot and then he started to turn 
to get off the porch and then another one and then that's when he was hit 
by a gunshot" (paragraph breaks omitted)).  Unlike the dissent's apparent 
ability to read Covington's mind, post, at 384-385, we rely on the available 
evidence, which suggests that Covington perceived an ongoing threat. 

374  MICHIGAN  v.  BRYANT 

Opinion of the Court 
say that the emergency ceases during the pause.  That is an extreme example and not the situation here, but it serves to 

highlight  the  implausibility,  at  least  as  to  certain  weapons, of construing the emergency to last only precisely as long as 
the  violent  act itself,  as  some  have  construed our  opinion  in 
Davis.  See Brief for Respondent 23-25. At  no  point  during  the  questioning  did  either  Covington 

or the police know the location of the shooter.  In fact, Bry-ant  was  not  at  home  by  the  time  the  police  searched  his 
house  at  approximately  5:30  a.m.  483  Mich.,  at  136,  768 N. W. 2d, at 67.  At some point between 3 a.m. and 5:30 a.m., 
Bryant  left  his  house.  At  bottom,  there  was  an  ongoing emergency  here  where  an  armed  shooter,  whose  motive  for 
and location  after the shooting  were unknown, had mortally wounded  Covington  within  a  few  blocks  and  a  few  minutes 
of the location where the police found Covington.17 This  is  not  to  suggest  that  the  emergency  continued  until 
Bryant was arrested in California a year  after the  shooting. 
Id., at 137, 768 N. W. 2d, at 67.  We need not decide precisely when  the  emergency  ended  because  Covington's  encounter 

with the police and all of the statements he made during that interaction  occurred  within  the  first  few  minutes  of  the  po-
lice  officers'  arrival  and  well  before  they  secured  the  scene of the shooting--the shooter's last known location. 

We  reiterate,  moreover,  that  the  existence  vel  non  of  an ongoing  emergency  is  not  the  touchstone  of  the  testimonial 
inquiry; rather, the ultimate inquiry is whether the "primary purpose of the interrogation [was] to enable police assistance 
to meet [the] ongoing emergency."  Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. We  turn  now  to  that  inquiry,  as  informed  by  the  circum-
stances  of  the  ongoing  emergency  just  described.  The  cir-cumstances  of  the  encounter  provide  important  context  for 

17 It  hardly  bears  mention  that  the  emergency  situation  in  this  case  is 
readily  distinguishable  from  the  "treasonous  conspiracies  of  unknown 
scope,  aimed  at  killing  or  overthrowing  the  King,"  post,  at  389,  about 
which the dissent is quite concerned.

Opinion of the Court 
understanding  Covington's  statements  to  the  police.  When the  police  arrived  at  Covington's  side,  their  first  question 

to  him  was  "What  happened?" 18  Covington's  response  was either "Rick shot me" or "I was shot," followed very quickly 
by  an  identification  of  "Rick"  as  the  shooter.  App.  76.  In response to  further questions,  Covington  explained that  the 
shooting  occurred  through  the  back  door  of  Bryant's  house 
and  provided  a  physical  description  of  the  shooter.  When he made the statements, Covington was lying in a gas station 

parking  lot  bleeding  from  a  mortal  gunshot  wound  to  his abdomen.  His answers to the police officers' questions were 
punctuated  with  questions  about  when  emergency  medical services  would  arrive. 

Id.,  at  56-57  (suppression  hearing 
testimony of Officer Brown).  He was obviously in consider-able  pain  and  had  difficulty  breathing  and  talking. 

Id.,  at 
75, 83-84 (testimony of Officer McCallister); id., at 101, 110- 
111 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine); id., at 126, 137 (testimony 
of  Officer  Stuglin).  From  this  description  of  his  condition 
and report of his statements, we cannot say that a person in 
Covington's  situation  would  have  had  a  "primary  purpose" 
"to  establish  or  prove  past  events  potentially  relevant  to 
later criminal prosecution."  Davis, 547 U. S., at 822. 

For  their  part,  the  police  responded  to  a  call  that  a  man 
had been shot.  As discussed above, they did not know why, 

18 Although the dissent claims otherwise, post, at 385, at least one officer 
asked Covington  something  akin  to "how  was he  doing."  App. 131  (tes-
timony  of  Officer  Stuglin)  ("A  I  approached  the  subject,  the  victim, 
Mr.  Covington,  on  the  ground  and  had  asked  something  like  what  hap-
pened  or  are  you  okay,  something  to  that  line.  .  .  .  Q  So  you  asked  this 
man  how  are  you,  how  are  you  doing?  A  Well,  basically  it's,  you  know, 
what's  wrong,  you  know"  (paragraph  breaks  omitted)).  The officers  also 
testified  about  their  assessment  of  Covington's  wounds.  See  id.,  at  35 
(suppression hearing testimony of Officer Brown) ("[H]e had blood . . . on 
the  front  of  his  body");  id.,  at  75  (testimony  of  Officer  McCallister)  ("It 
appeared he had a stomach wound of a gunshot"); id., at 132 (testimony of 
Officer Stuglin) ("Q Did you see the wound?  A Yes, I did.  Q You had to 
move some clothing to do that?  A Yes" (paragraph breaks omitted)).

where,  or  when  the  shooting  had  occurred.  Nor  did  they 
know  the  location  of  the  shooter  or  anything  else  about  the 
circumstances in which the crime occurred.19  The questions 
they  asked--"what  had  happened,  who  had  shot  him,  and 
where  the  shooting  had  occurred,"  483  Mich.,  at  143,  768 
N. W. 2d, at 71--were the exact type of questions necessary 
to  allow  the  police  to  " `assess  the  situation,  the  threat  to 
their  own  safety,  and  possible  danger  to  the  potential  vic-
tim' " and to the public, Davis, 547 U. S., at 832 (quoting Hii-
bel v.  Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., 542 
U. S.  177,  186  (2004)),  including  to  allow  them  to  ascertain 
"whether  they  would  be  encountering  a  violent  felon," 20 
Davis,  547  U. S.,  at  827.  In  other  words,  they  solicited  the 
information  necessary  to  enable  them  "to  meet  an  ongoing 
emergency."  Id., at 822. 

19 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 386, and despite the fact 
that the record was developed prior to Davis' focus on the existence of an 
"ongoing emergency," the record contains some testimony to support the 
idea  that  the  police  officers  were  concerned  about  the  location  of  the 
shooter when they arrived on the scene and thus to suggest that the pur-
pose of the questioning of Covington was to determine the shooter's loca-
tion.  See  App.  136  (testimony  of  Officer  Stuglin)  (stating  that  upon  ar-
rival officers questioned the gas station clerk about whether the shooting 
occurred in the gas station parking lot and about concern for safety); see 
also ibid. (testimony of Officer Stuglin) ("Q . . . So you  have some concern, 
there  may  be  a  person  with  a  gun  or  somebody,  a  shooter  right  there  in 
the immediate area?  A Sure, yes.  Q And you want to see that that area 
gets  secured?  A  Correct.  Q  For  your  safety  as  well  as  everyone  else? 
A  Correct"  (paragraph  breaks  omitted));  id.,  at  82  (testimony  of  Officer 
McCallister).  But see id., at 83 (cross-examination of Officer McCallister) 
("Q  You  didn't,  you  didn't  look  around  and  say,  gee,  there  might  be  a 
shooter around  here,  I  better  keep  an eye open?  A  I  did  not, no.  That 
could  have  been  my  partner  I  don't  know"  (paragraph  breaks  omitted)). 

20 Hiibel,  like  our  post-Crawford  Confrontation  Clause  cases,  involved

victim  and  the  police:  They  were  the  only  parties  potentially  threatened

tic assault").

Opinion of the Court 
Nothing  in  Covington's  responses  indicated  to  the  police that, contrary to their expectation upon responding to a call 

reporting a shooting, there was no emergency or that a prior emergency  had  ended.  Covington  did  indicate  that  he  had 
been  shot  at  another  location  about  25  minutes  earlier,  but he  did  not  know  the  location  of  the  shooter  at  the  time  the 
police  arrived  and,  as  far  as  we  can  tell  from  the  record,  he 
gave no indication that the shooter, having shot at him twice, would  be  satisfied  that  Covington  was  only  wounded.  In 

fact,  Covington  did  not  indicate  any  possible  motive  for  the shooting,  and  thereby  gave  no  reason  to  think  that  the 
shooter would not shoot again if he arrived on the scene.  As 
we noted in Davis, "initial inquiries" may "often . . . produce 
nontestimonial statements."  Id., at 832.  The initial inquir-
ies  in  this  case  resulted  in  the  type  of nontestimonial  state-
ments we contemplated in Davis. 

Finally,  we  consider  the  informality  of  the  situation  and 
the interrogation.  This situation is more similar, though not 
identical,  to  the  informal,  harried  911  call  in  Davis  than  to 
the  structured,  station-house  interview  in  Crawford.  As 
the  officers'  trial  testimony  reflects,  the  situation  was  fluid 
and  somewhat  confused:  The  officers  arrived  at  different 
times; apparently each, upon arrival, asked Covington "what 
happened?";  and,  contrary  to  the  dissent's  portrayal,  post, 
at  386-387, they  did  not  conduct a  structured interrogation. 
App.  84 (testimony  of  Officer McCallister)  (explaining  dupli-
cate  questioning,  especially  as  to  "what  happened?");  id.,  at 
101-102 (testimony of Sgt. Wenturine) (same); id., at 126-127 
(testimony  of  Officer  Stuglin)  (same).  The  informality  sug-
gests that the interrogators' primary purpose was simply to 
address  what  they  perceived  to  be  an  ongoing  emergency, 
and the circumstances lacked any formality that would have 
alerted  Covington  to  or  focused  him  on  the  possible  future 
prosecutorial use of his statements. 

Because the circumstances of the encounter as well as the 
statements  and  actions  of  Covington  and  the  police  objec-

have "privacy rights" that warrant protection under Exemp-

firms,  partnerships,  societies,  and  joint  stock  companies,  as well as individuals").  But AT&T's effort to ascribe a corre-
sponding legal meaning to "personal" again elides the differ-ence between "person" and "personal." 

When  it comes  to the  word  "personal,"  there  is  little  sup-
port  for  the  notion  that  it  denotes  corporations,  even  in  the legal context.  AT&T notes that corporations are "protected

tion 4 pertains to "trade secrets and commercial or financial information  obtained  from  a  person  and  privileged  or  con-

fidential."  5 U. S. C. $ 552(b)(4).  This clearly applies to cor-porations--it uses the defined term "person" to describe the 
source of the  information--and we far  more readily think of corporations  as  having  "privileged  or  confidential"  docu-
ments  than  personally  private  ones.  So  at  the  time  Con-gress  enacted  Exemption  7(C),  it  had  in  place  an  exemption 
that plainly covered a corporation's commercial and financial information,  and another  that we have described  as relating 
to  "individuals."  The  language  of  Exemption  7(C)  tracks the latter. 

The  Government  has  long  interpreted  the  phrase  "per-sonal privacy" in Exemption 7(C) accordingly.  Shortly after 
Congress passed the 1974 amendments that enacted Exemp-tion 7(C), the Attorney General issued a memorandum to ex-
ecutive  departments  and  agencies  explaining  that  "personal privacy" in that exemption "pertains to the privacy interests 
of  individuals."  U.  S.  Dept.  of  Justice,  Attorney  General's Memorandum  on  the  1974  Amendments  to  the  Freedom  of 
Information Act 9, reprinted in House Committee on Govern-ment  Operations  and  Senate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary, 
Freedom of Information Act and Amendments of 1974 (Pub. L. 93-502), 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 507, 519 (Joint Comm. Print 
1975).  The  exemption,  the  Attorney  General  noted,  "does not seem applicable to corporations or other entities."

process,  claiming  that  Mulally  had  fabricated  the  allegation underlying  the Corrective Action out  of hostility toward his

action  would  have  been  taken  in  the  absence  of  such membership."  $ 4311(c). 

The  statute  is  very  similar  to  Title  VII,  which  prohibits employment  discrimination  "because  of  .  .  .  race,  color,  reli-
gion,  sex,  or  national  origin"  and  states  that  such  discrim-ination is established when one of those factors "was a moti-
vating  factor  for  any  employment  practice,  even  though other  factors  also  motivated  the  practice."  42  U. S. C. 

$ 2000e-2(a), (m). The central difficulty in this case is  construing the phrase 
"motivating  factor  in  the  employer's  action."  When  the company  official  who  makes  the  decision  to  take  an  adverse 
employment action is personally acting out of hostility to the employee's membership in or obligation to a uniformed serv-
ice,  a  motivating  factor  obviously  exists.  The  problem  we confront  arises  when  that  official  has  no  discriminatory  ani-
mus but is influenced by previous company action that is the product of a like animus in someone else. 

In  approaching  this  question,  we  start  from  the  premise that when Congress creates a federal tort it adopts the back-
ground of general tort law.  See Burlington

animus  on  the  part  of  the  firing  agent,  but  partly  on  the basis  of  a  report  prompted  (unbeknownst  to  that  agent)  by 

discrimination, discrimination might perhaps be called a "fac-tor" or a "causal factor" in the decision; but it seems to us a 
considerable stretch to call it "a motivating factor." Proctor,  on  the  other  hand,  contends  that  the  employer  is 
not  liable  unless  the  de

Opinion of the Court 
Thus,  if  the  employer's  investigation  results  in  an  adverse action  for  reasons  unrelated  to  the  supervisor's  original  bi-

ased  action  (by  the  terms  of  USERRA  it  is  the  employer's burden  to  establish  that),  then  the  employer  will  not  be  lia-
ble.  But the supervisor's biased report may remain a causal factor  if  the  independent  investigation  takes  it  into  account 
without determining that the adverse action was, apart from 
the supervisor's recommendation, entirely justified.  We are aware  of  no  principle  in  tort  or  agency  law  under  which  an 

employer's mere conduct of an independent investigation has a claim-preclusive effect.  Nor do we think the independent 
investigation  somehow  relieves  the  employer  of  "fault." 
The employer is at fault because one of its agents committed 
an action based on discriminatory animus that was intended 
to  cause,  and  did  in  fact  cause,  an  adverse  employment 
decision.

to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court's adjudicatory capacity, i. e., 
its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.  E. g., Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. 
Muchnick, 559 U. S. 154, 161.  Among the rules that should not be de-
scribed as jurisdictional are "claim-processing rules," which seek to pro-
mote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring parties to take cer-
tain procedural  steps at specified times.  Although filing  deadlines are 
quintessential claim-processing rules, Congress is free to attach jurisdic-
tional  consequences  to such  rules.  Arbaugh v.  Y &  H Corp.,  546 U. S. 
500,  applied  a  "readily  administrable  bright  line"  rule  to  determine 
whether Congress has done so: There must be a "clear" indication that 
Congress  wanted  the  rule  to  be  "jurisdictional."  Id.,  at  515-516. 
"[C]ontext, including this Court's interpretation of similar provisions in 
many years past, is relevant," Reed Elsevier, supra, at 168, to whether 
Congress has spoken clearly on this point.  Pp. 434-436. 

(b)  Congress did not clearly prescribe that the 120-day deadline here 
be jurisdictional.  Pp. 436-441. 

(1)  None of the precedents cited by the parties controls here.  All 
of the cases they cite--e. g., Bowles, supra; Stone v.  INS, 514 U. S. 386; 
and Bowen v.  City of New York, 476 U. S. 467--involved review by Arti-
cle  III  courts.  This  case,  by  contrast,  involves  review  by  an  Article  I 
tribunal as part of a unique administrative scheme.  Instead of applying 
a  categorical  rule  regarding  review  of  administrative  decisions,  this 
Court  attempts  to  ascertain  Congress'  intent  regarding  the  particular 
type of review at issue.  Pp. 436-438. 

(2)  Several  factors  indicate  that  the  120-day  deadline  was  not 
meant to be jurisdictional.  The terms of $ 7266(a), which sets the dead-
line,  provide  no  clear  indication  that  the  provision  was  meant  to  carry 
jurisdictional consequences.  It neither speaks in "jurisdictional terms" 
nor refers "in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court]," Zipes 
v.  Trans  World  Airlines,  Inc.,  455  U. S.  385,  394.  Nor  does  $ 7266's 
placement within the VJRA provide such an indication.  Its placement 
in a subchapter entitled "Procedure," and not in the subchapter entitled 
"Organization  and  Jurisdiction,"  suggests  that  Congress  regarded  the 
120-day limit as a claim-processing rule.  Most telling, however, are the 
singular characteristics of the review scheme that Congress created for 
adjudicating  veterans'  benefits  claims.  Congress'  longstanding  solici-
tude for veterans, United States v.  Oregon, 366 U. S. 643, 647, is plainly 
reflected in the VJRA and in subsequent laws that place a thumb on the 
scale in the  veteran's  favor  in the course  of administrative  and judicial 
review  of  VA  decisions.  The  contrast  between  ordinary  civil  litiga-
tion--which provided the context in Bowles--and the system Congress 
created for veterans is dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation suits must 
generally be commenced within a specified limitations period; the litiga-

tion is adversarial; plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their 
claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion; both 
parties  may  appeal  an  adverse  decision;  and  a  final  judgment  may  be 
reopened  only  in  narrow  circumstances.  By  contrast,  a  veteran  need 
not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period; the VA proceed-
ings  are  informal  and  nonadversarial;  and  the  VA  assists  veterans  in 
developing their supporting evidence and must give them the benefit of 
any doubt in evaluating that evidence.  A veteran who loses before the 
Board  may  obtain  review  in  the  Veterans  Court,  but  a  Board  decision 
in the veteran's favor is final.  And a veteran may reopen a claim simply 
by  presenting  new  and  material  evidence.  Rigid  jurisdictional  treat-
ment of the 120-day period would clash sharply with this scheme.  Par-
ticularly  in  light  of "the  canon  that  provisions for  benefits to  members 
of  the  Armed  Services  are to  be  construed  in  the  beneficiaries'  favor," 
King  v.  St.  Vincent's  Hospital,  502  U. S.  215,  220-221,  n.  9,  this  Court 
sees no clear indication that the 120-day limit was intended to carry the 
harsh  consequences  that  accompany  the  jurisdiction  tag.  Contrary  to 
the Government's argument, the lack of review opportunities for veter-
ans before 1988 is of little help in interpreting $ 7266(a).  Section 7266(a) 
was  enacted  as  part  of  the  VJRA,  and  that  legislation  was  decidedly 
favorable to veterans.  Pp. 438-441.

ans.2  $$ 7251, 7252(a) (2006 ed.).  While proceedings before the Veterans Court are adversarial, see $ 7263, veterans have 
a remarkable record of success before that tribunal.  Statis-tics  compiled  by  the  Veterans  Court  show  that  in  the  last 
decade,  the  court  ordered  some  form  of  relief  in  around  79 percent of its "merits decisions."

David Henderson served in the military during the Korean 
War.  In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disabil-
ity  rating  for  paranoid  schizophrenia,  and  in  2001,  he  filed  a 
claim  for  supplemental  benefits  based  on  his  need  for  inhome care.  After a VA regional office and the Board denied 
his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, 
but  he  missed  the  120-day  filing  deadline  by  15  days.  See 

$ 7266(a). 

The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson's appeal 
as  untimely.  It  concluded  that  Henderson  was  not  entitled 
to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had not shown 
that his illness had caused his tardy filing.  Later, the court 
granted Henderson's motion for reconsideration, revoked the 
dismissal,  and  set  the  case  for  argument.  While  Hender-
son's  appeal  was  pending,  however,  we  decided  Bowles  v. 
Russell,  551  U. S.  205  (2007).  In  Bowles,  we  held  that  the 
statutory limitation on the length of an extension of the time 
to file a  notice of appeal in an ordinary  civil case, 28 U. S. C. 

$ 2107(c)  (2006  ed.,  Supp.  III),  is  "jurisdictional,"  and  we 
therefore held  that a party's failure  to file a  notice of appeal 
within  that  period  could  not  be  excused  based  on  equitable 
factors, or on the opposing party's forfeiture or waiver of any 
objection to the late filing.  Bowles, supra, at 213-214. 

After  we  announced  our  decision  in  Bowles,  the  Veterans 
Court  directed  the  parties  to  brief  that  decision's  effect  on 
prior  Federal  Circuit  precedent  that  allowed  the  equitable 
tolling of the 120-day deadline for filing a notice of appeal in 
the Veterans Court.  A divided panel of the Veterans Court 
concluded  that Bowles  compelled  jurisdictional treatment  of 
the 120-day deadline and dismissed Henderson's untimely ap-

peal  for  lack  of  jurisdiction.  Henderson  v.  Peake,  22  Vet. App. 217 (2008). 

Henderson then appealed to the Federal Circuit, and a di-vided  en  banc  court  affirmed.  589  F.  3d  1201  (2009).  We 
granted certiorari.  561 U. S. 1024 (2010). 

II 
In this case, as in others that have come before us in recent years, we must decide whether a procedural rule is "jurisdic-

tional."  See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v.  Muchnick, 559 U. S. 154 (2010);  Union  Pacific  R.  Co.  v.  Locomotive  Engineers,  558 
U. S. 67 (2009);  Bowles, supra; Arbaugh v.  Y  & H Corp.,  546 U. S.  500  (2006);  Eberhart  v.  United  States,  546  U. S.  12 
(2005)  (per  curiam);  Scarborough  v.  Principi,  541  U. S.  401 (2004);  Kontrick  v.  Ryan,  540  U. S.  443  (2004).  This  ques-
tion is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance  for  judges  and  litigants.  Branding  a  rule  as 
going  to a  court's  subject-matter  jurisdiction alters  the  nor-mal  operation  of  our  adversarial  system.  Under  that  sys-
tem,  courts  are  generally  limited  to  addressing  the  claims and  arguments  advanced  by  the  parties.  See 

Sanchez-Llamas v.  Oregon, 548 U. S. 331, 356-357 (2006).  Courts do 

not  usually  raise  claims  or  arguments  on  their  own.  But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that 
they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and there-fore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that 
the  parties  either  overlook  or  elect  not  to  press.  See  Ar-
baugh, supra, at 514. Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial 

resources  and  may  unfairly  prejudice  litigants.  For  pur-poses  of  efficiency  and  fairness,  our  legal  system  is  replete 
with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at partic-ular  times.  See 

Sanchez-Llamas,  supra,  at  356-357.  Ob-jections  to  subject-matter  jurisdiction,  however,  may  be 

raised at any time.  Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move  to  dismiss  the  case  because  the  trial  court  lacked 

435 Cite as: 562 U. S. 428 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
subject-matter  jurisdiction.  Arbaugh,  546  U. S.,  at  508. Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if the party 

had  previously  acknowledged  the  trial  court's  jurisdiction. 
Ibid.  And  if  the  trial  court  lacked  jurisdiction,  many 
months  of  work  on  the  part  of  the  attorneys  and  the  court may be wasted. 

Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional 
label  may  be  so  drastic,  we  have  tried  in  recent  cases  to bring  some  discipline  to  the  use  of  this  term.  We  have 

urged  that  a  rule  should  not  be  referred  to  as  jurisdictional unless  it  governs  a  court's  adjudicatory  capacity,  that  is,  its 
subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.  Reed Elsevier, 
supra,  at  161;  Kontrick,  supra,  at  455.  Other  rules,  even 
if  important  and  mandatory,  we  have  said,  should  not  be 
given the jurisdictional brand.  See Union Pacific, 558 U. S., 
at 81. 

Among  the  types  of  rules  that  should  not  be  described 
as  jurisdictional  are  what  we  have  called  "claim-processing 
rules."  These  are  rules  that  seek  to  promote  the  orderly 
progress of litigation  by requiring  that the  parties take cer-
tain  procedural  steps  at  certain  specified  times.  Id.,  at 
83-84;  Eberhart,  supra,  at  19;  Scarborough,  supra,  at  413- 
414; Kontrick,  supra,  at  455-456.  Filing deadlines, such  as 
the  120-day  filing  deadline  at  issue  here,  are  quintessential 
claim-processing  rules.  Accordingly,  if  we  were  simply  to 
apply the strict definition of jurisdiction that we have recom-
mended in our recent cases, we would reverse the decision of 
the Federal Circuit, and this opinion could end at this point. 

Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that sim-
ple because Congress is free to attach the conditions that go 
with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to 
call a claim-processing rule.  See Bowles, supra, at 212-213. 
The question here, therefore, is whether Congress mandated 
that  the  120-day  deadline  be  "jurisdictional."  In  Arbaugh, 
we applied  a "readily  administrable  bright  line"  rule  for de-
ciding  such  questions.  546  U. S.,  at  515-516.  Under  Ar-

436  HENDERSON  v.  SHINSEKI 

Opinion of the Court 
baugh,  we  look  to  see  if  there  is  any  "clear"  indication  that Congress  wanted  the  rule  to  be  "jurisdictional."  Ibid. 

This approach is suited to capture Congress' likely intent and also  provides  helpful  guidance  for  courts  and  litigants,  who 
will be "duly instructed" regarding a rule's nature.  See id., at 514-515, and n. 11. 

Congress,  of  course,  need  not  use  magic  words  in  order to  speak  clearly  on  this  point.  "[C]ontext,  including  this 
Court's  interpretation  of  similar  provisions  in  many  years past,  is  relevant." 

Reed  Elsevier,  supra,  at  168.  When "a long line of this Court's decisions left undisturbed by Con-

gress,"  Union  Pacific,  supra,  at  82,  has  treated  a  similar requirement  as  "jurisdictional,"  we  will  presume  that  Con-
gress  intended  to  follow  that  course.  See  John  R.  Sand  & 
Gravel  Co.  v.  United  States,  552  U. S.  130,  133-134,  139 (2008). 

III 
With  these  principles  in  mind,  we  consider  whether  Con-gress  clearly  prescribed  that  the  deadline  for  filing  a  notice 

of appeal with the Veterans Court should be "jurisdictional." 

A 
Contending  that  the  120-day  filing  deadline  was  meant  to be  jurisdictional,  the  Government  maintains  that  Bowles  is 

controlling.  The Government reads Bowles to mean that all statutory deadlines for taking appeals in civil cases are juris-
dictional.  Since  $ 7266(a)  establishes  a  statutory  deadline for taking an appeal in a civil case, the Government reasons, 
that deadline is jurisdictional. We  reject  the  major  premise  of  this  syllogism. 

Bowles did  not  hold  categorically  that  every  deadline  for  seeking 

judicial  review  in  civil  litigation  is  jurisdictional.  Instead, 
Bowles concerned an appeal from one court to another court. The "century's worth of precedent and practice in American 

courts" on which Bowles relied involved appeals of that type. See 551 U. S., at 209-210, and n. 2. 

437 Cite as: 562 U. S. 428 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
Contending that  Bowles' reasoning extends to the judicial review of administrative decisions, the Government relies on 

Stone v.  INS,  514  U. S.  386  (1995).  There,  without  elabora-tion,  we  described  as  " `mandatory  and  jurisdictional' "  the 
deadline  for  seeking  review  in  the  courts  of  appeals  of  final removal  orders  of  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals. 

Id., 
at 405  (quoting Missouri v.  Jenkins, 495  U. S. 33,  45 (1990)). 
The  Government  also  notes  that  lower  court  decisions  have uniformly  held  that  the  Hobbs  Act's  60-day  time  limit  for 

filing  a  petition  for  review  of  certain  final  agency  decisions, 28 U. S. C. $ 2344, is jurisdictional.  Brief for Respondent 18. 

Petitioner  correctly  observes,  however,  that  Veterans 
Court  review  of  a  VA  decision  denying  benefits  differs  in 
many  respects  from  court  of  appeals  review  of  an  agency 
decision under the Hobbs Act.  Cf. Shinseki v.  Sanders, 556 
U. S. 396, 412 (2009) ("Congress has made clear that the VA is 
not an ordinary agency").  And there is force to petitioner's 
argument  that  a  more  appropriate  analog  is  judicial  review 
of an administrative decision denying Social Security disabil-
ity  benefits.  The  Social  Security  disability  benefits  pro-
gram,  like  the  veterans  benefits  program,  is  "unusually  pro-
tective"  of  claimants,  Heckler  v.  Day,  467  U. S.  104,  106-107 
(1984).  See also Sims v.  Apfel, 530 U. S. 103, 110-112 (2000) 
(plurality  opinion).  Indeed,  the  Government  acknowledges 
that "the Social Security and veterans-benefit review mecha-
nisms  share  significant  common  attributes."  Brief  for  Re-
spondent 16.  And long before Congress enacted the VJRA, 
we held that the deadline for obtaining review of Social Secu-
rity benefits decisions in district court, 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g), is 
not  jurisdictional.  Bowen  v.  City  of  New  York,  476  U. S. 
467, 478, and n. 10 (1986); Mathews v.  Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 
328,  n.  9  (1976);  Weinberger  v.  Salfi,  422  U. S.  749,  763-764 
(1975). 

In  the  end,  however,  none  of  the  precedents  cited  by  the 
parties  controls  our  decision  here.  All  of  those  cases  in-
volved review by Article III courts.  This case, by contrast, 

438  HENDERSON  v.  SHINSEKI 

Opinion of the Court 
involves  review  by  an  Article  I  tribunal  as  part  of  a  unique administrative  scheme.  Instead  of  applying  a  categorical 

rule  regarding  review  of  administrative  decisions,  we  at-tempt to ascertain Congress' intent regarding the particular 
type of review at issue in this case. 

B 
Several  factors  convince  us  that  the  120-day  deadline  for seeking Veterans Court review was not meant to have juris-

dictional attributes. The  terms  of  the  provision  setting  that  deadline,  38 
U. S. C. $ 7266(a), do not suggest, much less provide clear evi-dence,  that  the  provision  was  meant  to  carry  jurisdictional 
consequences.  Section 7266(a) provides: 

"In  order  to  obtain  review  by  the  Court  of  Appeals for  Veterans  Claims  of  a  final  decision  of  the  Board  of 

Veterans'  Appeals,  a  person  adversely  affected  by  such decision  shall  file  a  notice  of  appeal  with  the  Court 
within  120  days  after  the  date  on  which  notice  of  the decision  is  mailed  pursuant  to  section  7104(e)  of  this 
title." 
This  provision  "does  not  speak  in  jurisdictional  terms  or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the [Veterans Court]," 

Zipes v.  Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982). If  Congress  had  wanted  the  120-day  time  to  be  treated  as 
jurisdictional,  it  could  have  cast  that  provision  in  language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal 
Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court.  This lat-ter provision states that Federal Circuit review must be ob-
tained  "within  the  time  and  in  the  manner  prescribed  for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States 
district courts."  $ 7292(a).  Because the  time  for taking an appeal  from  a  district  court  to  a  court  of  appeals  in  a  civil 
case  has  long  been  understood  to  be  jurisdictional,  see 
Bowles,  supra,  at  209-210,  and  n.  2,  this  language  clearly 

439 Cite as: 562 U. S. 428 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
signals  an intent to impose  the same restrictions on appeals 
from  the  Veterans  Court  to  the  Federal  Circuit.  But  the 
120-day limit at issue in this case is not framed in comparable 
terms.  It is true that $ 7266 is cast in mandatory language, 
but  we  have  rejected  the  notion  that  "all  mandatory  pre-
scriptions,  however  emphatic,  are  .  .  .  properly  typed  juris-
dictional."  Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at 81 (quoting Arbaugh, 
546  U. S.,  at  510;  internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Thus, 
the language of $ 7266 provides no clear indication that Con-
gress wanted that provision to be treated as having jurisdic-
tional attributes. 

Nor does $ 7266's placement within the VJRA provide such 
an  indication.  Congress  placed  $ 7266,  numbered  $ 4066  in 
the  enacting  legislation,  in  a  subchapter  entitled  "Proce-
dure."  See  VJRA  $ 301,  102  Stat.  4113,  4115-4116.  That 
placement  suggests  Congress  regarded  the  120-day  limit  as 
a claim-processing rule.  Cf. INS v.  National Center for Im-
migrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 189 (1991) ("[T]he title 
of  a  statute  or  section  can  aid  in  resolving  an  ambiguity  in 
the  legislation's  text").  Congress  elected  not  to  place  the 
120-day limit in the VJRA subchapter entitled "Organization 
and Jurisdiction."  See 102 Stat. 4113-4115. 

Within  that  subchapter,  a  separate  provision,  captioned 
"Jurisdiction;  finality  of  decisions,"  prescribes  the  jurisdic-
tion  of  the  Veterans  Court.  Id.,  at  4113-4114.  Subsection 
(a) of that provision, numbered $ 4052 in the enacting legisla-
tion, grants the Veterans Court "exclusive jurisdiction to re-
view  decisions  of  the  Board  of  Veterans'  Appeals"  and  the 
"power  to  affirm,  modify,  or  reverse  a  decision  of  the  Board 
or  to  remand  the  matter,  as  appropriate."  Id.,  at  4113.  It 
also prohibits the court from hearing appeals by the VA Sec-
retary.  Subsection (b) limits the court's review to "the rec-
ord  of  proceedings  before  the  [VA],"  specifies  the  scope  of 
that  review,  and  precludes  review  of  the  VA's  disability  rat-
ings  schedule.  Ibid.  Nothing  in  this  provision  or  in  the 

440  HENDERSON  v.  SHINSEKI 

Opinion of the Court 
"Organization  and  Jurisdiction"  subchapter  addresses  the 
time for seeking Veterans Court review. 

While the terms and placement of $ 7266 provide some in-
dication of Congress' intent, what is most telling here are the 
singular  characteristics of the  review  scheme  that Congress 
created  for  the  adjudication  of  veterans'  benefits  claims. 
"The solicitude of Congress for veterans is of long standing." 
United  States  v.  Oregon,  366  U. S.  643,  647  (1961);  see  also 
Sanders, 556 U. S., at 412.  And that solicitude is plainly re-
flected  in  the  VJRA,  as  well  as  in  subsequent  laws  that 
"place  a  thumb  on  the  scale  in  the  veteran's  favor  in  the 
course of administrative and judicial review of VA decisions," 
id.,  at  416  (Souter,  J.,  dissenting).  See,  e. g.,  Veterans 
Claims Assistance Act of 2000, 114 Stat. 2096; Act of Nov. 21, 
1997, 111 Stat. 2271; VJRA $ 103, 102 Stat. 4106-4107. 

The contrast between ordinary civil litigation--which pro-
vided the context of our decision in Bowles--and the system 
that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans' bene-
fits claims could hardly be more dramatic.  In ordinary civil 
litigation,  plaintiffs  must  generally  commence  their  suits 
within  the  time  specified  in  a  statute  of  limitations,  see  28 
U. S. C.  $ 1658,  and  the  litigation  is  adversarial.  Plaintiffs 
must gather the evidence that supports their claims and gen-
erally  bear  the  burden  of  production  and  persuasion.  Both 
parties  may  appeal  an  adverse  trial-court  decision,  see 

$ 1291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow 
circumstances.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60. 

By  contrast,  a  veteran  seeking  benefits  need  not  file  an 
initial  claim  within  any  fixed  period  after  the  alleged  onset 
of  disability  or  separation  from  service.  When  a  claim  is 
filed, proceedings before the VA are  informal and nonadver-
sarial.  The  VA  is  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  assist-
ing  veterans  in  developing  evidence  that  supports  their 
claims,  and  in  evaluating  that  evidence,  the  VA  must  give 
the veteran the benefit of any doubt.  If a veteran is unsuc-

441 Cite as: 562 U. S. 428 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
cessful  before  a  regional  office,  the  veteran  may  obtain  de 
novo review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before 
the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Vet-
erans Court.  A Board decision in the veteran's favor, on the 
other hand, is final.  And even if a veteran is denied benefits 
after  exhausting  all  avenues  of  administrative  and  judicial 
review,  a  veteran  may  reopen  a  claim  simply  by  presenting 
"new  and  material  evidence."  Rigid  jurisdictional  treat-
ment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the 
Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme. 

We have long applied "the canon that provisions for bene-
fits  to  members  of  the  Armed  Services  are  to  be  construed 
in  the  beneficiaries'  favor."  King  v.  St.  Vincent's  Hospital, 
502 U. S. 215, 220-221, n. 9 (1991); see also Coffy v.  Republic 
Steel  Corp.,  447  U. S.  191,  196  (1980);  Fishgold  v.  Sullivan 
Drydock & Repair Corp., 328 U. S. 275, 285 (1946).  Particu-
larly in light of this canon, we do not find any clear indication 
that the 120-day limit was intended to carry the harsh conse-
quences that accompany the jurisdiction tag. 

The  Government  argues  that  there  is  no  reason  to  think 
that jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent with 
a  pro-veteran  administrative  scheme  because,  prior  to  the 
enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were not sub-
ject  to  any  further  review  at  all.  Brief  for  Respondent  29. 
The provision at issue here, however, was enacted as part of 
the  VJRA,  and  that  legislation  was  decidedly  favorable  to 
veterans.  Accordingly, the review opportunities available to 
veterans  before  the  VJRA  was  enacted  are  of  little  help  in 
interpreting 38 U. S. C. $ 7266(a). 

IV 
We hold that the deadline for filing a notice of appeal with 
the  Veterans  Court  does  not  have  jurisdictional  attributes. 
The  120-day  limit  is  nevertheless  an  important  procedural

emotional distress.  Hustler Magazine, Inc. v.  Falwell, 485 U. S. 46, 50- 
51.  Whether  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  holding  Westboro  liable 
for  its  speech  in  this  case  turns  largely  on  whether  that  speech  is  of 
public  or  private  concern,  as  determined  by  all  the  circumstances  of 
the case.  "[S]peech on public issues occupies the ` "highest rung of the 
hierarchy of First Amendment values" ' and is entitled to special protec-
tion."  Connick v.  Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 145.  Although the boundaries 
of  what  constitutes  speech  on  matters  of  public  concern  are  not  well 
defined, this Court has said that speech is of public concern when it can 
"be  fairly  considered  as  relating  to  any  matter  of  political,  social,  or 
other concern to the community," id., at 146, or when it "is a subject of 
general  interest  and  of  value  and  concern  to  the  public,"  San  Diego 
v.  Roe,  543  U. S.  77,  83-84.  A  statement's  arguably  "inappropriate  or 
controversial character . . . is irrelevant to the question whether it deals 
with a matter of public concern."  Rankin v.  McPherson, 483 U. S. 378, 
387.  Pp. 451-453. 

To  determine  whether  speech  is  of  public  or  private  concern,  this 
Court  must  independently  examine  the  " `content,  form,  and  context' " 
of the speech " `as revealed by the whole record.' "  Dun & Bradstreet, 
Inc.  v.  Greenmoss  Builders,  Inc.,  472  U. S.  749,  761.  In  considering 
content,  form,  and  context,  no  factor  is  dispositive,  and  it  is  necessary 
to evaluate all aspects of the speech.  Pp. 453-454. 

The "content" of Westboro's signs plainly relates to public, rather than 
private,  matters.  The  placards  highlighted  issues  of  public  import-- 
the political and moral conduct of the United States and its citizens, the 
fate of the Nation, homosexuality in the military, and scandals involving 
the  Catholic  clergy--and  Westboro  conveyed  its  views  on  those  issues 
in  a  manner  designed  to  reach  as  broad  a  public  audience  as  possible. 
Even if a few of the signs were viewed as containing messages related 
to a particular individual, that would not change the fact that the domi-
nant  theme  of  Westboro's  demonstration  spoke  to  broader  public  is-
sues.  P. 454. 

The  "context"  of  the  speech--its  connection  with  Matthew  Snyder's 
funeral--cannot  by  itself  transform  the  nature  of  Westboro's  speech. 
The signs reflected Westboro's condemnation of much in modern society, 
and  it  cannot  be  argued  that Westboro's  use  of  speech  on public  issues 
was in any way contrived to insulate a personal attack on Snyder from 
liability.  Westboro  had been  actively  engaged in  speaking  on the sub-
jects addressed in its picketing long before it became aware of Matthew 
Snyder,  and  there  can  be  no  serious  claim  that  the  picketing  did  not 
represent  Westboro's  honestly  held  beliefs  on  public  issues.  Westboro 
may have chosen the  picket location to increase publicity for its  views, 
and its speech may have been particularly hurtful to Snyder.  That does 

445 Cite as: 562 U. S. 443 (2011) 
Syllabus 
not mean that its speech should be afforded less than full First Amend-
ment protection under the circumstances of this case.  Pp. 454-456. 

That  said,  " `[e]ven  protected  speech  is  not  equally  permissible  in  all 
places and at all times.' "  Frisby v.  Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 479.  West-
boro's  choice  of where  and when to  conduct its picketing  is not beyond 
the  Government's  regulatory  reach--it  is  "subject  to  reasonable  time, 
place,  or  manner  restrictions."  Clark  v.  Community  for  Creative 
Non-Violence,  468  U. S.  288,  293.  The  facts  here  are  quite  different, 
however,  both  with  respect  to  the  activity  being  regulated  and  the 
means  of  restricting  those  activities,  from  the  few  limited  situations 
where  the  Court  has  concluded  that  the  location  of  targeted  picketing 
can  be  properly  regulated  under  provisions  deemed  content  neutral. 
Frisby, supra, at 477; Madsen v.  Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 
753,  768,  distinguished.  Maryland  now  has  a  law  restricting  funeral 
picketing, but that law was not in effect at the time of these events, so 
this Court has no occasion to consider whether that law is a "reasonable 
time, place, or manner restrictio[n]" under the standards announced by 
this Court.  Clark, supra, at 293.  Pp. 456-457. 

The "special protection" afforded to what Westboro said, in the whole 
context  of  how  and  where  it  chose  to  say  it,  cannot  be  overcome  by  a 
jury finding that the picketing was "outrageous" for purposes of apply-
ing  the  state  law  tort  of  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress. 
That would pose too great a danger that the jury would punish Westboro 
for  its  views  on  matters  of  public  concern.  For  all  these  reasons,  the 
jury verdict imposing tort liability on Westboro for intentional infliction 
of emotional distress must be set aside.  Pp. 458-459. 

(b)  Snyder also may not recover for the tort of intrusion upon seclu-
sion.  He  argues  that  he  was  a  member  of  a  captive  audience  at  his 
son's funeral, but the captive audience doctrine--which has been applied 
sparingly, see Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 736-738; Frisby, 
supra,  at  484-485--should  not  be expanded  to  the  circumstances  here. 
Westboro  stayed  well  away  from  the  memorial  service,  Snyder  could 
see  no  more  than  the  tops  of  the  picketers'  signs,  and  there  is  no  in-
dication  that  the  picketing  interfered  with  the  funeral  service  itself. 
Pp. 459-460. 

(c)  Because  the First  Amendment  bars  Snyder from  recovery  for in-
tentional  infliction  of  emotional  distress  or  intrusion  upon  seclusion-- 
the allegedly unlawful activity Westboro conspired to accomplish--Sny-
der also cannot recover for civil conspiracy based on those torts.  P. 460. 

(d)  Westboro  addressed  matters  of  public  import  on  public  property, 
in a  peaceful  manner,  in full compliance  with the guidance  of  local  offi-
cials.  It  did  not  disrupt  Matthew  Snyder's  funeral,  and  its  choice  to 
picket  at  that  time  and  place  did  not  alter  the  nature  of  its  speech. 

446  SNYDER  v.  PHELPS

Because this Nation has chosen to protect even hurtful speech on public 
issues  to  ensure  that  public  debate  is  not  stifled,  Westboro  must  be

448  SNYDER  v.  PHELPS 

Opinion of the Court 

I  
A  

Fred  Phelps  founded  the  Westboro  Baptist  Church  in  To-
peka,  Kansas,  in  1955.  The  church's  congregation  believes 
that  God  hates  and  punishes  the  United  States  for  its  toler-
ance  of  homosexuality,  particularly  in  America's  military. 
The church  frequently  communicates  its  views  by  picketing, 
often  at  military  funerals.  In  the  more  than  20  years  that 
the members of Westboro Baptist have publicized their mes-
sage,  they  have  picketed  nearly  600  funerals.  Brief  for 
Rutherford Institute as Amicus Curiae 7, n. 14. 

Marine Lance Corporal Matthew Snyder was killed in Iraq 
in the line of duty.  Lance Corporal Snyder's father selected 
the  Catholic  church  in  the  Snyders'  hometown  of  Westmin-
ster, Maryland, as the site for his son's funeral.  Local news-
papers provided notice of the time and location of the service. 

Phelps became aware of Matthew Snyder's funeral and de-
cided to travel to Maryland with six other Westboro Baptist 
parishioners (two of his daughters and four of his grandchil-
dren)  to  picket.  On  the  day  of  the  memorial  service,  the 
Westboro congregation members picketed on public land ad-
jacent  to  public  streets  near  the  Maryland  State  House, 
the  United  States  Naval  Academy,  and  Matthew  Snyder's 
funeral.  The  Westboro  picketers  carried  signs  that  were 
largely the  same at all three locations.  They stated, for  in-
stance: "God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11," "America 
is  Doomed,"  "Don't  Pray  for  the  USA,"  "Thank  God  for 
IEDs,"  "Thank  God  for  Dead  Soldiers,"  "Pope  in  Hell," 
"Priests  Rape  Boys,"  "God  Hates  Fags,"  "You're  Going  to 
Hell," and "God Hates You." 

The  church  had  notified  the  authorities  in  advance  of  its 
intent to picket at the time  of the funeral, and the picketers 
complied with police instructions in staging their demonstra-
tion.  The  picketing  took  place  within  a  10- by  25-foot  plot 
of public land adjacent to a public street, behind a temporary

fence.  App.  to  Brief  for  Appellants  in  No.  08-1026  (CA4), pp.  2282-2285  (hereinafter  App.).  That  plot  was  approxi-

mately  1,000  feet  from  the  church  where  the  funeral  was held.  Several  buildings  separated  the  picket  site  from  the 
church.  Id.,  at  3758.  The  Westboro  picketers  displayed their signs for about 30 minutes before the funeral began and 
sang hymns and recited Bible verses.  None of the picketers entered church property or went to the cemetery.  They did 
not  yell  or  use  profanity,  and  there  was  no  violence  associ-ated with the picketing. 

Id., at 2168, 2371, 2286, 2293. The funeral procession passed within 200 to 300 feet of the 

picket site.  Although Snyder testified that he could see the tops of the picket signs as he drove to the funeral, he did not 
see  what  was  written  on  the  signs  until  later  that  night, while  watching  a  news  broadcast  covering  the  event. 

Id., at 2084-2086.

Snyder  filed  suit  against  Phelps,  Phelps's  daughters,  and the  Westboro  Baptist  Church  (collectively  Westboro  or  the 

1 A few weeks  after the funeral, one of the picketers  posted  a message 
on Westboro's Web site discussing the picketing and containing religiously 
oriented  denunciations of the  Snyders, interspersed among  lengthy Bible 
quotations.  Snyder discovered the posting, referred to by the parties as 
the "epic," during an Internet search for his son's name.  The epic is not 
properly before us and does not factor in our analysis.  Although the epic 
was submitted to the jury and discussed in the courts below, Snyder never 
mentioned it in his petition for certiorari.  See Pet. for Cert. i ("Snyder's 
claim arose out of Phelps' intentional acts at Snyder's son's funeral" (em-
phasis added)); this Court's Rule 14.1(g) (petition must contain statement 
"setting out the facts material to consideration of the question presented"). 
Nor  did  Snyder  respond  to  the  statement  in  the  opposition  to  certiorari 
that "[t]hough the epic was asserted as a basis for the claims at trial, the 
petition . . .  appears to be addressing only claims based on the picketing." 
Brief  in  Opposition  9.  Snyder  devoted  only  one  paragraph  in  the  argu-
ment section of his opening merits brief to the epic.  Given the foregoing 
and  the  fact  that  an  Internet  posting  may  raise  distinct  issues  in  this 
context, we decline to consider the epic in deciding this case.  See Ontario 
v.  Quon, 560 U. S. 746, 759-760 (2010).

Opinion of the Court 
church)  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  District of  Maryland  under  that  court's  diversity  jurisdiction.  Sny-

der  alleged  five  state  tort  law  claims:  defamation,  publicity given  to  private  life,  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  dis-
tress,  intrusion  upon  seclusion,  and  civil  conspiracy.  West-boro moved for summary judgment contending, in part, that 
the church's speech was insulated from liability by the First 
Amendment.  See 533 F. Supp. 2d 567, 570 (2008). The District Court awarded Westboro summary judgment 

on Snyder's claims for defamation and publicity given to pri-vate  life,  concluding  that  Snyder  could  not  prove  the  neces-
sary  elements  of  those  torts.  Id.,  at  572-573.  A  trial  was 
held  on  the  remaining  claims.  At  trial,  Snyder  described 
the  severity  of  his  emotional  injuries.  He  testified  that  he 
is  unable  to  separate  the  thought  of  his  dead  son  from  his 
thoughts of Westboro's picketing, and that he often becomes 
tearful,  angry,  and  physically  ill  when  he  thinks  about  it. 
Id.,  at  588-589.  Expert  witnesses  testified  that  Snyder's 
emotional anguish had resulted in severe depression and had 
exacerbated pre-existing health conditions. 

A  jury  found  for  Snyder  on  the  intentional  infliction  of 
emotional  distress,  intrusion  upon  seclusion,  and  civil  con-
spiracy  claims,  and  held  Westboro  liable  for  $2.9  million  in 
compensatory  damages  and  $8  million  in  punitive  damages. 
Westboro filed several post-trial motions, including a motion 
contending that the jury verdict was grossly excessive and a 
motion seeking judgment as a matter of law on all claims on 
First  Amendment  grounds.  The  District  Court  remitted 
the punitive damages award to $2.1 million, but left the jury 
verdict otherwise intact.  Id., at 597. 

In  the  Court  of  Appeals,  Westboro's  primary  argument 
was that the church was entitled to judgment as a matter of 
law  because  the  First  Amendment  fully  protected  West-
boro's speech.  The Court of Appeals agreed.  580 F. 3d 206, 
221  (CA4  2009).  The  court  reviewed  the  picket  signs  and 
concluded that Westboro's statements were entitled  to First

Opinion of the Court 
Amendment  protection  because  those  statements  were  on matters  of  public  concern,  were  not  provably  false,  and 

were  expressed  solely  through  hyperbolic  rhetoric.  Id.,  at 222-224.

We granted certiorari.  559 U. S. 990 (2010). 

II 
To succeed on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress  in  Maryland,  a  plaintiff  must  demonstrate  that  the 

defendant intentionally or recklessly engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct that caused the plaintiff to suffer severe 
emotional  distress.  See  Harris v.  Jones,  281  Md.  560,  565- 566,  380  A.  2d  611,  614  (1977).  The  Free  Speech  Clause  of 
the  First  Amendment--"Congress  shall  make  no  law  .  .  . abridging the freedom of speech"--can serve as a defense in 
state  tort  suits,  including  suits  for  intentional  infliction  of emotional distress.  See, e. g., Hustler Magazine, Inc. v.  Fal-
well, 485 U. S. 46, 50-51 (1988).3 Whether  the  First  Amendment  prohibits  holding  West-
boro liable for its speech in this case turns largely on whether that speech is of public or private concern, as determined by 
all  the  circumstances  of  the  case.  "[S]peech  on  `matters  of public concern' . . . is `at the heart of the First Amendment's 

2 One  judge  concurred  in  the  judgment  on  the  ground  that  Snyder  had 
failed  to  introduce  sufficient  evidence  at  trial  to  support  a  jury  verdict 
on  any  of  his  tort  claims.  580  F.  3d,  at  227  (opinion  of  Shedd,  J.).  The 
Court of Appeals majority determined that the picketers had "voluntarily 
waived"  any  such  contention  on  appeal.  Id.,  at  216.  Like  the  court 
below,  we  proceed  on  the  unexamined  premise  that  respondents'  speech 
was tortious.

protection.' "  Dun  &  Bradstreet,  Inc.  v.  Greenmoss  Build-
ers,  Inc., 472  U. S.  749, 758-759  (1985)  (opinion  of Powell,  J.) 
(quoting First Nat. Bank of Boston v.  Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 776  (1978)).  The First Amendment reflects "a profound  na-

tional  commitment  to  the  principle  that  debate  on  public  is-sues  should  be  uninhibited,  robust,  and  wide-open." 

New 
York  Times Co. v.  Sullivan,  376 U. S. 254, 270  (1964).  That 
is  because  "speech  concerning  public  affairs  is  more  than self-expression;  it  is  the  essence  of  self-government." 

Gar-
rison v.  Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 74-75 (1964).  Accordingly, "speech on public issues occupies the highest rung of the hi-

erarchy of First Amendment values, and is entitled to special 
protection."  Connick v.  Myers, 461 U. S. 138, 145 (1983) (in-

ternal quotation marks omitted). 

" `[N]ot  all  speech  is  of  equal  First  Amendment  impor-
tance,' "  however,  and  where  matters  of  purely  private  sig-
nificance are at issue, First Amendment protections are often 
less  rigorous.  Hustler,  supra,  at  56  (quoting  Dun  &  Brad-
street, supra, at 758); see Connick, supra, at 145-147.  That 
is because restricting speech on purely private matters does 
not  implicate  the  same  constitutional  concerns  as  limiting 
speech  on  matters  of  public  interest:  "[T]here  is  no  threat 
to  the  free  and  robust  debate  of  public  issues;  there  is  no 
potential  interference  with  a  meaningful  dialogue  of  ideas"; 
and  the  "threat  of  liability"  does  not  pose  the  risk  of 
"a  reaction  of  self-censorship"  on  matters  of  public  import. 
Dun  &  Bradstreet,  supra,  at  760  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted). 

We  noted  a  short  time  ago,  in  considering  whether  public 
employee  speech  addressed  a  matter  of  public  concern,  that 
"the  boundaries  of  the  public  concern  test  are  not  well  de-
fined."  San  Diego  v.  Roe,  543  U. S.  77,  83  (2004)  (per  cu-
riam).  Although  that  remains  true  today,  we  have  articu-
lated  some  guiding  principles,  principles  that  accord  broad 
protection to speech to ensure that courts themselves do not 
become inadvertent censors.

Opinion of the Court 
Speech  deals  with  matters  of  public  concern  when  it  can "be  fairly  considered  as  relating  to  any  matter  of  political, 

social,  or  other  concern  to  the  community,"  Connick,  supra, at  146,  or  when  it  "is  a  subject  of  legitimate  news  interest; 
that is, a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public," 

San Diego, supra, at 83-84.  See Cox Broad-
casting  Corp.  v.  Cohn,  420  U. S.  469,  492-494  (1975);  Time, 
Inc. v.  Hill, 385 U. S. 374, 387-388 (1967).  The arguably "in-appropriate or controversial character of a statement is irrel-

evant to the question whether it deals with a matter of public concern." 

Rankin  v.  McPherson,  483  U. S.  378,  387  (1987). 
Our opinion in  Dun  &  Bradstreet, on  the other  hand, pro-
vides an example of speech of only private concern.  In that 
case  we  held,  as  a  general  matter,  that  information  about 
a  particular  individual's  credit  report  "concerns  no  public 
issue."  472 U. S., at 762.  The content of the report, we ex-
plained,  "was  speech  solely  in  the  individual  interest  of  the 
speaker  and  its  specific  business  audience."  Ibid.  That 
was confirmed by the fact that the particular report was sent 
to  only  five  subscribers  to  the  reporting  service,  who  were 
bound  not  to  disseminate  it  further.  Ibid.  To  cite  another 
example, we concluded in San Diego v.  Roe that,  in the con-
text  of  a  government  employer  regulating  the  speech  of  its 
employees,  videos  of  an  employee  engaging  in  sexually  ex-
plicit  acts  did  not  address  a  public  concern;  the  videos  "did 
nothing to inform the public about any aspect of the [employ-
ing agency's] functioning or operation."  543 U. S., at 84. 

Deciding  whether  speech  is  of  public  or  private  concern 
requires us to examine the " `content, form, and context' " of 
that  speech,  " `as  revealed  by  the  whole  record.' "  Dun  & 
Bradstreet,  supra,  at  761  (quoting  Connick,  supra,  at  147- 
148).  As in other First Amendment cases, the court is obli-
gated  "to  `make  an  independent  examination  of  the  whole 
record'  in  order  to  make  sure  that  `the  judgment  does  not 
constitute  a  forbidden  intrusion  on  the  field  of  free  expres-
sion.' "  Bose  Corp.  v.  Consumers  Union  of  United  States, 

454  SNYDER  v.  PHELPS 

Opinion of the Court 
Inc.,  466  U. S.  485,  499  (1984)  (quoting  New  York  Times, 
supra,  at  284-286).  In  considering  content,  form,  and  con-
text,  no  factor  is  dispositive,  and  it  is  necessary  to  evaluate all the circumstances of the speech, including what was said, 

where it was said, and how it was said. The "content"  of Westboro's  signs  plainly  relates to broad 
issues  of  interest  to  society  at  large,  rather  than  matters  of 
"purely private concern."  Dun & Bradstreet, supra, at 759. The placards read "God Hates the USA/Thank God for 9/11," 

"America  is  Doomed,"  "Don't  Pray  for  the  USA,"  "Thank God for IEDs," "Fag Troops," "Semper Fi Fags," "God Hates 
Fags,"  "Maryland  Taliban,"  "Fags  Doom  Nations,"  "Not 
Blessed Just Cursed," "Thank God for Dead Soldiers," "Pope 
in  Hell,"  "Priests  Rape  Boys,"  "You're  Going  to  Hell,"  and 
"God  Hates  You."  App.  3781-3787.  While  these  messages 
may  fall  short  of  refined  social  or  political  commentary,  the 
issues they highlight--the political and moral conduct of the 
United States  and its citizens,  the  fate of our  Nation,  homo-
sexuality in the military, and scandals involving the Catholic 
clergy--are  matters  of  public  import.  The  signs  certainly 
convey  Westboro's  position  on  those  issues,  in  a  manner  de-
signed,  unlike  the  private  speech  in  Dun  &  Bradstreet,  to 
reach as broad a  public audience as possible.  And even if a 
few  of  the  signs--such  as  "You're  Going  to  Hell"  and  "God 
Hates You"--were viewed as containing messages related to 
Matthew  Snyder  or  the  Snyders  specifically,  that  would  not 
change  the  fact  that  the  overall  thrust  and  dominant  theme 
of  Westboro's  demonstration  spoke  to  broader  public  issues. 

Apart  from  the  content  of  Westboro's  signs,  Snyder  con-
tends  that  the  "context"  of  the  speech--its  connection  with 
his  son's  funeral--makes  the  speech  a  matter  of  private 
rather  than  public  concern.  The  fact  that  Westboro  spoke 
in connection with a funeral, however, cannot by itself trans-
form  the  nature  of  Westboro's  speech.  Westboro's  signs, 
displayed  on  public  land  next  to  a  public  street,  reflect  the 
fact  that  the  church  finds  much  to  condemn  in  modern

Opinion of the Court 
society.  Its  speech  is  "fairly  characterized  as  constituting speech on a matter of public concern," 

Connick, 461 U. S., at 
146,  and  the  funeral  setting  does  not  alter  that  conclusion. Snyder  argues  that  the  church  members  in  fact  mounted 

a  personal  attack  on  Snyder  and  his  family,  and  then  at-tempted  to  "immunize  their  conduct  by  claiming  that  they 
were  actually  protesting  the  United  States'  tolerance  of  ho-
mosexuality  or  the  supposed  evils  of  the  Catholic  Church." Reply Brief for Petitioner 10.  We are not concerned in this 

case  that  Westboro's  speech  on  public  matters  was  in  any way  contrived  to  insulate  speech  on  a  private  matter  from 
liability.  Westboro  had  been  actively  engaged  in  speaking 
on  the  subjects  addressed  in  its  picketing  long  before  it  be-
came aware of Matthew Snyder, and there can be no serious 
claim  that  Westboro's  picketing  did  not  represent  its  "hon-
estly believed" views  on public  issues.  Garrison, 379  U. S., 
at 73.  There was no pre-existing relationship or conflict be-
tween  Westboro  and  Snyder  that  might  suggest  Westboro's 
speech on public matters was intended to mask an attack on 
Snyder over a private matter.  Contrast Connick, 461 U. S., 
at  153  (finding  public  employee  speech  a  matter  of  private 
concern  when  it  was  "no  coincidence  that  [the  speech]  fol-
lowed  upon  the  heels  of  [a]  transfer  notice"  affecting  the 
employee). 

Snyder goes on to argue that Westboro's speech should be 
afforded less than full First Amendment protection "not only 
because of the words" but also because the church members 
exploited  the  funeral  "as  a  platform  to  bring  their  message 
to  a  broader  audience."  Brief  for  Petitioner  44,  40.  There 
is  no  doubt  that  Westboro  chose  to  stage  its  picketing  at 
the Naval Academy, the Maryland State House, and Matthew 
Snyder's  funeral  to  increase  publicity  for  its  views  and  be-
cause  of  the  relation  between  those  sites  and  its  views--in 
the  case  of  the  military  funeral,  because  Westboro  believes 
that  God  is  killing  American  soldiers  as  punishment  for  the 
Nation's sinful policies. 

456  SNYDER  v.  PHELPS 

Opinion of the Court 
Westboro's  choice  to  convey  its  views  in  conjunction  with 
Matthew  Snyder's  funeral  made  the  expression  of  those 
views  particularly  hurtful  to  many,  especially  to  Matthew's 
father.  The  record  makes  clear  that  the  applicable  legal 
term--"emotional  distress"--fails  to  capture  fully  the  an-
guish Westboro's choice added to Mr. Snyder's already incal-
culable  grief.  But  Westboro  conducted  its  picketing  peace-
fully  on  matters  of  public  concern  at  a  public  place  adjacent 
to  a  public  street.  Such  space  occupies  a  "special  position 
in  terms  of  First  Amendment  protection."  United  States 
v.  Grace,  461  U. S.  171,  180  (1983).  "[W]e  have  repeatedly 
referred  to  public  streets  as  the  archetype  of  a  traditional 
public forum," noting that " `[t]ime out of mind' public streets 
and  sidewalks  have  been  used  for  public  assembly  and  de-
bate."  Frisby v.  Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 480 (1988).4 

That said, "[e]ven protected speech is not equally permissi-
ble in all places and at all times."  Id., at 479 (quoting Corne-
lius  v.  NAACP  Legal  Defense  &  Ed.  Fund,  Inc.,  473  U. S. 
788,  799  (1985)).  Westboro's  choice  of  where  and  when  to 
conduct  its  picketing  is  not  beyond  the  Government's  regu-
latory  reach--it  is  "subject  to  reasonable  time,  place,  or 

manner  restrictions"  that  are  consistent  with  the  standards 
announced in this Court's precedents.  Clark v.  Community 
for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984).  Mary-
land  now  has  a  law  imposing  restrictions  on  funeral  picket-
ing,  Md.  Crim.  Law  Code  Ann.  $ 10-205  (Lexis  Supp.  2010), 
as  do  43  other  States  and  the  Federal  Government.  See 
Brief  for  American  Legion  as  Amicus  Curiae  18-19,  n.  2 

4 The dissent is wrong to suggest that the Court considers a public street 
"a free-fire zone in which otherwise actionable verbal attacks are shielded 
from liability."  Post, at 472.  The fact that Westboro conducted its pick-
eting adjacent to a public street does not insulate the speech from liability, 
but instead heightens concerns that what is at issue is an effort to commu-
nicate to the public the church's views on matters of public concern.  That 
is why our precedents so clearly recognize the special  significance of this 
traditional public forum.

Opinion of the Court 
(listing  statutes).  To  the  extent  these  laws  are  content neutral,  they  raise  very  different  questions  from  the  tort 

verdict  at  issue  in  this  case.  Maryland's  law,  however,  was not  in  effect  at  the  time  of  the  events  at  issue  here,  so  we 
have no occasion to consider how it might apply to facts such as those before us, or whether it or other similar regulations 
are constitutional.5 We have identified a few limited situations where the loca-
tion of targeted picketing can be regulated under provisions that  the  Court  has  determined  to  be  content  neutral.  In 
Frisby, for example, we upheld a ban on such picketing "be-fore  or  about"  a  particular  residence,  487  U. S.,  at  477.  In 
Madsen v.  Women's Health Center, Inc., we approved an in-junction  requiring  a  buffer  zone  between  protesters  and  an 
abortion  clinic  entrance.  512  U. S.  753,  768  (1994).  The facts  here  are  obviously  quite  different,  both  with  respect 
to  the  activity  being  regulated  and  the  means  of  restricting those activities. 

Simply put, the church members had the right to be where they were.  Westboro alerted local authorities to its funeral 
protest and fully complied with police guidance on where the picketing  could  be  staged.  The  picketing  was  conducted 
under police supervision some 1,000 feet from the church, out of  the  sight  of  those  at  the  church.  The  protest  was  not 
unruly; there was no shouting, profanity, or violence. The record confirms that any distress occasioned by West-
boro's  picketing  turned  on  the  content  and  viewpoint  of  the message  conveyed,  rather  than  any  interference  with  the 
funeral itself.  A group of parishioners standing at the very spot  where  Westboro  stood,  holding  signs  that  said  "God 
Bless  America"  and  "God  Loves  You,"  would  not  have  been subjected  to  liability.  It  was  what  Westboro  said  that  ex-
posed it to tort damages. 

5 The Maryland law prohibits picketing within 100 feet of a funeral serv-
ice or funeral  procession; Westboro's picketing would have complied with 
that restriction. 

458  SNYDER  v.  PHELPS 

Opinion of the Court 
Given  that  Westboro's  speech  was  at  a  public  place  on  a matter  of  public  concern,  that  speech  is  entitled  to  "special 

protection"  under  the  First  Amendment.  Such  speech  can-not  be  restricted  simply  because  it  is  upsetting  or  arouses 
contempt.  "If  there  is  a  bedrock  principle  underlying  the First  Amendment,  it  is  that  the  government  may  not  pro-
hibit  the  expression  of  an  idea  simply  because  society  finds 
the idea itself offensive or disagreeable."  Texas v.  Johnson, 491  U. S.  397,  414  (1989).  Indeed,  "the  point  of  all  speech 

protection  .  .  .  is  to  shield  just  those  choices  of  content  that in  someone's  eyes  are  misguided,  or  even  hurtful." 

Hurley 
v.  Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Bos-
ton, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 574 (1995). 

The  jury  here  was  instructed  that  it  could  hold  Westboro 
liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress based on 
a finding that Westboro's picketing was "outrageous."  "Out-
rageousness,"  however,  is  a  highly  malleable  standard  with 
"an  inherent  subjectiveness  about  it  which  would  allow  a 
jury  to  impose  liability  on  the  basis  of  the  jurors'  tastes  or 
views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular 
expression."  Hustler,  485  U. S.,  at  55  (internal  quotation 
marks  omitted).  In  a  case  such  as  this,  a  jury  is  "unlikely 
to  be  neutral  with  respect  to  the  content  of  [the]  speech," 
posing "a real danger of becoming an instrument for the sup-
pression  of . . .  `vehement,  caustic,  and  sometimes  unpleas-
an[t]' "  expression.  Bose  Corp.,  466  U. S.,  at  510  (quoting 
New York Times, 376 U. S., at 270).  Such a risk is unaccept-
able; "in public debate [we] must tolerate insulting, and even 
outrageous,  speech  in  order  to  provide  adequate  `breathing 
space' to the  freedoms protected  by  the  First Amendment." 
Boos v.  Barry, 485 U. S. 312, 322 (1988) (some internal quota-
tion marks omitted).  What Westboro said, in the whole con-
text of how and where it chose to say it, is entitled to "special 
protection" under the First Amendment, and that protection 
cannot  be  overcome  by  a  jury  finding  that  the  picketing 
was outrageous. 

459 Cite as: 562 U. S. 443 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
For all these reasons, the jury verdict imposing tort liabil-
ity  on  Westboro  for  intentional  infliction  of  emotional  dis-
tress must be set aside. 

III 

The jury also found Westboro liable for the state law torts 
of  intrusion upon  seclusion  and civil  conspiracy.  The  Court 
of Appeals did not examine these torts independently of the 
intentional infliction of emotional distress tort.  Instead, the 
Court  of  Appeals  reversed  the  District  Court  wholesale, 
holding  that  the  judgment  wrongly  "attache[d]  tort  liability 
to constitutionally protected speech."  580 F. 3d, at 226. 

Snyder  argues  that  even  assuming  Westboro's  speech  is 
entitled to First Amendment protection generally, the 
church is not immunized from liability for intrusion upon se-
clusion  because  Snyder was a  member of a  captive  audience 
at his son's funeral.  Brief for Petitioner 45-46.  We do not 
agree.  In  most  circumstances,  "the  Constitution  does  not 
permit  the  government  to  decide  which  types  of  otherwise 
protected speech are sufficiently offensive to require protec-
tion  for  the  unwilling  listener  or  viewer.  Rather,  .  .  .  the 
burden normally falls upon the viewer to avoid further bom-
bardment of [his] sensibilities simply by averting [his] eyes." 
Erznoznik v.  Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 210-211 (1975) (in-
ternal  quotation  marks  omitted).  As  a  result,  "[t]he  ability 
of  government,  consonant  with  the  Constitution,  to  shut  off 
discourse  solely  to  protect  others  from  hearing  it  is  .  .  .  de-
pendent  upon  a  showing  that  substantial  privacy  interests 
are  being  invaded  in  an  essentially  intolerable  manner." 
Cohen  v.  California, 403 U. S. 15, 21 (1971). 

As a general matter, we have applied the captive audience 
doctrine  only  sparingly  to  protect  unwilling  listeners  from 
protected  speech.  For  example,  we  have  upheld  a  statute 
allowing  a  homeowner  to  restrict  the  delivery  of  offensive 
mail  to  his  home,  see  Rowan  v.  Post  Office  Dept.,  397  U. S. 
728,  736-738  (1970),  and  an  ordinance  prohibiting  picketing 

460  SNYDER  v.  PHELPS 

Opinion of the Court 
"before  or  about"  any  individual's  residence,  Frisby,  487 U. S., at 477, 484-485. 

Here, Westboro stayed well away from the memorial serv-ice.  Snyder  could  see  no  more  than  the  tops  of  the  signs 
when driving to the funeral.  And there is no indication that the picketing in any way interfered with the funeral service 
itself.  We  decline  to  expand  the  captive  audience  doctrine to the circumstances presented here. 

Because  we  find  that  the  First  Amendment  bars  Snyder from  recovery  for  intentional infliction  of emotional  distress 
or  intrusion  upon  seclusion--the  alleged  unlawful  activity Westboro  conspired  to  accomplish--we  must  likewise  hold 
that  Snyder  cannot  recover  for  civil  conspiracy  based  on those torts. 

IV 
Our  holding  today  is  narrow.  We  are  required  in  First Amendment  cases  to  carefully  review  the  record,  and  the 

reach  of  our  opinion  here  is  limited  by  the  particular  facts before  us.  As  we  have  noted,  "the  sensitivity  and  signifi-
cance  of  the  interests  presented  in  clashes  between  First Amendment and [state law] rights counsel relying on limited 
principles  that  sweep  no  more  broadly  than  the  appropriate context  of  the  instant  case." 

Florida  Star  v.  B.  J.  F.,  491 U. S. 524, 533 (1989). 

Westboro  believes  that  America  is  morally  flawed;  many Americans might feel the same about Westboro.  Westboro's 
funeral  picketing  is  certainly  hurtful  and  its  contribution to  public  discourse  may  be  negligible.  But  Westboro  ad-
dressed  matters  of  public  import  on  public  property,  in  a peaceful manner, in full compliance with the guidance of local 
officials.  The  speech  was  indeed  planned  to  coincide  with Matthew Snyder's funeral, but did not  itself disrupt that  fu-
neral,  and  Westboro's  choice  to  conduct  its  picketing  at  that time and place did not alter the nature of its speech. 

Speech  is  powerful.  It  can  stir  people  to  action,  move them  to  tears  of  both  joy  and  sorrow,  and--as  it  did  here--

Syllabus 
claim  that the  law of  the case  from Pepper  II and  Pepper  III required 
the District Court to reduce the applicable Guidelines range by at least 
40 percent. 

Held: 

1.  When  a  defendant's  sentence  has  been  set  aside  on  appeal,  a  dis-
trict  court  at  resentencing  may  consider  evidence  of  the  defendant's 
postsentencing  rehabilitation,  and  such  evidence  may,  in  appropriate 
cases,  support  a  downward  variance  from  the  now-advisory  Guidelines 
range.  Pp. 487-505. 

(a)  Consistent  with  the  principle  that  "the  punishment  should  fit 
the offender and not merely the crime," Williams v.  New York, 337 U. S. 
241, 247, this Court has observed a consistent and uniform policy "under 
which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discretion in the sources 
and  types  of  evidence  used  to  assist  him  in  determining  the  kind 
and  extent  of  punishment  to  be  imposed  within  limits  fixed  by  law," 
id., at 246, particularly "the fullest information possible concerning the 
defendant's life and characteristics," id., at 247.  That principle is codi-
fied  at  18  U. S. C.  $ 3661,  which  provides  that  "[n]o  limitation  shall 
be placed on the information" a sentencing court may consider "concern-
ing  the  [defendant's]  background,  character,  and  conduct,"  and  at 

$ 3553(a),  which  specifies  that  sentencing  courts  must  consider,  among 
other  things,  a  defendant's  "history  and  characteristics,"  $ 3553(a)(1). 
The  Guidelines,  which  Booker  made  "effectively  advisory,"  543  U. S., 
at  245,  "should  be  the  starting  point  and  the  initial  benchmark,"  but 
district  courts  may  impose  sentences  within  statutory  limits  based  on 
appropriate  consideration  of  all  of  the  $ 3553(a)  factors,  subject  to  ap-
pellate  review  for  "reasonableness,"  Gall,  552  U. S.,  at  49-51.  This 
sentencing  framework  applies  both  at  initial  sentencing  and  at  any 
subsequent resentencing after a sentence has been set aside on appeal. 
Pp. 487-490. 

(b)  Postsentencing  rehabilitation  evidence  may  support  a  down-
ward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.  The plain language 
of $ 3661 makes clear that there is "[n]o limitation . . . on . . .  background, 
character,  and  conduct"  information,  and  it  makes  no  distinction  be-
tween an initial sentencing and a subsequent resentencing.  In addition, 
postsentencing rehabilitation evidence may be highly relevant to several 

$ 3553(a) factors that district courts are required to consider at sentenc-
ing.  The extensive  evidence of Pepper's rehabilitation  since his initial 
sentencing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sentence 
here.  Most fundamentally, that evidence provides the most up-to-date 
picture  of  his  "history  and  characteristics."  $ 3553(a)(1).  At  the  time 
of  his  initial  sentencing,  he  was  an  unemployed  drug  addict  who  was 

478  PEPPER  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Syllabus 
estranged from his family and sold drugs.  By his second resentencing, 
he had been drug free for nearly five years, was attending college, was 
a  top  employee  slated  for  promotion,  had  reestablished  a  relationship 
with his father, and was married and supporting a family.  His postsen-
tencing conduct also sheds light on the likelihood that he will engage in 
future  criminal  conduct,  a  central  factor  that  sentencing  courts  must 
consider.  See $$ 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C).  Pp. 490-493. 

(c)  The  contrary  arguments  advanced  by  amicus  appointed  to  de-
fend the judgment are unpersuasive.  Pp. 493-504. 

(1)  While $ 3742(g)(2)--which prohibits a district court at resen-
tencing  from  imposing  a  sentence  outside  the  Guidelines  range  except 
upon  a  ground  it  relied  upon  at  the  prior  sentencing--effectively  pre-
cludes  a  court  from  considering  postsentencing  rehabilitation,  that 
provision  is  invalid  after  Booker.  Like  the  provisions  invalidated  in 
Booker--$$ 3553(b)(1)  and  3742(e)--$ 3742(g)(2)  requires  district  courts 
effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in an entire set of cases. 
Thus, the proper remedy is to invalidate the provision.  While applying 

$ 3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not always result in a Sixth Amend-
ment violation, this Court rejects a partial invalidation that would leave 
the Guidelines effectively mandatory in some cases and advisory in oth-
ers.  The fact that $ 3742(g)(2) permits a resentencing court on remand 
to impose a non-Guidelines sentence where the prior sentence expressly 
relied on a departure upheld by the court of appeals also does not cure 
the constitutional infirmity.  And the argument that any constitutional 
infirmity  in  $ 3742(g)(2)  can  be  remedied  by  invalidating  $ 3742(j)(1)(B) 
is rejected.  Pp. 493-499. 

(2)  This Court finds unpersuasive amicus' arguments focusing on 
Congress'  sentencing  objectives  under  $ 3553(a).  Contrary  to  amicus' 
contention, $ 3742(g)(2) does not reflect a congressional purpose to pre-
clude  consideration  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation  evidence.  Thus, 
that  provision  has  no  bearing  on  this  Court's  analysis  of  whether 

$ 3553(a)  permits  consideration  of  such  evidence.  Nor  is  the  consider-
ation  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation  inconsistent  with  the  sentencing 
factor in  $ 3553(a)(5)--which  directs sentencing  courts to  consider "any 
pertinent policy statement" of the Sentencing Commission--particularly 
as the pertinent policy statement in this case is  based on unconvincing 
policy rationales not reflected in the relevant sentencing statutes.  Con-
sideration  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation  is also  not  inconsistent  with 

$ 3553(a)(6)--which  requires  courts  to  consider  "the  need  to  avoid  un-
warranted  sentenc[ing]  disparities  among  defendants  with  similar  rec-
ords  who have  been  found guilty  of  similar  conduct"--as  any  disparity 
arises  only  from  the  normal  trial  and  sentencing  process.  The  differ-

479 Cite as: 562 U. S. 476 (2011) 
Syllabus 
ences  in  procedural  opportunity  that  may  result  because  some  defend-
ants are inevitably sentenced in error and must be resentenced are not 
the kinds of "unwarranted" sentencing disparities that Congress sought 
to eliminate under $ 3553(a)(6).  Pp. 499-504. 

(d)  On remand, the District Court should consider and give appro-
priate  weight  to  the  postsentencing  rehabilitation  evidence,  as  well  as 
any additional evidence concerning Pepper's conduct since his last sen-
tencing.  Pp. 504-505. 

2.  Because the Eighth Circuit in Pepper III set aside Pepper's entire 
sentence and remanded for de novo resentencing, the District Court was 
not bound by the law of the case doctrine to apply the same 40-percent 
departure  applied  by  the  original  sentencing  judge.  To  avoid  under-
mining  a  district  court's  original  sentencing  intent,  an  appellate  court 
when reversing one part of a sentence "may vacate the entire sentence 
.  .  .  so  that,  on  remand,  the  trial  court  can  reconfigure  the  sentencing 
plan . . . to satisfy [$ 3553(a)'s] sentencing factors."  Greenlaw v.  United 
States,  554  U. S.  237,  253.  That  is  what  the  Eighth  Circuit  did  here.

posing  a  non-Guidelines  sentence--that  provision  did  not survive our holding in United States v.  Booker, 543 U. S. 220 

(2005), and we expressly invalidate it today. We  hold  that  when  a  defendant's  sentence  has  been  set 
aside on appeal, a district court at resentencing may consider evidence of the defendant's postsentencing rehabilitation and 
that  such  evidence  may,  in  appropriate  cases,  support  a downward variance from the now-advisory Federal Sentenc-
ing  Guidelines  range.  Separately,  we  affirm  the  Court  of Appeals'  ruling  that  the  law  of  the  case  doctrine  did  not 
require  the  District  Court  in  this  case  to  apply  the  same percentage departure from the Guidelines range for substan-
tial  assistance  that  had  been  applied  at  petitioner's  prior sentencing. 

I 
In October 2003, petitioner Jason Pepper was arrested and charged  with  conspiracy  to  distribute  500  grams  or  more 

of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 846.  After pleading  guilty,  Pepper  appeared  for  sentencing  before 
then-Chief  Judge  Mark  W.  Bennett  of  the  U.  S.  District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.  Pepper's sentenc-
ing range under the Guidelines was 97 to 121 months.1  The Government  moved  for  a  downward  departure  pursuant  to 
USSG  $ 5K1.1  based  on  Pepper's  substantial  assistance  and recommended a 15-percent downward departure.

2  The Dis-

trict Court, however, sentenced Pepper to a 24-month prison 

1 Although the charge to which Pepper pleaded guilty carried a manda-
tory minimum of 120 months' imprisonment, the mandatory minimum did 
not  apply  because  he  was  eligible  for  safety-valve  relief  pursuant  to  18 
U. S. C.  $ 3553(f)  (2000  ed.)  and  $ 5C1.2  of  the  United  States  Sentencing 
Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG). 

2 USSG  $ 5K1.1  provides  that  a  court  may  depart  from  the  Guidelines 

"[u]pon motion of the government stating that the defendant has provided 
substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person 
who has committed an offense."  Pepper provided information to Govern-
ment investigators  and a grand  jury concerning two other individuals in-
volved with illegal drugs and guns.

Opinion of the Court 
term,  resulting  in  an  approximately  75-percent  downward departure  from  the  low  end  of  the  Guidelines  range,  to  be 

followed  by  five  years  of  supervised  release.  The  Govern-ment  appealed  Pepper's  sentence,  and  in  June  2005,  the 
Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eighth  Circuit  reversed  and  re-manded for resentencing in light of our intervening decision 
in  Booker  (and  for  another  reason  not  relevant  here).  See 
United States v.  Pepper, 412 F. 3d 995, 999 (Pepper I).  Pep-per  completed  his  24-month  sentence  three  days  after 

Pep-
per  I  was  issued  and  began  serving  his  term  of  supervised release. 

In May 2006, the District Court conducted  a resentencing 
hearing  and  heard  from  three  witnesses.  In  his  testimony, 
Pepper  first  recounted  that  while  he  had  previously  been  a 
drug addict, he successfully completed a 500-hour drug treat-
ment  program  while  in  prison  and  he  no  longer  used  any 
drugs.  App. 104-105.  Pepper then explained that since his 
release  from  prison,  he  had  enrolled  at  a  local  community 
college as a full-time student and had earned A's in all of his 
classes in the prior semester.  Id., at 106-107.  Pepper also 
testified  that  he  had  obtained  employment  within  a  few 
weeks after being released from custody and was continuing 
to  work  part  time  while  attending  school.  Id.,  at  106-110. 
Pepper confirmed that he was in compliance with all the con-
ditions  of  his  supervised  release  and  described  his  changed 
attitude since his arrest.  See id., at 111 ("[M]y life was basi-
cally  headed  to  either  where--I  guess  where  I  ended  up, 
in  prison,  or  death.  Now  I  have  some  optimism  about  my 
life,  about  what  I  can  do  with  my  life.  I'm  glad  that  I  got 
this  chance  to  try  again  I  guess  you  could  say  at  a  decent 
life.  .  .  .  My  life  was  going  nowhere  before,  and  I  think  that 
it's going somewhere now"). 

Pepper's  father  testified  that  he  had  virtually  no  contact 
with  Pepper  during  the  5-year  period  leading  up  to  his  ar-
rest.  Id.,  at  117.  Pepper's  drug  treatment  program,  ac-
cording to his  father, "truly sobered  him up"  and  "made his 

483 Cite as: 562 U. S. 476 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
way  of  thinking  change."  Id.,  at  121.  He  explained  that Pepper was now "much more mature" and "serious in terms 

of  planning  for  the  future,"  id.,  at  119,  and  that  as  a  conse-quence, he had reestablished a relationship with his son, id., 
at 118-119. Finally,  Pepper's  probation  officer  testified  that,  in  his 
view,  a  24-month  sentence  would  be  reasonable  in  light  of Pepper's  substantial  assistance,  postsentencing  rehabilita-
tion,  and  demonstrated  low  risk  of  recidivism.  Id.,  at  126- 131.  The probation officer also prepared a sentencing mem-
orandum  that  further  set  forth  the  reasons  supporting  his recommendation for a 24-month sentence. 

The  District  Court  adopted  as  its  findings  of  fact  the  tes-timony  of  the  three  witnesses  and  the  probation  officer's 
sentencing  memorandum.  The  court  granted  a  40-percent downward  departure  based  on  Pepper's  substantial  assist-
ance,  reducing  the  bottom  of  the  Guidelines  range  from  97 to  58 months.  The  court  then  granted a  further 59-percent 
downward variance based on, inter alia, Pepper's rehabilita-tion since his initial sentencing.  Id., at 143-148.

3  The court 

sentenced Pepper to 24  months of imprisonment, concluding that "it would [not] advance  any purpose of federal sentenc-

ing  policy  or  any  other  policy  behind  the  federal  sentencing guidelines  to  send  this  defendant  back  to  prison."  Id.,  at 
149-150. The  Government  again  appealed  Pepper's  sentence,  and 
the  Court  of  Appeals  again  reversed  and  remanded  for  re-sentencing.  See 

United States v.  Pepper, 486 F. 3d 408, 410, 413 (CA8 2007) (Pepper II).  The court concluded that, while 

it was "a close call, [it could not] say the district court abused its  discretion"  by  granting  the  40-percent  downward  de-
parture  for  substantial  assistance.  Id.,  at  411.  The  court found  the  further  59-percent  downward  variance,  however, 

3 The court also  cited Pepper's  lack of a  violent history  and, to a lesser 
extent, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparity with Pepper's 
co-conspirators.  App. 144-145. 

484  PEPPER  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
to  be  an  abuse  of  discretion.  Id.,  at  412-413.  In  doing  so, the  court  held  that  Pepper's  "post-sentencing  rehabilitation 

was an impermissible factor to consider in granting a down-ward  variance."  Id.,  at  413.  The  court  stated  that  evi-
dence  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation  " `is  not  relevant  and will  not  be  permitted  at  resentencing  because  the  district 
court could not have considered that evidence at the time of the  original  sentencing,' "  and  permitting  courts  to  consider 
postsentencing  rehabilitation  at  resentencing  "would  create unwarranted sentencing disparities and inject blatant inequi-
ties into the sentencing process."  Ibid.4  The Court of Ap-peals directed that the case be assigned to a different district 
judge for resentencing.  Ibid. After the Court of Appeals' mandate issued, Pepper's case 
was  reassigned  on  remand  to  Chief  Judge  Linda  R.  Reade. In July 2007, Chief Judge Reade issued an order on the scope 
of  the  remand  from  Pepper  II,  stating  that  "[t]he  court will  not  consider  itself  bound  to  reduce  [Pepper's]  advisory 
Sentencing  Guidelines  range  by  40%  pursuant  to  USSG $ 5K1.1."  United  States  v.  Pepper,  No.  03-CR-4113-LRR, 
2007  WL 2076041,  *4 (ND Iowa).  In the  meantime, Pepper petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, and in January 
2008, we granted the petition, vacated the judgment in Pep-
per  II,  and  remanded  the  case  to  the  Court  of  Appeals  for 
further  consideration  in  light  of  Gall  v.  United  States,  552 

U. S.  38  (2007).  See  Pepper  v.  United  States,  552  U. S. 1089 (2008). 

On  remand,  the  Court  of  Appeals  held  that  Gall  did  not alter its prior conclusion that "post-sentence rehabilitation is

4 The Court of Appeals also held that the District Court "further erred 
by considering Pepper's lack of violent history, which history had already 
been accounted for in the sentencing Guidelines calculation, and by consid-
ering  sentencing  disparity  among  Pepper's  co-defendants  without  ade-
quate foundation and explanation."  Pepper II, 486 F. 3d, at 413.

variance."  518 F. 3d 949, 953 (CA8 2008) (Pepper III).  The 
court  again  reversed  the  sentence  and  remanded  for 
resentencing. 

In  October  2008,  Chief  Judge  Reade  convened  Pepper's 
second  resentencing  hearing.  Pepper  informed  the  court 
that he was still attending school and was now working as a 
supervisor for the night crew at a warehouse retailer, where 
he  was  recently  selected  by  management  as  "associate  of 

the year" and was likely to be promoted the following Janu-
ary.  App. 320, 323.  Pepper also stated that he had recently 
married and was now supporting his wife and her daughter. 
Id.,  at  321.  Pepper's  father  reiterated  that  Pepper  was 
moving  forward  in  both  his  career  and  his  family  life  and 
that  he  remained  in  close  touch  with  his  son.  See  id.,  at 
300-304. 

In December 2008, Chief Judge Reade issued a sentencing 
memorandum.  Noting  that the  remand  language  of Pepper 
III  was  nearly  identical  to  the  language  in  Pepper  II,  the 
court again observed that it was "not bound to reduce [Pep-
per's] advisory Sentencing Guidelines range by 40%" for sub-
stantial  assistance  and  concluded  that  Pepper  was  entitled 
only to a 20-percent downward departure because the assist-
ance  was  "timely,  helpful  and  important"  but  "in  no  way 
extraordinary."  Sealed Sentencing Memorandum in No. 03- 
CR-4113-LRR (ND Iowa), Record, Doc. 198, pp. 7, 10.  The 
court  also  rejected  Pepper's  request  for  a  downward  vari-
ance  based  on,  inter  alia,  his  postsentencing  rehabilitation. 
Id., at 16. 

The  District  Court  reconvened  Pepper's  resentencing 
hearing  in  January  2009.  The  court's  decision  to  grant  a 
20-percent  downward  departure  for  substantial  assistance 
resulted in an advisory Guidelines range of 77 to 97 months. 
The court also granted the Government's motion under Rule 
35(b) of the Federal Rules  of Criminal Procedure to account 
for  investigative  assistance  Pepper  provided  after  he  was

initially  sentenced.  The  court  imposed  a  65-month  term  of imprisonment,  to  be  followed  by  12  months  of  supervised 

release.5 The  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  Pepper's  65-month  sen-
tence.  570  F. 3d  958  (CA8 2009)  (Pepper IV).  As  relevant here, the Court of Appeals rejected Pepper's argument that 
the District Court erred in  refusing to consider his postsen-tencing  rehabilitation.  The  court  acknowledged  that  "Pep-
per made significant progress during and following his initial period  of  imprisonment"  and  "commend[ed]  Pepper  on  the 
positive changes he has made in his life," but concluded that Pepper's argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent hold-
ing  that  "post-sentencing  rehabilitation  is  not  a  permissible factor to consider in granting a downward variance." 

Id., at 964-965  (citing 
United  States  v.  Jenners,  473  F.  3d  894,  899 (CA8  2007); United States  v.  McMannus, 496  F. 3d  846, 852, 

n. 4 (CA8 2007)). The Court of Appeals also rejected Pepper's claim that the 
scope  of the  remand and  the law  of the  case  from  Pepper  II and  Pepper  III  required  the  District  Court  to  reduce  the 
applicable  Guidelines  range  by  at  least  40  percent  pursuant to  USSG  $ 5K1.1.  The  court  noted  that  its  remand  orders 
in  Pepper  II  and  Pepper  III  were  "general  remand[s]  for resentencing,"  which  "did  not  place  any  limitations  on  the 
discretion  of  the  newly  assigned  district  court  judge  in  re-sentencing."  570  F.  3d,  at  963.  The  court  further  noted 
that,  although  issues  decided  by  an  appellate  court  become law of the case on remand to the sentencing court, its earlier 
decisions merely held that a 40-percent downward departure for substantial assistance was not an abuse of discretion, not 
that  the  District  Court  would  be  bound  by  the  40-percent departure previously granted.  Id., at 963-964. 

5 After  the  District  Court  resentenced  Pepper  to  65  months'  imprison-
ment, Pepper was returned to federal custody.  On July 22, 2010, after we 
granted  Pepper's  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari,  the  District  Court 
granted his motion for release pending disposition of the case here.

Opinion of the Court 
We  granted  Pepper's  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari,  561 U. S. 1024 (2010), to decide two questions: (1) whether a dis-

trict  court,  after  a  defendant's  sentence  has  been  set  aside on  appeal,  may  consider  evidence  of  a  defendant's  postsen-
tencing rehabilitation to support a downward variance when resentencing  the  defendant,  a  question  that  has  divided  the 
Courts  of  Appeals; 6  and  (2)  whether  the  resentencing  court was  required,  under  the  law  of  the  case  doctrine,  to  apply 
the  same  percentage  departure  from  the  Guidelines  range for  substantial  assistance  that  had  been  applied  at  Pepper's 
prior  sentencing.  Because  the  United  States  has  confessed error in the Court of Appeals' ruling on the first question, we 
appointed an amicus curiae to defend the Court of Appeals' judgment.

7  We  now  vacate  the  Eighth  Circuit's  ruling  on 

the first question and affirm its ruling on the second.

"It  has  been  uniform  and  constant  in  the  federal  judicial tradition  for  the  sentencing  judge  to  consider  every  con-

times  magnify,  the  crime  and  the  punishment  to  ensue." Koon v.  United States, 518 U. S. 81, 113 (1996).  Underlying 
this  tradition  is  the  principle  that  "the  punishment  should

tive conduct); United States v.  Sims, 174 F. 3d 911, 913 (CA8 1999) (same),

fit  the  offender  and  not  merely  the  crime."  Williams, 337  U. S.,  at  247;  see  also  Pennsylvania  ex  rel.  Sullivan  v. 

Ashe,  302 U. S. 51, 55 (1937)  ("For the  determination  of sen-tences, justice generally requires consideration of more than 
the  particular  acts  by  which  the  crime  was  committed  and that  there  be  taken  into  account  the  circumstances  of  the 
offense  together  with  the  character  and  propensities  of  the offender"). 

Consistent  with  this  principle,  we  have  observed  that "both  before  and  since  the  American  colonies  became  a  na-
tion, courts in this country and in England practiced a policy under which a sentencing judge could exercise a wide discre-
tion  in  the  sources  and  types  of  evidence  used  to  assist  him in  determining  the  kind  and extent of  punishment  to  be im-
posed  within  limits  fixed  by  law."  Williams,  337  U. S.,  at 246.  In  particular,  we  have  emphasized  that  "[h]ighly  rele-
vant--if  not  essential--to  [the]  selection  of  an  appropriate sentence is the possession of the fullest information possible 
concerning  the  defendant's  life  and  characteristics."  Id.,  at 247.  Permitting  sentencing  courts  to  consider  the  widest 
possible  breadth  of  information  about  a  defendant  "ensures that the punishment will suit not merely the offense but the 
individual  defendant."  Wasman  v.  United  States,  468  U. S. 559, 564 (1984). 

In 1970, Congress codified the "longstanding principle that sentencing  courts  have  broad  discretion  to  consider  various 
kinds of information" at 18 U. S. C. $ 3577 (1970 ed.).  United 
States v.  Watts,  519 U. S. 148, 151 (1997) (per curiam).  Sec-tion 3577 provided: 

"No limitation shall be placed on the information con-cerning the background, character, and conduct of a per-
son  convicted  of  an  offense  which  a  court  of  the  United States  may  receive  and  consider  for  the  purpose  of  im-
posing  an  appropriate  sentence."  (Emphasis  added.) 
In  the  Sentencing  Reform  Act  of  1984  (SRA),  18  U. S. C. $ 3551  et  seq.,  Congress  effected  fundamental  changes  to 

489 Cite as: 562 U. S. 476 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
federal sentencing by creating the Federal Sentencing Com-mission  and  introducing  the  Guidelines  scheme.  In  doing 

so,  however,  Congress  recodified  $ 3577  without  change  at $ 3661.  The  Sentencing  Commission,  moreover,  expressly 
incorporated $ 3661 in the Guidelines: 

"In  determining  the  sentence  to  impose  within  the guideline range, or whether a departure from the guide-

lines is warranted, the court may consider, without limi-
tation,  any  information  concerning  the  background, character  and  conduct  of  the  defendant,  unless  other-

wise prohibited by law.  See 18 U. S. C. $ 3661."  USSG $ 1B1.4 (Nov. 2010) (emphasis added). 

Both  Congress  and  the  Sentencing  Commission  thus  ex-pressly  preserved  the  traditional  discretion  of  sentencing 
courts  to  "conduct  an  inquiry  broad  in  scope,  largely  unlim-ited either as to the kind of information [they] may consider, 
or  the  source  from  which  it  may  come."  United  States  v. 
Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972).8 The SRA did constrain sentencing courts' discretion in im-

portant  respects,  most  notably  by  making  the  Guidelines mandatory,  see  18  U. S. C.  $ 3553(b)(1)  (2000  ed.,  Supp.  IV), 
and  by  specifying  various  factors  that  courts  must  consider in  exercising  their  discretion,  see  $ 3553(a).  In  our  seminal 
decision in Booker, we held that where facts found by a judge by a preponderance of the  evidence increased the  applicable 
Guidelines  range,  treating  the  Guidelines  as  mandatory  in those  circumstances  violated  the  Sixth  Amendment  right  of 
criminal  defendants  to  be  tried  by  a  jury  and  to  have  every element  of  an  offense  proved  by  the  Government  beyond  a 
reasonable  doubt.  543  U. S.,  at  243-244.  Our  remedial opinion in

586  (CA2  1994)  ("A  defendant's  race  or  nationality  may  play  no  adverse 
role in the administration of justice, including at sentencing").

SRA,  see  id.,  at  245  (invalidating  18  U. S. C.  $$ 3553(b)(1), 3742(e)), and instructed the district courts to treat the Guide-

lines as "effectively advisory," 543 U. S., at 245. Our post-Booker opinions make clear that, although a sen-
tencing  court  must  "give  respectful  consideration  to  the Guidelines, 

Booker  permits  the  court  to  tailor  the  sentence in light of other statutory concerns as well."  Kimbrough v. 

United  States,  552  U. S.  85,  101  (2007)  (internal  quotation marks and  citation omitted).  Accordingly, although the 
"Guidelines  should  be  the  starting  point  and  the  initial benchmark,"  district  courts  may  impose  sentences  within 
statutory  limits  based  on  appropriate  consideration  of  all  of the factors listed in $ 3553(a), subject to appellate review for 
"reasonableness."  Gall,  552  U. S.,  at  49-51.  This  sentenc-ing  framework  applies  both  at  a  defendant's  initial  sentenc-
ing  and  at  any  subsequent  resentencing  after  a  sentence has  been  set  aside  on  appeal.  See  18  U. S. C.  $ 3742(g) 
("A district court to which a case is remanded . . . shall resen-tence a defendant in accordance with section 3553"); see also 
Dillon v.  United States, 560 U. S. 817, 828, 827 (2010) (distin-guishing between "sentence-modification proceedings" under 
18  U. S. C.  $ 3582(c)(2),  which  "do  not  implicate  the  interests identified  in  Booker,"  and  "plenary  resentencing  proceed-
ings," which do).  B 

In  light  of  the  federal  sentencing  framework  described above, we think it clear that when a defendant's sentence has 
been  set  aside  on  appeal  and  his  case  remanded  for  resen-tencing,  a  district  court  may  consider  evidence  of  a  defend-
ant's  rehabilitation  since  his  prior  sentencing  and  that  such evidence  may,  in  appropriate  cases,  support  a  downward 
variance from the advisory Guidelines range. Preliminarily,  Congress  could not  have  been  clearer  in di-
recting that "[n]o limitation . . . be placed on the information concerning  the  background,  character,  and  conduct"  of  a 
defendant  that  a  district  court  may  "receive  and  consider

Opinion of the Court 
for  the  purpose  of  imposing  an  appropriate  sentence."  18 U. S. C.  $ 3661.  The  plain  language  of  $ 3661  makes  no  dis-

tinction between a defendant's initial sentencing and a subse-quent resentencing after a prior sentence has been set aside 
on appeal.  We have recognized that "the broad language of $ 3661"  does  not  provide  "any  basis  for  the  courts  to  invent 
a blanket prohibition against considering certain types of ev-
idence at sentencing."  Watts, 519 U. S., at 152.  A categori-cal bar  on  the  consideration  of  postsentencing rehabilitation 

evidence  would  directly  contravene  Congress'  expressed  in-tent in $ 3661. 

In addition, evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation may 
be  highly  relevant  to  several  of  the  $ 3553(a)  factors  that 
Congress has expressly instructed district courts to consider 
at  sentencing.  For  example,  evidence  of  postsentencing  re-
habilitation may plainly be relevant to "the history and char-
acteristics  of  the  defendant."  $ 3553(a)(1).  Such  evidence 
may also be pertinent to "the need for the sentence imposed" 
to  serve  the  general  purposes  of  sentencing  set  forth  in 

$ 3553(a)(2)--in particular, to "afford adequate deterrence to 
criminal  conduct,"  "protect  the  public  from  further  crimes 
of  the  defendant,"  and  "provide  the  defendant  with  needed 
educational  or  vocational  training  .  .  .  or  other  correctional 
treatment  in  the  most  effective  manner."  $$ 3553(a)(2)(B)- 
(D); see McMannus, 496 F. 3d, at 853 (Melloy, J., concurring) 
("In  assessing  .  .  .  deterrence,  protection  of  the  public  and 
rehabilitation,  18  U. S. C.  $ 3553(a)(2)(B)(C)  &  (D),  there 
would  seem  to  be  no  better  evidence  than  a  defendant's 
post-incarceration  conduct").  Postsentencing  rehabilitation 
may  also  critically  inform  a  sentencing  judge's  overarching 
duty under $ 3553(a) to "impose a sentence sufficient, but not 
greater than necessary," to comply with the sentencing pur-
poses set forth in $ 3553(a)(2). 

As the original sentencing judge recognized, the extensive 
evidence  of  Pepper's  rehabilitation  since  his  initial  sentenc-
ing is clearly relevant to the selection of an appropriate sen-

Opinion of the Court 
tence in this case.  Most fundamentally, evidence of Pepper's conduct since his release from custody in June 2005 provides 

the most up-to-date picture of Pepper's "history and charac-teristics."  $ 3553(a)(1);  see 

United  States  v.  Bryson,  229 
F.  3d  425,  426  (CA2  2000)  (per  curiam)  ("[A]  court's  duty  is always  to  sentence  the  defendant  as  he  stands  before  the 

court  on  the  day  of  sentencing").  At  the  time  of  his  initial 
sentencing  in  2004,  Pepper  was  a  25-year-old  drug  addict who was unemployed, estranged from his family, and had re-

cently  sold  drugs  as  part  of a  methamphetamine  conspiracy. By  the  time  of  his  second  resentencing  in  2009,  Pepper  had 
been  drug  free  for  nearly  five  years,  had  attended  college 
and  achieved  high  grades,  was  a  top  employee  at  his  job 
slated for a promotion, had reestablished a relationship with 
his father, and was married and supporting his wife's daugh-
ter.  There is no question that this evidence of Pepper's con-
duct since  his  initial sentencing  constitutes  a critical  part of 
the  "history  and  characteristics"  of  a  defendant  that  Con-
gress intended sentencing courts to consider.  $ 3553(a). 

Pepper's  postsentencing  conduct  also  sheds  light  on  the 
likelihood  that  he  will  engage  in  future  criminal  conduct, 
a  central  factor  that  district  courts  must  assess  when  im-
posing sentence.  See $$ 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C); Gall, 552 U. S., at 
59 ("Gall's self-motivated rehabilitation . . .  lends strong sup-
port  to  the  conclusion  that  imprisonment  was  not  necessary 
to  deter  Gall  from  engaging  in  future  criminal  conduct  or 
to  protect  the  public  from  his  future  criminal  acts"  (citing 

$$ 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C))).  As recognized by Pepper's probation 
officer, Pepper's steady employment, as well as his successful 
completion  of  a  500-hour  drug  treatment  program  and  his 
drug-free  condition,  also  suggest  a  diminished  need  for 
"educational  or  vocational  training . . . or  other  correctional 
treatment."  $ 3553(a)(2)(D).  Finally,  Pepper's  exemplary 
postsentencing  conduct  may  be  taken  as  the  most  accurate 
indicator  of  "his  present  purposes  and  tendencies  and  sig-
nificantly  to  suggest  the  period  of  restraint  and  the  kind  of 

493 Cite as: 562 U. S. 476 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
discipline  that  ought  to  be  imposed  upon  him."  Ashe,  302 U. S.,  at  55.  Accordingly,  evidence  of  Pepper's  postsen-

tencing  rehabilitation  bears  directly  on  the  District  Court's overarching  duty  to  "impose  a  sentence  sufficient,  but  not 
greater  than  necessary,"  to  serve  the  purposes  of  sentenc-ing.  $ 3553(a). 

In  sum,  the  Court  of  Appeals'  ruling  prohibiting  the District  Court  from  considering  any  evidence  of  Pepper's 
postsentencing  rehabilitation  at  resentencing  conflicts  with longstanding principles of federal sentencing law and contra-
venes Congress' directives in $$ 3661 and 3553(a). 

C 
Amicus  nevertheless  advances  two  principal  arguments in  defense  of  the  Court  of  Appeals'  ruling:  (1)  18  U. S. C. 

$ 3742(g)(2),  which  restricts  the  discretion  of  a  resentencing court on remand to impose  a non-Guidelines  sentence, effec-
tively  forecloses  consideration  of  a  defendant's  postsentenc-ing  rehabilitation;  and  (2)  permitting  district  courts  to  con-
sider  postsentencing  rehabilitation  would  defeat  Congress' objectives under $ 3553(a).  We are not persuaded. 

1 
Amicus' main argument relies on 18 U. S. C. $ 3742(g)(2), a provision that the Court of Appeals did not cite below.  That 

provision states that when a sentence is set aside on appeal, the district court to which the case is remanded: 

"shall  not  impose  a  sentence  outside  the  applicable guidelines range except upon a ground that-- 

"(A) was specifically and affirmatively included in the written statement of reasons required by section 3553(c) 
in  connection  with  the  previous  sentencing  of  the  de-fendant prior to the appeal; and 

"(B)  was  held  by  the  court  of  appeals,  in  remanding the case, to be a permissible ground of departure." 

494  PEPPER  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
In operation, $ 3742(g)(2) restricts the discretion of a district court  on  remand  by  precluding  the  court  from  imposing  a 

sentence outside the Guidelines range except upon a "ground of  departure"  that  was  expressly  relied  upon  in  the  prior 
sentencing  and  upheld  on  appeal.  Amicus  thus  correctly contends that, on its face, $ 3742(g)(2) effectively forecloses a 
resentencing  court  from  considering  evidence  of  a  defend-ant's  postsentencing  rehabilitation  for  purposes  of  imposing 
a  non-Guidelines  sentence  because,  as  a  practical  matter, such evidence did  not exist  at the  time of the prior sentenc-
ing.  As  the  Government  concedes,  however,  $ 3742(g)(2)  is invalid after 

Booker. As  we  have  explained, 

Booker  held  that  where  judicial factfinding  increases  a  defendant's  applicable  Sentencing 

Guidelines  range,  treating  the  Guidelines  as  mandatory  in those  circumstances  would  violate  the  defendant's  Sixth 
Amendment  right  to  be  tried  by  a  jury  and  to  have  every element  of  an  offense  proved  by  the  Government  beyond  a 
reasonable  doubt.  See  supra,  at  489-490.  We  recognized in Booker that, although the SRA permitted departures from 
the  applicable  Guidelines  range  in  limited  circumstances,9 "departures  are  not  available  in  every  case,  and  in  fact  are 
unavailable  in  most."  543  U. S.,  at  234.  Because  in  those instances,  "the  judge  is  bound  to  impose  a  sentence  within 
the  Guidelines  range,"  we  concluded  that  the  availability  of departures in certain circumstances "does not avoid the con-
stitutional issue."  Ibid. To  remedy  the  constitutional  problem,  we  rendered  the 
Guidelines  effectively  advisory  by  invalidating  two  provi-sions of the SRA: 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), 
which generally required sentencing courts to impose a sen-tence  within  the  applicable  Guidelines  range,  and  $ 3742(e) 

9 See 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (permitting departures 
where the judge "finds that there exists an aggravating or mitigating cir-
cumstance  of  a  kind,  or  to  a  degree,  not  adequately  taken  into  consider-
ation by the Sentencing Commission").

de novo review  of Guidelines  de-
partures.  543  U. S.,  at  259.  We  invalidated  these  provi-sions even though we recognized that mandatory application 

of the Guidelines would not always result in a Sixth Amend-ment  violation.

10  Indeed,  although  the  Government  sug-

gested  in  Booker  that  we  render  the  Guidelines  advisory 
only in cases in which the Constitution prohibits judicial fact-finding,  we  rejected  that  two-track  proposal,  reasoning  that 

"Congress would not have authorized a mandatory system in some cases and  a nonmandatory system in  others, given the 
administrative  complexities  that  such  a  system  would  cre-ate." 

Id.,  at  266;  see  Dillon,  560  U. S.,  at  829-830  ("The

proceedings, leading potentially to unfair results and consid-
erable administrative challenges"). 

We did not expressly mention $ 3742(g)(2) in Booker,11  but 
the  rationale  we  set  forth  in  that  opinion  for  invalidating 

$$ 3553(b)(1)  and  3742(e)  applies  equally  to  $ 3742(g)(2).  As 
with  those  provisions,  $ 3742(g)(2)  requires  district  courts 
effectively to treat the Guidelines as mandatory in an entire 
set  of  cases.  Specifically,  $ 3742(g)(2)  precludes  a  district 
court on remand from imposing a sentence "outside the appli-
cable guidelines range" except upon a "ground of departure" 
that was expressly relied upon by the court at the prior sen-
tencing  and  upheld  by  the  court  of  appeals.  In  circum-
stances  in  which  the  district  court  did  not  rely  upon  such  a 
departure ground at the prior sentencing, $ 3742(g)(2) would

range depended solely on facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, 
requiring a judge to sentence within that range would not run afoul of the 
Sixth Amendment. 

11 See  Dillon,  560  U. S.,  at  839,  n.  5  (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting)  (citing 

$ 3742(g)(2)  as  "one  additional  provision  of  the  [SRA  that]  should  have 
been  excised,  but  was  not,  in  order  to  accomplish  the  Court's  remedy"). 

496  PEPPER  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
require the court on remand to impose a sentence within the 
applicable  Guidelines  range,  thus  rendering  the  Guidelines 
effectively mandatory.  Because in a large set of cases, judi-
cial  factfinding  will increase the  applicable  Guidelines  range 
beyond that supported solely by the facts established by the 
jury verdict (or guilty plea), requiring a sentencing judge on 
remand  to  apply  the  Guidelines  range,  as  $ 3742(g)(2)  does, 
will often result in a Sixth Amendment violation for the rea-
sons we explained in Booker.  Accordingly, as with the pro-
visions  in  Booker,  the  proper  remedy  here  is  to  invalidate 

$ 3742(g)(2). 

The  sentencing  proceeding  at  issue  in  Booker  itself  illus-
trates  why  $ 3742(g)(2)  cannot  withstand  Sixth  Amendment 
scrutiny.  The  District  Court  in  Booker  increased  the  de-
fendant's then-mandatory Guidelines range based on a drugquantity  finding  that  it,  rather  than  the  jury,  made.  543 
U. S.,  at  227.  After  we  held  that  the  Guidelines  must  be 
treated  as advisory, we remanded  the  case for resentencing. 
Id.,  at  267.  Had  $ 3742(g)(2)  remained  valid  after  Booker, 
the  District  Court  on  remand  would  have  been  required  to 
sentence  within  the  Guidelines  range  because  it  did  not  de-
part from the Guidelines at the original sentencing.  Accord-
ingly,  the  resentencing  judge  in  Booker  would  have  been 
required  under  $ 3742(g)(2)  to  impose  a  Guidelines  sentence 
based  on  judge-found  facts  concerning  drug  quantity,  the 
precise result that Booker forbids. 

The  same  result  would  occur  in  any  sentencing  in  which 
a  district  court  erroneously  refuses  to  impose  a  sentence 
outside  the  Guidelines  range  "based  on  a  misunderstanding 
of  its  authority  to  depart  under  or  vary  from  the  Guide-
lines."  Reply  Brief  for  United  States  16.  For  example,  if 

$ 3742(g)(2) remained valid, there would be no remedy at resentencing if a district court erroneously believed the Guide-
lines  were  presumptively  reasonable,  see  Nelson  v.  United 
States, 555 U. S. 350, 352 (2009) (per curiam), or if it mistak-

Opinion of the Court 
enly  thought  that  a  non-Guidelines  sentence  required  ex-
traordinary  circumstances,  see  Gall,  552  U. S.,  at  47,  or  if  it 
incorrectly concluded  that  it  could not  vary  from  the  Guide-
lines  based  on  a  policy  disagreement  with  their  disparate 
treatment of  crack and powder  cocaine, see  Kimbrough,  552 
U. S.,  at  101.  In  such  cases,  the  district  court  at  the  initial 
sentencing  proceeding  will  necessarily  have  imposed  a  sen-
tence  within  the  Guidelines  range,  and  thus  $ 3742(g)(2) 
would require the imposition of a Guidelines sentence on re-
mand.  See  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  3-5  (describing  fur-
ther categories of cases where "the Booker remedy would be 
entirely unavailable if $ 3742(g)(2) were valid"). 

To be sure, applying $ 3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not 
always  result  in  a  Sixth  Amendment  violation.  For  exam-
ple,  where  the  applicable  Guidelines  range  rests  solely  on 
facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, application 
of $ 3742(g)(2) at resentencing would not render the sentence 
constitutionally infirm.  But, as explained above, that possi-
bility was equally true with respect to the sentencing provi-
sions we invalidated in Booker.  See supra, at 495.  As with 
those  provisions,  "we  cannot  assume  that  Congress,  if  faced 
with  the  statute's  invalidity  in  key  applications,  would  have 
preferred  to  apply  the  statute  in  as  many  other  instances 
as  possible."  543  U. S.,  at  248.  Just  as  we  rejected  a  twotrack system in Booker that would have made the Guidelines 
mandatory in some cases and advisory in others, we reject a 
partial  invalidation  of  $ 3742(g)(2)  that  would  leave  us  with 
the same result. 

The  fact  that  $ 3742(g)(2)  permits  a  resentencing  court  on 
remand  to  impose  a  non-Guidelines  sentence  in  cases  where 
the prior sentence expressly relied upon a departure upheld 
by the  court of appeals  also  does not  cure  the  constitutional 
infirmity.  As  explained  above,  we  observed  in  Booker  that 
the availability of departures from the applicable Guidelines 
ranges in specified circumstances "does not avoid the consti-

Opinion of the Court 
tutional  issue."  Id.,  at  234.  Because  "departures  are  not 
available in every case, and in fact are unavailable in most," 
ibid., we held that remedying the Sixth Amendment problem 
required  invalidation  of  $ 3553(b)(1).  That  same  remedial 
approach requires us to invalidate $ 3742(g)(2).12 

Amicus contends that any constitutional infirmity in 

$ 3742(g)(2)  can  be  remedied  by  invalidating  $ 3742( j)(1)(B) 
rather  than  $ 3742(g)(2).  Brief  for  Amicus  Curiae  in  Sup-
port  of  Judgment  Below  21-22.  Section  3742( j)(1)(B)  pro-
vides  that  a  "ground  of  departure"  is  "permissible"  for 
purposes of $ 3742(g)(2)(B) only if it is, inter alia, "authorized 
under section 3553(b)."  In Booker, we noted that "statutory 
cross-references" to the SRA provisions we invalidated were 
also  constitutionally  infirm.  543  U. S.,  at  259.  Because 

$ 3742( j)(1)(B)  incorporates  a  cross-reference  to  $ 3553(b)(1), 
one  of  the  provisions  we  invalidated  in  Booker,  amicus 
suggests that invalidating $ 3742( j)(1)(B) would cure any con-
stitutional defect in $ 3742(g)(2)(B).  As the Government ex-
plains,  however,  even  if  $ 3742( j)(1)(B)  were  invalidated  and 
a district court could depart on any ground at an initial sen-
tencing, the district court would not be able to depart on any 
new  ground  at  resentencing  so  long  as  $ 3742(g)(2)  remains 

12 Amicus National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) 
argues  that,  because  $ 3742(g)(2)(B)  permits  a  non-Guidelines  sentence 
only with respect to certain "departures," that provision "appears to pre-
clude  sentencing  courts  on  remand  from  granting  any  and  all  variances 
under Section  3553(a)."  Brief for NACDL  11 (emphasis  added).  In  Iri-
zarry v.  United States, 553 U. S. 708 (2008), we held that a " `[d]eparture' 
is  a  term  of  art  under  the  Guidelines  and  refers  only  to  non-Guidelines 
sentences imposed under the framework set out in the Guidelines"; in con-
trast, a "variance" refers to a non-Guidelines sentence outside the Guide-
lines framework.  Id., at 714.  Irizarry's holding construed the term "de-
parture"  in  Rule  32(h)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure. 
Because  we  conclude  that  $ 3742(g)(2)  is  constitutionally  infirm  and  must 
be invalidated, we need not decide whether its reference to "departure[s]" 
includes variances.

Opinion of the Court 
in  force.  Because  amicus'  proposed  solution  would  still result  in  the  Guidelines  being  effectively  mandatory  at  resentencing  in  an  entire  set  of  cases,  it  fails  to  remedy  the fundamental constitutional defect of $ 3742(g)(2). 

2 
Amicus'  next  cluster  of  arguments  focuses  on  Congress' sentencing  objectives  under  $ 3553(a).  Preliminarily,  ami-

cus  contends  that  even  if  $ 3742(g)(2)  is  constitutionally  in-valid,  that  provision  reflects a  congressional  policy  determi-
nation that only information available at the time of original sentencing  should  be  considered,  and  that  this  policy  deter-
mination should inform our analysis of whether $ 3553(a) per-mits consideration of postsentencing rehabilitation evidence. 
This argument, however, is based on a faulty premise. Contrary to 

amicus' contention,  $ 3742(g)(2) does not reflect  a  congressional  purpose  to  preclude  consideration  of 

evidence  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation  at  resentencing. To  be  sure,  $ 3742(g)(2)  has  the  incidental  effect  of  limiting 
the  weight  a  sentencing  court  may  place  on  postsentencing rehabilitation by precluding the court from resentencing out-
side  the  Guidelines  range  on  a  "ground  of  departure"  on which it did  not previously rely.  But on its face, nothing in 

$ 3742(g)(2)  prohibits  a  district  court  from  considering  post-sentencing developments--including postsentencing reha-
bilitation--in  selecting  a  sentence  within  the  applicable Guidelines  range.  Section  3742(g)(2)  also  does  not  apply  to 
resentencings that occur for reasons other than  when a  sen-tence is overturned on appeal and the case is remanded (e. g., 
when  a  sentence  is  set  aside  on  collateral  review  under  28 U. S. C. $ 2255).  In such circumstances, $ 3742(g)(2) does not 
restrict a district court at all, much less with respect to con-sideration of postsentencing developments.  Accordingly, 
because  we  see  no  general  congressional  policy  reflected  in 

$ 3742(g)(2) to preclude resentencing courts from considering 

500  PEPPER  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
postsentencing  information,13  that  provision  has  no  bearing 
on our analysis of whether $ 3553(a) permits consideration of 
evidence of postsentencing rehabilitation. 

As  we  explained  above,  evidence  of  postsentencing  reha-
bilitation  may  be  highly  relevant  to  several  of  the  sentenc-
ing  factors  that  Congress  has  specifically  instructed  dis-
trict  courts  to  consider.  See  supra,  at  491-493  (discussing 

$$ 3553(a),  (a)(1),  (a)(2)(B)-(D)).  Amicus,  however,  argues 
that  consideration  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation  is  incon-
sistent  with  two  sentencing  factors:  $ 3553(a)(5),  which  di-
rects  sentencing  courts  to  consider  "any  pertinent  policy 
statement"  of  the  Sentencing  Commission,  and  $ 3553(a)(6), 
which requires courts to consider "the need to avoid unwar-
ranted  sentenc[ing]  disparities  among  defendants  with  simi-
lar  records  who  have  been  found  guilty  of  similar  conduct." 

With regard to $ 3553(a)(5), amicus points to the Sentenc-
ing  Commission's  policy  statement  in  USSG  $ 5K2.19,  which 
provides  that  "[p]ost-sentencing  rehabilitative  efforts,  even 
if exceptional, undertaken by a defendant after imposition of 
a  term  of  imprisonment  for  the  instant  offense[,]  are  not  an 
appropriate basis for a downward departure when resentenc-
ing  the  defendant  for  that  offense."  According  to  amicus, 
that  policy  statement  is  "clear  and  unequivocal,"  and  as  an 

13 For  those  of  us  for  whom  it  is  relevant,  the  legislative  history  of 

$ 3742(g)(2) confirms that the provision, enacted as part of the PROTECT 
Act  of  2003,  $ 401(e),  117  Stat.  671,  was  not  aimed  at  prohibiting  district 
courts  from  considering  postsentencing  developments.  Rather,  it  was 
meant to ensure that under the then-mandatory Guidelines system, when 
a particular departure was reversed on appeal, the district court could not 
impose the same sentence on remand on the basis of a different departure. 
See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66, pp. 58-59 (2003) (noting that $ 401 of the 
PROTECT  Act,  inter  alia,  "prevent[s]  sentencing  courts,  upon  remand, 
from  imposing  the  same  illegal  departure  on  a  different  theory").  Like 
the provisions invalidated in Booker, then, the purpose of $ 3742(g)(2) was 
"to  make  Guidelines sentencing  even more  mandatory  than it  had been." 
United  States  v.  Booker,  543  U. S.  220,  261  (2005).  As  we  recognized  in 
Booker, that purpose has "ceased to be relevant."  Ibid.

exercise  of  the  Sentencing  Commission's  "core  function," should be given effect.  Brief for Amicus Curiae in Support 

of Judgment Below 31-32. To be sure, we have recognized that the Commission postBooker  continues  to  "fil[l]  an  important  institutional  role" because  "[i]t  has  the  capacity  courts  lack  to  base  its  deter-
minations on empirical data and national experience, guided by  a  professional  staff  with  appropriate  expertise." 

Kim-brough, 552 U. S., at 109 (internal quotation marks omitted). 

Accordingly,  we  have  instructed  that  district  courts  must still  give  "respectful  consideration"  to  the  now-advisory 
Guidelines (and their accompanying policy statements).  Id., at 101.  As 

amicus acknowledges, however, our post-Booker decisions make clear that a district court may in appropriate 

cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on a disagree-ment  with  the  Commission's  views.  See  id.,  at  109-110. 
That  is  particularly  true  where,  as  here,  the  Commission's views  rest  on  wholly  unconvincing  policy  rationales  not  re-
flected in the sentencing statutes Congress enacted. The  commentary  to  USSG  $ 5K2.19  expresses  the  Com-
mission's  view  that  departures  based  on  postsentencing rehabilitation  would  "(1)  be  inconsistent  with  the  policies 
established by Congress  under  18 U. S. C. $ 3624(b) [govern-ing  good  time  credit]  and  other  statutory  provisions  for  re-
ducing  the  time  to  be  served  by  an  imprisoned  person;  and (2) inequitably benefit only those who gain the opportunity to 
be resentenced de novo."  With regard to the first proffered rationale, a sentencing reduction based on postsentencing re-
habilitation  can  hardly  be  said  to  be  "inconsistent  with  the policies"  underlying  an  award  of  good  time  credit  under 

$ 3624(b) because the two serve distinctly different penologi-cal  interests.

14  Indeed,  the  difference  between  the  two  is 

14 An  award  of  good  time  credit  by  the  Bureau  of  Prisons  (BOP)  does 
not affect the length of a court-imposed sentence; rather, it is an adminis-
trative  reward  "to  provide  an  incentive  for  prisoners  to  `compl[y]  with 
institutional disciplinary regulations.' "  Barber v.  Thomas, 560 U. S. 474, 

502  PEPPER  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
reflected  most  obviously  in  the  fact  that  the  BOP  has  no 
authority  to  award  good  time  credit  where,  as  in  this  case, 
the  defendant's  good  behavior  occurs  after  a  sentence  has 
already  been  served.15  The  Commission's  second  proffered 
rationale  fares  no  better.  To  be  sure,  allowing  district 
courts  to  consider  evidence  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation 
may result in disparate treatment between those defendants 
who  are  sentenced  properly  and  those  who  must  be  resen-
tenced.  But  that  disparity  arises  not  because  of  arbitrary 
or random sentencing practices, but because  of the  ordinary 
operation of appellate sentencing review. 

In  a  closely  related  vein,  amicus  argues  that  consider-
ation  of  postsentencing  rehabilitation  is  inconsistent  with 

$ 3553(a)(6), which requires sentencing courts to consider the 
need  to  avoid  unwarranted  sentencing  disparities.  The 
Court of Appeals also rested its holding on this ground, rea-

482 (2010) (quoting 18 U. S. C. $ 3624(b); alteration in original).  Such cred-
its  may  be  revoked  at  any  time  before  the  date  of  a  prisoner's  release. 
See  $ 3624(b)(2).  In  contrast,  a  court's  imposition  of  a  reduced  sentence 
based on postsentencing rehabilitation changes the very terms of impris-
onment and "recognizes that the [defendant's] conduct since his initial sen-
tencing  warrants  a  less  severe  criminal  punishment."  Brief  for  United 
States 50.  Once imposed, a sentence may be modified only in very limited 
circumstances.  See $ 3582(c). 

15 Amicus points to two other procedural mechanisms that may shorten 

a defendant's sentence--early termination of a term of supervised release, 
see $ 3583(e)(1), and the potential for sentencing reductions based on postsentencing  substantial  assistance,  see  Fed.  Rule  Crim.  Proc.  35(b)--but 
neither presents an adequate substitute for a district court's consideration 
of postsentencing rehabilitation.  Supervised release follows a term of im-
prisonment  and  serves  an  entirely  different  purpose  than  the  sentence 
imposed  under  $ 3553(a).  See  United  States  v.  Johnson,  529  U. S.  53,  59 
(2000) ("Supervised release fulfills rehabilitative ends, distinct from those 
served  by  incarceration").  Rule  35(b)  departures  address  only  postsen-
tencing  cooperation  with  the  Government,  not  postsentencing  rehabilita-
tion generally, and thus a defendant with nothing to offer the Government 
can gain no benefit from Rule 35(b).

soning  that  " `allowing  [postsentencing  rehabilitation]  evi-dence  to  influence  [defendant's]  sentence  would  be  grossly 

unfair  to  the  vast  majority  of  defendants  who  receive  no sentencing-court  review  of  any  positive  post-sentencing  re-
habilitative efforts.' "  570 F. 3d, at 965 (quoting McMannus, 496  F.  3d,  at  852,  n.  4).  But 

amicus  points  to  no  evidence, nor  are  we  aware  of  any,  suggesting  that  Congress  enacted 

$ 3553(a)(6)  out  of  a  concern  with  disparities  resulting  from the  normal  trial  and  sentencing  process.

16  The  differences 

in  procedural  opportunity  that  may  result  because  some defendants  are  inevitably  sentenced  in  error  and  must  be 

resentenced  are  not  the  kinds  of  "unwarranted"  sentencing disparities  that  Congress  sought  to  eliminate  under 

$ 3553(a)(6).  Cf.  United  States  v.  LaBonte,  520  U. S.  751, 761-762  (1997)  (disparity  arising from  exercise of  prosecuto-
rial  discretion  not  unwarranted);  United  States  v.  Rhodes, 145  F. 3d  1375, 1381  (CADC 1998)  ("Distinguishing  between 
prisoners  whose  convictions  are  reversed  on  appeal  and  all other prisoners hardly seems `unwarranted' "). 

As  the  Government  explains,  moreover,  the  logic  of  the Court  of Appeals'  approach  below--

i. e.,  that  "post-sentence rehabilitation  is  not  relevant . . .  because  the  district  court 

could  not  have  considered  that  evidence  at  the  time  of  the original  sentencing,"  570  F.  3d,  at  965  (internal  quotation 
marks  omitted)--would  require  sentencing  courts  categori-cally  to  ignore  not  only  postsentencing  rehabilitation,  but 

16 Indeed,  some  defendants  will  have  a  longer  period  of  time  between 
initial  custody  and  trial,  or  between  trial  and  sentencing,  and  those  de-
fendants--particularly  if  they  are  released  on  bail--will  have  a  greater 
opportunity  to  demonstrate  postoffense,  presentencing  rehabilitation. 
Even before Booker, the lower courts uniformly held that evidence of such 
rehabilitation  could  provide  a  basis  for  departing  from  the  applicable 
Guidelines.  See  USSG  App.  C,  Amdt.  602,  comment.,  p.  74  (Nov.  2003) 
("[D]epartures  based  on  extraordinary  post-offense  rehabilitative  efforts 
prior to sentencing . . . have been allowed by every circuit that has ruled 
on the matter").

Opinion of the Court 
any  postsentencing  information,  including,  for  example,  evi-
dence  that  a  defendant  had  committed  postsentencing  of-
fenses.  Our  precedents,  however,  provide  no  basis  to  sup-
port  such  a  categorical  bar.  See,  e. g.,  Wasman,  468  U. S., 
at  572  ("[A]  sentencing  authority  may  justify  an  increased 
sentence  by  affirmatively  identifying  relevant  conduct  or 
events  that  occurred  subsequent  to  the  original  sentencing 
proceedings");  cf.  North  Carolina  v.  Pearce,  395  U. S.  711, 
723  (1969).  Indeed,  even  the  Court  of  Appeals  below  does 
not  accept  the  logical  consequence  of  its  approach  as  it  per-
mits  district  courts  to  consider  postsentencing  conduct  that 
would support a higher sentence.  See United States v.  Sta-
pleton, 316 F. 3d 754, 757 (CA8 2003).  Nothing in $$ 3553(a) 
and  3661,  however,  remotely  suggests  that  Congress  in-
tended  district  courts  to  consider  only  postsentencing  evi-
dence  detrimental  to  a  defendant  while  turning  a  blind  eye 
to favorable evidence of a defendant's postsentencing rehabil-
itation.  Cf. United States v.  Jones,  460 F. 3d 191, 196  (CA2 
2006)  ("Obviously,  the  discretion  that  Booker  accords  sen-
tencing judges to impose non-Guidelines sentences cannot be 
an escalator that only goes up"). 

Finally,  we  note  that  $$ 3553(a)(5)  and (a)(6)  describe  only 
two of the seven sentencing factors that courts must consider 
in imposing sentence.  At root, amicus effectively invites us 
to elevate two $ 3553(a) factors above  all others.  We  reject 
that  invitation.  See  Gall,  552  U. S.,  at  49-50  (instructing 
sentencing  courts  to  "consider  all  of  the  $ 3553(a)  factors" 
(emphasis added)).

For  the  reasons  stated  above,  we  hold  that  the  Court  of 
Appeals erred in categorically precluding the District Court 
from  considering  evidence  of  Pepper's  postsentencing  reha-
bilitation  after  his  initial  sentence  was  set  aside  on  appeal. 
District  courts  post-Booker  may  consider  evidence  of  a  de-
fendant's  postsentencing  rehabilitation  at  resentencing  and 

505 Cite as: 562 U. S. 476 (2011) 
Opinion of the Court 
such  evidence  may,  in  appropriate  cases,  support  a  down-ward variance from the advisory Guidelines range.

17 

The Government informs us that, in granting Pepper's mo-tion  for  release  pending  disposition  of  this  appeal,  see  n.  5, 

supra, the District Court stated that it would not have exer-cised  its  discretion  to  grant  Pepper  a  downward  variance 
based on postsentencing rehabilitation.  That  statement, however, was made in light of the Court of Appeals' errone-
ous  views  regarding  postsentencing  rehabilitation  evidence. Because we expressly  reject those views today, it is  unclear 
from  the  record  whether  the  District  Court  would  have  im-posed  the  same  sentence  had  it  properly  considered  the  ex-
tensive  evidence  of  Pepper's  postsentencing  rehabilitation. On  remand,  the  District  Court  should  consider  and  give  ap-
propriate  weight  to  that  evidence,  as  well  as  any  additional evidence concerning Pepper's conduct since his last sentenc-
ing in January 2009.  Accordingly, we vacate the Eighth Cir-cuit's  judgment  in  respect  to  Pepper's  sentence  and  remand 
the case for resentencing consistent with this opinion. 

III 
The  second  question  presented  in  this  case  merits  only  a brief  discussion.  As  noted  above,  the  original  sentencing 

judge  in  this  case  granted  Pepper  a  40-percent  downward departure pursuant to USSG $ 5K1.1 based on Pepper's sub-
stantial  assistance  and  sentenced  him  to  24  months'  impris-onment.  When the Court of Appeals vacated that sentence 
in  Pepper  II,  and  again  in  Pepper  III,  the  case  was  reas-signed  on  remand  to  Chief  Judge  Reade.  In  resentencing 

17 Of course, we do not mean to imply that a district court must reduce 
a defendant's sentence upon any showing of postsentencing rehabilitation. 
Nor do we mean to preclude courts of appeals from issuing limited remand 
orders,  in  appropriate cases,  that  may  render  evidence  of  postsentencing 
rehabilitation  irrelevant  in  light  of  the  narrow  purposes  of  the  remand 
proceeding.  See, e. g., United States v.  Bernardo Sanchez, 569 F. 3d 995, 
1000 (CA9 2009). 

506  PEPPER  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
Pepper, Chief Judge Reade ruled that she was not bound by the  prior  sentencing  judge's  decision  to  grant  a  40-percent 

downward  departure  and  instead  granted  only  a  20-percent downward  departure,  which  the  Court  of  Appeals  upheld  in 
Pepper IV.  Pepper argues that the law of the case doctrine required  Chief  Judge  Reade  to  apply  the  same  40-percent 
departure  granted  by  the  original  sentencing  judge.  We disagree. 

Preliminarily, we note that the mandates in Pepper II and 
Pepper III were "general remand[s] for resentencing," which "did not  place any limitations  on the  discretion of the  newly 

assigned  district  court  judge  in  resentencing  Pepper."  570 F. 3d, at 963.  In his merits briefs to this Court, Pepper does 
not  challenge  the  scope  or  validity  of  the  Court  of  Appeals' 
mandate  ordering  de  novo  resentencing,  and  thus  has  aban-doned  any  argument  that  the  mandate  itself  restricted  the 

District  Court  from  imposing  a  different  substantial  assist-ance  departure.

18  The  only  question  before  us  is  whether 

the  law  of  the  case  doctrine  required  Chief  Judge  Reade  to adhere to the original sentencing judge's decision granting a 

40-percent downward departure. Although  we  have  described  the  "law  of  the  case  [a]s  an 
amorphous  concept,"  "[a]s  most  commonly  defined,  the  doc-trine  posits  that  when  a  court  decides  upon  a  rule  of  law, 
that  decision  should  continue  to  govern  the  same  issues  in subsequent  stages  in  the  same  case." 

Arizona  v.  Califor-
nia,  460  U. S.  605,  618  (1983).  This  doctrine  "directs  a court's  discretion,  it  does  not  limit  the  tribunal's  power." 

Ibid.  Accordingly, the doctrine "does not apply if the court 
is `convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly erroneous and 

18 In  any  event,  as  the  Court  of  Appeals  recognized,  neither  Pepper  II 
nor  Pepper  III  held  that  a  40-percent  downward  departure  was  the  only 
reasonable departure that a sentencing court could grant for Pepper's sub-
stantial  assistance;  rather,  the  only  issue  those  opinions  actually  decided 
was  that  a  "40%  downward  departure  was  not  an  abuse  of  discretion."

Opinion of the Court 
would  work  a  manifest  injustice.' "  Agostini  v.  Felton,  521 U. S. 203, 236 (1997) (quoting 

Arizona, 460 U. S., at 618, n. 8; 
alteration in original). Pepper argues that, because the orig inal sentencing 

judge's decision to grant the 40-percent departure was never set aside by the Court of Appeals or this Court, it constituted 
the  law  of  the  case.  As  such,  Pepper  contends  that  Chief 
Judge  Reade  should  not  have  disturbed  that  ruling  absent "compelling justification" for overturning it.  Brief for Peti-

tioner 56.  According to Pepper, because Chief Judge Reade identified  no  such  justification,  the  law  of  the  case  doctrine 
required  her  to  adhere  to  the  40-percent  departure  granted 
by the original sentencing judge. 

As  the  Government  explains,  however,  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals  in  Pepper  III  set  aside  Pepper's  entire  sentence  and 
remanded for a de novo resentencing.  See 518 F. 3d, at 949, 
953.  Thus,  even assuming,  arguendo,  that  the  original  sen-
tencing court's decision to impose a 40-percent departure was 
at  one  point  law  of  the  case,  Pepper  III  effectively  wiped 
the  slate  clean.  To  be  sure,  Pepper  III  vacated  Pepper's 
24-month  sentence  on  grounds  unrelated  to  the  substantial 
assistance departure, but that fact does not affect our conclu-
sion.  "A  criminal  sentence  is  a  package  of  sanctions  that 
the district court utilizes to effectuate its sentencing intent." 
United States v.  Stinson, 97 F. 3d 466, 469  (CA11 1996) (per 
curiam).  Because a district court's "original sentencing in-
tent may be undermined by altering one portion of the calcu-
lus,"  United  States  v.  White,  406  F.  3d  827,  832  (CA7  2005), 
an  appellate  court  when  reversing  one  part  of  a  defendant's 
sentence  "may  vacate  the  entire  sentence  . . . so  that,  on 
remand,  the  trial  court  can  reconfigure  the  sentencing  plan 
. . . to  satisfy the sentencing factors in 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a)," 
Greenlaw  v.  United  States,  554  U. S.  237,  253  (2008).  That 
is precisely what the Eighth Circuit did here. 

Accordingly,  because  the  Court  of  Appeals  in  Pepper  III 
remanded  for  de  novo  resentencing,  we  conclude  that  Chief

SKINNER  v.  SWITZER,  DISTRICT  ATTORNEY  FOR 

31st

522  SKINNER  v.  SWITZER 

Syllabus 
Held:  There  is  federal-court  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  Skinner's 

complaint,  and  the  claim  he  presses  is  cognizable  under  $ 1983. 
Pp. 529-537. 

(a)  Federal  Rule  of Civil  Procedure  8(a)(2)  generally requires  only  a 
plausible "short and plain" statement of the plaintiff's claim, not an ex-
position of his legal argument.  Skinner stated his due process claim in 
a  paragraph  alleging  that  the  State's  refusal  "to  release  the  biological 
evidence for testing . . .  deprived [him] of his liberty interests in utilizing 
state procedures to  obtain reversal of his conviction  and/or to obtain a 
pardon  or  reduction  of  his  sentence  .  .  .  ."  His  counsel  has  clarified 
that  Skinner  does  not  challenge  the  prosecutor's  conduct  or  the  CCA's 
decisions; instead, he challenges Texas' postconviction DNA statute "as 
construed" by the Texas courts.  Pp. 529-531. 

(b)  The Rooker-Feldman doctrine does not bar Skinner's suit.  This 
Court has applied the doctrine only in the two cases from which it takes 
its  name,  Rooker  v.  Fidelity  Trust  Co.,  263  U. S.  413,  and  District  of 
Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  v.  Feldman,  460  U. S.  462.  See  Exxon 
Mobil Corp. v.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280.  Given "the 
narrow ground" the doctrine occupies, id., at 284, the Court has confined 
Rooker-Feldman "to cases . . . brought by state-court losers . . . inviting  
district  court  review  and  rejection  of  [a  state  court's]  judgments,"  544 
U. S.,  at  284.  Skinner's  complaint  encounters  no  Rooker-Feldman 
shoal.  "If  a  federal  plaintiff  `present[s]  [an]  independent  claim,' "  it  is 
not an impediment to the exercise of federal jurisdiction that the "same 
or  a  related  question"  was  earlier  aired  between  the  parties  in  state 
court.  544 U. S., at 292-293.  A state-court decision is not reviewable 
by  lower  federal  courts,  but  a  statute  or  rule  governing  the  decision 
may be challenged in a federal action.  See, e. g., Feldman, 460 U. S., at 
487.  Because Skinner's federal case--which challenges not the adverse 
state-court  decisions  but  the  Texas  statute  they  authoritatively  con-
strued--falls  within  the  latter  category,  there  was  no  lack  of  subjectmatter jurisdiction over his federal suit.  Pp. 531-533. 

(c)  Measured against this Court's prior holdings, Skinner has properly 
invoked $ 1983.  This  Court has several times  considered when a  state 
prisoner, complaining of unconstitutional state action, may pursue a civil 
rights claim under $ 1983, and when habeas corpus is the prisoner's sole 
remedy.  The  pathmarking  decision,  Heck  v.  Humphrey,  512  U. S.  477, 
concerned  a  state  prisoner  who  brought  a  $ 1983  action  for  damages, 
alleging  that  he  had  been  unlawfully  investigated,  arrested,  tried,  and 
convicted.  This  Court  held  that  $ 1983  was  not  an  available  remedy 
because any award in the plaintiff's favor would "necessarily imply" the 
invalidity of his conviction.  See id., at 487.  In contrast, in Wilkinson 
v.  Dotson,  544  U. S.  74,  the  Court  held  that  prisoners  who  challenged 
the constitutionality of administrative decisions denying them parole eli-

Syllabus 
gibility  could  proceed  under  $ 1983,  for  they  sought  no  "injunction  or-
dering  .  .  .  immediate  or  speedier  release  into  the  community,"  id.,  at 
82,  and "a favorable  judgment  [would] not  `necessarily imply'  the inva-
lidity of [their] conviction[s] or sentence[s]," ibid.  Here, success in Skin-
ner's suit for DNA testing would not "necessarily imply" the invalidity 
of  his  conviction.  Test  results  might  prove  exculpatory,  but  that  out-
come is hardly inevitable, for those results could also prove inconclusive 
or  incriminating.  Switzer  argues  that,  although  Skinner's  immediate 
aim  is  DNA  testing,  his  ultimate  aim  is  to  use  the  test  results  as  a 
platform  for  attacking  his  conviction.  But  she  has  found  no  case  in 
which  the  Court  has  recognized  habeas  as  the  sole  remedy  where  the 
relief sought would not terminate custody, accelerate the date of release, 
or reduce  the custody level.  Contrary  to  the  fears  of Switzer  and her 
amici, in the  Circuits that  currently  allow  $ 1983  claims  for DNA  test-
ing, there has  been no  flood  of litigation  seeking  postconviction  discov-
ery  of  evidence  associated  with  the  questions  of  guilt  or  punishment. 
The projected toll on federal courts is all the more implausible regarding 
DNA  testing  claims,  for  Osborne  has  rejected  substantive  due  process 
as  a  basis  for  such  claims.  More  generally,  in  the  Prison  Litigation 
Reform  Act  of  1995,  Congress  has  placed  constraints  on  prisoner  suits 
in  order  to  prevent  sportive  federal-court  filings.  Nor  is  there  cause 
for  concern  that  the  instant  ruling  will  spill  over  to  claims  relying  on 
Brady v.  Maryland, 373 U. S.  83.  Brady, which announced a constitu-
tional requirement addressed to the prosecution's conduct pretrial, pro-
scribes withholding evidence "favorable to an accused" and "material to 
[his] guilt or to punishment."  Cone  v.  Bell, 556 U. S. 449, 451.  Unlike 
DNA  testing,  which  may  yield  exculpatory,  incriminating,  or  inconclu-
sive results, a successful Brady claim necessarily yields evidence under-
mining a conviction: Brady claims therefore rank within the traditional 
core of habeas corpus and outside the province of $ 1983.  Pp. 533-537. 

(d)  Switzer's  several  arguments  why  Skinner's  complaint  should  fail 
for lack of merit, unaddressed by the courts below, are ripe for consider-
ation on remand.  P. 537.

In  Wilkinson  v.  Dotson,  544  U. S.  74  (2005),  we  compre-hensively  surveyed  this  Court's  decisions  on  the  respective 
provinces of $ 1983 civil rights actions and $ 2254 federal ha-beas  petitions.  Habeas  is  the  exclusive  remedy,  we  reaf-
firmed,  for  the  prisoner  who  seeks  "immediate  or  speedier release"  from  confinement. 

Id.,  at  82.  Where  the  prison-er's  claim  would  not  "necessarily  spell  speedier  release," 

however,  suit  may  be  brought  under  $ 1983.  Ibid.  Adher-ing  to  our  opinion  in  Dotson,  we  hold  that  a  postconviction 
claim for DNA testing is properly pursued in a $ 1983 action. Success  in  the  suit  gains  for  the  prisoner  only  access  to  the 
DNA evidence, which may prove exculpatory, inculpatory, or inconclusive.  In  no  event  will  a  judgment  that  simply  or-
ders DNA tests "necessarily impl[y] the unlawfulness of the State's  custody." 

Id.,  at  81.  We  note,  however,  that  the Court's decision in Osborne severely limits the federal action 

a  state  prisoner  may  bring  for  DNA  testing.  Osborne  re-jected the extension of substantive  due process to this area, 
557  U. S.,  at  72,  and  left  slim  room  for  the  prisoner  to  show that the governing state law denies him procedural due proc-
ess, see id., at 71.  I 

In  1995,  a  Texas  jury  convicted  petitioner  Henry  Skinner and  sentenced  him  to  death  for  murdering  his  live-in  girl-
friend,  Twila  Busby,  and  her  two  sons.  Busby  was  blud-geoned  and  choked  with  an  axe  handle  and  her  sons  were 
stabbed  to death; the murders  were committed in the  house Busby shared with Skinner. 

Skinner  never  denied  his  presence  in  the  house  when  the killings  occurred.  He  claimed,  however,  that  he  was  inca-
pacitated  by  large  quantities  of  alcohol  and  codeine.  The potent  alcohol  and  drug  mix,  Skinner  maintained  at  trial, 
rendered  him  physically  unable  to  commit  the  brutal  mur-ders  charged  against  him.  Skinner  identified,  as  a  likely

perpetrator,  Busby's  uncle,  Robert  Donnell  (now  deceased), 
an  ex-convict  with  a  history  of  physical  and  sexual  abuse.1 
On  direct  appeal,  the  Texas  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals 
(CCA) affirmed Skinner's conviction and sentence.  Skinner 
v.  State,  956  S.  W.  2d  532,  546  (1997).  The  CCA's  opinion 
described the crime-scene evidence in detail: 

"As they approached the house . . . , the  police  noticed a 
trail of blood spots on the ground running from the front 
porch to the fence line.  There was a blood smear on the 
glass  storm door  and a knife on  the  front porch.  Upon 
entering  the  residence,  the  police  found  Twila's  dead 
body  on the  living  room  floor. . . . An  ax  handle  stained 
with  blood  and  hair  was  leaning  against  the  couch  near 
her body and a black plastic trash bag containing a knife 
and  a  towel  with  wet  brownish  stains  on  it  was  laying 
between the couch and the coffee table. 

"[One  officer]  proceeded  to  the  bedroom  where  [Bus-
by's  two sons]  usually  slept  in bunk  beds.  [The  officer] 
found  [one]  dead  body  laying  face  down  on  the  upper 
bunk,  covered  by  a  blood  spotted  blanket.  .  .  .  A  door 
leading  out  of  the  bedroom  and  into  a  utility  room 
yielded  further  evidence.  [He]  noticed  a  bloody  handprint  located  about  24  inches  off  the  floor  on  the  frame 
of  this  door.  He  also  noted  a  bloody  handprint  on  the 
door  knob  of  the  door  leading  from  the  kitchen  to  the 
utility  room  and  a  handprint  on  the  knob  of  the  door 
exiting from the utility room into the backyard. 

"[When] police arrested [Skinner] . . . [t]hey found him 
standing  in  a  closet  wearing  blood-stained  socks  and 
blood-stained blue jeans."  Id., at 536. 

1 At trial, a defense witness testified that, on the evening of the killings, 
Busby  had  spurned  Donnell's  "rude  sexual  advances."  Skinner  v.  State, 
956  S.  W.  2d  532,  535  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  1997).  A  neighbor  related  at  a 
federal  postconviction  hearing  that  she  observed  Donnell,  a  day  or  two 
after the murders, thoroughly cleaning the carpets and inside of his pickup 
truck.  See Skinner v.  Quarterman, 528 F. 3d 336, 345 (CA5 2008).

Investigators  also  retained  vag inal  swabs  taken  from Busby. 

In  preparation  for  trial,  "the  State  tested  the  blood  on [Skinner's]  clothing,  blood  and  hair  from  a  blanket  that  par-
tially  covered  one  of  the  victims,  and  hairs  on  one  of  the victim's  back  and  cheeks." 

Skinner  v.  State,  122  S.  W.  3d 808,  810  (Tex.  Crim.  App.  2003).  The  State  also  tested  fin-

gerprint evidence.  Some of this evidence--including bloody palm prints in the room where one victim was killed--impli-
cated  Skinner,  but  "fingerprints  on  a  bag  containing  one  of the knives" did not.  Ibid.  Items left untested included the 
knives found on the premises, the axe handle, vaginal swabs, fingernail clippings, and additional hair samples.  See 

ibid.2 In the decade following his conviction, Skinner unsuccess-

fully  sought  state  and  federal  postconviction  relief.  See 
Skinner  v.  Quarterman,  576  F.  3d  214  (CA5  2009),  cert.  de-nied, 559 U. S. 975 (2010).  He also pursued informal efforts 

to gain  access  to  untested biological  evidence  the  police had collected at the scene of the crime.

In  2001,  more  than  six  years  after  Skinner's  conviction, Texas enacted Article 64, a statute allowing prisoners to gain 

postconviction  DNA  testing  in  limited  circumstances.  Tex. Code  Crim.  Proc.  Ann.,  Art.  64.01(a)  (Vernon  Supp.  2010). 
To  obtain  DNA  testing  under  Article  64,  a  prisoner  must meet  one  of  two  threshold  criteria.  He  may  show  that,  at 
trial, testing either was "not available" or was "available, but 

2 After Skinner's conviction, the State performed DNA tests on certain 
additional  materials,  but  Skinner  took  no  part  in  the  selection  of  those 
materials  or  their  testing.  Skinner  maintains  that  these  ex  parte  tests 
were inconclusive.  See Complaint || 19, App. 12 (this "testing raised more 
questions than it answered").  But see Skinner v.  State, 122 S. W. 3d 808, 
811 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003) (some findings were "inculpatory"). 

3 Skinner's  trial  counsel,  although  aware  that  biological  evidence  re-

mained untested, did not request further testing.  Postconviction, Skinner 
sought DNA testing of vaginal swabs and fingernail clippings taken from 
Busby, blood and hairs on a jacket found next to Busby's body, and biologi-
cal  material  on  knives  and  a  dish  towel  recovered  at  the  crime  scene.

not  technologically  capable  of  providing  probative  results." Art. 64.01(b)(1)(A).  Alternatively, he may show that the ev-

idence  was  not  previously  tested  "through  no  fault"  on  his part, and that "the interests of justice" require a postconvic-
tion  order  for  testing.  Art.  64.01(b)(1)(B).  To  grant  a  mo-tion  for  postconviction  testing,  a  court  must  make  further 
findings,  prime  among  them,  the  movant  "would  not  have been  convicted  if  exculpatory  results  had  been  obtained 
through DNA testing," and "the [Article 64] request . . . [was] not made to unreasonably delay the execution of sentence or 
administration of justice."  Art. 64.03(a)(2). Invoking  Article  64,  Skinner  twice  moved  in  state  court, 
first  in  2001  and  again  in  2007,  for  DNA  testing  of  yet  un-tested  biological  evidence.  See  supra,  at  527,  n.  3.  Both 
motions were denied.  Affirming the denial of Skinner's first motion,  the  CCA  held  that  he  had  failed  to  demonstrate  a 
"reasonable probability . . . that he would not have been . . . convicted if the DNA test results were exculpatory."  Skin-
ner v.  State, 122 S. W. 3d, at 813. Skinner's  second  motion  was  bolstered  by  discovery  he 
had  obtained  in  the  interim.4  The  CCA  again  affirmed  the denial of relief under Article 64, this time on the ground that 
Skinner  failed  to  meet  the  "no  fault"  requirement.  See Skinner v.  State, 293 S. W. 3d 196, 200 (2009).

5  During postconviction proceedings, the CCA noted, trial counsel testified that he had not "ask[ed] for testing because he was afraid the 

4 On  the  basis  of  discovery  in  a  federal  postconviction  proceeding,  an 
expert  retained  by  Skinner  concluded  that  Skinner,  Busby,  and  her  two 
sons  could  be  excluded  as  sources  of  a  hair  collected  from  Busby's  right 
hand  after  the  killings.  See  Record  190.  See  also  Complaint  || 27, 
App. 18. 

5 The  District  Attorney,  in  response  to  Skinner's  second  motion,  in-

formed the Texas District Court that "[t]o the best of the State's informa-
tion, knowledge, and belief, the items sought to be tested are still available 
for testing, the chain of custody is intact, and the items are in a condition 
to  be  tested  although  the  State  has  not  sought  expert  opinion  in  that 
regard."  Record 202.  See also Complaint || 29, App. 19.

Skinner next filed the instant federal action for injunctive relief  under  $ 1983,  naming  as  defendant  respondent  Lynn 
Switzer, the District Attorney whose office prosecuted Skin-ner  and  has  custody  of  the  evidence  Skinner  would  like 
to  have  DNA  tested.  Skinner's  federal-court  complaint  al-leged  that  Texas  violated  his  Fourteenth  Amendment  right 
to  due  process  by  refusing  to  provide  for  the  DNA  testing he requested.  Complaint || 33, App. 20-21.  The Magistrate 
Judge recommended dismissal of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  App. 24-41. 
Under  the  governing  Circuit  precedent,  Kutzner  v.  Mont-gomery  County,  303  F.  3d  339,  the  Magistrate  Judge  ob-

Adopting  the  Magistrate  Judge's  recommendation,  the  Dis-trict Court dismissed Skinner's suit.  Id., at 44-45. 

On  appeal,  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the Fifth  Circuit  affirmed,  363  Fed.  Appx.  302  (2010)

corpus," id., at 303.  On Skinner's petition,6  we granted cer-tiorari,  560  U. S.  924  (2010),  and  now  reverse  the  Fifth  Cir-

[Skinner] will ultimately prevail" on his procedural due proc-ess  claim,  see  Scheuer  v.  Rhodes,  416  U. S.  232,  236  (1974), 

but whether his complaint was sufficient to cross the federal court's  threshold,  see  Swierkiewicz  v.  Sorema  N.  A.,  534 
U. S.  506,  514  (2002).  Skinner's  complaint  is  not  a  model  of the careful drafter's art, but under the Federal Rules of Civil 
Procedure, a complaint need not pin plaintiff 's claim for relief to  a  precise  legal  theory.  Rule  8(a)(2)  of  the  Federal  Rules 
of Civil Procedure generally requires only a plausible "short and  plain"  statement  of  the  plaintiff 's  claim,  not  an  exposi-
tion  of  his  legal  argument.  See  5  C.  Wright  &  A.  Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure $ 1219, pp. 277-278 (3d ed. 2004 
and Supp. 2010). Skinner stated his due process claim in a paragraph alleg-
ing that the State's refusal "to release the biological evidence for  testing  .  .  .  has  deprived  [him]  of  his  liberty  interests  in 
utilizing state procedures to obtain reversal of his conviction and/or to obtain a pardon or reduction of his sentence . . . ." 
Complaint  || 33,  App.  20-21.  As  earlier  recounted,  see supra, at 528-529, Skinner had twice requested and failed to 
obtain DNA testing under the only state-law procedure then available to him.  See Complaint |||| 22-31, App. 14-20.

7  At 

oral  argument  in  this  Court,  Skinner's  counsel  clarified  the gist of Skinner's due process claim: He does not challenge the 

prosecutor's conduct or the decisions reached by the CCA in applying Article 64 to his motions; instead, he challenges, as 
denying  him  procedural  due  process,  Texas'  postconviction DNA  statute  "as  construed"  by  the  Texas  courts.  Tr.  of 
Oral Arg. 56.  See also id., at 52-53 (Texas courts, Skinner's counsel  argued,  have  "construed  the  statute  to  completely 
foreclose  any  prisoner  who  could  have  sought  DNA  test-ing  prior  to  trial[,]  but  did  not[,]  from  seeking  testing" 
postconviction).8 

7 He also persistently sought the State's voluntary testing of the materi-
als he identified.  See Complaint || 31, App. 20.

Opinion of the Court 
The  merits  of  Skinner's  federal-court  complaint  assailing the  Texas  statute  as  authoritatively  construed,  and  particu-

larly  the  vitality  of  his  claim in  light  of  Osborne,  see  supra, at 525--unaddressed by the District Court or the Fifth Cir-
cuit--are  not  ripe  for  review.  We  take  up  here  only  the questions  whether  there  is  federal-court  subject-matter  ju-
risdiction  over  Skinner's  complaint,  and  whether  the  claim he presses is cognizable under $ 1983. 

B 
Respondent  Switzer  asserts  that  Skinner's  challenge  is "[ j]urisdictionally  [b]arred"  by  what  has  come  to  be  known 

as  the  Rooker-Feldman  doctrine.  Brief  for  Respondent 48-49  (boldface deleted).  In  line  with  the  courts  below, we 
conclude  that  Rooker-Feldman  does  not  bar  Skinner's  suit. As we explained in 

Exxon Mobil Corp. v.  Saudi Basic In-
dustries  Corp.,  544  U. S.  280  (2005),  the  Rooker-Feldman doctrine has been applied by this Court only twice, i. e., only 

in  the  two  cases  from  which  the  doctrine  takes  its  name: first, Rooker v.  Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923), then 
60  years  later,  District  of  Columbia  Court  of  Appeals  v. Feldman,  460  U. S.  462  (1983).  Both  cases  fit  this  pattern: 
The  losing  party  in  state  court 9  filed  suit  in  a  U. S.  District Court  after  the  state  proceedings  ended,  complaining  of  an 

injury  caused  by  the  state-court  judgment  and  seeking federal-court review and rejection of that judgment.  Alleg-
ing federal-question jurisdiction, the plaintiffs in Rooker and Feldman  asked the District Court to overturn the injurious 
state-court judgment.  We held, in both cases, that the Dis-trict  Courts  lacked  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  such 

process through . . . a federal lawsuit," id., at 71, Skinner first resorted to 
state court, see supra, at 528-529.  In this respect, Skinner is better posi-
tioned to urge in federal court "the inadequacy of the state-law procedures 
available to him in state postconviction relief."  Osborne, 557 U. S., at 71. 

9 The  judgment  assailed  in  Feldman  was  rendered  by  the  District  of 

Columbia Court of Appeals, equivalent for this purpose to a State's high-
est court.

claims,  for  28  U. S. C.  $ 1257  "vests  authority  to  review  a state  court's  judgment  solely  in  this  Court."  See  Exxon, 

544 U. S., at 292. We observed in Exxon that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine 
had  been  construed  by  some  federal  courts  "to  extend  far beyond  the  contours  of  the 

Rooker  and  Feldman  cases." 544  U. S.,  at  283.  Emphasizing  "the  narrow  ground"  occu-

pied  by  the  doctrine,  id.,  at  284,  we  clarified  in  Exxon  that Rooker-Feldman "is confined to cases of the kind from which 
the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers . . . inviting district court review and rejection of [the 
state court's] judgments," 544 U. S., at 284. Skinner's  litigation,  in  light  of 

Exxon,  encounters  no Rooker-Feldman  shoal.  "If  a  federal  plaintiff  `present[s] 

[an] independent claim,' " it is not an impediment to the exer-cise  of federal  jurisdiction  that  the  "same  or  a related  ques-
tion"  was  earlier  aired  between  the  parties  in  state  court. 544  U. S.,  at  292-293  (quoting  GASH  Assocs.  v.  Rosemont, 
995 F. 2d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); first alteration in original); see In  re  Smith,  349  Fed.  Appx.  12,  18  (CA6  2009)  (Sutton,  J., 
concurring in part and dissenting in part) (a defendant's fed-eral  challenge  to  the  adequacy  of  state-law  procedures  for 
postconviction DNA testing is not within the "limited grasp" of 

Rooker-Feldman). As earlier noted, see supra, at 530, Skinner does not chal-

lenge the adverse CCA decisions themselves; instead, he tar-gets  as  unconstitutional  the  Texas  statute  they  authorita-
tively  construed.  As  the  Court  explained  in  Feldman,  460 U. S.,  at  487,  and  reiterated  in 

Exxon,  544  U. S.,  at  286,  a state-court  decision  is  not  reviewable  by  lower  federal 

courts,  but  a  statute  or  rule  governing  the  decision  may  be challenged in a federal action.

10  Skinner's federal case falls 

10 The  Court  further  observed  in  Exxon  Mobil  Corp.  v.  Saudi  Basic 
Industries Corp., 544 U. S. 280, 292-293 (2005), that "[w]hen there is paral-
lel state and federal litigation," state preclusion law may become decisive, 
but "[p]reclusion . . . is not a jurisdictional matter."

within the latter category.  There was, therefore, no lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over Skinner's federal suit.

C 
When  may  a  state  prisoner,  complaining  of  unconstitu-tional  state  action,  pursue  a  civil  rights  claim  under  $ 1983, 

and when is habeas corpus the prisoner's sole remedy?  This Court  has  several  times  considered  that  question.  Pathmarking  here  is  Heck  v.  Humphrey,  512  U. S.  477  (1994). The  plaintiff  in  that  litigation  was  a  state  prisoner  serving 
time for manslaughter.  He brought a $ 1983 action for dam-ages,  alleging  that  he  had  been  unlawfully  investigated,  ar-
rested,  tried,  and  convicted.  Although  the  complaint  in 
Heck  sought  monetary  damages  only,  not  release  from  con-finement, we ruled that the plaintiff could not proceed under 

$ 1983.  Any award in his favor, we observed, would "neces-sarily imply" the invalidity of his conviction.  See 

id., at 487. When "a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily 

imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence," the Court held,  $ 1983  is  not  an  available  remedy.  Ibid.  "But  if . . .  
the plaintiff 's action, even if successful, will not demonstrate the  invalidity  of [his  conviction  or sentence], the  [$ 1983] ac-
tion should be allowed to proceed . . . ."   Ibid. We  summarized  the  relevant  case  law  most  recently  in 
Wilkinson  v.  Dotson,  544  U. S.  74  (2005).  That  case  in-volved  prisoners  who  challenged  the  constitutionality  of  ad-
ministrative decisions denying them parole eligibility.  They could  proceed  under  $ 1983,  the  Court  held,  for  they  sought 
no  "injunction  ordering  .  .  .  immediate  or  speedier  release into  the  community," 

id.,  at  82,  and  "a  favorable  judgment 

11 Switzer asserts that Skinner could have raised his federal claim in the 
Article  64  proceeding.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  48.  Even  if  that  were  so, 
"Rooker-Feldman  is  not  simply  preclusion  by  another  name,"  Lance  v. 
Dennis, 546 U. S. 459, 466 (2006) (per curiam), and questions of preclusion 
unresolved  below  are  "best  left  for  full  airing  and  decision  on  remand,"

Opinion of the Court 
[would] not `necessarily imply the invalidity of [their] convic-tion[s] or sentence[s],' " ibid. (quoting Heck, 512 U. S., at 487; 

first alteration added). Measured against our prior holdings, Skinner has properly 
invoked  $ 1983.  Success  in  his  suit  for  DNA  testing  would not  "necessarily  imply"  the  invalidity  of  his  conviction. 
While  test  results  might  prove  exculpatory,  that  outcome  is hardly  inevitable;  as  earlier  observed,  see 

supra,  at  525,  re-sults might prove inconclusive or they might further incrimi-

nate  Skinner.  See  Nelson  v.  Campbell,  541  U. S.  637,  647 (2004)  ("[W]e  were careful  in  Heck  to stress  the  importance 
of the term `necessarily.' ").12 Respondent  Switzer  nevertheless  argues,  in  line  with 
Fifth  Circuit  precedent,  see  Kutzner,  303  F.  3d,  at  341,  that Skinner's request for DNA testing must be pursued, if at all, 
in  an  application  for  habeas  corpus,  not  in  a  $ 1983  action. The  dissent  echoes  Switzer's  argument.  See 

post,  at  539. Although Skinner's immediate plea is simply for an order re-

quiring  DNA  testing,  his  ultimate  aim,  Switzer  urges,  is  to use the test results as a platform for attacking his conviction. 
It  suffices  to  point  out  that  Switzer  has  found  no  case,  nor has the dissent, in which the Court has recognized habeas as 
the  sole  remedy,  or  even  an  available  one,  where  the  relief sought  would  "neither  terminat[e]  custody,  accelerat[e]  the 
future  date of release from  custody, nor  reduc[e] the  level of custody."

ated with the central questions of guilt or punishment."  Id., 
at  6.  These  fears,  shared  by  the  dissent,  post,  at  542,  are 
unwarranted.13 

In the Circuits that currently allow $ 1983 claims for DNA 
testing,  see  supra,  at  524,  no  evidence  tendered  by  Switzer 
shows  any  litigation  flood  or  even  rainfall.  The  projected 
toll  on  federal  courts  is  all  the  more  implausible  regarding 
DNA  testing  claims,  for  Osborne  has  rejected  substantive 
due process as a basis for such claims.  See supra, at 525. 

More  generally,  in  the  Prison  Litigation  Reform  Act  of 
1995 (PLRA), 110 Stat. 1321-66, Congress has placed a series 
of controls on prisoner suits, constraints designed to prevent 
sportive  filings  in  federal  court.  See,  e. g.,  PLRA  $ 803(d) 
(adding 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e to create new procedures and pen-
alties  for  prisoner  lawsuits  under  $ 1983);  PLRA  $ 804(a)(3) 
(adding  28  U. S. C.  $ 1915(b)(1)  to  require  any  prisoner  pro-
ceeding  in  forma  pauperis  to pay  the full filing fee out of a 
percentage  of  his  prison  trust  account);  PLRA  $ 804(c)(3) 
(adding  28  U. S. C.  $ 1915(f)  to  require  prisoners  to  pay  the 
full  amount  of  any  cost  assessed  against  them  out  of  their 
prison  trust  account);  PLRA  $ 804(d)  (adding  28  U. S. C.

13 Unlike the parole determinations at issue in Wilkinson v.  Dotson, 544 
U. S.  74  (2005),  Switzer  urges,  claims  like  Skinner's  require  inquiry  into 
the  State's  proof  at  trial  and  therefore  lie  at  "the  core  of  the  criminal 
proceeding  itself."  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  41;  see  id.,  at  33-34.  Dotson  de-
clared, however, in no uncertain terms, that when a prisoner's claim would 
not "necessarily spell speedier release," that claim does not lie at "the core 
of habeas corpus," and may be brought, if at all, under $ 1983.  544 U. S., 
at  82  (majority  opinion)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  id.,  at

lawsuits  that  fail  to  state  a  claim,  or  are  malicious  or  frivo-lous).  See  also 

Crawford-El  v.  Britton,  523  U. S.  574,  596- 
597  (1998)  (PLRA  aims  to  "discourage  prisoners  from  filing claims  that  are  unlikely  to  succeed,"  and  statistics  suggest 

that the Act is "having its intended effect"). Nor  do  we  see  any  cause  for  concern  that  today's  ruling 
will  spill  over  to  claims  relying  on  Brady  v.  Maryland,  373 
U. S.  83  (1963);  indeed,  Switzer  makes  no  such  assertion. 
Brady  announced  a  constitutional  requirement  addressed 
first  and  foremost  to  the  prosecution's  conduct  pretrial. 
Brady  proscribes  withholding  evidence  "favorable  to  an  ac-
cused" and "material to [his] guilt or to punishment."  Cone 
v.  Bell, 556  U. S. 449, 451  (2009).  To establish that  a Brady 
violation  undermines  a  conviction,  a  convicted  defendant 
must make each of three showings:  (1) the evidence at  issue 
is "favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, 
or  because  it  is  impeaching";  (2)  the  State  suppressed 
the  evidence,  "either  willfully  or  inadvertently";  and  (3) 
"prejudice  .  .  .  ensued."  Strickler  v.  Greene,  527  U. S.  263, 
281-282  (1999);  see  Banks  v.  Dretke,  540  U. S.  668,  691 
(2004). 

Unlike DNA testing, which may yield exculpatory, incrimi-
nating, or inconclusive results, a Brady claim, when success-
ful  postconviction,  necessarily  yields  evidence  undermining 
a  conviction:  Brady  evidence  is,  by  definition,  always  favor-
able to the defendant and material to his guilt or punishment. 
See  Strickler,  527  U. S.,  at  296.  And  parties  asserting 
Brady  violations  postconviction  generally  do  seek  a  judg-
ment  qualifying  them  for  "immediate  or  speedier  release" 
from  imprisonment.  See  Dotson,  544  U. S.,  at  82.  Accord-
ingly,  Brady  claims  have  ranked  within  the  traditional  core 
of  habeas  corpus  and  outside  the  province  of  $ 1983.  See 
Heck,  512  U. S.,  at  479,  490  (claim  that  prosecutors  and  an 
investigator had " `knowingly destroyed' evidence `which was 
exculpatory  in  nature  and  could  have  proved  [petitioner's] 
innocence' "  cannot  be  maintained  under  $ 1983);  Amaker  v.

land's  Rule  35 is  an  "application for  State  post-conviction  or other collateral review." 

The  parties  agree  that  the  answer  to  this  question  turns on  the  meaning  of  the  phrase  "collateral  review,"  see  Brief 
for  Petitioner  19;  Brief  for  Respondent  12-13,  but  they  dis-agree  about  the  definition  of  that  term.  Rhode  Island  ar-
gues that "collateral review" includes only "legal" challenges to  a  conviction  or  sentence  and  thus  excludes  motions  seek-
ing a discretionary sentence reduction.  Respondent, on the other  hand,  maintains  that  "collateral  review"  is  "review 
other than review of a judgment in the direct appeal process" and thus includes motions to reduce sentence.  Brief for Re-
spondent 17.  We  agree with  respondent's understanding of "collateral review."

"Collateral review" is not defined in AEDPA, and we have never  provided  a  comprehensive  definition  of  that  term.

Held:  Because  Exemption  2  encompasses  only  records  relating  to  em-

ployee  relations  and  human  resources  issues,  the  explosives  maps  and 
data  requested  here  do  not  qualify  for  withholding  under  that  exemp-
tion.  Pp. 569-581. 

(a)  Exemption  2  shields  only  those  records  relating  to  "personnel 
rules  and  practices."  When  used  as  an  adjective  in  this  manner,  the 
key  statutory  word  "personnel"  refers  to  human  resources  matters. 
For  example,  a  "personnel  department"  deals  with  employee  problems 
and  interviews  applicants  for  jobs.  FOIA  Exemption  6  provides  an-
other example, protecting certain "personnel . . . files" from disclosure.

tices" all share a critical feature: They concern conditions of employment 
in  federal  agencies--such  matters  as  hiring  and  firing,  work  rules  and 
discipline, compensation and benefits.  These items currently fall within 
the so-called Low 2 exemption.  And under this Court's construction of 
the statutory language, Low 2 is all of 2. 

FOIA's purpose reinforces this reading.  The statute's goal is "broad 
disclosure,"  and  the  exemptions  must  be  "given  a  narrow  compass." 
Department  of  Justice  v.  Tax  Analysts,  492  U. S.  136,  151.  A  narrow 
construction  stands  on  especially  firm  footing  with  respect  to  Exemp-
tion  2,  which  was  intended  to  hem  in  the  expansive  withholding  that 
occurred  under  the  prior  APA  exemption  for  "internal  management" 
records. 

Exemption 2, as interpreted here, does not reach the requested explo-
sives  information.  The  data  and  maps,  which  calculate  and  visually 
portray the  magnitude of  hypothetical  detonations, in  no way relate  to 
"personnel  rules  and  practices,"  as  that  term  is  most  naturally  under-
stood.  Pp. 569-573. 

(b)  The Government's two alternative readings of Exemption 2 cannot 
be squared with the statute.  Pp. 573-580. 

(c)  While  the  Navy  has  a  strong  security  interest  in  shielding  the 
explosives  data  and  maps  from  public  disclosure,  the  Government  has 
other tools at hand to protect such information: FOIA Exemption 1 pre-
vents access to classified documents; Exemption 3 applies to records that 
any  other  statute  exempts  from  disclosure;  and  Exemption  7  protects 
"information compiled for law enforcement purposes" if its release, inter 
alia,  "could  reasonably  be  expected  to  endanger  the  life  or  physical 
safety of any individual," $ 552(b)(7)(F).  The Navy's argument that the

explosives  information  is  exempt  under  Exemption  7  remains  open  for 
the Ninth Circuit to address on remand.  And if these or other exemp-
tions  do  not  cover  records  whose  release  would  threaten  the  Nation's 
vital  interests,  the  Government  may  of  course  seek  relief  from  Con-
gress.  Pp. 580-581.

a FOIA request for data and maps used to help store explo-sives  at  a  naval  base  in  Washington  State.  We  hold  that 

Exemption 2 does not stretch so far. 

I 
Congress  enacted  FOIA  to  overhaul  the  public-disclosure section of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. 

$ 1002  (1964  ed.).  That  section  of  the  APA  "was  plagued with  vague  phrases"  and  gradually  became  more  "a  with-
holding  statute  than  a  disclosure  statute."  EPA  v.  Mink, 410 U. S. 73, 79 (1973).  Congress intended FOIA to "permit 
access  to  official  information  long  shielded  unnecessarily from public view."  Id., at 80.  FOIA thus mandates that an 
agency  disclose  records  on  request,  unless  they  fall  within one  of  nine  exemptions.  These  exemptions  are  "explicitly 
made  exclusive,"  id.,  at  79,  and  must  be  "narrowly  con-strued," 

FBI v.  Abramson, 456 U. S. 615, 630 (1982). At  issue  here  is  Exemption  2,  which  shields  from  com-

pelled  disclosure  documents  "related  solely  to  the  internal personnel  rules  and  practices  of  an  agency."  $ 552(b)(2). 
Congress enacted Exemption 2 to replace the APA's exemp-tion  for  "any  matter  relating  solely  to  the  internal  manage-
ment  of  an  agency,"  5  U. S. C.  $ 1002  (1964  ed.).  Believing that  the  "sweep"  of  the  phrase  "internal  management"  had 
led to excessive withholding, Congress drafted Exemption 2 "to  have  a  narrower  reach." 

Department  of  Air  Force  v. Rose, 425 U. S. 352, 362-363 (1976). 

We  considered  the  extent  of  that  reach  in  Department  of Air  Force  v.  Rose.  There,  we  rejected  the  Government's 
invocation  of  Exemption  2  to  withhold  case  summaries  of honor  and  ethics  hearings  at  the  United  States  Air  Force 
Academy.  The  exemption,  we  suggested,  primarily  targets material concerning employee relations or human resources: 
" `use  of  parking  facilities  or  regulations  of  lunch  hours, statements  of policy  as to  sick  leave, and  the  like.' " 

Id.,  at 363  (quoting  S.  Rep.  No.  813,  89th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.,  8  (1965) 

566  MILNER  v.  DEPARTMENT  OF  NAVY 

Opinion of the Court 
(hereinafter  S.  Rep.));  see  Rose,  425  U. S.,  at  367.  "[T]he general  thrust"  of  Exemption  2,  we  explained,  "is  simply  to 

relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintaining [such  information]  for  public  inspection." 

Id.,  at  369.  We 
concluded  that  the  case  summaries  did  not  fall  within  the exemption because they "d[id] not concern only routine mat-

ters" of "merely internal significance."  Id., at 370.  But we 
stated  a  possible  caveat  to  our  interpretation  of  Exemption 2: That  understanding  of  the provision's  coverage governed, 

we wrote, "at least where the situation is not one where dis-closure  may  risk  circumvention  of  agency  regulation." 

Id., 
at 369. In 

Crooker v.  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 670 
F.  2d  1051  (1981)  (en  banc),  the  D.  C.  Circuit  converted this  caveat  into  a  new  definition  of  Exemption  2's  scope. 

Crooker approved the use of Exemption 2 to shield a manual 
designed  to  train  Government  agents  in  law  enforcement 
surveillance techniques.  The D. C. Circuit noted that it pre-
viously had  understood Exemption  2  to  "refe[r] only  to `pay, 
pensions,  vacations,  hours  of  work,  lunch  hours,  parking[,] 
etc.' "  Id.,  at  1056  (quoting  Jordan  v.  Department  of  Jus-
tice,  591  F.  2d  753,  763  (1978)).  But  the  court  now  thought 
Exemption 2 should also cover any "predominantly internal" 
materials,1  Crooker, 670 F. 2d, at 1056-1057, whose disclosure 
would  "significantly  ris[k]  circumvention  of  agency  regula-
tions or statutes," id., at 1074.  This construction of Exemp-
tion  2,  the  court  reasoned,  flowed  from  FOIA's  "overall  de-
sign,"  its  legislative  history,  "and  even  common  sense," 
because Congress could not have meant to "enac[t] a statute 

1 The court  adopted  the "predominantly  internal"  standard  as  a  way of 
implementing  the  exemption's  requirement that  materials  "relat[e]  solely 
to"  an  agency's  internal  personnel  rules  and  practices.  The  word 
"solely," the court reasoned, "has to be given the construction, consonant 
with reasonableness, of `predominantly' " because otherwise "solely" would 
conflict with the expansive term "related."  670 F. 2d, at 1056 (some inter-
nal quotation marks omitted).

whose  provisions  undermined  .  .  .  the  effectiveness  of  law enforcement agencies."  Ibid. 

In the ensuing years, three Courts of Appeals adopted the D. C. Circuit's interpretation of Exemption 2.  See 575 F. 3d 
959, 965 (CA9 2009) (case below); Massey v.  FBI, 3 F. 3d 620, 622  (CA2  1993); 

Kaganove  v.  EPA,  856  F.  2d  884,  889  (CA7 1988).
2  And  that  interpretation  spawned  a  new  terminol-

ogy: Courts applying the Crooker approach now refer to the "Low  2"  exemption  when  discussing  materials  concerning 

human  resources  and  employee  relations,  and  to  the  "High 2" exemption when assessing records whose disclosure would 
risk  circumvention  of  the  law.  See,  e. g.,  575  F.  3d,  at  963; Schiller v.  NLRB, 964 F.  2d 1205, 1208 (CADC 1992).  Con-
gress, as well, took notice of the D. C. Circuit's decision, bor-rowing  language  from 

Crooker  to  amend  Exemption  7(E) when  next  enacting  revisions  to  FOIA.  The  amended  ver-

sion  of  Exemption  7(E)  shields  certain  "records  or  informa-tion  compiled  for  law  enforcement  purposes"  if  their  disclo-
sure  "could  reasonably be  expected  to  risk  circumvention  of the  law."  $ 552(b)(7)(E);  see  Freedom  of  Information  Re-
form Act of 1986, $ 1802(a), 100 Stat. 3207-49.

2 Three other Courts of Appeals had previously taken  a narrower  view 
of Exemption 2's scope, consistent with the interpretation adopted in De-
partment of  Air Force  v.  Rose,  425 U. S. 352  (1976).  See Cox  v.  Depart-
ment  of  Justice,  576  F.  2d  1302,  1309-1310  (CA8  1978)  (concluding  that 
Exemption 2 covers only an agency's internal "housekeeping matters" (in-
ternal  quotation  marks  omitted));  Stokes  v.  Brennan,  476  F.  2d  699,  703 
(CA5 1973) (holding that Exemption 2 "must not be read so broadly as to 
exempt"  an  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Administration  manual  for 
training compliance officers); Hawkes v.  IRS, 467 F. 2d 787, 797 (CA6 1972) 
("[T]he internal practices and policies referred to in [Exemption 2] relate 
only  to . . .  employee-employer  type  concerns").  These  Circuits  have 
never revised their understandings of the exemption.  See n. 7, infra.

Opinion of the Court 
Sound, Washington.  The Navy keeps weapons, ammunition, 
and  explosives  on  the  island.  To  aid  in  the  storage  and 
transport  of  these  munitions,  the  Navy  uses  data  known 
as Explosive Safety  Quantity  Distance  (ESQD)  informa-
tion.  575 F.  3d, at 962.  ESQD information prescribes 
"minimum  separation  distances"  for  explosives  and  helps 
the  Navy  design  and  construct  storage  facilities  to  prevent 
chain  reactions  in  case  of  detonation.  Ibid.  The  ESQD 
calculations  are  often  incorporated  into  specialized  maps 
depicting  the  effects  of  hypothetical  explosions.  See,  e. g., 
App. 52. 

In  2003  and  2004,  petitioner  Glen  Milner,  a  Puget  Sound 
resident, submitted FOIA requests for all ESQD information 
relating  to  Indian  Island.  575  F.  3d,  at  962.  The  Navy  re-
fused  to  release  the  data,  stating  that  disclosure  would 
threaten  the  security  of  the  base  and  surrounding  commu-
nity.  In support of its decision to withhold the records,  the 
Navy invoked Exemption 2.  Ibid.3 

The  District  Court  granted  summary  judgment  to  the 
Navy, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the High 
2  interpretation  developed  in  Crooker.  575  F.  3d,  at  963. 
The Court of Appeals explained  that the  ESQD information 
"is  predominantly  used  for  the  internal  purpose  of  instruct-
ing  agency  personnel  on  how  to  do  their  jobs."  Id.,  at  968. 
And disclosure of the material, the court determined, "would 
risk  circumvention  of  the  law"  by  "point[ing]  out  the  best 
targets for those bent on wreaking havoc"--for example, "[a] 
terrorist who wished to hit the most damaging target."  Id., 

3 The  Navy  also  invoked  Exemption  7(F),  which  applies  to  "records  or 
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent 
that the production of such . . . records . . . could reasonably be expected 
to  endanger  the  life  or  physical  safety  of  any  individual."  5  U. S. C. 

$ 552(b)(7)(F).  The  courts  below  did  not  decide  whether  the  Navy  could 
withhold  the  ESQD  data under  that  exemption.  575  F.  3d  959,  971,  n.  8 
(CA9 2009); No. CV-06-01301 (WD Wash., Oct. 30, 2007), App. to Pet. for

Opinion of the Court 
at 971.  The ESQD information, the court concluded, there-fore qualified for a High 2 exemption.  Ibid. 

We granted  certiorari  in  light  of the  Circuit  split  respect-ing  Exemption  2's  meaning,  561  U. S.  1024  (2010),  and  we 
now reverse.  III 

Our  consideration  of  Exemption  2's  scope  starts  with  its text.  See, e. g., Park 'N Fly, Inc. v.  Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 
469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985) ("Statutory construction must begin with the language employed by Congress and the assumption 
that  the  ordinary  meaning  of  that  language  accurately  ex-presses  the  legislative  purpose").  Judicial  decisions  since 
FOIA's  enactment  have  analyzed  and  reanalyzed  the  mean-ing of the exemption.  But comparatively little attention has 
focused on the provision's 12 simple words: "related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency." 

The  key  word  in  that  dozen--the  one  that  most  clearly marks  the  provision's  boundaries--is  "personnel."  When 
used  as  an  adjective,  as  it  is  here  to  modify  "rules  and practices,"  that  term  refers  to  human  resources  matters. 
"Personnel," in this  common  parlance, means  "the  selection, placement, and training of employees and . . . the formulation 
of  policies, procedures,  and relations  with  [or  involving] em-ployees or their representatives."  Webster's Third New In-
ternational  Dictionary  1687  (1966)  (hereinafter  Webster's). So,  for  example,  a  "personnel  department"  is  "the  depart-
ment  of  a  business  firm  that  deals  with  problems  affecting the  employees  of  the  firm  and  that  usually  interviews  ap-
plicants  for  jobs."  Random  House  Dictionary  1075  (1966) (hereinafter  Random  House).  "Personnel  management"  is 
similarly  "the  phase  of  management  concerned  with  the engagement  and  effective  utilization  of  manpower  to  obtain 
optimum  efficiency  of  human  resources."  Webster's  1687. And  a  "personnel  agency"  is  "an  agency  for  placing  employ-
able  persons  in  jobs;  employment  agency."  Random  House 1075. 

570  MILNER  v.  DEPARTMENT  OF  NAVY 

Opinion of the Court 
FOIA  itself  provides  an  additional  example  in  Exemp-tion  6.  See  Ratzlaf  v.  United  States,  510  U. S.  135,  143 

(1994)  ("A  term  appearing  in  several  places  in  a  statutory text  is  generally  read  the  same  way  each  time  it  appears"). 
That  exemption,  just  a  few  short  paragraphs  down  from Exemption  2,  protects from  disclosure "personnel  and medi-
cal files and similar files the disclosure of which would consti-tute  a  clearly  unwarranted  invasion  of  personal  privacy." 

$ 552(b)(6).  Here too, the statute uses the term "personnel" as  a  modifier  meaning  "human  resources."  See  Tr.  of  Oral 
Arg.  32  ("[The  Court:]  It's  [an]  H.  R.  file,  right?  [The  Gov-ernment:]  That's  generally  true").  As  we  recognized  in 
Rose, "the common and congressional meaning of . . .  `person-nel  file' "  is  the  file  "showing,  for  example,  where  [an  em-
ployee]  was  born,  the  names  of  his  parents,  where  he  has lived  from  time  to  time,  his  .  .  .  school  records,  results  of 
examinations,  [and]  evaluations  of  his  work  performance." 425  U. S.,  at  377.  It  is  the  file  typically  maintained  in  the 
human  resources  office--otherwise  known  (to  recall  an  ex-ample  offered  above)  as  the  "personnel  department."  Ibid. 

Exemption 2 uses "personnel" in the exact same way.  An agency's  "personnel  rules  and  practices"  are  its  rules  and 
practices  dealing  with  employee  relations  or  human  re-sources.  The  D.  C.  Circuit,  in  a  preCrooker  decision,  gave as  examples  "matters  relating  to  pay,  pensions,  vacations, 

hours of work, lunch hours, parking, etc."  Jordan, 591 F. 2d, at 763; see supra, at 566.  That "etc." is important; we doubt 
any  court  could  know  enough  about  the  Federal  Govern-ment's  operations  to  formulate  a  comprehensive  list.  But 
all  the  rules  and  practices  referenced  in  Exemption  2  share a critical feature: They concern the conditions of employment 
in  federal agencies--such matters  as hiring  and firing, work rules  and  discipline,  compensation  and  benefits.

4 Government  records  also  must  satisfy  the  other  requirements  of  Ex-
emption  2  to  be  exempt  from  disclosure.  Information  must  "relat[e] 
solely"--meaning, as usual, "exclusively or only," Random House 1354--to

Opinion of the Court 
practice have had little difficulty identifying the records that qualify  for  withholding  under  this  reading:  They  are  what 

now  commonly  fall  within  the  Low  2  exemption.  Our  con-struction  of  the  statutory  language  simply  makes  clear  that 
Low  2  is  all  of  2  (and  that  High  2  is  not  2  at  all,  see  infra, at 573-577). 

The statute's purpose reinforces this understanding of the exemption.  We  have  often  noted  "the  Act's  goal  of  broad 
disclosure" and insisted that the exemptions be "given a nar-row compass." 

Department of Justice v.  Tax Analysts, 492 U. S. 136, 151 (1989); see Department of Interior v.  Klamath 

Water Users Protective Assn., 532 U. S. 1, 7-8 (2001).5  This practice  of  "constru[ing]  FOIA  exemptions  narrowly,"  De-
partment  of  Justice  v.  Landano,  508  U. S.  165,  181  (1993), stands  on  especially  firm  footing  with  respect  to  Exemp-
tion  2.  As  described  earlier,  Congress  worded  that  provi-sion  to  hem  in  the  prior  APA  exemption  for  "any  matter 
relating  solely  to  the  internal  management  of  an  agency," which agencies had used to prevent access to masses of docu-
ments.  See  Rose,  425  U. S.,  at  362.  We  would  ill-serve 
the agency's "personnel  rules  and practices."  And the information must 
be "internal"; that is, the agency must typically keep the records to itself 
for its  own use.  See  Webster's 1180  ("internal"  means "existing  or  situ-
ated within the limits . . . of  something").  An agency's human resources 
documents will often meet these conditions. 

5 The dissent would reject this longstanding rule of construction in favor 

of an approach asking courts "to turn Congress' public information objec-
tives  into  workable  agency  practice."  Post,  at  592  (opinion  of  Breyer,

572  MILNER  v.  DEPARTMENT  OF  NAVY 

Opinion of the Court 
Congress's  purpose  by  construing  Exemption  2  to  reauthor-ize the expansive withholding that Congress wanted to halt. 

Our  reading  instead  gives  the  exemption  the  "narrower reach" Congress intended, 

id., at 363, through the simple de-
vice of confining the provision's meaning to its words. The Government resists giving "personnel" its plain mean-

ing  on  the  ground  that  Congress,  when  drafting  Exemption 
2, considered but chose not to enact language exempting "in-ternal employment rules and practices."  Brief for Respond-

ent  30-34,  and  n.  11  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted). This  drafting history,  the  Navy maintains,  proves that  Con-
gress  did  not  wish  "to  limit  the  Exemption  to  employmentrelated matters," id., at 31, even if the adjective "personnel" 
conveys  that  meaning  in  other  contexts,  id.,  at  41.  But  we 
think the Navy's evidence insufficient: The scant history con-
cerning  this  word  change  as  easily  supports  the  inference 
that  Congress  merely  swapped  one  synonym  for  another. 
Cf.  Mead  Corp.  v.  Tilley,  490  U. S.  714,  723  (1989)  (noting 
with respect  to the "unexplained disappearance  of one word 
from  an  unenacted  bill"  that  "mute  intermediate  legislative 
maneuvers  are  not  reliable"  aids  to  statutory  interpretation 
(internal quotation marks omitted)).  Those of us who make 
use  of  legislative  history  believe  that  clear  evidence  of  con-
gressional  intent  may  illuminate  ambiguous  text.  We  will 
not  take the  opposite tack  of allowing ambiguous  legislative 
history to muddy clear statutory language. 

Exemption  2,  as  we  have  construed  it,  does  not  reach  the 
ESQD information at issue here.  These data and maps cal-
culate  and  visually  portray  the  magnitude  of  hypothetical 
detonations.  By no stretch of imagination do they relate to 
"personnel  rules  and  practices,"  as  that  term  is  most  natu-
rally  understood.  They  concern  the  physical  rules  govern-
ing  explosives,  not  the  workplace  rules  governing  sailors; 
they  address  the  handling  of  dangerous  materials,  not  the 
treatment  of  employees.  The  Navy  therefore  may  not  use 
Exemption 2, interpreted in accord with its plain meaning to

Opinion of the Court 
cover human resources matters, to prevent disclosure of the requested maps and data. 

IV 
The  Government  offers  two  alternative  readings  of  Ex-emption  2  to  support  withholding  the  ESQD  information. 

We cannot square either with the statute. 

A 
The Navy first encourages us to adopt the construction of Exemption  2  pioneered  by 

Crooker,  which  shields  material not  only  if  it  meets  the  criteria  set  out  above  (Low  2),  but 

also  if  it  is  "predominant[ly]  interna[l]"  and  its  "disclosure would  significantly  risk[ ]  circumvention  of  federal  agency 
functions" (High 2).  Brief for Respondent 41 (internal quo-tation marks omitted).  The dissent, too, favors this reading 
of  the  statute.  Post,  at  585.  But  the  Crooker  interpreta-tion,  as  already  suggested,  suffers  from  a  patent  flaw:  It 
is  disconnected  from  Exemption  2's  text.  The  High  2  test (in  addition  to  substituting  the  word  "predominantly"  for 
"solely,"  see  n.  1,  supra)  ignores  the  plain  meaning  of  the adjective  "personnel,"  see 

supra,  at  569-572  and  this  page, and adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or ref-

erent  in  Exemption  2's  language.  Indeed,  the  only  way  to arrive at High 2 is by taking a red pen to the statute--"cut-
ting  out  some"  words  and  "pasting  in  others"  until  little  of the  actual  provision  remains. 

Elliott  v.  Department  of Agriculture, 596 F. 3d 842, 845 (CADC 2010).  Because this 

is so, High 2 is better labeled "Non 2" (and Low 2 . . . just 2). In  support  of  its  text-light  approach  to  the  statute,  the 
Government  relies  primarily  on  legislative  history,  placing particular  emphasis on  the  House Report  concerning  FOIA. 
See  Brief  for  Respondent  33-38.  A  statement  in  that  Re-port  buttresses  the  High  2  understanding  of  the  exemption 
and, indeed, specifically rejects the Low 2 construction.  Ac-cording  to  the  Report:  "Operating  rules,  guidelines,  and 
manuals of procedure for Government investigators or exam-

iners would be exempt from disclosure [under Exemption 2], but  this  exemption  would  not  cover . . .  employee  relations 

and  working  conditions  and  routine  administrative  proce-dures."  H. R. Rep. No. 1497, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 10 (1966). 
But the Senate Report says exactly the opposite, explaining in  support  of a  Low  2  interpretation that the  phrase "inter-
nal personnel rules and practices of an agency" means "rules as  to  personnel's  use  of  parking  facilities  or  regulation  of 
lunch  hours,  statements  of  policy  as  to  sick  leave,  and  the like."  S. Rep., at 8.

6  In Rose, we gave reasons for thinking 

the  Senate  Report  the  more  reliable  of  the  two.  See  425 U. S.,  at  366.  But  the  more  fundamental  point  is  what  we 

said  before:  Legislative  history,  for  those  who  take  it  into account,  is  meant  to  clear  up  ambiguity,  not  create  it.  See 
supra,  at  572;  Wong  Yang  Sung  v.  McGrath,  339  U. S.  33, 49  (1950)  (declining  to  consult  legislative  history  when  that 
"history  is  more  conflicting  than  the  text  is  ambiguous"). When  presented,  on  the  one  hand,  with  clear  statutory  lan-
guage and, on the other, with dueling committee reports, we must choose the language. 

The  Government  also  advances,  in  support  of  Crooker's High  2  approach,  an  argument  based  on  subsequent  legisla-
tive action.  Congress, the Government notes, amended Ex-emption 7(E) in 1986 to cover law enforcement records whose 
production  "would  disclose  techniques  and  procedures  for law  enforcement  investigations  or  prosecutions,  or  would 
disclose  guidelines  for  law  enforcement  investigations  or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected 
to  risk  circumvention  of  the  law."  $ 552(b)(7)(E).  That amendment,  the  Government  contends,  codified 

Crooker's "circumvention of the law" standard and, in so doing, ratified 

6 We are perplexed that the dissent takes seriously Crooker's notion that 
the Reports are " `reconcilable.' "  Post, at 588.  To strip the matter to its 
essentials,  the  House  Report  says:  "Exemption  2  means  A,  but  not  B." 
The Senate Report says: "Exemption 2 means B."  That is the very defi-
nition of "irreconcilable."

Crooker's  holding.  Brief  for  Respondent  42-43.  The  dis-sent likewise counts as significant that Congress "t[ook] note" 

of Crooker in revising FOIA.  Post,  at 592; see  post, at 586. But  the  Government  and  the  dissent  neglect  the  key  fea-
ture of the 1986 amendment: Congress modified not Exemp-tion  2  (the  subject  of 

Crooker),  but instead  Exemption 7(E). 
And  the  Crooker  construction  of  Exemption  2  renders  Ex-
emption 7(E) superfluous and so deprives that amendment of any effect.  See, 

e. g., TRW Inc. v.  Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 
(2001)  (noting  canon  that  statutes  should  be  read  to  avoid making any provision "superfluous, void, or insignificant" (in-

ternal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  We  cannot  think  of  any 
document eligible for withholding under Exemption 7(E) that 
the  High  2  reading  does  not  capture:  The  circumvention 
standard is the same, and the law enforcement records listed 
in Exemption 7(E) are "predominantly internal."  So if Con-
gress  had  agreed  with  Crooker's  reading  of  Exemption  2,  it 
would have had no reason to alter Exemption 7(E).  In that 
event,  Congress  would  either  have  left  the  statute  alone 
(on  the  theory  that  Crooker  would  do  the  necessary  work) 
or  would  have  amended  Exemption  2  specifically  to  ratify 
Crooker.  The  decision  instead  to  amend  Exemption  7(E) 
suggests  that  Congress  approved  the  circumvention  stand-
ard  only  as  to  law  enforcement  materials,  and  not  as  to  the 
wider set of records High 2 covers.  Perhaps this legislative 
action  does  not  show  that  Congress  affirmatively  disagreed 
with  Crooker;  maybe  Congress  was  agnostic  about  whether 
the  circumvention  standard  should  apply  to  other  records. 
But  one thing  is  clear: The  1986  amendment does  not  ratify, 
approve,  or  otherwise  signal  agreement  with  Crooker's  in-
terpretation of Exemption 2.  This argument therefore can-
not save the High 2 construction. 

The dissent offers  one last reason  to embrace High 2,  and 
indeed stakes most of its wager on this argument.  Crooker, 
the  dissent  asserts,  "has  been  consistently  relied  upon  and 
followed  for  30  years"  by  other  lower  courts.  Post,  at  592; 

576  MILNER  v.  DEPARTMENT  OF  NAVY 

Opinion of the Court 
see post, at 585-586.  But this claim,  too, trips at the  start-
ing  gate.  It  would  be  immaterial  even  if  true,  because  we 
have  no  warrant  to  ignore  clear  statutory  language  on  the 
ground  that  other  courts  have  done  so.  And  in  any  event, 
it  is  not  true.  Prior  to  Crooker,  three  Circuits  adopted 
the  reading  of  Exemption  2  we  think  right,  and  they  have 
not changed  their  minds.  See n.  2,  supra.7  Since  Crooker, 
three other Circuits have accepted the High 2 reading.  See 
supra,  at  567.  One  Circuit  has  reserved  judgment  on  the 
High  2-Low  2  debate.  See  Audubon  Soc.  v.  United  States 
Forest  Serv.,  104  F.  3d  1201,  1203-1204  (CA10  1997).  And 
the  rest  have  not  considered  the  matter.  (No  one  should 
think  Crooker  has  been  extensively  discussed  or  debated  in 

7 The dissent's view that "two of th[ese] Circuits [have] not adher[ed] to 
their  early  positions"  is  incorrect.  Post,  at  586.  In  Abraham  &  Rose, 
P.  L.  C.  v.  United States, 138 F. 3d 1075, 1082 (1998), cited by the dissent, 
the  Sixth  Circuit  rejected  the  Government's  claim  that  Exemption  2 
shielded records of federal tax lien filings.  The court nowhere discussed 
the  High  2  versus  Low  2  question  at  issue  here.  Its  only  reference  to 
Crooker concerned the part of that decision interpreting "solely" to mean 
"predominantly."  See  138  F.  3d,  at  1080;  see  also  n.  1,  supra.  Subse-
quently,  the  Sixth  Circuit  once  again  held,  in  Rugiero  v.  Department  of 
Justice,  257  F.  3d  534,  549  (2001),  that  Exemption  2  applies  to  "routine 
matters  of  merely  internal  significance."  In  Sladek  v.  Bensinger,  605 
F. 2d 899, 902 (1979), which the dissent also cites, the Fifth Circuit insisted 
that the Government disclose a Drug Enforcement Administration agent's 
manual  because  it  "is  not  the  type  of  trivial  rule,  such  as  allocation  of 
parking  facilities,  that  is  covered  by  Exemption  2."  In  confirming  this 
Low 2 interpretation of the statute, the court acknowledged that another 
Circuit had embraced the High 2 standard.  The court, however, declined 
to  consider  this  alternative  interpretation  because  it  would  not  have 
changed the case's outcome.  See ibid.  Finally, the Eighth Circuit's last 
word  on  Exemption  2  is  clear,  and  the  dissent  does  not  say  otherwise. 
The exemption, according to that most recent Eighth Circuit decision, ap-
plies  "only  [to  an  agency's]  housekeeping  matters."  Cox,  576  F.  2d,  at 
1309-1310 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The dissent is surely right 
to  say,  post  at  586,  that  Crooker  "has  guided  nearly  every  [FOIA]  case 
decided  over  the  last  30  years"  in  Circuits  applying  Crooker;  but  that 
statement does not hold in the Circuits using the Low 2 approach.

Opinion of the Court 
the Courts of Appeals.  In the past three decades, Crooker's analysis  of  Exemption  2  has  been  cited  a  sum  total  of  five 

times  in  federal  appellate  decisions  outside  the  D.  C.  Cir-cuit--on  average,  once  every  six  years.)  The  result  is  a  4-
to-3  split  among  the  Circuits.8  We  will  not  flout  all  usual rules  of  statutory  interpretation  to  take  the  side  of  the 
bare majority.  B 

Presumably  because  Crooker  so  departs  from  Exemption 2's  language,  the  Government  also  offers  another  construc-
tion, which it says we might adopt "on a clean slate," "based on the  plain  text . . . alone."  Brief  for  Respondent  15.  On 
this  reading,  the  exemption  "encompasses  records  concern-ing an agency's internal rules and practices for its personnel 
to  follow  in  the  discharge  of  their  governmental  functions." 
Id., at 20; see also id., at 13-14 (Exemption 2 "applies gener-ally  to  matters  concerning  internal  rules  and  practices  to 

guide  agency  personnel  in  performing  their  duties").  Ac-cording to the  Government, this interpretation makes  sense 
because  "the  phrase  `personnel  rules  and  practices  of  an agency' is logically understood to mean an agency's rules and 
practices for its personnel."  Id., at 20 (emphasis added). But  the  purported  logic  in  the  Government's  definition 
eludes  us.  We  would  not  say,  in  ordinary  parlance,  that  a "personnel  file"  is  any  file  an  employee  uses,  or  that  a  "per-
sonnel department" is any department in which an employee 

8 Notably,  even  those  courts  approving  Crooker  have  disagreed  about 
how to apply High 2.  Fault lines include whether the risk of circumven-
tion must be significant, see, e. g., Hidalgo v.  FBI, 541 F. Supp. 2d 250, 253 
(DC 2008); Pet. for Cert. 15-16; whether courts should consider the public 
interest in disclosure when calculating that risk, see, e. g., Dept. of Justice, 
Guide  to  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act,  p.  185  (2009);  and  whether  an 
agency  must  regulate  the  person  or  entity  threatening  circumvention; 
compare,  e. g.,  575  F.  3d,  at  971,  with,  e. g.,  id.,  at  978  (W.  Fletcher,  J., 
dissenting).  The disagreement is not surprising.  Because High 2 is no-
where evident in the statute, courts lack the normal guideposts for ascer-
taining its coverage. 

578  MILNER  v.  DEPARTMENT  OF  NAVY 

Opinion of the Court 
serves.  No  more  would  we  say  that  a  "personnel  rule  or practice"  is  any  rule  or  practice  that  assists  an  employee  in 

doing  her  job.  The  use  of  the  term  "personnel"  in  each  of these  phrases  connotes  not  that  the  file  or  department  or 
practice/rule  is  for  personnel,  but  rather  that  the  file  or  de-partment or practice/rule is 

about personnel--i. e., that it re-
lates  to  employee  relations  or  human  resources.  This  case 
well illustrates the point.  The records requested, as earlier noted,  are  explosives  data  and  maps  showing  the  distances 

that  potential  blasts  travel.  This  information  no  doubt  as-sists  Navy  personnel  in  storing  munitions.  But  that  is  not 
to say that the data and maps relate to "personnel rules and 
practices."  No one staring at these charts of explosions and 
using ordinary language would describe them in this manner. 

Indeed, the Government's "clean slate" constructi on 
reaches such documents only by stripping the word "person-
nel"  of  any  real  meaning.  Under  this  interpretation,  an 
agency's  "internal  personnel  rules  and  practices"  appears 
to  mean  all  its  internal  rules  and  practices.  That  is  be-
cause  agencies  necessarily  operate  through  personnel,  and 
so  all  their  internal  rules  and  practices  are  for  personnel. 
The  modifier  "personnel,"  then,  does  no  modifying  work;  it 
does  not  limit  the  class  of  internal  rules  and  practices  that 
Exemption 2 covers.  What is most naturally viewed as the 
provision's  key  word--the  term  that  ought  to  define  its 
scope--does  nothing  more  than  state  the  truism  that  in 
an  agency  it  is  "personnel"  who  follow  internal  rules  and 
practices. 

And  this  odd  reading  would  produce  a  sweeping  exemp-
tion,  posing  the  risk  that  FOIA  would  become  less  a  disclo-
sure  than  "a  withholding  statute."  Mink,  410  U. S.,  at  79. 
Many  documents  an  agency  generates  in  some  way  aid  em-
ployees in carrying out their responsibilities.  If Exemption 
2  were  to  reach  all  these  records,  it  would  tend  to  engulf 
other  FOIA  exemptions,  rendering  ineffective  the  limita-
tions  Congress  placed  on  their  application.  Exemption  7,

Opinion of the Court 
for  example,  shields  records  compiled  for  law  enforcement 
purposes,  but  only  if  one  of  six  specified  criteria  is  met. 

$ 552(b)(7).  Yet on the  Government's  view,  an agency could 
bypass these restrictions by invoking Exemption 2 whenever 
law enforcement records guide personnel in performing their 
duties.  Indeed, an agency could use  Exemption 2 as an allpurpose back-up provision to withhold sensitive records that 
do not fall within any of FOIA's more targeted exemptions.9 

Interpreted  in  this  way,  Exemption  2--call  it  "Super  2" 
now--would  extend,  rather  than  narrow,  the  APA's  former 
exemption for records relating to the "internal management 
of  an  agency."  5  U. S. C.  $ 1002  (1964  ed.).  We  doubt  that 
even  the  "internal  management"  provision,  which  Congress 
thought  allowed  too  much  withholding,  see  supra,  at  565, 
would have  protected  all information  that guides employees 
in the discharge of their duties, including the explosives data 
and  maps  in  this  case.  And  perhaps  needless  to  say,  this 
reading  of  Exemption  2  violates  the  rule  favoring  narrow 

9 The dissent  asserts  that "30  years  of  experience" with  a  more expan-
sive  interpretation  of  the  exemption  suggests  no  "seriou[s]  interfere[nce] 
with . . . FOIA's informational objectives."  Post, at 589-590.  But those 
objectives  suffer any time an agency denies a  FOIA request  based on  an 
improper  interpretation  of  the  statute.  To  give  just  one  example,  the 
U. S.  Forest  Service  has  wrongly  invoked  Exemption  2  on  multiple  occa-
sions to withhold information about (of all things) bird nesting sites.  See 
Audubon  Soc.  v.  United  States  Forest  Serv.,  104  F.  3d  1201,  1203  (CA10 
1997);  Maricopa  Audubon  Soc.  v.  United  States  Forest  Serv.,  108  F.  3d 
1082, 1084 (CA9 1997).  And recent statistics raise a concern that federal 
agencies may too readily use Exemption 2 to refuse disclosure.  According 
to amicus Public Citizen, "while reliance on exemptions overall rose 83% 
from  1998  to  2006,  reliance  on  Exemption  2  rose  344%  during  that  same 
time  period."  Brief  for  Public  Citizen  et  al.  24.  In  2009  alone,  federal 
departments cited Exemption 2 more than 72,000 times to prevent access 
to  records.  See  Brief  for  Allied  Daily  Newspapers  of  Washington  et  al. 
as  Amici  Curiae  3.  We  do  not  doubt  that  many  of  these  FOIA  denials 
were appropriate.  But we are unable to accept the dissent's unsupported 
declaration  that  a  sweeping  construction  of  Exemption  2  has  not  inter-
fered with Congress's goal of broad disclosure. 

580  MILNER  v.  DEPARTMENT  OF  NAVY 

Opinion of the Court 
construction of FOIA exemptions.  See, e. g., Abramson, 456 U. S.,  at  630;  Rose,  425  U. S.,  at  361.  Super  2  in  fact  has 

no  basis  in  the  text,  context,  or  purpose  of  FOIA,  and  we accordingly reject it. 

V 
Although we cannot interpret Exemption 2 as the Govern-ment  proposes,  we  recognize  the  strength  of  the  Navy's  in-

terest in protecting the ESQD data and maps and other simi-lar  information.  The  Government  has  informed  us  that 
"[p]ublicly  disclosing  the  [ESQD]  information  would  signifi-cantly  risk  undermining  the  Navy's  ability  to  safely  and  se-
curely store military ordnance," Brief for Respondent 47, and we have no reason to doubt that representation.  The Ninth 
Circuit similarly cautioned that disclosure of this information could  be  used  to  "wrea[k]  havoc"  and  "make  catastrophe 
more  likely."  575  F.  3d,  at  971.  Concerns  of  this  kind--a sense  that  certain  sensitive  information 

should  be  exempt from  disclosure--in  part  led  the  Crooker  court  to  formulate 

the High 2 standard.  See 670 F. 2d, at 1074 (contending that "common  sense"  supported  the  High  2  interpretation  be-
cause  Congress  would  not  have  wanted  FOIA  to  "under-min[e]  .  .  .  the  effectiveness  of  law  enforcement  agencies"). 
And  we  acknowledge  that  our  decision  today  upsets  three decades of agency practice relying on Crooker, and therefore 
may force considerable adjustments. We  also  note,  however,  that  the  Government  has  other 
tools  at  hand  to  shield  national  security  information  and other  sensitive  materials.  Most  notably,  Exemption  1  of 
FOIA  prevents  access  to  classified  documents.  $ 552(b)(1); see 575 F. 3d, at 980 (W. Fletcher, J., dissenting) (Exemption 
1  is  "specifically  designed  to  allow  government  agencies  to withhold  information  that  might  jeopardize  our  national  se-
curity").  The  Government  generally  may  classify  material even  after  receiving  a  FOIA  request,  see  Exec.  Order 
No. 13526, $ 1.7(d), 75 Fed.  Reg. 711 (2009); an agency there-fore may wait until that time to decide whether the dangers

views.  But the comparison serves only to highlight the unlawful-ness  of  the  alleged  treatment  of  Weise  and  Young:  Not  only  was 

this an official presentation of the President's views, not a private 
act  of  expression  as  in  Hurley;  in  addition,  unlike  the  Hurley plaintiff  who  sought  to  engage  in  competing  expression,  Weise 

and  Young  were  "silent  attendee[s],"  593  F.  3d,  at  1170  (emphasis added).  Their  presence  alone  cannot  have  affected  the  Presi-
dent's  message.  Therefore,  ejecting  them  for  holding  discordant views could only have been a reprisal for the expression conveyed 
by  the  bumper  sticker.  "Official  reprisal  for  protected  speech 
`offends  the  Constitution  because  it  threatens  to  inhibit  exercise of  the  protected  right.' " 

Hartman  v.  Moore,  547  U. S.  250,  256 
(2006)  (quoting  Crawford-El  v.  Britton,  523  U. S.  574,  588,  n.  10 (1998);  brackets  omitted). 

I  see  only  one  arguable  reason  for  deferring  the  question  this 
case  presents.  Respondents  were  volunteers  following  instruc-
tions  from  White  House  officials.  The  Volunteer  Protection  Act 
of  1997,  111  Stat.  218,  42  U. S. C.  $ 14501  et  seq.,  had  respondents 
invoked  it  in  the  courts  below,  might  have  shielded  them  from 
liability.  Federal  officials  themselves,  however,  gain  no  shelter 
from  that  Act.  Suits  against  the  officials  responsible  for  Weise's 
and  Young's  ouster  remain  pending  and  may  offer  this  Court  an 
opportunity  to  take  up  the  issue  avoided  today.

drug  obtained  from  a  foreign  source  is  unsafe.  The  District Court  granted  the  restraining  order  because  it  was  left  to  specu-

Administration]  approved  drug  will  cause  pain  and  suffering"). But speculation  cannot substitute  for  evidence  that  the use  of  the 
drug  is " `sure  or  very  likely to  cause  serious  illness and  needless suffering.' "  Baze v.  Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 50 (2008) (quoting Helling

view  in  this  case  because  not  many  cases  presenting  this  issue are likely to reach the Courts of Appeals.  The Court has decided 
not  to  grant  review  at  this  time,  but  if  a  conflict  in  the  Circuits develops  in  the  future,  the  question  presented,  in  my  judgment, 
is important enough to warrant review.

outcome  would  have  been  different  absent  the  error").  I  there-fore do not disagree with the denial of certiorari. 

I  nonetheless  write  respecting  the  denial  of  certiorari  because the  allocation  of  the  burden  of  proving  harmlessness  can  be  out-
come  determinative  in  some  cases.  See  Fulminante,  499  U. S., at  296  ("Five  of  us  are  of  the  view  that  the  State  has  not  carried 
its burden and accordingly affirm the judgment of the court below reversing  respondent's  conviction");  see,  e. g.,  State  v.  Ball,  2004 
S.  D.  9,  675  N. W.  2d  192  (holding  that  the  State  had  not  met  its burden  of  showing  that  prosecutor's  improper  references  in  clos-
ing  argument  to  defendant's  silence  were  harmless  beyond  a  rea-sonable  doubt);  State  v.  Jorgensen,  2008  WI  60,  310  Wis.  2d  138, 
754  N. W.  2d 77  (holding  that  the  State  had  not  met  its  burden  of showing that Confrontation Clause violation was harmless beyond 
a reasonable  doubt).  With  all  that  is  at  stake  in  capital cases,  cf. Kyles  v.  Whitley, 514 U. S. 419,  422 (1995) (" `[O]ur  duty to search 
for constitutional error with painstaking care is never more exact-ing  than  it  is  in  a  capital  case' "  (quoting  Burger  v.  Kemp,  483 
U. S. 776, 785 (1987))), in future cases the California courts should take  care  to  ensure  that  their  burden  allocation  conforms  to  the 
commands  of  Chapman.  In  this  case,  however,  because  it  seems that  the  burden  allocation  would  not  have  altered  the  court's 
prejudice  analysis, I  do  not  disagree with  the  denial  of  certiorari.

age  at  the  time  of  the  offense  and  his  troubled  family  back-ground,"  and  could  have  asked  the  jury  for  mercy.  Ibid.  But 
merely identifying statements counsel could have made (there will always be statements counsel could have made) does not establish 
what  Strickland  requires:  that  those  statements  would  probably have  made  a  difference.  All  the  facts  relevant  to  the  Eleventh 
Circuit's  hypothesized  closing  argument  had  already  come  out  in the  sentencing  phase.  And  a  plea  for  mercy  had  been  made  in 
the  sentencing  phase  by  Lawhorn  himself. The  hypothesized  closing  argument  falls  even  further  short  of 
establishing  what  AEDPA  requires:  that  it  was  not  merely  incor-rect  but  unreasonable  for  the  Alabama  courts  to  conclude  that 
probability  of  a  different  outcome  had  not  been  shown.  It  was, to  the  contrary,  well  within  the  bounds  of  reasonable  judgment 
for  the  Alabama  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  to  conclude  that  "in this  situation  with  these  particular  facts,  closing  argument  by 
defense counsel would have had little impact."  756 So. 2d, at 987. In  sum,  the  outcome  imposed  upon  the  Alabama  courts  by  the 
Eleventh  Circuit  is  not  remotely  required  by  clearly  established Supreme  Court  precedent. 

* * * 
It  has  been  over  21  years  since  Lawhorn  was  sentenced  to death.  Alabama should be not barred from carrying out its judg-

ment  based  on  a  federal  court's  lawless  speculation.  I  would  not dissent  from  denial  of  certiorari  if  what  happened  here  were  an 
isolated judicial  error.  It  is  not.  With distressing  frequency, es-pecially  in  capital  cases  such  as  this,  federal  judges  refuse  to  be 
governed  by  Congress's  command  that  state  criminal  judgments must  not  be  revised  by  federal  courts  unless  they  are  "contrary 
to,  or  involv[e]  an  unreasonable  application  of,  clearly  established Federal  law,  as  determined  by  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  United 
States,"  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254(d)(1)  (emphasis  added).  We  invite  con-tinued  lawlessness  when  we  permit  a  patently  improper  interfer-
ence  with  state  justice  such  as  that  which  occurred  in  this  case to  stand.  We  should  grant  Alabama's  petition  for  certiorari  and 
summarily  reverse  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  judgment.
