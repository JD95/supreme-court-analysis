This case concerns the adequacy of the means employedby the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to providenotice to a federal prisoner of his right to contest the ad-ministrative forfeiture of property seized during the execution of a search warrant for the residence where he wasarrested.In April 1986, officers of the FBI arrested petitioner LarryDean Dusenbery at a house trailer in Atwater, Ohio. Laterthat day, they obtained and executed a search warrant, seizing drugs, drug paraphernalia, several firearms, a ballisticknife, an automobile registered in the name of petitioner'sstepmother, and various other items of personal property.Among these was $21,939 in cash, $394 of which had beenfound on petitioner's person, $7,500 in the inside pocket of acoat in the dining area and $14,045 in a briefcase found onthe floor in the living room.Two months later, petitioner pleaded guilty in the UnitedStates District Court for the Northern District of Ohio to acharge of possession with intent to distribute 813 grams ofcocaine in violation of 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1) (1988 ed.). Hewas sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment followed by 6years of special parole. Two years later, the United States,no longer expecting the firearms and knife to be used as evi-dence in a future prosecution, and unable to determine theirrightful owner, sought and obtained an order from the Dis-trict Court authorizing the FBI to destroy them. The FBIalso began the process of administratively forfeiting the cashand the automobile.At this time, designated agents of the FBI were allowedto dispose of property seized pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act, 84 Stat. 1242, 21 U. S. C. $ 801 et seq. (1988 ed.),without initiating judicial proceedings if the property's valuedid not exceed $100,000, and if no person claimed an interest534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN164 DUSENBERY v.

S. C. $$ 1607-1609 (1988 ed.) (setting forth customs lawrequirements for summary forfeitures).To effect such a forfeiture, the statute required the agencyto send written notice of the seizure together with information on the applicable forfeiture procedures to each partywho appeared to have an interest in the property. $ 1607(a).It also required the publication for at least three successiveweeks of a similar notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the judicial district in which the forfeiture proceedingwas brought. Ibid.; 21 CFR $ 1316.75 (1988). The FBIsent letters of its intention to forfeit the cash by certifiedmail addressed to petitioner care of the Federal CorrectionalInstitution (FCI) in Milan, Michigan, where he was then incarcerated; to the address of the residence where petitionerwas arrested; and to an address in Randolph, Ohio, the townwhere petitioner's mother lived. App. 21-23. It placed therequisite legal notice in three consecutive Sunday editions ofthe Cleveland Plain Dealer. Id., at 24-30. Similar practices were followed with respect to the proposed forfeitureof the car. Brief for Petitioner 3. The FBI received no response to these notices within the time allotted, and so declared the items administratively forfeited. Ibid.; App. 15.An FBI agent turned over the cash to the United StatesMarshals Service on December 13, 1988. Id., at 16-17.Nearly five years later, petitioner moved in the DistrictCourt pursuant to Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Crimi534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN165Cite as: 534 U. S. 161 (2002)Opinion of the Courtnal Procedure 1 seeking return of all the property and fundsseized in his criminal case. The United States respondedthat all of the items of petitioner's property that were notused in his drug business had been returned to him andthat other items seized had long since been forfeited tothe Government. The District Court denied the motion,reasoning that any challenge to the forfeiture proceed-ings should have been brought in a civil action, not as a motion ancillary to petitioner's now-closed criminal case. CaseNo. 5:95-CV-1872 (ND Ohio, Oct. 5, 1995).The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit vacated theDistrict Court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings. Judgt. order reported at 97 F. 3d 1451 (1996),App. 31. The Court of Appeals agreed that petitioner couldnot pursue his claim through a Rule 41(e) motion since thecriminal proceedings against him had been completed. Itheld that the District Court abused its discretion, however,by not construing the motion as a civil complaint seekingequitable relief for a due process challenge to adequacy ofthe notice of the administrative forfeiture.Following remand, the District Court entered an orderallowing discovery and subsequently presided over a telephone deposition of James Lawson, an Inmate Systems Offi-cer who began to work in the mailroom at FCI Milan earlyin 1988 and who had submitted an affidavit in the case.Lawson testified that he signed the certified mail receipt forthe FBI's notice to petitioner regarding the cash. App. 49-50. He also testified about the procedures within FCI Milanfor accepting, logging, and delivering certified mail ad-dressed to inmates.Id., at 50. Lawson explained that the1 Rule 41(e) provides that "[a] person aggrieved by an unlawful searchand seizure or by the deprivation of property may move the district courtfor the district in which the property was seized for the return of theproperty on the ground that such person is entitled to lawful possessionof the property."534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN166 DUSENBERY v.

But he said that a papertrail no longer existed because the Bureau of Prisons (BOP)had a policy of holding prison logbooks for only one yearafter they were closed.2 Id., at 51-52.Both parties moved for summary judgment. The DistrictCourt ruled that the Government's sending of notice by certified mail to petitioner's place of incarceration satisfied hisdue process rights as to the cash. Case No. 5:95-CV-1872(ND Ohio, Jan. 19, 1999). The Court of Appeals affirmed.223 F. 3d 422 (CA6 2000). CitingMullane v. Central Han-over Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 314 (1950), it held thatthe Government's notice of the cash forfeiture comportedwith due process even in the absence of proof that the mailactually reached petitioner. 223 F. 3d, at 424.Because Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions about what the Due Process Clause requires of theUnited States when it seeks to provide notice to a federalinmate of its intention to forfeit property in which the in-mate appears to have an interest,3 we granted certiorari to2 In a letter received before argument, the Solicitor General advised usthat the BOP now requires the retention of certified mail logbooks for 11years in accordance with its implementation of Government record retention policies under the Federal Records Act of 1950, 44 U.

Wenow affirm the judgment below.The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibitsthe United States, as the Due Process Clause of the Four-teenth Amendment prohibits the States, from depriving anyperson of property without "due process of law." Fromthese "cryptic and abstract words,"Mullane, supra, at 313,we have determined that individuals whose property interests are at stake are entitled to "notice and an opportunityto be heard." United States v. James Daniel Good RealProperty, 510 U. S. 43, 48 (1993).Petitioner urges that, in analyzing his due process claim,we follow the approach articulated in Mathews v. Eldridge,424 U. S. 319 (1976). Brief for Petitioner 12; Reply Brief forPetitioner 7. There we spoke of a balancing of three factors:(1) the private interest that will be affected by the officialaction, (2) a cost-benefit analysis of the risks of an erroneousdeprivation versus the probable value of additional safeguards, and (3) the Government's interest, including thefunction involved and any fiscal and administrative burdensassociated with using different procedural safeguards. 424U. S., at 335. The United States, on the other hand, urgesus to apply the method set forth in Mullane, supra, whichespouses a more straightforward test of reasonablenessunder the circumstances. Brief for United States 27.We thinkMullane supplies the appropriate analyticalframework. The Mathews balancing test was first conceived in the context of a due process challenge to theadequacy of administrative procedures used to terminateSocial Security disability benefits. Although we have sinceinvokedMathews to evaluate due process claims in otherv.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcontexts, see Medina v. California, 505 U. S. 437, 444 (1992)(citing cases), we have never viewedMathews as announcingan all-embracing test for deciding due process claims. SinceMullane was decided, we have regularly turned to it whenconfronted with questions regarding the adequacy of themethod used to give notice. See,e. g., New York City v.New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 344 U. S. 293, 296 (1953); Walkerv. City of Hutchinson, 352 U. S. 112, 115 (1956); Schroederv.City of New York, 371 U. S. 208, 210 (1962); Robinson v.Hanrahan, 409 U. S. 38, 39 (1972) (per curiam); Greene v.Lindsey, 456 U. S. 444, 448 (1982); Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, 462 U. S. 791, 797 (1983); Tulsa ProfessionalCollection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478, 484 (1988).We see no reason to depart from this well-settled practice.Mullane itself involved a due process challenge to the constitutional sufficiency of notice to beneficiaries on judicial settlement of accounts by the trustee of a common trust fundestablished under state law. A trustee of such a commontrust fund sought a judicial decree settling its accounts asagainst all parties having an interest in the fund. The onlynotice of the application for this decree was by court-orderedpublication in a newspaper for four successive weeks. 339U. S., at 309-310. We held that this notice was constitutionally defective as to known persons whose whereabouts werealso known, because it was not "reasonably calculated, underall the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of thependency of the action and afford them an opportunity topresent their objections." Id., at 314, 319; see also id., at315 ("The means employed must be such as one desirous ofactually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt toaccomplish it").Was the notice in this case "reasonably calculated underall the circumstances" to apprise petitioner of the pendencyof the cash forfeiture? The Government here carried itsburden of showing the following procedures had been usedto give notice. The FBI sent certified mail addressed to534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN169Cite as: 534 U. S. 161 (2002)Opinion of the Courtpetitioner at the correctional facility where he was incarcer-ated. At that facility, prison mailroom staff traveled to thecity post office every day to obtain all the mail for the institu-tion, including inmate mail. App. 36. The staff signed forall certified mail before leaving the post office. Once themail was transported back to the facility, certified mail wasentered in a logbook maintained in the mailroom. Id., at 37.A member of the inmate's Unit Team then signed for thecertified mail to acknowledge its receipt before removing itfrom the mailroom, and either a Unit Team member or another staff member distributed the mail to the inmate duringthe institution's "mail call."Id., at 37, 51.Petitioner does not seriously contest the FBI's use of thepostal service to send its certified letter to him, a methodour cases have recognized as adequate for known addresseeswhen we have found notice by publication insufficient.4Tr. of Oral Arg. 11 ("This case is not really a mailed noticecase because the procedures that are inadequate are the pro-cedures that happened after the mailing"). Instead, he argues that the notice was insufficient because due processgenerally requires "actual notice" to interested parties priorto forfeiture, which he takes to mean actual receipt of notice.5Brief for Petitioner 8, 15, 18-19; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 23.4 E. g., Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 319(1950) (noting that the mails "are recognized as an efficient and inexpensive means of communication"); Walker v. City of Hutchinson, 352 U. S.112, 116 (1956); Schroeder v. City of New York, 371 U. S. 208, 214 (1962);Mennonite Bd. of Missions v. Adams, 462 U. S. 791, 798 (1983); TulsaProfessional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U. S. 478, 490 (1988).5 The Government's brief notes that the term "actual notice" is not freefrom ambiguity as used by this Court in cases such as Tulsa, supra, andby other courts. Brief for United States 20, n. 12 (stating that the termhas been used both to distinguish notice by mail from notice by publicationand to refer to the actual receipt of the notice by the intended recipient);see also Black's Law Dictionary 1087 (7th ed. 1999) (defining "actual notice" as "[n]otice given directly to, or received personally by, a party").We think the best way to avoid this confusion is to equate, as petitionerdoes, "actual notice" with "receipt of notice."534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN170 DUSENBERY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtFor this proposition he cites Mennonite Bd. of Missions, 462U. S., at 796-797. But the only sentence inMennonite arguably supporting petitioner's view appears in a footnote.That sentence reads: "Our cases have required the State tomake efforts to provide actual notice to all interested partiescomparable to the efforts that were previously required onlyin in personam actions." Id., at 797, n. 3. It does not saythat the State must provide actual notice, but that it mustattempt to provide actual notice. Since Mennonite concluded that mailed notice of a pending tax sale to a mortga-gee of record was constitutionally sufficient,id., at 799, thesentence is at best inconclusive dicta for the view petitioner espouses.We note that none of our cases cited by either party hasrequired actual notice in proceedings such as this. Instead,we have allowed the Government to defend the "reasonableness and hence the constitutional validity of any chosenmethod . . . on the ground that it is in itself reasonably certain to inform those affected." Mullane, 339 U. S., at 315.Petitioner argues that because he was housed in a federalprison at the time of the forfeiture, the FBI could have madearrangements with the BOP to assure the delivery of thenotice in question to him. Brief for Petitioner 17. But it ishard to see why such a principle would not also apply, forexample, to members of the Armed Forces both in this country and overseas. Undoubtedly the Government could makea special effort in any case ( just as it did in the movie "Saving Private Ryan") to assure that a particular piece of mailreaches a particular individual who is in one way or anotherin the custody of the Government. It could, for example,have allowed petitioner to make an escorted visit to the postoffice himself in order to sign for his letter. But the DueProcess Clause does not require such heroic efforts by theGovernment; it requires only that the Government's effortbe "reasonably calculated" to apprise a party of the pendencyof the action; " `[t]he criterion is not the possibility of conceiv534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN171Cite as: 534 U. S. 161 (2002)Opinion of the Courtable injury but the just and reasonable character of therequirements . . . .' "Mullane, supra, at 315.Nor does the Due Process Clause require the Governmentto substitute the procedures proposed by petitioner for thosein place at FCI Milan in 1988. See Brief for Petitioner 17(suggesting that the Government could send the notice to aprison official with a request that a prison employee watchthe prisoner open the notice, cosign a receipt, and mail thesigned paper back to the agency from which it came). Thesuggested procedures would work primarily to bolster theGovernment's ability to establish that the prisoner actuallyreceived notice of the forfeiture, a problem petitioner perceives to be the FCI Milan's procedures' primary defect.See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15 (explaining that the problem is that"[t]he procedure doesn't require verification of delivery").But as we have noted above, our cases have never requiredactual notice. The facts of the present case, moreover, illustrate the difficulty with such a requirement. The letter inquestion was sent to petitioner in 1988, but the claim of improper notice was first asserted in 1993. What might bereasonably fresh in the minds of all parties had the questionarisen contemporaneously will surely be stale five yearslater. The issue would often turn on disputed testimony asto whether the letter was in fact delivered to petitioner.The title to property should not depend on such vagaries.Justice Ginsburg's dissent does not contend, as petitioner does, that due process could be satisfied in this caseonly with actual notice. It makes an alternative argumentthat the FBI's notice was constitutionally flawed because itwas " `substantially less likely to bring home notice' than afeasible substitute," post, at 174 (quoting Mullane, supra, at314-315)--namely, the methods used currently by the BOP,which generally require an inmate to sign a logbook acknowledging delivery, see post, at 180, 181-182 (describing currentBOP procedures and noting the practicability of BOP UnitTeam member's "linger[ing]" a little longer to secure an in534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN172 DUSENBERY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtmate's signature). Just how requiring the end recipient tosign for a piece of mail substantially improves the reliabilityof the delivery procedures leading up to that person's re-ceipt,Justice Ginsburg's dissent does not persuasively ex-plain. Nor is there any probative evidence to this effect inthe record.6Even if one accepts that the BOP's current procedures improve delivery to some degree, our cases have never heldthat improvements in the reliability of new procedures necessarily demonstrate the infirmity of those that were re-placed. Other areas of the law, moreover, have for strongpolicy reasons resisted rules crediting the notion that, " `be-cause the world gets wiser as it gets older, therefore it wasfoolish before.' " Advisory Committee's Notes on Fed. RuleEvid. 407, 28 U. S. C. App., p. 864 (1994 ed.) (quotingHart v.Lancashire & Yorkshire R. Co., 21 Law Times Rep.

In this case, we believe the same principlesupports our conclusion that the Government ought not bepenalized and told to "try harder,"post, at 180, simply because the BOP has since upgraded its policies.Here, the use of the mail addressed to petitioner at thepenitentiary was clearly acceptable for much the same rea-son we have approved mailed notice in the past. Short ofallowing the prisoner to go to the post office himself, theremaining portion of the delivery would necessarily dependon a system in effect within the prison itself relying onprison staff. We think the FBI's use of the system de6 To try to show that there is a "significant risk," Brief for Petitioner 14,that notice mailed to a prison will not reach an inmate, petitioner has citedseveral cases from various Courts of Appeals involving postforfeiture challenges. As the Government argues, these cases, like petitioner's own suithere, involve only claims that notice was not received, not findings ofnonreceipt.534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN173Cite as: 534 U.

As adequate tonotify prisoners that the Government seeks forfeiture oftheir property, the Court condones a procedure too lax toreliably ensure that a prisoner will receive a legal notice sentto him. The Court does so despite the Government's totalcontrol of a prison inmate's location, and the evident feasibility of tightening the notice procedure "as [would] one desir-ous of actually informing [the prisoner]."Id., at 315.

UNITED STATESGinsburg, J., dissentingrest on the Government's use of the postal service to dis-patch, from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to theFederal Correctional Institution (FCI) in Milan, Michigan,notice of an impending forfeiture.Ante, at 169. Were thiscase about the adequacy of the transmission of informationfrom the FBI to the FCI, swift summary judgment for theGovernment, I agree, would be in order. But the case weconfront is not about notice to the prison, the warden, or theprison mailroom personnel. It is about the adequacy of notice to an individual held in the Government's custody, a pris-oner whose location the Government at all times knows andtightly controls.What process did the Government provide for getting theFBI's forfeiture notice from the FCI's mailroom to prisonerDusenbery's cell? On that key transmission the record isbare. It contains no statement by FCI Milan's warden concerning any set of safeguards routinely employed. The Government presented only the affidavit and telephone deposition of James Curtis Lawson, an "Inmate Systems Officer"assigned to FCI Milan's mailroom. App. 36-37, 46-53. Onthe mailroom to prisoner transmission, Lawson said simplythis: "The [Housing] Unit Team member or a correctionalstaff member will [after signing the mailroom logbook] distribute the mail to the inmates during the institution's mailcall." App. 37. Lawson did not know whether notice wasin fact delivered to Dusenbery. Nor would he have suchknowledge or information regarding any other prisoner. AsLawson clarified on deposition, he was not acquainted withparticular practices or systems governing mail once it leftthe mailroom, because that was not "pertinent to [his] department." App. 52. According to Lawson, "[t]hat wouldbe case workers' responsibility," ibid.; but no caseworkerfilled in the evidentiary gap.Was the prison to prisoner mode of transmission describedby Officer Lawson "substantially less likely to bring homenotice" than a feasible substitute that would place no "im534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN175Cite as: 534 U. S. 161 (2002)Ginsburg, J., dissentingpractical obstacles" in the Government's way? Mullane,339 U. S., at 314-315. The answer, in my judgment, is certainly yes. Before detailing why that is my view, I will ex-amine what the Court does not elaborate: In full scope, whatdoes Mullane, the foundational case, teach about the nexusto the forum and notice to interested persons necessary tomake an adjudication fair and workable, and thus compatiblewith due process?1IIMullane was a proceeding in which the trustee of a com-mon trust fund sought from a New York Surrogate Court anorder settling all questions concerning the management ofthe common fund during a statutorily specified accountingperiod.2 Many of the beneficiaries resided outside NewYork. Could a New York court adjudicate such a case despite the large numbers of nonresidents affected? And if aNew York court could entertain the case, would notice bypublication, for which the New York statute provided, sufficeto inform beneficiaries of the proceeding? The Court recognized that these were separate questions calling for dis-crete inquiries.New York had jurisdiction to adjudicate despite the dis-persion of trust beneficiaries among several States, theCourt explained, because the trust "exist[ed] by the grace of[New York's] laws and [was] administered under the supervision of its courts." Id., at 313. If New York could not take1 In briefing this case, the Government questioned whether it is "permissible for courts to approach the due process issue here as a matter of whatis `fair' or workable." Brief for United States 31. Any doubt on thatscore should be dispelled. Mullane carefully explained that the due process requirement at stake is not merely permissive, it demands that bothfairness and practicality be taken into account. See 339 U. S., at 313-320.2 The decree sought by the Mullane trustee would terminate "everyright which beneficiaries would otherwise have against the trust company,either as trustee of the common fund or as trustee of any individual trust,for improper management of the common trust fund during the periodcovered by the accounting." Id., at 311.534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN176 DUSENBERY v. UNITED STATESGinsburg, J., dissentinghold of the case, no other State would be better situated todo so. Without a forum for periodic settlement of the trustee's accounts, the common fund device would be unworkable.Under the circumstances, New York's interest "in providingmeans [periodically] to close trusts [of the kind involved inMullane was] . . . so insistent and rooted in custom as toestablish beyond doubt the right of its courts to determinethe interests of all claimants." Ibid.Having thus settled the question of the nexus between theforum and the controversy necessary to establish jurisdictionto adjudicate, the Court turned to the means by which potentially affected persons must be apprised of the proceeding:"Quite different from the question of a state's power to discharge trustees," the Court began, "is that of the [full] opportunity it must give beneficiaries to contest." Ibid."Personal service of written notice," the Court acknowledged, "is the classic form of notice always adequate in anytype of proceeding." Ibid. But that classic form, the Courtnext developed, "has not in all circumstances been regardedas indispensable to the process due to residents, and it hasmore often been held unnecessary as to nonresidents." Id.,at 314. For beneficiaries whose interests or addresses wereunknown to the trustee, notice by publication would do, fautede mieux. Id., at 318. But "[a]s to known present beneficiaries of known place of residence," Mullane instructed, notice by publication would not do. Ibid. Personal service on"the large number of known resident or nonresident beneficiaries," however, would "seriously interfere with the properadministration of the fund." Id., at 318-319 (delay as wellas expense rendered such service impractical). For thatgroup, the Court indicated, "ordinary mail to the record addresses," which might be sent with periodic income remittances, was the minimal due process requirement. Id., at318. The risk that notice would not reach even all knownbeneficiaries, the Court reasoned, was justifiable, for thecommon trust534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN177Cite as: 534 U.

UNITED STATESGinsburg, J., dissentingIIIReturning to the instant case and the question Mullaneidentified as pivotal: Was the mail delivery procedure at FCIMilan "substantially less likely to bring home notice [toprison inmates]" than a "feasible . . . substitut[e]"? 339U. S., at 315; cf. Mennonite Bd., 462 U. S., at 803 (O'Connor,J., dissenting) (ability of "members of a particular class . . .to safeguard their interests . . . must be taken into accountwhen we consider the `totality of the circumstances,' as required by Mullane"). Prisoner Dusenbery's situation dif-fers dramatically from that of persons for whom we suggested ordinary mail service, without more, would suffice.Those differences, I am persuaded, are dispositive.A beneficiary not in receipt of actual notice in Mullanewould nevertheless be protected, in significant measure, bybeneficiaries who did receive notice and might have advancedobjections shared by the large class of similarly situatedpersons. Moreover, the Surrogate's Court was obliged toreview the trustee's accounting before approving it. Incontrast, Dusenbery's alleged ownership interest standsalone. No others are similarly situated. Dusenbery claimsthat the money the FBI seized at his home was not traceableto an unlawful exchange for a controlled substance. See 21U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6) (1988 ed.). Absent notice of the forfeitureproceeding, Dusenbery had no opportunity to present thatclaim before an impartial forum. See 19 U. S. C. $ 1609 (1988ed.) (if no claim is filed within the prescribed time, the Government shall declare the property forfeited).Nor can any undue hardship justify a less than careful endeavor actually to inform Dusenbery that his property is thesubject of an impending forfeiture. The agency responsiblefor giving notice of the forfeiture, here, the FBI, is part ofthe same Government as the prisoner's custodian, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). As the Second Circuit observed,"[w]hen [a federal] investigating agency [seeks] a prisoner'scooperation in testifying against some important wrongdoer,534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN179Cite as: 534 U.

Similarly, the federal forfeiting agency should en-counter no difficulty in "secur[ing] the [BOP's] cooperation inassuring that the notice will be delivered to the [prisoner]and that a reliable record of the delivery will be created."Ibid.A further factor counsels care to inform a prisoner thathis Government is proceeding against him or his property.A prisoner receives his mail only through the combined goodoffices oftwo bureaucracies which he can neither monitor norcontrol: The postal service must move the mail from thesender to the prison, and the prison must then move the mailfrom the prison gates to the prisoner's hands. That the firstsystem can be relied upon does not imply that the second isacceptable. See United States v. One Toshiba Color Television, 213 F. 3d 147, 154 (CA3 2000); accord, Weng, 137 F. 3d,at 715; cf. Houston v. Lack, 487 U. S. 266, 271 (1988) (Courtrecognized that "the pro se prisoner has no choice but toentrust the forwarding of [mail] to prison authorities whomhe cannot control or supervise and who may have every incentive to delay"; Court therefore held that pro se prisoner'snotice of appeal must be regarded as "filed" when deliveredto prison authorities for mailing). In the cases in which weindicated that mail notice would be sufficient, by contrast,receipt hinged only upon the dependability of the postalservice, "upon which prudent men will ordinarily rely in theconduct of important affairs." Greene, 456 U. S., at 455; seealso Mullane, 339 U. S., at 319 ("[T]he mails today are recognized as an efficient and inexpensive means of communication."); United States Postal Service, 2000 ComprehensiveStatement on Postal Operations 91 (Table 5.1) (on-time delivery rate of first class mail between 87% and 94%).The majority asserts that "[t]he Government here carriedits burden of showing the . . . procedures . . . used to givenotice."

UNITED STATESGinsburg, J., dissentingmission, that assertion is groundless, for the Governmentcarried no burden whatever. It introduced nothing to showthe reasonableness or reliability of the mailroom to cell deliv-ery at FCI Milan at the time of the forfeiture in question.See supra, at 174.Beyond doubt, the Government can try harder, withoutundue inconvenience or expense. Indeed, it now does so: Asthe Government informed the Court on brief, prison employees currently "must not only record the receipt of the certi-fied mail and its distribution, but the prisoner himself mustsign a log book acknowledging delivery." Brief for UnitedStates 24 (citing BOP Program Statement 5800.10.409,5800.10.409A (Nov. 3, 1995)). If a prisoner refuses to sign, aprison officer must document that refusal. BOP OperationsMemorandum 035-99 (5800), p. 2 (July 19, 1999). The Gov-ernment noted additionally that administrative forfeiture notices, along with "appropriately marked congressional, judi-cial, law enforcement, and attorney correspondence," arenow marked "special mail," to be "opened only in the in-mate's presence." Brief for United States 29, n. 19 (citing28 CFR $ 540.12(c) (2001) and BOP Program Statement5800.10.35).The Government, of course, should not be "penalized" forupgrading its policies. See ante, at 172. It would be improper to brand the BOP's 1988 procedures deficient simplybecause those procedures have since been improved. Nevertheless, the new rules show that substantial improvementsin reliability could have been had, in 1988 and years before,at minimal expense and inconvenience. Nor will it do tolabel these efforts a matter of executive grace. They undeniably provide a "feasible" means "substantially [more] likelyto bring home notice" than FCI Milan's prior uncertain mailroom to prison cell practice. See Mullane, 339 U. S., at 315.33 The majority suggests that it is necessary to "explain" how "requiring the end recipient to sign for a piece of mail substantially improvesthe reliability of the delivery procedures leading up to that person's534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN181Cite as: 534 U.

Brief for United States23-24. The Court shies away from explicit agreement, forthat is not what Mullane instructs. Rather, the partyobliged to give notice--here, the Government--must adopta method "reasonably calculated" to reach the intended re-cipient. See 339 U.

The Government,staying "within the limits of practicability," Mullane, 339U.

Ante, at 172. The signature procedure now in place offers theFBI the same security that motivates any other postal customer to pay asurcharge for certified mail, return receipt requested: A sender who knowswhether delivery to the addressee was accomplished can try again if thefirst effort fails. Moreover, if forfeiture cannot be had absent a logbooksignature or documentation that the addressee refused to sign, the BOPwill have every incentive to make sure its internal procedures guaranteereliable delivery. The BOP's incentive fades if all that is required is ageneral statement by a mailroom employee that it is prison policy to deliver inmate mail. See supra, at 174.4 The majority's concern that a more demanding proof of notice requirement would undermine finality, ante, at 171, is baffling: Disputes overwhether notice was sent or received would be diminished, not encouraged,by requiring proof of notice by signature. Under the regime the majoritytolerates, notice may be delivered or not depending on the diligence orcarelessness of the prison administration and the reliability or neglect ofits Unit Teams. "The title to property should not depend on such vagaries." Ibid.534US1 Unit: $U10 [02-27-02 20:58:57] PAGES PGT: OPIN182 DUSENBERY v. UNITED STATESGinsburg, J., dissentingAnte, at 170.

There is littledanger that Hollywood will confuse the rescuers of PrivateRyan, see ibid., with a BOP Unit Team member, putativelydelivering certified mail to inmates in his charge at leastsince 1988, instructed a decade later to linger for the additional moments required to secure for each delivery a signature in a logbook.5 The Due Process Clause requires nothing of the Government in cases of this genre beyond thepracticable, efficient, and inexpensive reform the BOP hasalready adopted.Notice consistent with due process "will vary with circumstances and conditions." Mennonite Bd., 462 U. S., at 802(O'Connor, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted) (internal quotation marks omitted). Given the circumstances and conditions of imprisonment, the Government must have cause tobe confident that legal notices to prisoners will be deliveredinside the prison with the care "one desirous of actually informing the [addressee] might reasonably adopt to accomplish it."

Ante, at 170. Of course, many active-duty military personnel, both on and off military bases, maintain personal mailboxes and interact with local postal authorities as does any other resident. The majorityis right that other members of the Armed Forces--soldiers in combat,for example--are in respects material to this case similarly situated toDusenbery: Government authority determines their whereabouts and restricts their movements, and that same authority receives their mail at acentral delivery location and must make arrangements to distribute it further.

WILLIAMScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuitNo. 00-1089. Argued November 7, 2001--Decided January 8, 2002Claiming to be unable to perform her automobile assembly line job because she was disabled by carpal tunnel syndrome and related impairments, respondent sued petitioner, her former employer, for failing toprovide her with a reasonable accommodation as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(b)(5)(A).The District Court granted petitioner summary judgment, holding thatrespondent's impairment did not qualify as a "disability" under the ADAbecause it had not "substantially limit[ed]" any "major life activit[y],"$ 12102(2)(A), and that there was no evidence that respondent had hada record of a substantially limiting impairment or that petitioner hadregarded her as having such an impairment. The Sixth Circuit reversed, finding that the impairments substantially limited respondent inthe major life activity of performing manual tasks. In order to demonstrate that she was so limited, said the court, respondent had to showthat her manual disability involved a "class" of manual activities affecting the ability to perform tasks at work. Respondent satisfied this test,according to the court, because her ailments prevented her from doingthe tasks associated with certain types of manual jobs that require thegripping of tools and repetitive work with hands and arms extended ator above shoulder levels for extended periods of time. In reaching thisconclusion, the court found that evidence that respondent could tend toher personal hygiene and carry out personal or household chores did notaffect a determination that her impairments substantially limited herability to perform the range of manual tasks associated with an assembly line job. The court granted respondent partial summary judgmenton the issue of whether she was disabled under the ADA.Held: The Sixth Circuit did not apply the proper standard in determiningthat respondent was disabled under the ADA because it analyzed onlya limited class of manual tasks and failed to ask whether respondent'simpairments prevented or restricted her from performing tasks that areof central importance to most people's daily lives. Pp. 193-203.(a) The Court's consideration of what an individual must prove todemonstrate a substantial limitation in the major life activity of performing manual tasks is guided by the ADA's disability definition.534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN185Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Syllabus"Substantially" in the phrase "substantially limits" suggests "considerable" or "to a large degree," and thus clearly precludes impairmentsthat interfere in only a minor way with performing manual tasks.Cf. Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U. S. 555, 565. Moreover, because "major" means important, "major life activities" refers to thoseactivities that are of central importance to daily life. In order for performing manual tasks to fit into this category, the tasks in question mustbe central to daily life. To be substantially limited in the specific majorlife activity of performing manual tasks, therefore, an individual musthave an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individualfrom doing activities that are of central importance to most people'sdaily lives. The impairment's impact must also be permanent or longterm. See 29 CFR $$ 1630.2(j)(2)(ii)-(iii).It is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove disability statusunder this test to merely submit evidence of a medical diagnosis of animpairment. Instead, the ADA requires them to offer evidence thatthe extent of the limitation caused by their impairment in terms of theirown experience is substantial. 527 U. S., at 567. That the ADA defines "disability" "with respect to an individual," $ 12102(2), makes clearthat Congress intended the existence of a disability to be determined insuch a case-by-case manner. See, e. g., Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc.,527 U. S. 471, 483. An individualized assessment of the effect of animpairment is particularly necessary when the impairment is one suchas carpal tunnel syndrome, in which symptoms vary widely from personto person. Pp. 196-199.(b) The Sixth Circuit erred in suggesting that, in order to prove asubstantial limitation in the major life activity of performing manualtasks, a plaintiff must show that her manual disability involves a "class"of manual activities, and that those activities affect the ability to perform tasks at work. Nothing in the ADA's text, this Court's opinions,or the regulations suggests that a class-based framework should applyoutside the context of the major life activity of working. While theSixth Circuit addressed the different major life activity of performingmanual tasks, its analysis erroneously circumvented Sutton, supra, at491, by focusing on respondent's inability to perform manual tasks associated only with her job. Rather, the central inquiry must be whetherthe claimant is unable to perform the variety of tasks central to mostpeople's daily lives. Also without support is the Sixth Circuit's assertion that the question of whether an impairment constitutes a disabilityis to be answered only by analyzing the impairment's effect in the workplace. That the ADA's "disability" definition applies not only to theportion of the ADA dealing with employment, but also to the otherprovisions dealing with public transportation and public accommoda534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN186 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v. WILLIAMSSyllabustions, demonstrates that the definition is intended to cover individualswith disabling impairments regardless of whether they have any connection to a workplace. Moreover, because the manual tasks unique to anyparticular job are not necessarily important parts of most people's lives,occupation-specific tasks may have only limited relevance to the manualtask inquiry. In this case, repetitive work with hands and arms extended at or above shoulder levels for extended periods, the manualtask on which the Sixth Circuit relied, is not an important part of mostpeople's daily lives. Household chores, bathing, and brushing one'steeth, in contrast, are among the types of manual tasks of central importance to people's daily lives, so the Sixth Circuit should not have disregarded respondent's ability to do these activities.

(1994 ed. andSupp. V), a physical impairment that "substantially limitsone or more . . . major life activities" is a "disability." 42U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A) (1994 ed.). Respondent, claiming to bedisabled because of her carpal tunnel syndrome and otherrelated impairments, sued petitioner, her former employer,for failing to provide her with a reasonable accommodationas required by the ADA. See $ 12112(b)(5)(A). The District Court granted summary judgment to petitioner, findingthat respondent's impairments did not substantially limit anyof her major life activities. The Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit reversed, finding that the impairments substantially limited respondent in the major life activity of per-forming manual tasks, and therefore granting partial summary judgment to respondent on the issue of whether shewas disabled under the ADA. We conclude that the Courtof Appeals did not apply the proper standard in making thisdetermination because it analyzed only a limited class ofmanual tasks and failed to ask whether respondent's impair-ments prevented or restricted her from performing tasksthat are of central importance to most people's daily lives.IRespondent began working at petitioner's automobilemanufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, in August1990. She was soon placed on an engine fabrication assem-bly line, where her duties included work with pneumatictools. Use of these tools eventually caused pain in respond-ent's hands, wrists, and arms. She sought treatment at petitioner's in-house medical service, where she was diagnosedwith bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and bilateral tendinitis. Respondent consulted a personal physician who placedher on permanent work restrictions that precluded her fromlifting more than 20 pounds or from "frequently lifting or534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN188 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v.

Brief for Respondent 2; App. 45-46.In light of these restrictions, for the next two years peti-tioner assigned respondent to various modified duty jobs.Nonetheless, respondent missed some work for medicalleave, and eventually filed a claim under the Kentucky Work-ers' Compensation Act. Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 342.0011et seq. (1997 and Supp. 2000). The parties settled this claim,and respondent returned to work. She was unsatisfied bypetitioner's efforts to accommodate her work restrictions,however, and responded by bringing an action in the UnitedStates District Court for the Eastern District of Kentuckyalleging that petitioner had violated the ADA by refusing toaccommodate her disability. That suit was also settled, andas part of the settlement, respondent returned to work inDecember 1993.Upon her return, petitioner placed respondent on a teamin Quality Control Inspection Operations (QCIO). QCIO isresponsible for four tasks: (1) "assembly paint"; (2) "paintsecond inspection"; (3) "shell body audit"; and (4) "ED surface repair." App. 19. Respondent was initially placed ona team that performed only the first two of these tasks, andfor a couple of years, she rotated on a weekly basis betweenthem. In assembly paint, respondent visually inspectedpainted cars moving slowly down a conveyor. She scannedfor scratches, dents, chips, or any other flaws that may haveoccurred during the assembly or painting process, at a rateof one car every 54 seconds. When respondent began working in assembly paint, inspection team members were required to open and shut the doors, trunk, and/or hood of eachpassing car. Sometime during respondent's tenure, however, the position was modified to include only visual inspection with few or no manual tasks. Paint second inspection required team members to use their hands to wipe each534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN189Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Opinion of the Courtpainted car with a glove as it moved along a conveyor. Id.,at 21-22. The parties agree that respondent was physicallycapable of performing both of these jobs and that her per-formance was satisfactory.During the fall of 1996, petitioner announced that itwanted QCIO employees to be able to rotate through all fourof the QCIO processes. Respondent therefore receivedtraining for the shell body audit job, in which team membersapply a highlight oil to the hood, fender, doors, rear quarterpanel, and trunk of passing cars at a rate of approximatelyone car per minute. The highlight oil has the viscosity ofsalad oil, and employees spread it on cars with a spongeattached to a block of wood. After they wipe each car withthe oil, the employees visually inspect it for flaws. Wipingthe cars required respondent to hold her hands and arms uparound shoulder height for several hours at a time.A short while after the shell body audit job was added torespondent's rotations, she began to experience pain in herneck and shoulders. Respondent again sought care at petitioner's in-house medical service, where she was diagnosedwith myotendinitis bilateral periscapular, an inflammation ofthe muscles and tendons around both of her shoulder blades;myotendinitis and myositis bilateral forearms with nervecompression causing median nerve irritation; and thoracicoutlet compression, a condition that causes pain in the nervesthat lead to the upper extremities. Respondent requestedthat petitioner accommodate her medical conditions byallowing her to return to doing only her original two jobsin QCIO, which respondent claimed she could still performwithout difficulty.The parties disagree about what happened next. According to respondent, petitioner refused her request and forcedher to continue working in the shell body audit job, whichcaused her even greater physical injury. According to petitioner, respondent simply began missing work on a regularbasis. Regardless, it is clear that on December 6, 1996, the534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN190 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v.

On January 27, 1997, respondent received aletter from petitioner that terminated her employment, citing her poor attendance record.Respondent filed a charge of disability discrimination withthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).After receiving a right to sue letter, respondent filed suitagainst petitioner in the United States District Court for theEastern District of Kentucky. Her complaint alleged thatpetitioner had violated the ADA and the Kentucky CivilRights Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 344.010 et seq. (1997 andSupp. 2000), by failing to reasonably accommodate her disability and by terminating her employment. Respondentlater amended her complaint to also allege a violation of theFamily and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), 107 Stat. 6,as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 2601 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V).Respondent based her claim that she was "disabled" underthe ADA on the ground that her physical impairments substantially limited her in (1) manual tasks; (2) housework;(3) gardening; (4) playing with her children; (5) lifting; and(6) working, all of which, she argued, constituted major lifeactivities under the Act. Respondent also argued, in the alternative, that she was disabled under the ADA because shehad a record of a substantially limiting impairment and because she was regarded as having such an impairment.

The Court of Appealsfor the Sixth Circuit reversed the District Court's ruling onwhether respondent was disabled at the time she sought an534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN192 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtaccommodation, but affirmed the District Court's rulings onrespondent's FMLA and wrongful termination claims. 224F. 3d 840 (2000). The Court of Appeals held that in orderfor respondent to demonstrate that she was disabled due toa substantial limitation in the ability to perform manualtasks at the time of her accommodation request, she had to"show that her manual disability involve[d] a `class' of manual activities affecting the ability to perform tasks at work."Id., at 843. Respondent satisfied this test, according to theCourt of Appeals, because her ailments "prevent[ed] herfrom doing the tasks associated with certain types of manualassembly line jobs, manual product handling jobs and manualbuilding trade jobs (painting, plumbing, roofing, etc.) that require the gripping of tools and repetitive work with handsand arms extended at or above shoulder levels for extendedperiods of time." Ibid. In reaching this conclusion, thecourt disregarded evidence that respondent could "ten[d] toher personal hygiene [and] carr[y] out personal or householdchores," finding that such evidence "does not affect a determination that her impairment substantially limit[ed] her ability to perform the range of manual tasks associated withan assembly line job," ibid. Because the Court of Appealsconcluded that respondent had been substantially limited inperforming manual tasks and, for that reason, was entitledto partial summary judgment on the issue of whether shewas disabled under the Act, it found that it did not need todetermine whether respondent had been substantially limited in the major life activities of lifting or working, ibid., orwhether she had had a "record of " a disability or had been"regarded as" disabled, id., at 844.We granted certiorari, 532 U. S. 970 (2001), to consider theproper standard for assessing whether an individual is substantially limited in performing manual tasks. We now reverse the Court of Appeals' decision to grant partial summary judgment to respondent on the issue of whether shewas substantially limited in performing manual tasks at the534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN193Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Opinion of the Courttime she sought an accommodation. We express no opinionon the working, lifting, or other arguments for disability status that were preserved below but which were not ruledupon by the Court of Appeals.IIThe ADA requires covered entities, including private em-ployers, to provide "reasonable accommodations to theknown physical or mental limitations of an otherwise quali-fied individual with a disability who is an applicant oremployee, unless such covered entity can demonstrate thatthe accommodation would impose an undue hardship." 42U. S. C. $ 12112(b)(5)(A) (1994 ed.); see also $ 12111(2) ("Theterm `covered entity' means an employer, employmentagency, labor organization, or joint labor-management com-mittee"). The Act defines a "qualified individual with a disability" as "an individual with a disability who, with or with-out reasonable accommodation, can perform the essentialfunctions of the employment position that such individualholds or desires." $ 12111(8). In turn, a "disability" is:"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substan-tially limits one or more of the major life activities ofsuch individual;"(B) a record of such an impairment; or"(C) being regarded as having such an impairment."$ 12102(2).There are two potential sources of guidance for interpret-ing the terms of this definition--the regulations interpretingthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 87 Stat. 361, as amended, 29U. S. C. $ 706(8)(B) (1988 ed.), and the EEOC regulations interpreting the ADA. Congress drew the ADA's definitionof disability almost verbatim from the definition of "handicapped individual" in the Rehabilitation Act, $ 706(8)(B), andCongress' repetition of a well-established term generallyimplies that Congress intended the term to be construed534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN194 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtin accordance with pre-existing regulatory interpretations.Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S. 624, 631 (1998); FDIC v. Philadelphia Gear Corp., 476 U. S. 426, 437-438 (1986); ICC v. Parker, 326 U. S. 60, 65 (1945). As we explained in Bragdon v.Abbott, supra, at 631, Congress did more in the ADA thansuggest this construction; it adopted a specific statutory provision directing as follows:"Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to apply a lesserstandard than the standards applied under title V of theRehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U. S. C. 790 et seq.) or theregulations issued by Federal agencies pursuant to suchtitle." 42 U. S. C. $ 12201(a) (1994 ed.).The persuasive authority of the EEOC regulations is lessclear. As we have previously noted, see Sutton v. UnitedAir Lines, Inc., 527 U. S. 471, 479 (1999), no agency has beengiven authority to issue regulations interpreting the term"disability" in the ADA. Nonetheless, the EEOC has doneso. See 29 CFR $$ 1630.2(g)-( j) (2001). Because both par-ties accept the EEOC regulations as reasonable, we assumewithout deciding that they are, and we have no occasion todecide what level of deference, if any, they are due. SeeSutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., supra, at 480; Albertson's,Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U. S. 555, 563, n. 10 (1999).To qualify as disabled under subsection (A) of the ADA'sdefinition of disability, a claimant must initially prove that heor she has a physical or mental impairment. See 42 U. S. C.$ 12102(2)(A). The Rehabilitation Act regulations issued bythe Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) in1977, which appear without change in the current regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, define "physical impairment," the type of impairmentrelevant to this case, to mean "any physiological disorder orcondition, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting one or more of the following body systems: neurological;534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN195Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Opinion of the Courtmusculoskeletal; special sense organs; respiratory, includ-ing speech organs; cardiovascular; reproductive, digestive,genito-urinary; hemic and lymphatic; skin; and endocrine."45 CFR $ 84.3( j)(2)(i) (2001). The HEW regulations are ofparticular significance because at the time they were issued,HEW was the agency responsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act,29 U. S. C. $ 794 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), which prohibits dis-crimination against individuals with disabilities by recipientsof federal financial assistance. Bragdon v. Abbott, supra, at632 (citingConsolidated Rail Corporation v. Darrone, 465U. S. 624, 634 (1984)).Merely having an impairment does not make one disabledfor purposes of the ADA. Claimants also need to demonstrate that the impairment limits a major life activity. See42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A) (1994 ed.). The HEW Rehabilitation Act regulations provide a list of examples of "majorlife activities" that includes "walking, seeing, hearing," and,as relevant here, "performing manual tasks." 45 CFR$ 84.3( j)(2)(ii) (2001).To qualify as disabled, a claimant must further show thatthe limitation on the major life activity is "substantia[l]."42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A). Unlike "physical impairment" and"major life activities," the HEW regulations do not definethe term "substantially limits." See Nondiscrimination onthe Basis of Handicap in Programs and Activities Receivingor Benefiting from Federal Financial Assistance, 42 Fed.Reg. 22676, 22685 (1977) (stating HEW's position that adefinition of "substantially limits" was not possible at thattime). The EEOC, therefore, has created its own definitionfor purposes of the ADA. According to the EEOC regulations, "substantially limit[ed]" means "[u]nable to perform amajor life activity that the average person in the generalpopulation can perform"; or "[s]ignificantly restricted as tothe condition, manner or duration under which an individualcan perform a particular major life activity as compared to534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN196 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtthe condition, manner, or duration under which the averageperson in the general population can perform that samemajor life activity." 29 CFR $ 1630.2( j) (2001). In deter-mining whether an individual is substantially limited in amajor life activity, the regulations instruct that the followingfactors should be considered: "[t]he nature and severity ofthe impairment; [t]he duration or expected duration of theimpairment; and [t]he permanent or long-term impact, or theexpected permanent or long-term impact of or resulting fromthe impairment." $$ 1630.2( j)(2)(i)-(iii).IIIThe question presented by this case is whether the SixthCircuit properly determined that respondent was disabledunder subsection (A) of the ADA's disability definition at thetime that she sought an accommodation from petitioner. 42U. S. C. $ 12102(2)(A). The parties do not dispute that re-spondent's medical conditions, which include carpal tunnelsyndrome, myotendinitis, and thoracic outlet compression,amount to physical impairments. The relevant question,therefore, is whether the Sixth Circuit correctly analyzedwhether these impairments substantially limited respondentin the major life activity of performing manual tasks. An-swering this requires us to address an issue about which theEEOC regulations are silent: what a plaintiff must demon-strate to establish a substantial limitation in the specificmajor life activity of performing manual tasks.Our consideration of this issue is guided first and foremostby the words of the disability definition itself. "[S]ubstan-tially" in the phrase "substantially limits" suggests "considerable" or "to a large degree." See Webster's Third NewInternational Dictionary 2280 (1976) (defining "substantially"as "in a substantial manner" and "substantial" as "consider-able in amount, value, or worth" and "being that specified toa large degree or in the main"); see also 17 Oxford EnglishDictionary 66-67 (2d ed. 1989) ("substantial": "[r]elating to534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN197Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Opinion of the Courtor proceeding from the essence of a thing; essential"; "[o]fample or considerable amount, quantity, or dimensions").The word "substantial" thus clearly precludes impairmentsthat interfere in only a minor way with the performance ofmanual tasks from qualifying as disabilities. Cf. Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U. S., at 565 (explaining thata "mere difference" does not amount to a "significant restric[tion]" and therefore does not satisfy the EEOC's interpre-tation of "substantially limits")."Major" in the phrase "major life activities" means impor-tant. See Webster's,supra, at 1363 (defining "major" as"greater in dignity, rank, importance, or interest"). "Majorlife activities" thus refers to those activities that are of central importance to daily life. In order for performing manual tasks to fit into this category--a category that includessuch basic abilities as walking, seeing, and hearing--themanual tasks in question must be central to daily life. Ifeach of the tasks included in the major life activity of performing manual tasks does not independently qualify as amajor life activity, then together they must do so.That these terms need to be interpreted strictly to createa demanding standard for qualifying as disabled is confirmedby the first section of the ADA, which lays out the legislativefindings and purposes that motivate the Act. See 42 U. S. C.$ 12101. When it enacted the ADA in 1990, Congress foundthat "some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physicalor mental disabilities." $ 12101(a)(1). If Congress intendedeveryone with a physical impairment that precluded theperformance of some isolated, unimportant, or particularlydifficult manual task to qualify as disabled, the number ofdisabled Americans would surely have been much higher.Cf. Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U. S., at 487 (findingthat because more than 100 million people need correctivelenses to see properly, "[h]ad Congress intended to includeall persons with corrected physical limitations among thosecovered by the Act, it undoubtedly would have cited a much534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN198 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courthigher number [than 43 million] disabled persons in thefindings").We therefore hold that to be substantially limited in per-forming manual tasks, an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual fromdoing activities that are of central importance to most people's daily lives. The impairment's impact must also be permanent or long term. See 29 CFR $$ 1630.2( j)(2)(ii)-(iii)(2001).It is insufficient for individuals attempting to prove dis-ability status under this test to merely submit evidence ofa medical diagnosis of an impairment. Instead, the ADArequires those "claiming the Act's protection . . . to prove adisability by offering evidence that the extent of the limitation [caused by their impairment] in terms of their ownexperience . . . is substantial." Albertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, supra, at 567 (holding that monocular vision is not invariably a disability, but must be analyzed on an individualbasis, taking into account the individual's ability to compensate for the impairment). That the Act defines "disability""with respect to an individual," 42 U. S. C. $ 12102(2), makesclear that Congress intended the existence of a disability tobe determined in such a case-by-case manner. See Suttonv. United Air Lines, Inc., supra, at 483; Albertson's, Inc. v.Kirkingburg, supra, at 566; cf. Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U. S.,at 641-642 (relying on unchallenged testimony that the respondent's HIV infection controlled her decision not to havea child, and declining to consider whether HIV infection is aper se disability under the ADA); 29 CFR pt. 1630, App.$ 1630.2( j) (2001) ("The determination of whether an individual has a disability is not necessarily based on the name ordiagnosis of the impairment the person has, but rather onthe effect of that impairment on the life of the individual");ibid. ("The determination of whether an individual is substantially limited in a major life activity must be made on acase-by-case basis").534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN199Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAn individualized assessment of the effect of an impair-ment is particularly necessary when the impairment is onewhose symptoms vary widely from person to person. Car-pal tunnel syndrome, one of respondent's impairments, isjust such a condition. While cases of severe carpal tunnelsyndrome are characterized by muscle atrophy and extremesensory deficits, mild cases generally do not have either ofthese effects and create only intermittent symptoms ofnumbness and tingling. Carniero, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome:The Cause Dictates the Treatment, 66 Cleveland Clinic J.Medicine 159, 161-162 (1999). Studies have further shownthat, even without surgical treatment, one quarter of carpaltunnel cases resolve in one month, but that in 22 percent ofcases, symptoms last for eight years or longer. See DeStefano, Nordstrom, & Uierkant, Long-term Symptom Out-comes of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and its Treatment, 22A J.Hand Surgery 200, 204-205 (1997). When pregnancy is thecause of carpal tunnel syndrome, in contrast, the symptomsnormally resolve within two weeks of delivery. See Ouel-lette, Nerve Compression Syndromes of the Upper Extremity in Women, 17 J. of Musculoskeletal Medicine 536 (2000).Given these large potential differences in the severity andduration of the effects of carpal tunnel syndrome, an individ-ual's carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosis, on its own, does notindicate whether the individual has a disability within themeaning of the ADA.IVThe Court of Appeals' analysis of respondent's claimed dis-ability suggested that in order to prove a substantial limitation in the major life activity of performing manual tasks, a"plaintiff must show that her manual disability involves a`class' of manual activities," and that those activities "affec[t]the ability to perform tasks at work." See 224 F. 3d, at 843.Both of these ideas lack support.The Court of Appeals relied on our opinion inSutton v.United Air Lines, Inc., for the idea that a "class" of manual534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN200 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtactivities must be implicated for an impairment to substan-tially limit the major life activity of performing manualtasks. 224 F. 3d, at 843. But Sutton said only that "[w]henthe major life activity under consideration is that of working, the statutory phrase `substantially limits' requires . . .that plaintiffs allege they are unable to work in a broad classof jobs." 527 U. S., at 491 (emphasis added). Because ofthe conceptual difficulties inherent in the argument thatworking could be a major life activity, we have been hesitantto hold as much, and we need not decide this difficult ques-tion today. InSutton, we noted that even assuming thatworking is a major life activity, a claimant would be requiredto show an inability to work in a "broad range of jobs,"rather than a specific job. Id., at 492. But Sutton did notsuggest that a class-based analysis should be applied to anymajor life activity other than working. Nor do the EEOCregulations. In defining "substantially limits," the EEOCregulations only mention the "class" concept in the contextof the major life activity of working. 29 CFR $ 1630.2( j)(3)(2001) ("With respect to the major life activity of working[,][t]he term substantially limits means significantly restrictedin the ability to perform either a class of jobs or a broadrange of jobs in various classes as compared to the averageperson having comparable training, skills and abilities").Nothing in the text of the Act, our previous opinions, or theregulations suggests that a class-based framework shouldapply outside the context of the major life activity ofworking.While the Court of Appeals in this case addressed the different major life activity of performing manual tasks, itsanalysis circumvented Sutton by focusing on respondent'sinability to perform manual tasks associated only with herjob. This was error. When addressing the major life activity of performing manual tasks, the central inquiry must bewhether the claimant is unable to perform the variety oftasks central to most people's daily lives, not whether the534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN201Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Opinion of the Courtclaimant is unable to perform the tasks associated with herspecific job. Otherwise,Sutton's restriction on claims ofdisability based on a substantial limitation in working willbe rendered meaningless because an inability to perform aspecific job always can be recast as an inability to perform a"class" of tasks associated with that specific job.There is also no support in the Act, our previous opinions,or the regulations for the Court of Appeals' idea that thequestion of whether an impairment constitutes a disability isto be answered only by analyzing the effect of the impair-ment in the workplace. Indeed, the fact that the Act's definition of "disability" applies not only to Title I of the Act, 42U. S. C. $$ 12111-12117 (1994 ed.), which deals with employment, but also to the other portions of the Act, which dealwith subjects such as public transportation, $$ 12141-12150,42 U. S. C. $$ 12161-12165 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), and privately provided public accommodations, $$ 12181-12189,demonstrates that the definition is intended to cover individuals with disabling impairments regardless of whether theindividuals have any connection to a workplace.Even more critically, the manual tasks unique to any particular job are not necessarily important parts of most people's lives. As a result, occupation-specific tasks may haveonly limited relevance to the manual task inquiry. In thiscase, "repetitive work with hands and arms extended at orabove shoulder levels for extended periods of time," 224F. 3d, at 843, the manual task on which the Court of Appealsrelied, is not an important part of most people's daily lives.The court, therefore, should not have considered respondent's inability to do such manual work in her specialized assembly line job as sufficient proof that she was substantiallylimited in performing manual tasks.At the same time, the Court of Appeals appears to havedisregarded the very type of evidence that it should havefocused upon. It treated as irrelevant "[t]he fact that [respondent] can . . . ten[d] to her personal hygiene [and] carr[y]534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN202 TOYOTA MOTOR MFG., KY., INC. v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtout personal or household chores." Ibid. Yet householdchores, bathing, and brushing one's teeth are among thetypes of manual tasks of central importance to people's dailylives, and should have been part of the assessment ofwhether respondent was substantially limited in performingmanual tasks.The District Court noted that at the time respondentsought an accommodation from petitioner, she admitted thatshe was able to do the manual tasks required by her originaltwo jobs in QCIO. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-36. In addi-tion, according to respondent's deposition testimony, evenafter her condition worsened, she could still brush her teeth,wash her face, bathe, tend her flower garden, fix breakfast,do laundry, and pick up around the house. App. 32-34. Therecord also indicates that her medical conditions caused herto avoid sweeping, to quit dancing, to occasionally seek helpdressing, and to reduce how often she plays with her children, gardens, and drives long distances. Id., at 32, 38-39.But these changes in her life did not amount to such severerestrictions in the activities that are of central importanceto most people's daily lives that they establish a manual taskdisability as a matter of law. On this record, it was therefore inappropriate for the Court of Appeals to grant partialsummary judgment to respondent on the issue of whethershe was substantially limited in performing manual tasks,and its decision to do so must be reversed.In its brief on the merits, petitioner asks us to reinstatethe District Court's grant of summary judgment to petitioner on the manual task issue. In its petition for certiorari, however, petitioner did not seek summary judgment; itargued only that the Court of Appeals' reasons for grantingpartial summary judgment to respondent were unsound.This Court's Rule 14.1(a) provides: "Only the questions setout in the petition, or fairly included therein, will be considered by the Court." The question of whether petitioner wasentitled to summary judgment on the manual task issue is534US1 Unit: $U11 [04-10-03 15:28:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN203Cite as: 534 U. S. 184 (2002)Opinion of the Courttherefore not properly before us. See Irvine v. California,347 U. S. 128, 129-130 (1954).Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals' judgmentgranting partial summary judgment to respondent and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
