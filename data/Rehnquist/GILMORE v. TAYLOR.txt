Respondent Kevin Taylor was convicted of murder byan Illinois jury and sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment.After his conviction and sentence became final, he soughtfederal habeas relief on the ground that the jury instructionsgiven at his trial violated the Fourteenth Amendment's DueProcess Clause. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted relief on the basis of its recent decision in Falconer v. Lane, 905 F. 2d 1129 (1990), which held that theIllinois pattern jury instructions on murder and voluntarymanslaughter were unconstitutional because they allowed ajury to return a murder verdict without considering whetherthe defendant possessed a mental state that would supporta voluntary-manslaughter verdict instead. We concludethat the rule announced in Falconer was not dictated byprior precedent and is therefore "new" within the meaningof Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Accordingly, theFalconer rule may not provide the basis for federal habeasrelief in respondent's case.Early one morning in September 1985, respondent becameinvolved in a dispute with his former wife and her live-in*Kent S.

At the close of all the evidence, thetrial judge found that there was sufficient evidence supporting respondent's "heat of passion" defense to require an instruction on voluntary manslaughter, and instructed the juryas follows:"To sustain the charge of murder, the State must provethe following propositions:"First: That the Defendant performed the acts whichcaused the death of Scott Siniscalchi; and"Second: That when the Defendant did so he intendedto kill or do great bodily harm to Scott Siniscalchi; or heknew that his act would cause death or great bodilyharm to Scott Siniscalchi; or he knew that his acts created a strong probability of death or great bodily harmto Scott Siniscalchi; or he was committing the offense ofhome invasion."If you find from your consideration of all the evidencethat each one of these propositions has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the Defendantguilty."If you find from your consideration of all the evidencethat any one of these propositions has not been provedbeyond a reasonable doubt, you should find the Defendant not guilty.. . . . .508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT337Cite as: 508 U.

TAYLOROpinion of the Courtslaughter Cases: An Affirmative Defense Approach, 59 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 23 (1982).1 Respondent did not object to theinstructions. The jury returned a guilty verdict on the mur-der charge, and respondent was sentenced to 35 years'imprisonment.Respondent unsuccessfully challenged his conviction onappeal, then filed a petition for state postconviction relief.The Circuit Court dismissed the petition. But while respondent's appeal was pending, the Illinois Supreme Courtinvalidated the Illinois pattern jury instructions on murderand voluntary manslaughter. People v. Reddick, 123 Ill. 2d184, 526 N. E. 2d 141 (1988). According to the SupremeCourt, under Illinois law, the instructions should have placedon the prosecution the burden ofdisproving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed a mitigatingmental state.Id., at 197, 526 N. E. 2d, at 146. Respondentsought to take advantage of Reddick on appeal, but theCourt of Appeals affirmed the denial of postconviction reliefon the ground that Reddick did not involve constitutionalerror, the only type of error that would support the grant ofrelief. People v. Taylor, 181 Ill. App. 3d 538, 536 N. E. 2d1312 (1989). The Illinois Supreme Court denied respond-ent's request for leave to appeal.Having exhausted his state remedies, respondent soughtfederal habeas relief, attacking his conviction on the groundthat the jury instructions given at his trial violated due proc-ess. Eleven days later, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held as much in Falconer v. Lane, 905 F. 2d 1129(1990). The defect identified by theFalconer court wasquite different from that identified in Reddick: Because the1 Effective July 1, 1987, the offense of voluntary manslaughter was reclassified as second-degree murder and the burden of proof as to the existence of a mitigating mental state was expressly placed on the defendant.Ill. Rev. Stat., ch. 38, || 9-2 (1987). The Illinois pattern jury instructionswere rewritten accordingly. 1 Illinois Pattern Jury Instructions--Criminal $ 7.02B (3d ed. 1992, Supp. 1993).508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT339Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)Opinion of the Courtmurder instructions preceded the voluntary-manslaughterinstructions, but did not expressly direct the jury that itcould not return a murder conviction if it found that the defendant possessed a mitigating mental state, it was possiblefor a jury to find that a defendant was guilty of murder without even considering whether he was entitled to a voluntarymanslaughter conviction instead. 905 F. 2d, at 1136. "Explicit misdirection on this scale," the Seventh Circuit held,"violates the constitutional guarantee of due process." Id.,at 1137. In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appealsplaced principal reliance on Cupp v. Naughten, 414 U. S.141 (1973).At respondent's federal habeas proceeding, the State conceded that the jury instructions given at respondent's trialwere unconstitutional under Falconer, but argued that therule announced in Falconer was "new" within the meaningof Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and therefore couldnot form the basis for federal habeas relief. The DistrictCourt agreed, but the Court of Appeals reversed. 954 F. 2d441 (1992). Although the Seventh Circuit now thoughtCupp was "too general to have compelled Falconer withinthe meaning of Teague," 954 F. 2d, at 452, it concluded thatBoyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990), and Connecticut v.Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (1983) (plurality opinion), were "specific enough to have compelled" the result reached in Falconer, 954 F. 2d, at 453. Accordingly, the Court of Appealsheld that the rule announced in Falconer was not "new"within the meaning of Teague, and that Teague therefore didnot bar the retroactive application of Falconer in respondent's case. Id., at 453. We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 814(1992), and now reverse.The retroactivity of Falconer under Teague and its progeny is the only question before us in this case.

Though we have offered various formulations of what constitutes a new rule, put "meaningfully for the majority of cases, a decision announces a newrule ` "if the result was notdictated by precedent existing atthe time the defendant's conviction became final." ' " Butlerv.McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 412 (1990) (quoting Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 314 (1989), in turn quoting Teague,supra, at 301 (emphasis in original)); see also Graham,supra, at 467; Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 234 (1990);Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990); Penry v. Lynaugh,492 U. S. 302, 329 (1989). "The `new rule' principle . . . validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts," 494 U. S., at 414, and thuseffectuates the States' interest in the finality of criminal convictions and fosters comity between federal and state courts.We begin our analysis with the actual flaw found by theFalconer court in the challenged jury instructions. It wasnot that they somehow lessened the State's burden of proofbelow that constitutionally required by cases such as In reWinship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970); nor was it that the instructionsaffirmatively misstated applicable state law. (The Court ofAppeals in no way relied upon People v. Reddick, supra,which the Illinois Supreme Court had subsequently held wassubject to prospective application only. People v. Flowers,138 Ill. 2d 218, 561 N. E. 2d 674 (1990).) Rather, the flawidentified by the Falconer court was that when the juryinstructions were read consecutively, with the elements ofmurder set forth before the elements of voluntary manslaughter, a juror could conclude that the defendant wasguilty of murder after applying the elements of that offensewithout continuing on to decide whether the elements of voluntary manslaughter were also made out, so as to justifyreturning a verdict on that lesser offense instead.508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT341Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIn concluding that this defect violated due process, theFalconer court relied on Cupp v. Naughten, supra. Thatcase involved a due process challenge to a jury instructionthat witnesses are presumed to tell the truth, which thedefendant claimed had the effect of shifting the burden ofproof on his innocence. Because the jury had been explicitlyinstructed on the defendant's presumption of innocence aswell as the State's burden of proving guilt beyond a reason-able doubt, we held that the instruction did not amount to aconstitutional violation. See 414 U. S., at 149.We thinkCupp is an unlikely progenitor of the rule announced in Falconer, a view now shared by the Seventh Circuit. The cases following Cupp in the Winship line establish that States must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubtwith respect to every element of the offense charged, butthat they may place on defendants the burden of provingaffirmative defenses. See Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228(1987); Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977). TheState argues that these later cases support the propositionthat any error committed in instructing a jury with respectto an affirmative defense, which does not lessen the State'sWinship burden in proving every element of the offensecharged beyond a reasonable doubt, is one wholly of statelaw. Cf. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 119-121, and n. 21(1982) (challenge to correctness of self-defense instructionsunder state law provides no basis for federal habeas relief).We need not address this contention other than to say thatcases like Patterson and Martin make it crystal clear thatCupp does not compel the result reached in Falconer.In its decision in the present case, the Court of Appealsoffered two additional cases which it believed did dictate theresult in Falconer. The first is Boyde v. California, supra.There, we clarified the standard for reviewing on federal habeas a claim that ambiguous jury instructions impermissiblyrestricted the jury's consideration of "constitutionally relevant evidence." 494 U. S., at 380. Although Boyde was de508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT342 GILMORE v. TAYLOROpinion of the Courtcided after respondent's conviction and sentence becamefinal, it did not work a change in the law favoring criminaldefendants, and therefore may be considered in our Teagueanalysis. SeeLockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 373 (1993).Nevertheless, Boyde was a capital case, with respect towhich we have held that the Eighth Amendment requires agreater degree of accuracy and factfinding than would betrue in a noncapital case. See Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S.390, 399 (1993);Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625 (1980). Outside of the capital context, we have never said that the possi-bility of a jury misapplying state law gives rise to federalconstitutional error. To the contrary, we have held that instructions that contain errors of state law may not form thebasis for federal habeas relief. Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S.62 (1991).Moreover, under the standard fashioned in Boyde, the relevant inquiry is "whether there is a reasonable likelihoodthat the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a waythat prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevantevidence." 494 U. S., at 380. In Boyde, the petitioner argued that the trial court's instruction on California's "catchall" factor for determining whether a defendant should besentenced to death restricted the jury's consideration of certain mitigating evidence. Since "[t]he Eighth Amendmentrequires that the jury be able to consider and give effect toall relevant mitigating evidence," id., at 377-378, this evidence was plainly constitutionally relevant. In this case, bycontrast, petitioner argues that the challenged instructionsprevented the jury from considering evidence of his affirmative defense. But in a noncapital case such as this there isno counterpart to the Eighth Amendment's doctrine of "constitutionally relevant evidence" in capital cases.The Court of Appeals also relied on the plurality opinionin Connecticut v. Johnson, 460 U. S. 73 (1983). That casedealt with the question whether an instruction that violatesdue process under Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT343Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)Opinion of the Court(1979), may be subject to harmless-error analysis. But inthe course of deciding this question, the plurality discussedthe nature of Sandstrom error, and it is this discussion onwhich the Court of Appeals relied below.Sandstrom is alineal descendant of Winship; it simply held that an instruction which creates a presumption of fact violates due processif it relieves the State of its burden of proving all of theelements of the offense charged beyond a reasonable doubt.The Court of Appeals read theJohnson plurality's discussionof Sandstrom as establishing the "due process principle" thatinstructions are unconstitutional if they lead "the jury to ignore exculpatory evidence in finding the defendant guiltyof murder beyond a reasonable doubt." 954 F. 2d, at 453(emphasis added). But neither Sandstrom nor Johnson canbe stretched that far beyond Winship. The most that canbe said of the instructions given at respondent's trial is thatthey created a risk that the jury would fail to consider evidence that related to an affirmative defense, with respect towhich Winship's due process guarantee does not apply. SeeMartin v. Ohio, supra; Patterson v. New York, supra.Respondent offers a separate (but related) rationale heclaims is supported by our cases and also compels the Seventh Circuit's ruling in Falconer: viz., the jury instructionsgiven at his trial interfered with his fundamental right topresent a defense. We have previously stated that "theConstitution guarantees criminal defendants `a meaningfulopportunity to present a complete defense.' " Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 690 (1986) (quoting California v. Trombetta, 467 U. S. 479, 485 (1984)). But the cases in which wehave invoked this principle dealt with the exclusion of evidence, see, e. g., Crane v. Kentucky, supra; Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U. S. 284 (1973), or the testimony of defensewitnesses, see, e. g., Webb v. Texas, 409 U. S. 95 (1972) (percuriam); Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14 (1967). None ofthem involved restrictions imposed on a defendant's abilityto present an affirmative defense. Drawing on these cases,508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT344 GILMORE v. TAYLOROpinion of the Courtrespondent argues that the right to present a defense in-cludes the right to have the jury consider it, and that confusing instructions on state law which prevent a jury fromconsidering an affirmative defense therefore violate dueprocess.2 But such an expansive reading of our cases wouldmake a nullity of the rule reaffirmed in Estelle v. McGuire,supra, that instructional errors of state law generally maynot form the basis for federal habeas relief. And the levelof generality at which respondent invokes this line of casesis far too great to provide any meaningful guidance for purposes of our Teague inquiry. See Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S.,at 491.For the foregoing reasons, we disagree with the SeventhCircuit and respondent that our precedent foreordained theresult in Falconer, and therefore hold that the rule an-nounced in Falconer is "new" within the meaning of Teague.32 Respondent also relies on Cool v. United States, 409 U. S. 100 (1972)(per curiam). That case involved a due process challenge to an instruction that the jury should disregard defense testimony unless it believedbeyond a reasonable doubt that the testimony was true. Relying on Inre Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), and Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14(1967), we held that this instruction required reversal of the defendant'sconviction because it "place[d] an improper burden on the defense andallow[ed] the jury to convict despite its failure to find guilt beyond areasonable doubt." 409 U. S., at 102-103. This, in turn, we emphasized,contravened Winship's command that the State must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 409 U. S., at 104. Cool is a progeny ofWinship, and therefore provides no predicate under Teague for the ruleannounced in Falconer.3 Strongly fortifying this conclusion is the fact that the instructionsdeemed unconstitutional in Falconer were modeled after, and virtuallyidentical to, the Illinois pattern jury instructions on murder and voluntarymanslaughter, which were formally adopted in 1981--five years before respondent's trial--but on which Illinois judges had relied since 1961. Aswe have stated, the purpose of Teague's "new rule" principle is to "validat[e] reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents madeby state courts." Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 414 (1990). The existence of such an institutionalized state practice over a period of years is508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT345Cite as: 508 U. S. 333 (1993)Opinion of the CourtAll that remains to be decided is whether this rule falls intoone of Teague's exceptions, under which a new rule may begiven retroactive effect on collateral review. The first exception applies to those rules that "plac[e] certain kinds ofprimary, private individual conduct beyond the power of thecriminal law-making authority to proscribe." Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S., at 307 (plurality opinion) (internal quotationmarks omitted). This exception is clearly inapplicable here,since the rule announced in Falconer does not "decriminalize" any class of conduct. See Saffle v. Parks, supra, at 495.Teague's second exception permits the retroactive application of " `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicatingthe fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." 494 U. S., at 495 (quoting Teague, supra, at 311).This exception is also inapplicable. Although the Falconercourt expressed concern that the jury might have been confused by the instructions in question, we cannot say that itsholding falls into that "small core of rules requiring `observance of those procedures that . . . are implicit in the conceptof ordered liberty.' " Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S., at 478(quoting Teague, supra, at 311 (internal quotation marksomitted)).4Because the rule announced in Falconer is "new" withinthe meaning of Teague and does not fall into one of Teague'sexceptions, it cannot provide the basis for federal habeasstrong evidence of the reasonableness of the interpretations given existingprecedent by state courts.4 Justice Blackmun in dissent would elevate the instructional defectcontained in the Illinois pattern jury instructions on murder and voluntarymanslaughter not merely to the level of a federal constitutional violation,but to one that is so fundamental as to come within Teague's second exception. He reaches this result by combining several different constitutional principles--the prohibition against ex post facto laws, the right to afair trial, and the right to remain silent--into an unrecognizable constitutional stew.508us2$84J 02-19-97 13:53:38 PAGES OPINPGT346 GILMORE v.
