Petitioner Leonel Torres Herrera was convicted of capitalmurder and sentenced to death in January 1982. He unsuccessfully challenged the conviction on direct appeal and statecollateral proceedings in the Texas state courts, and in a federal habeas petition. In February 1992--10 years after hisconviction--he urged in a second federal habeas petition thathe was "actually innocent" of the murder for which he wassentenced to death, and that the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process of law therefore forbid his execution. He supported this claim withaffidavits tending to show that his now-dead brother, ratherthan he, had been the perpetrator of the crime. Petitionerurges us to hold that this showing of innocence entitles himto relief in this federal habeas proceeding. We hold that itdoes not.Shortly before 11 p.m. on an evening in late September1981, the body of Texas Department of Public Safety OfficerDavid Rucker was found by a passer-by on a stretch of highway about six miles east of Los Fresnos, Texas, a few milesnorth of Brownsville in the Rio Grande Valley. Rucker'sbody was lying beside his patrol car. He had been shot inthe head.At about the same time, Los Fresnos Police Officer Enrique Carrisalez observed a speeding vehicle traveling westtowards Los Fresnos, away from the place where Rucker'sbody had been found, along the same road. Carrisalez, whowas accompanied in his patrol car by Enrique Hernandez,turned on his flashing red lights and pursued the speeding506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT394 HERRERA v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtvehicle. After the car had stopped briefly at a red light, itsignaled that it would pull over and did so. The patrol carpulled up behind it. Carrisalez took a flashlight and walkedtoward the car of the speeder. The driver opened his doorand exchanged a few words with Carrisalez before firing atleast one shot at Carrisalez' chest. The officer died ninedays later.Petitioner Herrera was arrested a few days after theshootings and charged with the capital murder of both Carrisalez and Rucker. He was tried and found guilty of the capital murder of Carrisalez in January 1982, and sentenced todeath. In July 1982, petitioner pleaded guilty to the murderof Rucker.At petitioner's trial for the murder of Carrisalez, Hernandez, who had witnessed Carrisalez' slaying from the officer'spatrol car, identified petitioner as the person who hadwielded the gun. A declaration by Officer Carrisalez to thesame effect, made while he was in the hospital, was also admitted. Through a license plate check, it was shown thatthe speeding car involved in Carrisalez' murder was registered to petitioner's "live-in" girlfriend. Petitioner wasknown to drive this car, and he had a set of keys to thecar in his pants pocket when he was arrested. Hernandezidentified the car as the vehicle from which the murdererhad emerged to fire the fatal shot. He also testified thatthere had been only one person in the car that night.The evidence showed that Herrera's Social Security cardhad been found alongside Rucker's patrol car on the night hewas killed. Splatters of blood on the car identified as thevehicle involved in the shootings, and on petitioner's bluejeans and wallet were identified as type A blood--the sametype which Rucker had. (Herrera has type O blood.) Similar evidence with respect to strands of hair found in the carindicated that the hair was Rucker's and not Herrera's. Ahandwritten letter was also found on the person of petitioner506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT395Cite as: 506 U.

TheTexas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed,Herrera v. State,682 S. W. 2d 313 (1984), and we denied certiorari, 471 U. S.1131 (1985). Petitioner's application for state habeas reliefwas denied.

Insupport of this claim petitioner presented the affidavits ofHector Villarreal, an attorney who had represented petitioner's brother, Raul Herrera, Sr., and of Juan Franco Palacious,one of Raul, Senior's former cellmates. Both individualsclaimed that Raul, Senior, who died in 1984, had told themthat he--and not petitioner--had killed Officers Rucker andCarrisalez.2 The State District Court denied this application, finding that "no evidence at trial remotely suggest[ed]that anyone other than [petitioner] committed the offense."Ex parte Herrera, No. 81-CR-672-C (Tex. 197th Jud.

He attested thatwhile he was representing Raul, Senior, on a charge of attempted murderin 1984, Raul, Senior, had told him that he, petitioner, their father, OfficerRucker, and the Hidalgo County Sheriff were involved in a drugtrafficking scheme; that he was the one who had shot Officers Ruckerand Carrisalez; that he did not tell anyone about this because he thoughtpetitioner would be acquitted; and that after petitioner was convicted andsentenced to death, he began blackmailing the Hidalgo County Sheriff.According to Villarreal, Raul, Senior, was killed by Jose Lopez, whoworked with the sheriff on drug-trafficking matters and was present whenRaul, Senior, murdered Rucker and Carrisalez, to silence him.Palacious' affidavit is dated December 10, 1990. He attested that whilehe and Raul, Senior, shared a cell together in the Hidalgo County jail in1984, Raul, Senior, told him that he had shot Rucker and Carrisalez.506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT397Cite as: 506 U. S. 390 (1993)Opinion of the Courtand Fourteenth Amendments. In addition to proffering theabove affidavits, petitioner presented the affidavits of RaulHerrera, Jr., Raul, Senior's son, and Jose Ybarra, Jr., aschoolmate of the Herrera brothers. Raul, Junior, averredthat he had witnessed his father shoot Officers Rucker andCarrisalez and petitioner was not present. Raul, Junior,was nine years old at the time of the killings. Ybarra al-leged that Raul, Senior, told him one summer night in 1983that he had shot the two police officers.3 Petitioner allegedthat law enforcement officials were aware of this evidence,and had withheld it in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373U. S. 83 (1963).The District Court dismissed most of petitioner's claims asan abuse of the writ. No. M-92-30 (SD Tex., Feb. 17, 1992).However, "in order to ensure that Petitioner can assert hisconstitutional claims and out of a sense of fairness and dueprocess," the District Court granted petitioner's request fora stay of execution so that he could present his claim of actual innocence, along with the Raul, Junior, and Ybarra affi-davits, in state court. App. 38-39. Although it initiallydismissed petitioner's Brady claim on the ground that peti-tioner had failed to present "any evidence of withholding exculpatory material by the prosecution," App. 37, the DistrictCourt also granted an evidentiary hearing on this claim afterreconsideration, id., at 54.The Court of Appeals vacated the stay of execution. 954F. 2d 1029 (CA5 1992). It agreed with the District Court'sinitial conclusion that there was no evidentiary basis for petitioner's Brady claim, and found disingenuous petitioner's at-tempt to couch his claim of actual innocence in Brady terms.954 F. 2d, at 1032. Absent an accompanying constitutionalviolation, the Court of Appeals held that petitioner's claim3 Raul, Junior's affidavit is dated January 29, 1992. Ybarra's affidavit isdated January 9, 1991. It was initially submitted with Petitioner's Replyto State's Brief in Response to Petitioner's Petition for Writ of HabeasCorpus filed January 18, 1991, in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT398 HERRERA v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtof actual innocence was not cognizable because, under Town-send v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 317 (1963), "the existence merelyof newly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a stateprisoner is not a ground for relief on federal habeas corpus."See 954 F. 2d, at 1034.4 We granted certiorari, 502 U. S.1085 (1992), and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals stayedpetitioner's execution. We now affirm.Petitioner asserts that the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit the execu-tion of a person who is innocent of the crime for which hewas convicted. This proposition has an elemental appeal, aswould the similar proposition that the Constitution prohibitsthe imprisonment of one who is innocent of the crime forwhich he was convicted. After all, the central purpose ofany system of criminal justice is to convict the guilty andfree the innocent. SeeUnited States v. Nobles, 422 U. S.225, 230 (1975). But the evidence upon which petitioner'sclaim of innocence rests was not produced at his trial, butrather eight years later. In any system of criminal justice,"innocence" or "guilt" must be determined in some sort of ajudicial proceeding. Petitioner's showing of innocence, andindeed his constitutional claim for relief based upon thatshowing, must be evaluated in the light of the previous proceedings in this case, which have stretched over a span of10 years.A person when first charged with a crime is entitled to apresumption of innocence, and may insist that his guilt beestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397U. S. 358 (1970). Other constitutional provisions also havethe effect of ensuring against the risk of convicting an inno4 After the Court of Appeals vacated the stay of execution, petitionerattached a new affidavit by Raul, Junior, to his petition for rehearing,which was denied.

S. 390 (1993)Opinion of the Courtcent person. See, e. g., Coy v. Iowa, 487 U. S. 1012 (1988)(right to confront adverse witnesses); Taylor v. Illinois, 484U. S. 400 (1988) (right to compulsory process); Strickland v.Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984) (right to effective assistance of counsel); Winship, supra (prosecution must proveguilt beyond a reasonable doubt); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391U. S. 145 (1968) (right to jury trial); Brady v. Maryland,supra (prosecution must disclose exculpatory evidence);Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (right to assistance of counsel); In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 (1955)(right to "fair trial in a fair tribunal"). In capital cases, wehave required additional protections because of the nature ofthe penalty at stake. See, e. g., Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S.625 (1980) ( jury must be given option of convicting thedefendant of a lesser offense). All of these constitutionalsafeguards, of course, make it more difficult for the Stateto rebut and finally overturn the presumption of innocencewhich attaches to every criminal defendant. But we havealso observed that "[d]ue process does not require that everyconceivable step be taken, at whatever cost, to eliminate thepossibility of convicting an innocent person." Patterson v.New York, 432 U. S. 197, 208 (1977). To conclude otherwisewould all but paralyze our system for enforcement of thecriminal law.Once a defendant has been afforded a fair trial and convicted of the offense for which he was charged, the presumption of innocence disappears. Cf. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S.600, 610 (1974) ("The purpose of the trial stage from theState's point of view is to convert a criminal defendant froma person presumed innocent to one found guilty beyond areasonable doubt"). Here, it is not disputed that the Statemet its burden of proving at trial that petitioner was guiltyof the capital murder of Officer Carrisalez beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, in the eyes of the law, petitioner does notcome before the Court as one who is "innocent," but, on the506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT400 HERRERA v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtcontrary, as one who has been convicted by due process oflaw of two brutal murders.Based on affidavits here filed, petitioner claims that evi-dence never presented to the trial court proves him innocentnotwithstanding the verdict reached at his trial. Such aclaim is not cognizable in the state courts of Texas. For toobtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, adefendant must file a motion within 30 days after impositionor suspension of sentence. Tex. Rule App. Proc. 31(a)(1)(1992). The Texas courts have construed this 30-day timelimit as jurisdictional. SeeBeathard v. State, 767 S. W. 2d423, 433 (Tex. Crim. App. 1989); Drew v. State, 743 S. W. 2d207, 222-223 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987).Claims of actual innocence based on newly discovered evidence have never been held to state a ground for federalhabeas relief absent an independent constitutional violationoccurring in the underlying state criminal proceeding.Chief Justice Warren made this clear inTownsend v. Sain,supra, at 317 (emphasis added):"Where newly discovered evidence is alleged in a habeas application, evidence which could not reasona-bly have been presented to the state trier of facts, thefederal court must grant an evidentiary hearing. Ofcourse, such evidence must bear upon the constitutionality of the applicant's detention; the existence merely ofnewly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of astate prisoner is not a ground for relief on federal habeas corpus."This rule is grounded in the principle that federal habeascourts sit to ensure that individuals are not imprisoned inviolation of the Constitution--not to correct errors of fact.See, e. g., Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86, 87-88 (1923)(Holmes, J.) ("[W]hat we have to deal with [on habeas review]is not the petitioners' innocence or guilt but solely the question whether their constitutional rights have been pre506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT401Cite as: 506 U. S. 390 (1993)Opinion of the Courtserved"); Hyde v. Shine, 199 U. S. 62, 84 (1905) ("[I]t is wellsettled that upon habeas corpus the court will not weigh theevidence") (emphasis in original); Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S.289, 305 (1888) ("As the writ of habeas corpus does not perform the office of a writ of error or an appeal, [the factsestablishing guilt] cannot be re-examined or reviewed in thiscollateral proceeding") (emphasis in original).More recent authority construing federal habeas statutesspeaks in a similar vein. "Federal courts are not forums inwhich to relitigate state trials."Barefoot v. Estelle, 463U. S. 880, 887 (1983). The guilt or innocence determinationin state criminal trials is "a decisive and portentous event."Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90 (1977). "Society's re-sources have been concentrated at that time and place inorder to decide, within the limits of human fallibility, thequestion of guilt or innocence of one of its citizens." Ibid.Few rulings would be more disruptive of our federal systemthan to provide for federal habeas review of freestandingclaims of actual innocence.Our decision inJackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307 (1979),comes as close to authorizing evidentiary review of a statecourt conviction on federal habeas as any of our cases.There, we held that a federal habeas court may review aclaim that the evidence adduced at a state trial was not suf-ficient to convict a criminal defendant beyond a reasonabledoubt. But in so holding, we emphasized:"[T]his inquiry does not require a court to `ask itselfwhetherit believes that the evidence at the trial estab-lished guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.' Instead, therelevant question is whether, after viewing the evidencein the light most favorable to the prosecution,any ra-tional trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Thisfamiliar standard gives full play to the responsibility ofthe trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testi-mony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT402 HERRERA v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtinferences from basic facts to ultimate facts." Id., at318-319 (citations omitted; emphasis in original).We specifically noted that "the standard announced . . . doesnot permit a court to make its own subjective determinationof guilt or innocence." Id., at 320, n. 13.The type of federal habeas review sought by petitionerhere is different in critical respects than that authorized byJackson. First, the Jackson inquiry is aimed at determining whether there has been an independent constitutionalviolation--i. e., a conviction based on evidence that fails tomeet the Winship standard. Thus, federal habeas courtsact in their historic capacity--to assure that the habeas peti-tioner is not being held in violation of his or her federal constitutional rights. Second, the sufficiency of the evidencereview authorized by Jackson is limited to "record evidence." 443 U. S., at 318. Jackson does not extend to non-record evidence, including newly discovered evidence. Finally, the Jackson inquiry does not focus on whether thetrier of fact made thecorrect guilt or innocence determina-tion, but rather whether it made a rational decision to convict or acquit.Petitioner is understandably imprecise in describing thesort of federal relief to which a suitable showing of actualinnocence would entitle him. In his brief he states that thefederal habeas court should have "an important initial oppor-tunity to hear the evidence and resolve the merits of Petitioner's claim." Brief for Petitioner 42. Acceptance of thisview would presumably require the habeas court to hear testimony from the witnesses who testified at trial as well asthose who made the statements in the affidavits which petitioner has presented, and to determine anew whether or notpetitioner is guilty of the murder of Officer Carrisalez. Indeed, the dissent's approach differs little from that hypothe-sized here.The dissent would place the burden on petitioner to showthat he is "probably" innocent. Post, at 442. Although506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT403Cite as: 506 U. S. 390 (1993)Opinion of the Courtpetitioner would not be entitled to discovery "as a matter ofright," the District Court would retain its "discretion toorder discovery . . . when it would help the court make areliable determination with respect to the prisoner's claim."Post, at 444. And although the District Court would not berequired to hear testimony from the witnesses who testifiedat trial or the affiants upon whom petitioner relies, the dissent would allow the District Court to do so "if the petitionwarrants a hearing."Ibid. At the end of the day, thedissent would have the District Court "make a case-by-casedetermination about the reliability of the newly discoveredevidence under the circumstances," and then "weigh the evidence in favor of the prisoner against the evidence of hisguilt." Post, at 443.The dissent fails to articulate the relief that would beavailable if petitioner were to meets its "probable innocence"standard. Would it be commutation of petitioner's deathsentence, new trial, or unconditional release from imprisonment? The typical relief granted in federal habeas corpusis a conditional order of release unless the State elects toretry the successful habeas petitioner, or in a capital case asimilar conditional order vacating the death sentence. Werepetitioner to satisfy the dissent's "probable innocence" standard, therefore, the District Court would presumably be required to grant a conditional order of relief, which would ineffect require the State to retry petitioner 10 years after hisfirst trial, not because of any constitutional violation whichhad occurred at the first trial, but simply because of a beliefthat in light of petitioner's new-found evidence a jury mightfind him not guilty at a second trial.Yet there is no guarantee that the guilt or innocence determination would be any more exact. To the contrary, thepassage of time only diminishes the reliability of criminaladjudications. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491(1991) ("[W]hen a habeas petitioner succeeds in obtaining anew trial, the `erosion of memory and dispersion of witnesses506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT404 HERRERA v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtthat occur with the passage of time' prejudice the govern-ment and diminish the chances of a reliable criminal adjudication") (quoting Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 453(1986) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted;citation omitted)); United States v. Smith, 331 U. S. 469, 476(1947). Under the dissent's approach, the District Courtwould be placed in the even more difficult position of havingto weigh the probative value of "hot" and "cold" evidence onpetitioner's guilt or innocence.This is not to say that our habeas jurisprudence casts ablind eye toward innocence. In a series of cases culminatingwith Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U. S. 333 (1992), decided lastTerm, we have held that a petitioner otherwise subject todefenses of abusive or successive use of the writ may havehis federal constitutional claim considered on the merits ifhe makes a proper showing of actual innocence. This rule,or fundamental miscarriage of justice exception, is groundedin the "equitable discretion" of habeas courts to see that federal constitutional errors do not result in the incarcerationof innocent persons. See McCleskey, supra, at 502. Butthis body of our habeas jurisprudence makes clear that aclaim of "actual innocence" is not itself a constitutional claim,but instead a gateway through which a habeas petitionermust pass to have his otherwise barred constitutional claimconsidered on the merits.Petitioner in this case is simply not entitled to habeas relief based on the reasoning of this line of cases. For he doesnot seek excusal of a procedural error so that he may bringan independent constitutional claim challenging his conviction or sentence, but rather argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because newly discovered evidence shows that hisconviction is factually incorrect. The fundamental miscarriage of justice exception is available "only where the prisoner supplements his constitutional claim with a colorableshowing of factual innocence." Kuhlmann, supra, at 454(emphasis added). We have never held that it extends to506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT405Cite as: 506 U. S. 390 (1993)Opinion of the Courtfreestanding claims of actual innocence. Therefore, the ex-ception is inapplicable here.Petitioner asserts that this case is different because he hasbeen sentenced to death. But we have "refused to hold thatthe fact that a death sentence has been imposed requires adifferent standard of review on federal habeas corpus." Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 9 (1989) (plurality opinion).We have, of course, held that the Eighth Amendment re-quires increased reliability of the process by which capitalpunishment may be imposed. See, e. g., McKoy v. NorthCarolina, 494 U. S. 433 (1990) (unanimity requirement impermissibly limits jurors' consideration of mitigating evidence);Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104 (1982) ( jury must beallowed to consider all of a capital defendant's mitigatingcharacter evidence); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978)(plurality opinion) (same). But petitioner's claim does notfit well into the doctrine of these cases, since, as we havepointed out, it is far from clear that a second trial 10 yearsafter the first trial would produce a more reliable result.Perhaps mindful of this, petitioner urges not that he necessarily receive a new trial, but that his death sentence simplybe vacated if a federal habeas court deems that a satisfactoryshowing of "actual innocence" has been made. Tr. of OralArg. 19-20. But such a result is scarcely logical; petitioner'sclaim is not that some error was made in imposing a capitalsentence upon him, but that a fundamental error was madein finding him guilty of the underlying murder in the firstplace. It would be a rather strange jurisprudence, in thesecircumstances, which held that under our Constitution hecould not be executed, but that he could spend the rest ofhis life in prison.Petitioner argues that our decision in Ford v. Wainwright,477 U. S. 399 (1986), supports his position. The plurality inFord held that, because the Eighth Amendment prohibits theexecution of insane persons, certain procedural protectionsinhere in the sanity determination. "[I]f the Constitution506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT406 HERRERA v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courtrenders the fact or timing of his execution contingent uponestablishment of a further fact," Justice Marshall wrote,"then that fact must be determined with the high regard fortruth that befits a decision affecting the life or death of ahuman being." Id., at 411. Because the Florida scheme fordetermining the sanity of persons sentenced to death failed"to achieve even the minimal degree of reliability,"id., at413, the plurality concluded that Ford was entitled to an evi-dentiary hearing on his sanity before the District Court.Unlike petitioner here, Ford did not challenge the valid-ity of his conviction. Rather, he challenged the constitutionality of his death sentence in view of his claim of insanity.Because Ford's claim went to a matter of punishment--notguilt--it was properly examined within the purview of theEighth Amendment. Moreover, unlike the question of guiltor innocence, which becomes more uncertain with time forevidentiary reasons, the issue of sanity is properly considered in proximity to the execution. Finally, unlike the sanity determination under the Florida scheme at issue in Ford,the guilt or innocence determination in our system of criminal justice is made "with the high regard for truth that befitsa decision affecting the life or death of a human being." Id.,at 411.Petitioner also relies on Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S.578 (1988), where we held that the Eighth Amendment requires reexamination of a death sentence based in part on aprior felony conviction which was set aside in the renderingState after the capital sentence was imposed. There, theState insisted that it was too late in the day to raise thispoint. But we pointed out that the Mississippi SupremeCourt had previously considered similar claims by writ oferror coram nobis. Thus, there was no need to overridestate law relating to newly discovered evidence in order toconsider Johnson's claim on the merits. Here, there is nodoubt that petitioner seeks additional process--an evidentiary hearing on his claim of "actual innocence" based on506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT407Cite as: 506 U.

Rule App. Proc. 31(a)(1) (1992).5Alternatively, petitioner invokes the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process of law in support of his claimthat his showing of actual innocence entitles him to a newtrial, or at least to a vacation of his death sentence.6 "[B]ecause the States have considerable expertise in matters ofcriminal procedure and the criminal process is grounded incenturies of common-law tradition," we have "exercis[ed]substantial deference to legislative judgments in this area."Medina v.

To the extent Beck rests on EighthAmendment grounds, it simply emphasizes the importance of ensuring thereliability of the guilt determination in capital cases in the first instance.We have difficulty extending this principle to hold that a capital defendantwho has been afforded a full and fair trial may challenge his conviction onfederal habeas based on after-discovered evidence.6 The dissent takes us to task for examining petitioner's FourteenthAmendment claim in terms of procedural, rather than substantive, dueprocess. Because "[e]xecution of an innocent person is the ultimate `arbitrary impositio[n],' " post, at 437, quoting Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 848 (1992) (internal quotation marksomitted), the dissent concludes that "petitioner may raise a substantivedue process challenge to his punishment on the ground that he is actuallyinnocent," post, at 437. But the dissent puts the cart before the horse.For its due process analysis rests on the assumption that petitioner is infact innocent. However, as we have discussed, petitioner does not comebefore this Court as an innocent man, but rather as one who has beenconvicted by due process of law of two capital murders. The questionbefore us, then, is not whether due process prohibits the execution of aninnocent person, but rather whether it entitles petitioner to judicial reviewof his "actual innocence" claim. This issue is properly analyzed only interms of procedural due process.506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT408 HERRERA v.

"Historical practice is probative of whether a procedural rule can be characterized as fundamental." 505U. S., at 446.The Constitution itself, of course, makes no mention of newtrials. New trials in criminal cases were not granted inEngland until the end of the 17th century. And even then,they were available only in misdemeanor cases, though thewrit of error coram nobis was available for some errors offact in felony cases. Orfield, New Trial in Federal CriminalCases, 2 Vill. L. Rev. 293, 304 (1957). The First Congressprovided for new trials for "reasons for which new trialshave usually been granted in courts of law." Act of Sept.24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 17, 1 Stat. 83. This rule was early held toextend to criminal cases. See Sparf v. United States, 156U. S. 51, 175 (1895) (Gray, J., dissenting) (citing cases). Oneof the grounds upon which new trials were granted wasnewly discovered evidence. See F. Wharton, CriminalPleading and Practice $$ 854-874, pp. 584-592 (8th ed. 1880).The early federal cases adhere to the common-law rulethat a new trial may be granted only during the term ofcourt in which the final judgment was entered. See, e. g.,United States v. Mayer, 235 U. S. 55, 67 (1914); United Statesv. Simmons, 27 F. Cas. 1080 (No. 16,289) (CC EDNY 1878).Otherwise, "the court at a subsequent term has power tocorrect inaccuracies in mere matters of form, or clerical errors." 235 U. S., at 67. In 1934, this Court departed fromthe common-law rule and adopted a time limit--60 days afterfinal judgment--for filing new trial motions based on newlydiscovered evidence. Rule II(3), Criminal Rules of Practiceand Procedure, 292 U. S. 659, 662. Four years later, weamended Rule II(3) to allow such motions in capital cases "atany time" before the execution took place. 304 U. S. 592(1938) (codified at 18 U. S.

See Orfield, supra, at 299-304. In 1946, we set a2-year time limit for filing new trial motions based on newlydiscovered evidence and abolished the exception for capitalcases. Rule 33, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 327U. S. 821, 855-856 ("A motion for a new trial based on theground of newly discovered evidence may be made only before or within two years after final judgment").7 We havestrictly construed the Rule 33 time limits. Cf. United Statesv. Smith, 331 U. S. 469, 473 (1947). And the Rule's treatment of new trials based on newly discovered evidence hasnot changed since its adoption.The American Colonies adopted the English common lawon new trials. Riddell, New Trial in Present Practice, 27Yale L. J. 353, 360 (1917). Thus, where new trials wereavailable, motions for such relief typically had to be filed before the expiration of the term during which the trial washeld. H. Underhill, Criminal Evidence 579, n. 1 (1898);J. Bassett, Criminal Pleading and Practice 313 (1885). Overtime, many States enacted statutes providing for new trials7 In response to the second preliminary draft of the Federal Rules ofCriminal Procedure, Chief Justice Harlan Stone forwarded a memorandumon behalf of the Court to the Rules Advisory Committee with variouscomments and suggestions, including the following: "It is suggested thatthere should be a definite time limit within which motions for new trialbased on newly discovered evidence should be made, unless the trial courtin its discretion, for good cause shown, allows the motion to be filed. Isit not desirable that at some point of time further consideration of criminalcases by the court should be at an end, after which appeals should bemade to Executive clemency alone?" 7 Drafting History of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure 3, 7 (M. Wilken & N. Triffin eds. 1991) (responding to proposed Rule 35). As noted above, we eventually rejectedthe adoption of a flexible time limit for new trial motions, opting insteadfor a strict 2-year time limit.506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT410 HERRERA v.

W. Humbert, The Pardoning Power of the President 9 (1941). Blackstone thoughtthis "one of the great advantages of monarchy in general,above any other form of government; that there is a magistrate, who has it in his power to extend mercy, wherever hethinks it is deserved: holding a court of equity in his ownbreast, to soften the rigour of the general law, in such criminal cases as merit an exemption from punishment." 4 W.Blackstone, Commentaries *397. Clemency provided theprincipal avenue of relief for individuals convicted of criminal offenses--most of which were capital--because there wasno right of appeal until 1907. 1 L. Radzinowicz, A Historyof English Criminal Law 122 (1948). It was the only meansby which one could challenge his conviction on the ground ofinnocence.

But that case is inapposite insofar as it pertains to ourdiscussion of clemency here.

Unlike Ford's claim of insanity, which had neverbeen presented in a judicial proceeding, petitioner's claim of "actual innocence" comes 10 years after he was adjudged guilty beyond a reasonabledoubt after a full and fair trial.

It is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whosebenefit it is intended, and not communicated officially tothe court. It is a constituent part of the judicial system,that the judge sees only with judicial eyes, and knowsnothing respecting any particular case, of which he isnot informed judicially. A private deed, not communicated to him, whatever may be its character, whether apardon or release, is totally unknown and cannot beacted on. The looseness which would be introducedinto judicial proceedings, would prove fatal to the greatprinciples of justice, if the judge might notice and actupon facts not brought regularly into the cause.

It is an unalterable factthat our judicial system, like the human beings who administer it, is fallible. But history is replete with examples ofwrongfully convicted persons who have been pardoned in thewake of after-discovered evidence establishing their innocence. In his classic work, Professor Edwin Borchard compiled 65 cases in which it was later determined that individuals had been wrongfully convicted of crimes. Clemencyprovided the relief mechanism in 47 of these cases; the remaining cases ended in judgments of acquittals after newtrials. E. Borchard, Convicting the Innocent (1932). Recent authority confirms that over the past century clemencyhas been exercised frequently in capital cases in which demonstrations of "actual innocence" have been made. SeeM. Radelet, H. Bedau, & C.

COLLINSOpinion of the CourtIn Texas, the Governor has the power, upon the recom-mendation of a majority of the Board of Pardons and Paroles,to grant clemency. Tex. Const., Art. IV, $ 11; Tex. CodeCrim. Proc. Ann., Art. 48.01 (Vernon 1979). The board'sconsideration is triggered upon request of the individual sentenced to death, his or her representative, or the Governorherself. In capital cases, a request may be made for a fullpardon, Tex. Admin. Code, Tit. 37, $ 143.1 (West Supp. 1992),a commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment orappropriate maximum penalty, $ 143.57, or a reprieve ofexecution, $ 143.43. The Governor has the sole authorityto grant one reprieve in any capital case not exceeding30 days. $ 143.41(a).The Texas clemency procedures contain specific guidelinesfor pardons on the ground of innocence. The board will entertain applications for a recommendation of full pardon because of innocence upon receipt of the following: "(1) a written unanimous recommendation of the current trial officialsof the court of conviction; and/or (2) a certified order orjudgment of a court having jurisdiction accompanied by certified copy of the findings of fact (if any); and (3) affidavitsof witnesses upon which the finding of innocence is based."$ 143.2. In this case, petitioner has apparently sought a 30-day reprieve from the Governor, but has yet to apply for apardon, or even a commutation, on the ground of innocenceor otherwise. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 34.As the foregoing discussion illustrates, in state criminalproceedings the trial is the paramount event for determiningthe guilt or innocence of the defendant. Federal habeas review of state convictions has traditionally been limited toclaims of constitutional violations occurring in the course ofthe underlying state criminal proceedings. Our federal habeas cases have treated claims of "actual innocence," not asan independent constitutional claim, but as a basis uponwhich a habeas petitioner may have an independent constitutional claim considered on the merits, even though his habeas506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT417Cite as: 506 U. S. 390 (1993)Opinion of the Courtpetition would otherwise be regarded as successive or abu-sive. History shows that the traditional remedy for claimsof innocence based on new evidence, discovered too late inthe day to file a new trial motion, has been executiveclemency.We may assume, for the sake of argument in deciding thiscase, that in a capital case a truly persuasive demonstrationof "actual innocence" made after trial would render the exe-cution of a defendant unconstitutional, and warrant federalhabeas relief if there were no state avenue open to processsuch a claim. But because of the very disruptive effect thatentertaining claims of actual innocence would have on theneed for finality in capital cases, and the enormous burdenthat having to retry cases based on often stale evidencewould place on the States, the threshold showing for suchan assumed right would necessarily be extraordinarily high.The showing made by petitioner in this case falls far shortof any such threshold.Petitioner's newly discovered evidence consists of affidavits. In the new trial context, motions based solely uponaffidavits are disfavored because the affiants' statements areobtained without the benefit of cross-examination and an opportunity to make credibility determinations. See Orfield,2 Vill. L. Rev., at 333. Petitioner's affidavits are particularlysuspect in this regard because, with the exception of RaulHerrera, Jr.'s affidavit, they consist of hearsay. Likewise,in reviewing petitioner's new evidence, we are mindful thatdefendants often abuse new trial motions "as a method ofdelaying enforcement of just sentences." United States v.Johnson, 327 U. S. 106, 112 (1946). Although we are notpresented with a new trial motion per se, we believe thelikelihood of abuse is as great--or greater--here.The affidavits filed in this habeas proceeding were givenover eight years after petitioner's trial. No satisfactory explanation has been given as to why the affiants waited untilthe 11th hour--and, indeed, until after the alleged perpetra506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT418 HERRERA v. COLLINSOpinion of the Courttor of the murders himself was dead--to make their state-ments. Cf.Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S., at 414 ("[I]t is . . .reasonable to presume that there is something suspect abouta defense witness who is not identified until after the 11thhour has passed"). Equally troubling, no explanation hasbeen offered as to why petitioner, by hypothesis an innocentman, pleaded guilty to the murder of Rucker.Moreover, the affidavits themselves contain inconsisten-cies, and therefore fail to provide a convincing account ofwhat took place on the night Officers Rucker and Carrisalezwere killed. For instance, the affidavit of Raul, Junior, whowas nine years old at the time, indicates that there werethree people in the speeding car from which the murdereremerged, whereas Hector Villarreal attested that Raul, Senior, told him that there were two people in the car thatnight. Of course, Hernandez testified at petitioner's trialthat the murderer was the only occupant of the car. Theaffidavits also conflict as to the direction in which the vehiclewas heading when the murders took place and petitioner'swhereabouts on the night of the killings.Finally, the affidavits must be considered in light of theproof of petitioner's guilt at trial--proof which included twoeyewitness identifications, numerous pieces of circumstantialevidence, and a handwritten letter in which petitioner apologized for killing the officers and offered to turn himself inunder certain conditions. See supra, at 393-395, and n. 1.That proof, even when considered alongside petitioner's belated affidavits, points strongly to petitioner's guilt.This is not to say that petitioner's affidavits are withoutprobative value. Had this sort of testimony been offered attrial, it could have been weighed by the jury, along with theevidence offered by the State and petitioner, in deliberatingupon its verdict. Since the statements in the affidavits contradict the evidence received at trial, the jury would havehad to decide important issues of credibility. But coming 10years after petitioner's trial, this showing of innocence falls506us2$21D 08-22-96 19:45:48 PAGES OPINPGT419Cite as: 506 U.
