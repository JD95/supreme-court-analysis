See Garrett, supra, at 363; Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 786 (1991) (citing Dellmuth v.Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 228 (1989)). The clarity of Congress'intent here is not fairly debatable. The Act enables employees to seek damages "against any employer (including a public agency) in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction," 29 U. S. C. $ 2617(a)(2), and Congress has defined"public agency" to include both "the government of a Stateor political subdivision thereof " and "any agency of . . .a State, or a political subdivision of a State," $$ 203(x),2611(4)(A)(iii).

This case turns, then, onwhether Congress acted within its constitutional authoritywhen it sought to abrogate the States' immunity for purposes of the FMLA's family-leave provision.In enacting the FMLA, Congress relied on two of the powers vested in it by the Constitution: its Article I commercepower and its power under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN727Cite as: 538 U.

See,e. g., Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197-199 (1976). For agender-based classification to withstand such scrutiny, itmust "serv[e] important governmental objectives," and "thediscriminatory means employed [must be] substantially related to the achievement of those objectives." United2 The text of the Act makes this clear. Congress found that, "due to thenature of the roles of men and women in our society, the primary responsibility for family caretaking often falls on women, and such responsibilityaffects the working lives of women more than it affects the working livesof men." 29 U.

In response to this finding, Congresssought "to accomplish the [Act's other] purposes . . . in a manner that . . .minimizes the potential for employment discrimination on the basis of sexby ensuring generally that leave is available . . . on a gender-neutralbasis[,] and to promote the goal of equal employment opportunity forwomen and men . . . ." $$ 2601(b)(4) and (5) (emphasis added).538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN729Cite as: 538 U.

The State's justificationfor such a classification "must not rely on overbroad general-izations about the different talents, capacities, or preferencesof males and females." Ibid. We now inquire whetherCongress had evidence of a pattern of constitutional violations on the part of the States in this area.The history of the many state laws limiting women's em-ployment opportunities is chronicled in--and, until relativelyrecently, was sanctioned by--this Court's own opinions.For example, inBradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873) (Illinois), and Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464, 466 (1948) (Michigan), the Court upheld state laws prohibiting women frompracticing law and tending bar, respectively. State laws frequently subjected women to distinctive restrictions, terms,conditions, and benefits for those jobs they could take. InMuller v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412, 419, n. 1 (1908), for example,this Court approved a state law limiting the hours thatwomen could work for wages, and observed that 19 Stateshad such laws at the time. Such laws were based on therelated beliefs that (1) a woman is, and should remain, "thecenter of home and family life," Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57,62 (1961), and (2) "a proper discharge of [a woman's] maternalfunctions--having in view not merely her own health, butthe well-being of the race--justif[ies] legislation to protecther from the greed as well as the passion of man," Muller,supra, at 422. Until our decision in Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S.71 (1971), "it remained the prevailing doctrine that government, both federal and state, could withhold from womenopportunities accorded men so long as any `basis in reason' "--such as the above beliefs--"could be conceived for thediscrimination." Virginia, supra, at 531 (quoting Goesaert,supra, at 467).Congress responded to this history of discrimination byabrogating States' sovereign immunity in Title VII of theCivil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 255, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a),538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN730 NEVADA DEPT. OF HUMAN RESOURCES v. HIBBSOpinion of the Courtand we sustained this abrogation in Fitzpatrick. But stategender discrimination did not cease. "[I]t can hardly bedoubted that . . . women still face pervasive, although attimes more subtle, discrimination . . . in the job market."Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 686 (1973). Accord-ing to evidence that was before Congress when it enactedthe FMLA, States continue to rely on invalid gender stereo-types in the employment context, specifically in the administration of leave benefits. Reliance on such stereotypes can-not justify the States' gender discrimination in this area.Virginia, supra, at 533. The long and extensive historyof sex discrimination prompted us to hold that measuresthat differentiate on the basis of gender warrant heightenedscrutiny; here, as in Fitzpatrick, the persistence of suchunconstitutional discrimination by the States justifies Congress' passage of prophylactic $ 5 legislation.As the FMLA's legislative record reflects, a 1990 Bureauof Labor Statistics (BLS) survey stated that 37 percent ofsurveyed private-sector employees were covered by maternity leave policies, while only 18 percent were covered bypaternity leave policies. S. Rep. No. 103-3, pp. 14-15 (1993).The corresponding numbers from a similar BLS surveythe previous year were 33 percent and 16 percent, respec-tively.Ibid. While these data show an increase in the percentage of employees eligible for such leave, they also showa widening of the gender gap during the same period. Thus,stereotype-based beliefs about the allocation of family du-ties remained firmly rooted, and employers' reliance onthem in establishing discriminatory leave policies remainedwidespread.33 While this and other material described leave policies in the privatesector, a 50-state survey also before Congress demonstrated that "[t]heproportion and construction of leave policies available to public sector employees differs little from those offered private sector employees." TheParental and Medical Leave Act of 1986: Joint Hearing before the Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations and the Subcommittee on Labor538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN731Cite as: 538 U. S. 721 (2003)Opinion of the CourtCongress also heard testimony that "[p]arental leave forfathers . . . is rare. Even . . . [w]here child-care leave policiesdo exist, men, both in the public and private sectors, receivenotoriously discriminatory treatment in their requests forsuch leave." Joint Hearing 147 (Washington Council ofLawyers) (emphasis added). Many States offered womenextended "maternity" leave that far exceeded the typical 4-to 8-week period of physical disability due to pregnancy andchildbirth,4 but very few States granted men a parallel bene-fit: Fifteen States provided women up to one year of extended maternity leave, while only four provided men withthe same. M. Lord & M. King, The State Reference Guideto Work-Family Programs for State Employees 30 (1991).This and other differential leave policies were not attributable to any differential physical needs of men and women,but rather to the pervasive sex-role stereotype that caringfor family members is women's work.5Standards of the House Committee on Education and Labor, 99th Cong.,2d Sess., 33 (1986) (hereinafter Joint Hearing) (statement of Meryl Frank,Director of the Yale Bush Center Infant Care Leave Project). See alsoid., at 29-30.4 See, e. g., id., at 16 (six weeks is the medically recommended pregnancydisability leave period); H. R. Rep. No. 101-28, pt. 1, p. 30 (1989) (referringto Pregnancy Discrimination Act legislative history establishing four toeight weeks as the medical recovery period for a normal childbirth).5 For example, state employers' collective-bargaining agreements oftengranted extended "maternity" leave of six months to a year to womenonly. Gerald McEntee, President of the American Federation of State,County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO, testified that "the vast majority of our contracts, even though we look upon them with great pride,really cover essentially maternity leave, and not paternity leave."

In addition, state leave lawsoften specified that catchall leave-without-pay provisions could be used forextended maternity leave, but did not authorize such leave for paternitypurposes. See, e. g., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1987: Joint Hearingbefore the House Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, 100th Cong.,538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN732 NEVADA DEPT. OF HUMAN RESOURCES v. HIBBSOpinion of the CourtFinally, Congress had evidence that, even where state lawsand policies were not facially discriminatory, they were applied in discriminatory ways. It was aware of the "seriousproblems with the discretionary nature of family leave," because when "the authority to grant leave and to arrange thelength of that leave rests with individual supervisors," itleaves "employees open to discretionary and possibly unequal treatment." H. R. Rep. No. 103-8, pt. 2, pp. 10-11(1993). Testimony supported that conclusion, explainingthat "[t]he lack of uniform parental and medical leave policiesin the work place has created an environment where [sex]discrimination is rampant." 1987 Senate Labor Hearings,pt. 2, at 170 (testimony of Peggy Montes, Mayor's Commission on Women's Affairs, City of Chicago).In spite of all of the above evidence, Justice Kennedyargues in dissent that Congress' passage of the FMLA wasunnecessary because "the States appear to have been aheadof Congress in providing gender-neutral family leave benefits," post, at 750, and points to Nevada's leave policies inparticular, post, at 755. However, it was only "[s]ince Federal family leave legislation was first introduced" that theStates had even "begun to consider similar family leave initiatives." S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 20; see also S. Rep. No. 102-1st Sess., 2-5 (1987) (Rep. Gary Ackerman recounted suffering expresslysex-based denial of unpaid leave of absence where benefit was ostensiblyavailable for "child care leave").Evidence pertaining to parenting leave is relevant here because statediscrimination in the provision of both types of benefits is based on thesame gender stereotype: that women's family duties trump those of theworkplace. Justice Kennedy's dissent (hereinafter dissent) ignores thiscommon foundation that, as Congress found, has historically produced discrimination in the hiring and promotion of women. See post, at 748-749.Consideration of such evidence does not, as the dissent contends, expandour $ 5 inquiry to include "general gender-based stereotypes in employment." Post, at 749 (emphasis added). To the contrary, because parenting and family leave address very similar situations in which work andfamily responsibilities conflict, they implicate the same stereotypes.538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN733Cite as: 538 U.

First, seven States hadchildcare leave provisions that applied to women only. Indeed, Massachusetts required that notice of its leave provisions be posted only in "establishment[s] in which femalesare employed." 6 These laws reinforced the very stereotypes that Congress sought to remedy through the FMLA.Second, 12 States provided their employees no family leave,beyond an initial childbirth or adoption, to care for a seriously ill child or family member.7 Third, many States pro6 Mass.

Post, at 752. But Louisiana provided women with four monthsof such leave, which far exceeds the medically recommended pregnancydisability leave period of six weeks. See n. 4, supra. This genderdiscriminatory policy is not attributable to any different physical needs ofmen and women, but rather to the invalid stereotypes that Congresssought to counter through the FMLA.

Finally, fourStates provided leave only through administrative regulations or personnel policies, which Congress could reasonablyconclude offered significantly less firm protection than a federal law.9 Against the above backdrop of limited state leavepolicies, no matter how generous petitioners' own may havebeen, see post, at 755 (dissent), Congress was justified inenacting the FMLA as remedial legislation.10Ann. $ 4-21-408(a) (1998); U.

The dissent misunderstands the purpose ofthe FMLA's family-leave provision. The FMLA is not a "substantive entitlement program," post, at 754; Congress did not create a particular leavepolicy for its own sake. See infra, at 737-738. Rather, Congress soughtto adjust family-leave policies in order to eliminate their reliance on, andperpetuation of, invalid stereotypes, and thereby dismantle persistinggender-based barriers to the hiring, retention, and promotion of women inthe workplace. In pursuing that goal, for the reasons discussed above,538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN735Cite as: 538 U. S. 721 (2003)Opinion of the CourtIn sum, the States' record of unconstitutional participationin, and fostering of, gender-based discrimination in the administration of leave benefits is weighty enough to justifythe enactment of prophylactic $ 5 legislation.11We reached the opposite conclusion in Garrett and Kimel.In those cases, the $ 5 legislation under review respondedto a purported tendency of state officials to make age- ordisability-based distinctions. Under our equal protectioncase law, discrimination on the basis of such characteristics isnot judged under a heightened review standard, and passesmuster if there is "a rational basis for doing so at a classbased level, even if it `is probably not true' that those reasonsare valid in the majority of cases." Kimel, 528 U. S., at 86(quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 473 (1991)). Seealso Garrett, 531 U. S., at 367 ("States are not required bythe Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodationsfor the disabled, so long as their actions toward such individuals are rational"). Thus, in order to impugn the constitutionality of state discrimination against the disabled or theelderly, Congress must identify, not just the existence of ageor disability-based state decisions, but a "widespread pattern" of irrational reliance on such criteria. Kimel, supra,at 90. We found no such showing with respect to the ADEAand Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA). Kimel, supra, at 89; Garrett, supra, at 368.supra, at 733-734 and this page, Congress reasonably concluded that stateleave laws and practices should be brought within the Act.11 Given the extent and specificity of the above record of unconstitutionalstate conduct, it is difficult to understand the dissent's accusation that werely on "a simple recitation of a general history of employment discrimination against women." Post, at 746. As we stated above, our holdingrests on congressional findings that, at the time the FMLA was enacted,States "rel[ied] on invalid gender stereotypes in the employment context,specifically in the administration of leave benefits."

Becausethe standard for demonstrating the constitutionality of agender-based classification is more difficult to meet than ourrational-basis test--it must "serv[e] important governmentalobjectives" and be "substantially related to the achievementof those objectives," Virginia, 518 U. S., at 533--it was eas-ier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutionalviolations. Congress was similarly successful in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 308-313 (1966), where weupheld the Voting Rights Act of 1965: Because racial classifi-cations are presumptively invalid, most of the States' acts ofrace discrimination violated the Fourteenth Amendment.The impact of the discrimination targeted by the FMLAis significant. Congress determined:"Historically, denial or curtailment of women's employment opportunities has been traceable directly to thepervasive presumption that women are mothers first,and workers second. This prevailing ideology aboutwomen's roles has in turn justified discriminationagainst women when they are mothers or mothers-to-be." Joint Hearing 100.Stereotypes about women's domestic roles are reinforcedby parallel stereotypes presuming a lack of domestic responsibilities for men. Because employers continued to regardthe family as the woman's domain, they often denied mensimilar accommodations or discouraged them from takingleave. These mutually reinforcing stereotypes created aself-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that forced women tocontinue to assume the role of primary family caregiver, andfostered employers' stereotypical views about women's commitment to work and their value as employees. Those perceptions, in turn, Congress reasoned, lead to subtle discrimination that may be difficult to detect on a case-by-case basis.538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN737Cite as: 538 U. S. 721 (2003)Opinion of the CourtWe believe that Congress' chosen remedy, the family-careleave provision of the FMLA, is "congruent and proportionalto the targeted violation," Garrett, supra, at 374. Congresshad already tried unsuccessfully to address this problemthrough Title VII and the amendment of Title VII by thePregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(k). Here,as in Katzenbach, supra, Congress again confronted a "difficult and intractable proble[m]," Kimel, supra, at 88, whereprevious legislative attempts had failed. SeeKatzenbach,supra, at 313 (upholding the Voting Rights Act). Such prob-lems may justify added prophylactic measures in response.Kimel, supra, at 88.By creating an across-the-board, routine employment benefit for all eligible employees, Congress sought to ensure thatfamily-care leave would no longer be stigmatized as an inordinate drain on the workplace caused by female employees,and that employers could not evade leave obligations simplyby hiring men. By setting a minimum standard of familyleave for all eligible employees, irrespective of gender, theFMLA attacks the formerly state-sanctioned stereotype thatonly women are responsible for family caregiving, therebyreducing employers' incentives to engage in discriminationby basing hiring and promotion decisions on stereotypes.The dissent characterizes the FMLA as a "substantive entitlement program" rather than a remedial statute becauseit establishes a floor of 12 weeks' leave. Post, at 754. Inthe dissent's view, in the face of evidence of gender-baseddiscrimination by the States in the provision of leave benefits, Congress could do no more in exercising its $ 5 powerthan simply proscribe such discrimination. But this positioncannot be squared with our recognition that Congress "is notconfined to the enactment of legislation that merely parrotsthe precise wording of the Fourteenth Amendment," butmay prohibit "a somewhat broader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the Amendment'stext." Kimel, supra, at 81. For example, this Court has538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN738 NEVADA DEPT. OF HUMAN RESOURCES v. HIBBSOpinion of the Courtupheld certain prophylactic provisions of the Voting RightsAct as valid exercises of Congress' $ 5 power, including theliteracy test ban and preclearance requirements for changesin States' voting procedures. See,e. g., Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112(1970);South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra.Indeed, in light of the evidence before Congress, a statutemirroring Title VII, that simply mandated gender equalityin the administration of leave benefits, would not haveachieved Congress' remedial object. Such a law would allowStates to provide for no family leave at all. Where "[t]wothirds of the nonprofessional caregivers for older, chronicallyill, or disabled persons are working women," H. R. Rep.No. 103-8, pt. 1, at 24; S. Rep. No. 103-3, at 7, and statepractices continue to reinforce the stereotype of women ascaregivers, such a policy would exclude far more women thanmen from the workplace.Unlike the statutes at issue in City of Boerne, Kimel, andGarrett, which applied broadly to every aspect of state employers' operations, the FMLA is narrowly targeted at thefaultline between work and family--precisely where sexbased overgeneralization has been and remains strongest--and affects only one aspect of the employment relationship.Compare Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U. S.81, 91 (2002) (discussing the "important limitations of the[FMLA's] remedial scheme"), with City of Boerne, 521 U. S.,at 532 (the "[s]weeping coverage" of the Religious FreedomRestoration Act of 1993); Kimel, 528 U. S., at 91 ("the indiscriminate scope of the [ADEA's] substantive requirements"); and Garrett, 531 U. S., at 361 (the ADA prohibitsdisability discrimination "in regard to [any] terms, conditions, and privileges of employment" (internal quotationmarks omitted)).We also find significant the many other limitations thatCongress placed on the scope of this measure. See FloridaPrepaid, 527 U. S., at 647 ("[W]here `a congressional enact538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN739Cite as: 538 U.

The FMLA requires onlyunpaid leave, 29 U. S.

Employees must give advance notice of foreseeableleave, $ 2612(e), and employers may require certification bya health care provider of the need for leave, $ 2613. Inchoosing 12 weeks as the appropriate leave floor, Congresschose "a middle ground, a period long enough to serve`the needs of families' but not so long that it would upset`the legitimate interests of employers.' " Ragsdale, supra,at 94 (quoting 29 U. S. C. $ 2601(b)).12 Moreover, the cause12 Congress established 12 weeks as a floor, thus leaving States free toprovide their employees with more family-leave time if they so choose.See 29 U. S. C. $ 2651(b) ("Nothing in this Act or any amendment made bythis Act shall be construed to supersede any provision of any State orlocal law that provides greater family or medical leave rights than therights established under this Act or any amendment made by this Act").The dissent faults Congress for giving States this choice, arguing that theFMLA's terms do not bar States from granting more family-leave time towomen than to men. Post, at 756. But Justice Kennedy effectivelycounters his own argument in his very next breath, recognizing that suchgender-based discrimination would "run afoul of the Equal ProtectionClause or Title VII." Ibid. In crafting new legislation to remedy unconstitutional state conduct, Congress may certainly rely on and take accountof existing laws. Indeed, Congress expressly did so here. See 29 U. S. C.$ 2651(a) ("Nothing in this Act or any amendment made by this Act shallbe construed to modify or affect any Federal or State law prohibitingdiscrimination on the basis of . . . sex . . .").538US2 Unit: $U57 [02-10-05 13:08:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN740 NEVADA DEPT.
