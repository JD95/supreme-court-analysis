This case presents the question whether the Federal TortClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S. C. $$ 1346(b), 1402(b), 2401(b),2671-2680 (1988 ed. and Supp. II), applies to tortious actsor omissions occurring in Antarctica, a sovereignless regionwithout civil tort law of its own.1 We hold that it does not.Petitioner Sandra Jean Smith is the widow of John Emmett Smith and the duly appointed representative of his es1 Without indigenous human population and containing roughly onetenth of the world's land mass, Antarctica is best described as "an entirecontinent of disputed territory."

In any event, these sovereign claims have all been suspended bythe terms of the Antarctic Treaty, concluded in 1959. Antarctic Treaty,Dec. 1, 1959, [1961] 12 U. S. T. 794, T. I. A. S. No. 4780. Article IV of thetreaty states that no claim may be enforced, expanded, or compromisedwhile the treaty is in force, id., art. IV, 12 U. S. T., at 796, thus essentiallyfreezing nations' sovereign claims as of the date of the treaty's execution.507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT199Cite as: 507 U.

At the time of his death, Smith worked as a carpenterat McMurdo Station on Ross Island, Antarctica, for a construction company under contract to the National ScienceFoundation, an agency of the United States. Smith and twocompanions one day took a recreational hike to Castle Rock,located several miles outside of McMurdo Station. On theirreturn, they departed from the marked route to walk acrossa snow field in the direction of Scott Base, a New Zealandoutpost not far from McMurdo Station. After stopping fora snack, one of the three men took a step and suddenlydropped from sight. Smith followed, and he, too, disappeared. Both men had fallen into a crevasse. Despitesearch and rescue efforts, Smith died from exposure and internal injuries suffered as a result of the fall.Petitioner filed this wrongful-death action against theUnited States under the FTCA in the District Court for theDistrict of Oregon, the district where she resides. Petitioner alleged that the United States was negligent in failingto provide adequate warning of the dangers posed by crevasses in areas beyond the marked paths. It is undisputedthat petitioner's claim is based exclusively on acts or omissions occurring in Antarctica. Upon the motion of theUnited States, the District Court dismissed petitioner's complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, 702 F. Supp.1480 (1989), holding that her claim was barred by 28 U. S. C.$ 2680(k), the foreign-country exception. Section 2680(k)precludes the exercise of jurisdiction over "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country."The Court of Appeals affirmed, 953 F. 2d 1116 (CA9 1991).It noted that the term "foreign country" admits of multipleinterpretations, and thus looked to the language and structure of the FTCA as a whole to determine whether Antarctica is a "foreign country" within the meaning of the statute.Adopting the analysis and conclusion of then-Judge Scalia,see Beattie v. United States, 244 U. S. App. D. C. 70, 85-109,756 F. 2d 91, 106-130 (1984) (Scalia, J., dissenting), the Court507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT200 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtof Appeals ruled that the FTCA does not apply to claimsarising in Antarctica. To hold otherwise, the Court ofAppeals stated, would render two other provisions of theFTCA, 28 U. S. C. $$ 1402(b), 1346(b), nonsensical. TheCourt of Appeals held, in the alternative, that petitioner'ssuit would be barred even if Antarctica were not a "foreigncountry" for purposes of the FTCA. Because the FTCAwas a limited relinquishment of the common-law immunityof the United States, the Court of Appeals concluded thatthe absence of any clear congressional intent to subject theUnited States to liability for claims arising in Antarctica pre-cluded petitioner's suit. We granted certiorari to resolve aconflict between two Courts of Appeals,2 504 U. S. 984 (1992),and now affirm.Petitioner argues that the scope of the foreign-country ex-ception turns on whether the United States has recognizedthe legitimacy of another nation's sovereign claim over theforeign land. Otherwise, she contends, the land is not a"country" for purposes of the FTCA. Petitioner points outthat the United States does not recognize the validity ofother nations' claims to portions of Antarctica. She asserts,moreover, that this construction of the term "foreign country" is most consistent with the purpose underlying theforeign-country exception. According to petitioner, Congress enacted the foreign-country exception in order to insu-late the United States from tort liability imposed pursuantto foreign law. Because Antarctica has no law of its own,petitioner claims that conventional choice-of-law rules control and require the application of Oregon law, the law ofher domicil. Thus, petitioner concludes, the rationale forthe foreign-country exception would not be compromised bythe exercise of jurisdiction here, since the United States2 Cf. Beattie v. United States, 244 U. S. App. D. C. 70, 756 F. 2d 91 (1984)(holding that Antarctica is not a "foreign country" within the meaning ofthe FTCA).507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT201Cite as: 507 U. S. 197 (1993)Opinion of the Courtwould not be subject to liability under the law of a foreignnation.Petitioner's argument for governmental liability here facessignificant obstacles in addition to the foreign-country exception, but we turn first to the language of that proviso. Itstates that the FTCA's waiver of sovereign immunity doesnot apply to "[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country." 28U. S. C. $ 2680(k). Though the FTCA offers no definition of"country," the commonsense meaning of the term undermines petitioner's attempt to equate it with "sovereignstate." The first dictionary definition of "country" is simply"[a] region or tract of land." Webster's New InternationalDictionary 609 (2d ed. 1945). To be sure, this is not the onlypossible interpretation of the term, and it is therefore appropriate to examine other parts of the statute before making afinal determination. But the ordinary meaning of the language itself, we think, includes Antarctica, even though ithas no recognized government.Our construction of the term "foreign country" draws support from the language of $ 1346(b), "[t]he principal provisionof the Federal Tort Claims Act." Richards v. United States,369 U. S. 1, 6 (1962). That section waives the sovereign immunity of the United States for certain torts committed byfederal employees "under circumstances where the UnitedStates, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant inaccordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred." 28 U. S. C. $ 1346(b) (emphasis added). Wehave construed $ 1346(b) in determining what law shouldapply in actions brought under the FTCA. See Richards,supra. But by its terms the section is more than a choiceof-law provision: It delineates the scope of the United States'waiver of sovereign immunity. If Antarctica were not a"foreign country," and for that reason included within theFTCA's coverage, $ 1346(b) would instruct courts to look tothe law of a place that has no law in order to determine the507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT202 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtliability of the United States--surely a bizarre result.3 Ofcourse, if it were quite clear from the balance of the statutethat governmental liability was intended for torts committedin Antarctica, then the failure of $ 1346(b) to specify any governing law might be treated as a statutory gap that thecourts could fill by decisional law. But coupled with whatseems to us the most natural interpretation of the foreign-country exception, this portion of $ 1346(b) reinforces theconclusion that Antarctica is excluded from the coverage ofthe FTCA.Section 1346(b) is not, however, the only FTCA provisionthat contradicts petitioner's interpretation of the foreigncountry exception. The statute's venue provision, $ 1402(b),provides that claims under the FTCA may be brought "onlyin the judicial district where the plaintiff resides or whereinthe act or omission complained of occurred." Because nofederal judicial district encompasses Antarctica, petitioner'sinterpretation of the FTCA would lead to yet another anomalous result: The FTCA would establish jurisdiction for alltort claims against the United States arising in Antarctica,but no venue would exist unless the claimant happened toreside in the United States.4 As we observed in Brunette3 Nor can the law of the plaintiff's domicil, Oregon here, be substitutedin FTCA actions based on torts committed in Antarctica. "Congress hasexpressly stated that the Government's liability is to be determined bythe application of a particular law, the law of the place where the act oromission occurred . . . ." Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 9 (1962).Petitioner does not contend that her cause of action is based on acts oromissions occurring in Oregon.4 The history of the FTCA reveals that Congress declined to enact earlier versions of the statute that would have differentiated between foreignand United States residents. Those versions would have barred claims"arising in a foreign country in behalf of an alien." S. 2690, 76th Cong.,1st Sess., $ 303(12) (1939) (emphasis added); H. R. 7236, 76th Cong., 1stSess., $ 303(12) (1939) (emphasis added). At the suggestion of the Attorney General, the last five words of the proposed bills were dropped. SeeHearings on H. R. 5373 and H. R. 6463 before the House Committee on theJudiciary, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., 29, 35, 66 (1942). As we observed in507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT203Cite as: 507 U. S. 197 (1993)Opinion of the CourtMachine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U. S.706, 710, n. 8 (1972), "Congress does not in general intendto create venue gaps, which take away with one hand whatCongress has given by way of jurisdictional grant with theother." Thus, in construing the FTCA, it is "reasonable toprefer the construction that avoids leaving such a gap,"ibid.,especially when that construction comports with the usualmeaning of a disputed term.Our decisions interpreting the FTCA contain varyingstatements as to how it should be construed. See, e. g.,United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 340 U. S. 543, 547 (1951);Dalehite v. United States, 346 U. S. 15, 31 (1953); UnitedStates v. Orleans, 425 U. S. 807, 813 (1976); Kosak v. UnitedStates, 465 U. S. 848, 853, n. 9 (1984). See also United Statesv. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U. S. 30, 34 (1992). A recentstatement of this sort, and the one to which we now adhere,is found in United States v. Kubrick, 444 U. S. 111, 117-118(1979) (citations omitted): "We should also have in mind thatthe Act waives the immunity of the United States and that. . . we should not take it upon ourselves to extend the waiverbeyond that which Congress intended. Neither, however,should we assume the authority to narrow the waiver thatCongress intended." Reading the foreign-country excep-tion to the FTCA to exclude torts committed in Antarcticaaccords with this canon of construction.Lastly, the presumption against extraterritorial application of United States statutes requires that any lingeringdoubt regarding the reach of the FTCA be resolved againstUnited States v. Spelar, 338 U. S. 217, 220 (1949), "[t]he superseded drafthad made the waiver of the Government's traditional immunity turn uponthe fortuitous circumstance of the injured party's citizenship." Theamended version, however, "identified the coverage of the Act with thescope of United States sovereignty." Id., at 220-221. At least insofar asAntarctica is concerned, petitioner's interpretation of the FTCA wouldeffectively resurrect the scheme rejected by Congress; it would deny reliefto foreign residents in circumstances where United States residentscould recover.507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT204 SMITH v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtits encompassing torts committed in Antarctica. "It is alongstanding principle of American law `that legislation ofCongress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to applyonly within the territorial jurisdiction of the UnitedStates.' " EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U. S.244, 248 (1991) (quoting Foley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U. S.281, 285 (1949)). In applying this principle, "[w]e assumethat Congress legislates against the backdrop of the pre-sumption against extraterritoriality."Arabian AmericanOil Co., supra, at 248; accord, e. g., Argentine Republic v.Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U. S. 428, 440 (1989)("When it desires to do so, Congress knows how to place thehigh seas within the jurisdictional reach of a statute"). Theapplicability of the presumption is not defeated here just because the FTCA specifically addresses the issue of extrater-ritorial application in the foreign-country exception. To thecontrary, as we stated in United States v. Spelar, 338 U. S.217, 222 (1949), "[t]hat presumption, far from being overcomehere, is doubly fortified by the language of this statute andthe legislative purpose underlying it." Petitioner does notassert, nor could she, that there is clear evidence of congressional intent to apply the FTCA to claims arisingin Antarctica.5For all of these reasons, we hold that the FTCA's waiverof sovereign immunity does not apply to tort claims arisingin Antarctica. Some of these reasons are based on the language and structure of the statute itself; others are basedon presumptions as to extraterritorial application of Acts ofCongress and as to waivers of sovereign immunity. We5 Petitioner instead argues that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies only if it serves to avoid " `unintended clashes between ourlaws and those of other nations which could result in international discord.' " Brief for Petitioner 16 (quoting EEOC v. Arabian American OilCo., 499 U. S., at 248). But the presumption is rooted in a number ofconsiderations, not the least of which is the commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.507US1$38H 11-18-96 19:53:09 PAGES OPINPGT205Cite as: 507 U.
