EVANSOpinion of the Courtacted in reliance on a police record indicating the existenceof an outstanding arrest warrant--a record that is later determined to be erroneous--must be suppressed by virtue ofthe exclusionary rule regardless of the source of the error.The Supreme Court of Arizona held that the exclusionaryrule required suppression of evidence even if the erroneousinformation resulted from an error committed by an employee of the office of the Clerk of Court. We disagree.In January 1991, Phoenix police officer Bryan Sargent observed respondent Isaac Evans driving the wrong way on aone-way street in front of the police station. The officerstopped respondent and asked to see his driver's license.After respondent told him that his license had been suspended, the officer entered respondent's name into a computer data terminal located in his patrol car. The computerinquiry confirmed that respondent's license had been suspended and also indicated that there was an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for his arrest. Based upon the outstanding warrant, Officer Sargent placed respondent under arrest.While being handcuffed, respondent dropped a hand-rolledcigarette that the officers determined smelled of marijuana.Officers proceeded to search his car and discovered a bag ofmarijuana under the passenger's seat.The State charged respondent with possession of marijuana. When the police notified the Justice Court that theyhad arrested him, the Justice Court discovered that the arrest warrant previously had been quashed and so advisedthe police. Respondent argued that because his arrest wasbased on a warrant that had been quashed 17 days prior tohis arrest, the marijuana seized incident to the arrest shouldbe suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest. Respondent also argued that "[t]he `good faith' exception to the exclusionary rule [was] inapplicable . . . because it was police error,not judicial error, which caused the invalid arrest." App. 5.At the suppression hearing, the Chief Clerk of the JusticeCourt testified that a Justice of the Peace had issued the514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:58 PAGES OPINPGT5Cite as: 514 U. S. 1 (1995)Opinion of the Courtarrest warrant on December 13, 1990, because respondenthad failed to appear to answer for several traffic violations.On December 19, 1990, respondent appeared before a pro temJustice of the Peace who entered a notation in respondent'sfile to "quash warrant." Id., at 13.The Chief Clerk also testified regarding the standard courtprocedure for quashing a warrant. Under that procedure ajustice court clerk calls and informs the warrant section ofthe Sheriff 's Office when a warrant has been quashed. TheSheriff 's Office then removes the warrant from its computerrecords. After calling the Sheriff 's Office, the clerk makesa note in the individual's file indicating the clerk who madethe phone call and the person at the Sheriff 's Office to whomthe clerk spoke. The Chief Clerk testified that there was noindication in respondent's file that a clerk had called and notified the Sheriff 's Office that his arrest warrant had beenquashed. A records clerk from the Sheriff 's Office also testified that the Sheriff 's Office had no record of a telephonecall informing it that respondent's arrest warrant had beenquashed. Id., at 42-43.At the close of testimony, respondent argued that the evidence obtained as a result of the arrest should be suppressedbecause "the purposes of the exclusionary rule would beserved here by making the clerks for the court, or the clerkfor the Sheriff 's office, whoever is responsible for this mistake, to be more careful about making sure that warrantsare removed from the records." Id., at 47. The trial courtgranted the motion to suppress because it concluded that theState had been at fault for failing to quash the warrant.Presumably because it could find no "distinction betweenState action, whether it happens to be the police departmentor not," id., at 52, the trial court made no factual finding asto whether the Justice Court or Sheriff 's Office was responsible for the continued presence of the quashed warrant in thepolice records.514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:58 PAGES OPINPGT6 ARIZONA v. EVANSOpinion of the CourtA divided panel of the Arizona Court of Appeals reversedbecause it "believe[d] that the exclusionary rule [was] notintended to deter justice court employees or Sheriff 's Officeemployees who are not directly associated with the arrestingofficers or the arresting officers' police department." 172Ariz. 314, 317, 836 P. 2d 1024, 1027 (1992). Therefore, itconcluded, "the purpose of the exclusionary rule would notbe served by excluding the evidence obtained in this case."Ibid.The Arizona Supreme Court reversed. 177 Ariz. 201, 866P. 2d 869 (1994). The court rejected the "distinction drawnby the court of appeals . . . between clerical errors committedby law enforcement personnel and similar mistakes by courtemployees." Id., at 203, 866 P. 2d, at 871. The court predicted that application of the exclusionary rule would "hope-fully serve to improve the efficiency of those who keep records in our criminal justice system." Id., at 204, 866 P. 2d,at 872. Finally, the court concluded that "[e]ven assumingthat deterrence is the principal reason for application of theexclusionary rule, we disagree with the court of appeals thatsuch a purpose would not be served where carelessness by acourt clerk results in an unlawful arrest."Ibid.We granted certiorari to determine whether the exclusionary rule requires suppression of evidence seized incident toan arrest resulting from an inaccurate computer record, regardless of whether police personnel or court personnel wereresponsible for the record's continued presence in the policecomputer. 511 U.

S. 1032 (1983), we adopted astandard for determining whether a state-court decisionrested upon an adequate and independent state ground.When "a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarilyon federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, andwhen the adequacy and independence of any possible statelaw ground is not clear from the face of the opinion, we willaccept as the most reasonable explanation that the statecourt decided the case the way it did because it believed thatfederal law required it to do so."Id., at 1040-1041. Weadopted this practice, in part, to obviate the "unsatisfactoryand intrusive practice of requiring state courts to clarifytheir decisions to the satisfaction of this Court." Id., at1041. We also concluded that this approach would "providestate judges with a clearer opportunity to develop statejurisprudence unimpeded by federal interference, and yetwill preserve the integrity of federal law."Ibid.Justice Ginsburg would overrule Michigan v. Long,supra, because she believes that the rule of that case "im-pedes the States' ability to serve as laboratories for testingsolutions to novel legal problems."

EVANSOpinion of the Courtion in Long describes the 60-year history of the Court's differing approaches to the determination whether the judgment of the highest court of a State rested on federal ornonfederal grounds. 463 U. S., at 1038-1040. When wewere in doubt, on some occasions we dismissed the writ ofcertiorari; on other occasions we vacated the judgment ofthe state court and remanded so that it might clarify thebasis for its decision. See ibid. The latter approach did notalways achieve the desired result and burdened the statecourts with additional work. Ibid.We believe that Michigan v. Long properly serves its purpose and should not be disturbed. Under it, state courts areabsolutely free to interpret state constitutional provisions toaccord greater protection to individual rights than do similarprovisions of the United States Constitution. They also arefree to serve as experimental laboratories, in the sense thatJustice Brandeis used that term in his dissenting opinion inNew State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932) (urging that the Court not impose federal constitutional restraints on the efforts of a State to "serve as a laboratory").Under our decision today, the State of Arizona remains freeto seek whatever solutions it chooses to problems of law enforcement posed by the advent of computerization.3 Indeed,it is freer to do so because it is disabused of its erroneousview of what the United States Constitution requires.State courts, in appropriate cases, are not merely free to--they are bound to--interpret the United States Constitution.In doing so, they are not free from the final authority of thisv. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 740 (1991) (opinion of O'Connor, J.) (decliningto expand the Long and Harris presumption to instances "where the relevant state court decision does not fairly appear to rest primarily on federallaw or to be interwoven with such law").3 Justice Ginsburg acknowledges as much when she states that sinceLong, "state courts, on remand, have reinstated their prior judgmentsafter clarifying their reliance on state grounds."

Virginia,6 Wheat. 264 (1821), and presumablyJustice Ginsburgdoes not quarrel with it.4 In Minnesota v. National Tea Co.,309 U. S. 551 (1940), we recognized that our authority as finalarbiter of the United States Constitution could be eroded bya lack of clarity in state-court decisions."It is fundamental that state courts be left free and un-fettered by us in interpreting their state constitutions.But it is equally important that ambiguous or obscureadjudications by state courts do not stand as barriers toa determination by this Court of the validity under thefederal constitution of state action. Intelligent exerciseof our appellate powers compels us to ask for the elimi-nation of the obscurities and ambiguities from the opinions in such cases. . . . For no other course assures thatimportant federal issues, such as have been argued here,will reach this Court for adjudication; that state courtswill not be the final arbiters of important issues underthe federal constitution; and that we will not encroachon the constitutional jurisdiction of the states." Id.,at 557.We therefore adhere to the standard adopted in Michigan v.Long, supra.Applying that standard here, we conclude that we havejurisdiction. In reversing the Court of Appeals, the ArizonaSupreme Court stated that "[w]hile it may be inappropriateto invoke the exclusionary rule where a magistrate has is-sued a facially valid warrant (a discretionary judicial function) based on an erroneous evaluation of the facts, the law,or both,Leon, 468 U. S. 897 . . . (1984), it is useful and proper4 Surely if we have jurisdiction to vacate and remand a state-court judgment for clarification, post, at 34, n. 7, we also must have jurisdiction todetermine whether a state-court judgment is based upon an adequate andindependent state ground.

EVANSOpinion of the Courtto do so where negligent record keeping (a purely clericalfunction) results in an unlawful arrest." 177 Ariz., at 204,866 P. 2d, at 872. Thus, the Arizona Supreme Court's deci-sion to suppress the evidence was based squarely upon itsinterpretation of federal law. See ibid. Nor did it offer aplain statement that its references to federal law were"being used only for the purpose of guidance, and d[id] notthemselves compel the result that [it] reached." Long,supra, at 1041.The Fourth Amendment states that "[t]he right of the peo-ple to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects,against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things tobe seized." We have recognized, however, that the FourthAmendment contains no provision expressly precluding theuse of evidence obtained in violation of its commands. SeeUnited States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 906 (1984). "The wrongcondemned by the [Fourth] Amendment is `fully accomplished' by the unlawful search or seizure itself," ibid. (quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 354 (1974)), andthe use of the fruits of a past unlawful search or seizure" `work[s] no new Fourth Amendment wrong,' " Leon, supra,at 906 (quoting Calandra, supra, at 354)."The question whether the exclusionary rule's remedy isappropriate in a particular context has long been regardedas an issue separate from the question whether the FourthAmendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rulewere violated by police conduct." Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S.213, 223 (1983); see also United States v. Havens, 446 U. S.620, 627-628 (1980); Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 486-487(1976); Calandra, supra, at 348. The exclusionary rule operates as a judicially created remedy designed to safeguardagainst future violations of Fourth Amendment rightsthrough the rule's general deterrent effect. Leon, supra, at514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT11Cite as: 514 U. S. 1 (1995)Opinion of the Court906; Calandra, supra, at 348. As with any remedial device,the rule's application has been restricted to those instanceswhere its remedial objectives are thought most efficaciouslyserved. Leon, supra, at 908; Calandra, supra, at 348.Where "the exclusionary rule does not result in appreciabledeterrence, then, clearly, its use . . . is unwarranted."United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 454 (1976).InLeon, we applied these principles to the context of apolice search in which the officers had acted in objectivelyreasonable reliance on a search warrant, issued by a neutraland detached Magistrate, that later was determined to beinvalid. 468 U. S., at 905. On the basis of three factors,we determined that there was no sound reason to apply theexclusionary rule as a means of deterring misconduct on thepart of judicial officers who are responsible for issuing warrants. See Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340, 348 (1987) (ana-lyzingLeon, supra). First, we noted that the exclusionaryrule was historically designed " `to deter police misconductrather than to punish the errors of judges and magistrates.' "Krull, supra, at 348 (quoting Leon, supra, at 916). Second,there was " `no evidence suggesting that judges and magistrates are inclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amend-ment or that lawlessness among these actors requires theapplication of the extreme sanction of exclusion.' " Krull,supra, at 348 (quoting Leon, supra, at 916). Third, and ofgreatest importance, there was no basis for believing thatexclusion of evidence seized pursuant to a warrant wouldhave a significant deterrent effect on the issuing judge ormagistrate.Krull, supra, at 348.The Leon Court then examined whether application of theexclusionary rule could be expected to alter the behavior ofthe law enforcement officers. We concluded:"[W]here the officer's conduct is objectively reasonable,`excluding the evidence will not further the ends of theexclusionary rule in any appreciable way; for it is pain-fully apparent that . . . the officer is acting as a reason514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT12 ARIZONA v. EVANSOpinion of the Courtable officer would and should act in similar circum-stances. Excluding the evidence can in no way affecthis future conduct unless it is to make him less willing todo his duty.' " Leon, supra, at 919-920 (quoting Stone,supra, at 539-540 (White, J., dissenting)).See also Massachusetts v. Sheppard, 468 U. S. 981, 990-991(1984) ("[S]uppressing evidence because the judge failed tomake all the necessary clerical corrections despite his assur-ances that such changes would be made will not serve thedeterrent function that the exclusionary rule was designedto achieve"). Thus, we held that the "marginal or nonexistent benefits produced by suppressing evidence obtained inobjectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidatedsearch warrant cannot justify the substantial costs of exclu-sion." Leon, supra, at 922.Respondent relies on United States v. Hensley, 469 U. S.221 (1985), and argues that the evidence seized incident tohis arrest should be suppressed because he was the victimof a Fourth Amendment violation. Brief for Respondent10-12, 21-22. In Hensley, the Court determined that evi-dence uncovered as a result of a stop pursuant toTerry v.Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), was admissible because the officerswho made the stop acted in objectively reasonable relianceon a flyer that had been issued by officers of another policedepartment who possessed a reasonable suspicion to justifyaTerry stop. 469 U. S., at 231. Because the Hensley Courtdetermined that there had been no Fourth Amendment violation, id., at 236, the Court never considered whether theseized evidence should have been excluded. Hensley doesnot contradict our earlier pronouncements that "[t]he ques-tion whether the exclusionary rule's remedy is appropriatein a particular context has long been regarded as an issueseparate from the question whether the Fourth Amendmentrights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violatedby police conduct."Gates, supra, at 223; see also Stone,supra, at 486-487; Calandra, supra, at 348.514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT13Cite as: 514 U. S. 1 (1995)Opinion of the CourtRespondent also argues that Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo.State Penitentiary, 401 U. S. 560 (1971), compels exclusion ofthe evidence. In Whiteley, the Court determined that theFourth Amendment had been violated when police officersarrested Whiteley and recovered inculpatory evidence basedupon a radio report that two suspects had been involved intwo robberies. Id., at 568-569. Although the "police wereentitled to act on the strength of the radio bulletin," theCourt determined that there had been a Fourth Amendmentviolation because the initial complaint, upon which the arrestwarrant and subsequent radio bulletin were based, was insufficient to support an independent judicial assessment ofprobable cause. Id., at 568. The Court concluded that "anotherwise illegal arrest cannot be insulated from challengeby the decision of the instigating officer to rely on fellowofficers to make the arrest." Ibid. Because the "arrestviolated [Whiteley's] constitutional rights under the Fourthand Fourteenth Amendments; the evidence secured as an incident thereto should have been excluded from his trial.Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)." Id., at 568-569.Although Whiteley clearly retains relevance in determining whether police officers have violated the Fourth Amendment, see Hensley, supra, at 230-231, its precedential valueregarding application of the exclusionary rule is dubious. InWhiteley, the Court treated identification of a FourthAmendment violation as synonymous with application of theexclusionary rule to evidence secured incident to that violation. 401 U. S., at 568-569. Subsequent case law hasrejected this reflexive application of the exclusionary rule.Cf. Illinois v. Krull, 480 U. S. 340 (1987); Sheppard, supra;United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984); United Statesv. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338 (1974). These later cases haveemphasized that the issue of exclusion is separate fromwhether the Fourth Amendment has been violated, see, e. g.,Leon, supra, at 906, and exclusion is appropriate only if the514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT14 ARIZONA v. EVANSOpinion of the Courtremedial objectives of the rule are thought most efficaciouslyserved, seeCalandra, supra, at 348.Our approach is consistent with the dissenting Justices'position inKrull, our only major case since Leon and Sheppard involving the good-faith exception to the exclusionaryrule. In that case, the Court found that the good-faithexception applies when an officer conducts a search in objectively reasonable reliance on the constitutionality of a stat-ute that subsequently is declared unconstitutional.Krull,supra, at 346. Even the dissenting Justices in Krull agreedthatLeon provided the proper framework for analyzingwhether the exclusionary rule applied; they simply thoughtthat "application of Leon's stated rationales le[d] to a contrary result." 480 U. S., at 362 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).In sum, respondent does not persuade us to abandon theLeon framework.Applying the reasoning of Leon to the facts of this case,we conclude that the decision of the Arizona Supreme Courtmust be reversed. The Arizona Supreme Court determinedthat it could not "support the distinction drawn . . . betweenclerical errors committed by law enforcement personnel andsimilar mistakes by court employees," 177 Ariz., at 203, 866P. 2d, at 871, and that "even assuming . . . that responsibilityfor the error rested with the justice court, it does not followthat the exclusionary rule should be inapplicable to thesefacts," ibid.This holding is contrary to the reasoning of Leon, supra;Massachuset ts v. Sheppard, supra; and, Kr ull, supra.If court employees were responsible for the erroneouscomputer record, the exclusion of evidence at trial wouldnot sufficiently deter future errors so as to warrant such asevere sanction. First, as we noted in Leon, the exclusionary rule was historically designed as a means of deterringpolice misconduct, not mistakes by court employees. SeeLeon, supra, at 916; see also Krull, supra, at 350. Second,respondent offers no evidence that court employees are in514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT15Cite as: 514 U. S. 1 (1995)Opinion of the Courtclined to ignore or subvert the Fourth Amendment or thatlawlessness among these actors requires application of theextreme sanction of exclusion. See Leon, supra, at 916, andn. 14; see alsoKrull, supra, at 350-351. To the contrary, theChief Clerk of the Justice Court testified at the suppressionhearing that this type of error occurred once every three orfour years. App. 37.Finally, and most important, there is no basis for believingthat application of the exclusionary rule in these circumstances will have a significant effect on court employees re-sponsible for informing the police that a warrant has beenquashed. Because court clerks are not adjuncts to the lawenforcement team engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime, see Johnson v. United States,333 U. S. 10, 14 (1948), they have no stake in the outcome ofparticular criminal prosecutions. Cf. Leon, supra, at 917;Krull, supra, at 352. The threat of exclusion of evidencecould not be expected to deter such individuals from failingto inform police officials that a warrant had been quashed.Cf. Leon, supra, at 917; Krull, supra, at 352.If it were indeed a court clerk who was responsible for theerroneous entry on the police computer, application of theexclusionary rule also could not be expected to alter the behavior of the arresting officer. As the trial court in this casestated: "I think the police officer [was] bound to arrest. Ithink he would [have been] derelict in his duty if he failed toarrest." App. 51. Cf. Leon, supra, at 920 (" `Excluding theevidence can in no way affect [the officer's] future conductunless it is to make him less willing to do his duty.' " quotingStone, 428 U. S., at 540 (White, J., dissenting)). The ChiefClerk of the Justice Court testified that this type of erroroccurred "on[c]e every three or four years." App. 37. Infact, once the court clerks discovered the error, they immediately corrected it, id., at 30, and then proceeded to searchtheir files to make sure that no similar mistakes had occurred, id., at 37. There is no indication that the arresting514us1$30H 06-11-98 18:12:59 PAGES OPINPGT16 ARIZONA v. EVANSO'Connor, J., concurringofficer was not acting objectively reasonably when he reliedupon the police computer record. Application of the Leonframework supports a categorical exception to the exclusion-ary rule for clerical errors of court employees. See Leon,supra, at 916-922; Sheppard, supra, at 990-991.5The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded to that court forproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
