The Wayne County Cir-cuit Court rejected this argument, declared the car a publicnuisance, and ordered the car's abatement. In reaching thisdisposition, the trial court judge recognized the remedial discretion he had under Michigan's case law. App. 21.

Alternatively, the intermediate appellatecourt ruled that the conduct in question did not qualify as apublic nuisance because only one occurrence was shown andthere was no evidence of payment for the sexual act. 200Mich.

It concluded as a matterof state law that the episode in the Bennis vehicle was anabatable nuisance. Rejecting the Court of Appeals' inter-pretation of $ 600.3815(2), the court then announced that, inorder to abate an owner's interest in a vehicle, Michigan doesnot need to prove that the owner knew or agreed that hervehicle would be used in a manner proscribed by $ 600.3801when she entrusted it to another user.Id., at 737, 527N.

Kansas, 272 U. S. 465(1926), and Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416U. S. 663 (1974), that Michigan's failure to provide aninnocent-owner defense was "without constitutional consequence." 447 Mich., at 740-741, 527 N. W. 2d, at 493-494.The Michigan Supreme Court specifically noted that, in itsview, an owner's interest may not be abated when "a vehicleis used without the owner's consent."Id., at 742, n. 36, 527N. W. 2d, at 495, n. 36. Furthermore, the court confirmedthe trial court's description of the nuisance abatement proceeding as an "equitable action," and considered it "critical"that the trial judge so comprehended the statute. Id., at742, 527 N. W. 2d, at 495.We granted certiorari in order to determine whetherMichigan's abatement scheme has deprived petitioner of herinterest in the forfeited car without due process, in violationof the Fourteenth Amendment, or has taken her interest forpublic use without compensation, in violation of the FifthAmendment as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment.515 U. S. 1121 (1995). We affirm.The gravamen of petitioner's due process claim is not thatshe was denied notice or an opportunity to contest the abatement of her car; she was accorded both. Cf. United Statesv. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43 (1993).Rather, she claims she was entitled to contest the abatementby showing she did not know her husband would use it toviolate Michigan's indecency law. But a long and unbrokenline of cases holds that an owner's interest in property maybe forfeited by reason of the use to which the property isput even though the owner did not know that it was to beput to such use.Our earliest opinion to this effect is Justice Story's opinionfor the Court in The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1 (1827). The Pal516us2$31H 10-22-98 14:10:56 PAGES OPINPGT447Cite as: 516 U.

Onthe Government's appeal from the Circuit Court's acquittalof the vessel, it was contended by the owner that the vesselcould not be forfeited until he was convicted for the privateering. The Court rejected this contention, explaining:"The thing is here primarily considered as the offender, orrather the offence is attached primarily to the thing." Id.,at 14. In another admiralty forfeiture decision 17 yearslater, Justice Story wrote for the Court that in in rem admiralty proceedings "the acts of the master and crew . . . bindthe interest of the owner of the ship, whether he be innocentor guilty; and he impliedly submits to whatever the law denounces as a forfeiture attached to the ship by reason of theirunlawful or wanton wrongs." Harmony v. United States, 2How. 210, 234 (1844) (emphasis added).In Dobbins's Distillery v. United States, 96 U. S. 395, 401(1878), this Court upheld the forfeiture of property usedby a lessee in fraudulently avoiding federal alcohol taxes,observing: "Cases often arise where the property of theowner is forfeited on account of the fraud, neglect, or misconduct of those intrusted with its possession, care, and custody,even when the owner is otherwise without fault . . . and ithas always been held . . . that the acts of [the possessors]bind the interest of the owner . . . whether he be innocentor guilty."In Van Oster v. Kansas, 272 U. S. 465 (1926), this Courtupheld the forfeiture of a purchaser's interest in a car misused by the seller. Van Oster purchased an automobile froma dealer but agreed that the dealer might retain possessionfor use in its business. The dealer allowed an associate touse the automobile, and the associate used it for the illegaltransportation of intoxicating liquor. Id., at 465-466. TheState brought a forfeiture action pursuant to a Kansas stat516us2$31H 10-22-98 14:10:56 PAGES OPINPGT448 BENNIS v. MICHIGANOpinion of the Courtute, and Van Oster defended on the ground that the transpor-tation of the liquor in the car was without her knowledge orauthority. This Court rejected Van Oster's claim:"It is not unknown or indeed uncommon for the lawto visit upon the owner of property the unpleasant consequences of the unauthorized action of one to whom hehas entrusted it. Much of the jurisdiction in admiralty,so much of the statute and common law of liens as en-ables a mere bailee to subject the bailed property to alien, the power of a vendor of chattels in possession tosell and convey good title to a stranger, are familiarexamples. . . . They suggest that certain uses of propertymay be regarded as so undesirable that the owner surrenders his control at his peril. . . ."It has long been settled that statutory forfeitures ofproperty entrusted by the innocent owner or lienor toanother who uses it in violation of the revenue laws ofthe United States is not a violation of the due processclause of the Fifth Amendment."Id., at 467-468.The Van Oster Court relied on J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-GrantCo. v. United States, 254 U. S. 505 (1921), in which the Courtupheld the forfeiture of a seller's interest in a car misusedby the purchaser. The automobile was forfeited after thepurchaser transported bootleg distilled spirits in it, and theselling dealership lost the title retained as security forunpaid purchase money. Id., at 508-509. The Court discussed the arguments for and against allowing the forfeitureof the interest of an owner who was "without guilt,"id., at510, and concluded that "whether the reason for [the challenged forfeiture scheme] be artificial or real, it is too firmlyfixed in the punitive and remedial jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced," id., at 511.55 In Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602, 617 (1993), the Court observed that J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U. S.505 (1921), "expressly reserved the question whether the [guilty-property]516us2$31H 10-22-98 14:10:56 PAGES OPINPGT449Cite as: 516 U. S. 442 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIn Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S.663 (1974), the most recent decision on point, the Court reviewed the same cases discussed above, and concluded that"the innocence of the owner of property subject to forfeiturehas almost uniformly been rejected as a defense." Id., at683. Petitioner is in the same position as the various owners involved in the forfeiture cases beginning with The Palmyra in 1827. She did not know that her car would be usedin an illegal activity that would subject it to forfeiture. Butunder these cases the Due Process Clause of the FourteenthAmendment does not protect her interest against forfeitureby the government.Petitioner relies on a passage from Calero-Toledo, that "itwould be difficult to reject the constitutional claim of . . . anowner who proved not only that he was uninvolved in andunaware of the wrongful activity, but also that he had donefiction could be employed to forfeit the property of a truly innocentowner." This observation is quite mistaken. The Goldsmith-GrantCourt expressly reserved opinion "as to whether the section can be extended to property stolen from the owner or otherwise taken from himwithout his privity or consent." Id., at 512 (emphases added). In otherwords, the Goldsmith-Grant Court drew the very same distinction madeby the Michigan Supreme Court in this case: "the distinction between thesituation in which a vehicle is used without the owner's consent," and onein which, "although the owner consented to [another person's] use, [thevehicle] is used in a manner to which the owner did not consent." 447Mich., at 742, n. 36, 527 N. W. 2d, at 495, n. 36. Because John Bennisco-owned the car at issue, petitioner cannot claim she was in the formersituation.The dissent, post, at 466-468, and n. 12, quoting Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch347, 364 (1808), seeks to enlarge the reservation in Goldsmith-Grant intoa general principle that " `a forfeiture can only be applied to those casesin which the means that are prescribed for the prevention of a forfeituremay be employed.' " But Peisch was dealing with the same question reserved in Goldsmith-Grant, not any broader proposition: "If, by privatetheft, or open robbery, without any fault on his part, [an owner's] propertyshould be invaded, . . . the law cannot be understood to punish him withthe forfeiture of that property." 4 Cranch, at 364.516us2$31H 10-22-98 14:10:56 PAGES OPINPGT450 BENNIS v. MICHIGANOpinion of the Courtall that reasonably could be expected to prevent the pro-scribed use of his property." 416 U. S., at 689. But sheconcedes that this comment was obiter dictum, and "[i]t isto the holdings of our cases, rather than their dicta, thatwe must attend." Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. ofAmerica, 511 U. S. 375, 379 (1994). And the holding ofCalero-Toledo on this point was that the interest of a yachtrental company in one of its leased yachts could be forfeitedbecause of its use for transportation of controlled substances,even though the company was " `in no way . . . involved inthe criminal enterprise carried on by [the] lessee' and `hadno knowledge that its property was being used in connectionwith or in violation of [Puerto Rican Law].' " 416 U. S., at668. Petitioner has made no showing beyond that here.Justice Stevens' dissent argues that our cases treat contraband differently from instrumentalities used to conveycontraband, like cars: Objects in the former class are forfeitable "however blameless or unknowing their owners maybe," post, at 459, but with respect to an instrumentality inthe latter class, an owner's innocence is no defense only tothe "principal use being made of that property," post, at 461.However, this Court's precedent has never made the dueprocess inquiry depend on whether the use for which theinstrumentality was forfeited was the principal use. If ithad, perhaps cases like Calero-Toledo, in which JusticeDouglas noted in dissent that there was no showing that the"yacht had been notoriously used in smuggling drugs . . . andso far as we know only one marihuana cigarette was foundon the yacht," 416 U. S., at 693 (opinion dissenting in part),might have been decided differently.The dissent also suggests that The Palmyra line of cases"would justify the confiscation of an ocean liner just becauseone of its passengers sinned while on board." Post, at 462.None of our cases have held that an ocean liner may be confiscated because of the activities of one passenger. We saidin Goldsmith-Grant, and we repeat here, that "[w]hen such516us2$31H 10-22-98 14:10:56 PAGES OPINPGT451Cite as: 516 U. S. 442 (1996)Opinion of the Courtapplication shall be made it will be time enough to pronounceupon it." 254 U. S., at 512.Notwithstanding this well-established authority rejectingthe innocent-owner defense, petitioner argues that we shouldin effect overrule it by importing a culpability requirementfrom cases having at best a tangential relation to the "inno-cent owner" doctrine in forfeiture cases. She citesFouchav. Louisiana, 504 U. S. 71 (1992), for the proposition that acriminal defendant may not be punished for a crime if he isfound to be not guilty. She also argues that our holding inAustin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), that the Excessive Fines Clause 6 limits the scope of civil forfeiture judg-ments, "would be difficult to reconcile with any rule allowingtruly innocent persons to be punished by civil forfeiture."Brief for Petitioner 18-19, n. 12.In Foucha the Court held that a defendant found not guiltyby reason of insanity in a criminal trial could not be thereafter confined indefinitely by the State without a showing thathe was either dangerous or mentally ill. Petitioner arguesthat our statement that in those circumstances a State hasno "punitive interest" which would justify continued detention, 504 U. S., at 80, requires that Michigan demonstrate apunitive interest in depriving her of her interest in the forfeited car. But, putting aside the extent to which a forfeiture proceeding is "punishment" in the first place, Foucha didnot purport to discuss, let alone overrule, The Palmyra lineof cases.In Austin, the Court held that because "forfeiture serves,at least in part, to punish the owner," forfeiture proceedingsare subject to the limitations of the Eighth Amendment'sprohibition against excessive fines. 509 U. S., at 618.There was no occasion in that case to deal with the validityof the "innocent-owner defense," other than to point out thatif a forfeiture statute allows such a defense, the defense is6 U. S. Const., Amdt. 8.516us2$31H 10-22-98 14:10:56 PAGES OPINPGT452 BENNIS v. MICHIGANOpinion of the Courtadditional evidence that the statute itself is "punitive" in mo-tive.Id., at 617-618. In this case, however, Michigan's Supreme Court emphasized with respect to the forfeiture pro-ceeding at issue: "It is not contested that this is an equitableaction," in which the trial judge has discretion to consider"alternatives [to] abating the entire interest in the vehicle."447 Mich., at 742, 527 N. W. 2d, at 495.In any event, for the reasons pointed out in Calero-ToledoandVan Oster, forfeiture also serves a deterrent purposedistinct from any punitive purpose. Forfeiture of propertyprevents illegal uses "both by preventing further illicit useof the [property] and by imposing an economic penalty,thereby rendering illegal behavior unprofitable." CaleroToledo, supra, at 687. This deterrent mechanism is hardlyunique to forfeiture. For instance, because Michigan alsodeters dangerous driving by making a motor vehicle ownerliable for the negligent operation of the vehicle by a driverwho had the owner's consent to use it, petitioner was alsopotentially liable for her husband's use of the car in violationof Michigan negligence law. Mich. Comp. Laws $ 257.401(1979). "The law thus builds a secondary defense against aforbidden use and precludes evasions by dispensing with thenecessity of judicial inquiry as to collusion between thewrongdoer and the alleged innocent owner." Van Oster, 272U. S., at 467-468.Petitioner also claims that the forfeiture in this case wasa taking of private property for public use in violation of theTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicableto the States by the Fourteenth Amendment. But if theforfeiture proceeding here in question did not violate theFourteenth Amendment, the property in the automobile wastransferred by virtue of that proceeding from petitioner tothe State. The government may not be required to compensate an owner for property which it has already lawfully acquired under the exercise of governmental authority otherthan the power of eminent domain. United States v. Fuller,516us2$31H 10-22-98 14:10:56 PAGES OPINPGT453Cite as: 516 U. S. 442 (1996)Thomas, J., concurring409 U. S. 488, 492 (1973); see United States v. Rands, 389U. S. 121, 125 (1967).At bottom, petitioner's claims depend on an argument thatthe Michigan forfeiture statute is unfair because it relievesprosecutors from the burden of separating co-owners whoare complicit in the wrongful use of property from innocentco-owners. This argument, in the abstract, has considerableappeal, as we acknowledged in Goldsmith-Grant, 254 U. S.,at 510. Its force is reduced in the instant case, however, bythe Michigan Supreme Court's confirmation of the trialcourt's remedial discretion, seesupra, at 446, and petitioner'srecognition that Michigan may forfeit her and her husband'scar whether or not she is entitled to an offset for her interestin it, Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 9.We conclude today, as we concluded 75 years ago, that thecases authorizing actions of the kind at issue are "too firmlyfixed in the punitive and remedial jurisprudence of the country to be now displaced." Goldsmith-Grant, supra, at 511.The State here sought to deter illegal activity that contributes to neighborhood deterioration and unsafe streets. TheBennis automobile, it is conceded, facilitated and was usedin criminal activity. Both the trial court and the MichiganSupreme Court followed our longstanding practice, and thejudgment of the Supreme Court of Michigan is therefore
