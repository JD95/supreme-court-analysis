In the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, Congress madeit a federal offense "for any individual knowingly to possessa firearm at a place that the individual knows, or hasreasonable cause to believe, is a school zone." 18 U. S. C.$ 922(q)(1)(A) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The Act neither regulatesa commercial activity nor contains a requirement that thepossession be connected in any way to interstate commerce.We hold that the Act exceeds the authority of Congress "[t]oregulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . . ."U.

Acting upon an anonymous tip, school authorities con-fronted respondent, who admitted that he was carrying theweapon. He was arrested and charged under Texas lawwith firearm possession on school premises. See Tex. PenalCode Ann. $ 46.03(a)(1) (Supp. 1994). The next day, the statecharges were dismissed after federal agents charged respondent by complaint with violating the Gun-Free SchoolZones Act of 1990. 18 U. S. C. $ 922(q)(1)(A) (1988 ed.,Supp. V).1A federal grand jury indicted respondent on one count ofknowing possession of a firearm at a school zone, in violationof $ 922(q). Respondent moved to dismiss his federal indictment on the ground that $ 922(q) "is unconstitutional as it isbeyond the power of Congress to legislate control over ourpublic schools." The District Court denied the motion, concluding that $ 922(q) "is a constitutional exercise of Congress'well-defined power to regulate activities in and affecting1 The term "school zone" is defined as "in, or on the grounds of, a public,parochial or private school" or "within a distance of 1,000 feet from thegrounds of a public, parochial or private school." $ 921(a)(25).514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT552 UNITED STATES v.

Respondent waived his right to a jury trial.The District Court conducted a bench trial, found him guiltyof violating $ 922(q), and sentenced him to six months' imprisonment and two years' supervised release.On appeal, respondent challenged his conviction based onhis claim that $ 922(q) exceeded Congress' power to legislateunder the Commerce Clause. The Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit agreed and reversed respondent's conviction.It held that, in light of what it characterized as insufficientcongressional findings and legislative history, "section 922(q),in the full reach of its terms, is invalid as beyond the powerof Congress under the Commerce Clause." 2 F. 3d 1342,1367-1368 (1993). Because of the importance of the issue,we granted certiorari, 511 U. S. 1029 (1994), and we nowaffirm.We start with first principles. The Constitution creates aFederal Government of enumerated powers. See Art. I, $ 8.As James Madison wrote: "The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few anddefined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite." The Federalist No. 45,pp. 292-293 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). This constitutionallymandated division of authority "was adopted by the Framersto ensure protection of our fundamental liberties." Gregoryv. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458 (1991) (internal quotationmarks omitted). "Just as the separation and independenceof the coordinate branches of the Federal Government serveto prevent the accumulation of excessive power in any onebranch, a healthy balance of power between the States andthe Federal Government will reduce the risk of tyranny andabuse from either front."

The Court, through Chief Justice Marshall, first de-fined the nature of Congress' commerce power in Gibbonsv. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189-190 (1824):"Commerce, undoubtedly, is traffic, but it is somethingmore: it is intercourse. It describes the commercialintercourse between nations, and parts of nations, inall its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rulesfor carrying on that intercourse."The commerce power "is the power to regulate; that is, toprescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.This power, like all others vested in congress, is complete initself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in theconstitution."Id., at 196. The Gibbons Court, however,acknowledged that limitations on the commerce power areinherent in the very language of the Commerce Clause."It is not intended to say that these words compre-hend that commerce, which is completely internal, whichis carried on between man and man in a State, or be-tween different parts of the same State, and which doesnot extend to or affect other States. Such a powerwould be inconvenient, and is certainly unnecessary."Comprehensive as the word `among' is, it may veryproperly be restricted to that commerce which concernsmore States than one. . . . The enumeration presupposessomething not enumerated; and that something, if weregard the language, or the subject of the sentence, mustbe the exclusively internal commerce of a State."Id.,at 194-195.For nearly a century thereafter, the Court's CommerceClause decisions dealt but rarely with the extent of Congress' power, and almost entirely with the Commerce Clauseas a limit on state legislation that discriminated against interstate commerce. See, e. g., Veazie v. Moor, 14 How. 568,573-575 (1853) (upholding a state-created steamboat monop514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT554 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZOpinion of the Courtoly because it involved regulation of wholly internal com-merce);Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U. S. 1, 17, 20-22 (1888) (upholding a state prohibition on the manufacture of intoxicat-ing liquor because the commerce power "does not comprehend the purely internal domestic commerce of a State whichis carried on between man and man within a State or be-tween different parts of the same State"); see also L. Tribe,American Constitutional Law 306 (2d ed. 1988). Under thisline of precedent, the Court held that certain categories ofactivity such as "production," "manufacturing," and "min-ing" were within the province of state governments, andthus were beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111,121 (1942) (describing development of Commerce Clausejurisprudence).In 1887, Congress enacted the Interstate Commerce Act,24 Stat. 379, and in 1890, Congress enacted the Sherman Antitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq.These laws ushered in a new era of federal regulation underthe commerce power. When cases involving these laws firstreached this Court, we imported from our negative Commerce Clause cases the approach that Congress could notregulate activities such as "production," "manufacturing,"and "mining." See, e. g., United States v. E. C. Knight Co.,156 U. S. 1, 12 (1895) ("Commerce succeeds to manufacture,and is not part of it"); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S.238, 304 (1936) ("Mining brings the subject matter of commerce into existence. Commerce disposes of it"). Simultaneously, however, the Court held that, where the interstateand intrastate aspects of commerce were so mingled together that full regulation of interstate commerce requiredincidental regulation of intrastate commerce, the CommerceClause authorized such regulation. See, e. g., ShreveportRate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914).In A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295U. S. 495, 550 (1935), the Court struck down regulations that514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT555Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)Opinion of the Courtfixed the hours and wages of individuals employed by an in-trastate business because the activity being regulated related to interstate commerce only indirectly. In doing so,the Court characterized the distinction between direct andindirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstatecommerce as "a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our constitutional system." Id., at 548. Activitiesthat affected interstate commerce directly were within Congress' power; activities that affected interstate commerceindirectly were beyond Congress' reach.Id., at 546. Thejustification for this formal distinction was rooted in the fearthat otherwise "there would be virtually no limit to the fed-eral power and for all practical purposes we should have acompletely centralized government." Id., at 548.Two years later, in the watershed case ofNLRB v. Jones &Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1 (1937), the Court upheld theNational Labor Relations Act against a Commerce Clausechallenge, and in the process, departed from the distinctionbetween "direct" and "indirect" effects on interstate com-merce.Id., at 36-38 ("The question [of the scope of Con-gress' power] is necessarily one of degree"). The Court heldthat intrastate activities that "have such a close and substan-tial relation to interstate commerce that their control isessential or appropriate to protect that commerce fromburdens and obstructions" are within Congress' power toregulate. Id., at 37.InUnited States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941), the Courtupheld the Fair Labor Standards Act, stating:"The power of Congress over interstate commerce is notconfined to the regulation of commerce among thestates. It extends to those activities intrastate whichso affect interstate commerce or the exercise of thepower of Congress over it as to make regulation of themappropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end,the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regu-late interstate commerce." Id., at 118.514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT556 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZOpinion of the CourtSee also United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co., 315 U. S.110, 119 (1942) (the commerce power "extends to those intrastate activities which in a substantial way interfere with orobstruct the exercise of the granted power").In Wickard v. Filburn, the Court upheld the applicationof amendments to the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938to the production and consumption of homegrown wheat.317 U. S., at 128-129. The Wickard Court explicitly re-jected earlier distinctions between direct and indirect effectson interstate commerce, stating:"[E]ven if appellee's activity be local and though it maynot be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever itsnature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantialeconomic effect on interstate commerce, and this irre-spective of whether such effect is what might at someearlier time have been defined as `direct' or `indirect.' "Id., at 125.The Wickard Court emphasized that although Filburn's owncontribution to the demand for wheat may have been trivialby itself, that was not "enough to remove him from the scopeof federal regulation where, as here, his contribution, takentogether with that of many others similarly situated, is farfrom trivial."Id., at 127-128.Jones & Laughlin Steel, Darby, and Wickard ushered inan era of Commerce Clause jurisprudence that greatly ex-panded the previously defined authority of Congress underthat Clause. In part, this was a recognition of the greatchanges that had occurred in the way business was carriedon in this country. Enterprises that had once been local orat most regional in nature had become national in scope.But the doctrinal change also reflected a view that earlierCommerce Clause cases artificially had constrained the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce.But even these modern-era precedents which have expanded congressional power under the Commerce Clause514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT557Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)Opinion of the Courtconfirm that this power is subject to outer limits. InJones & Laughlin Steel, the Court warned that the scope ofthe interstate commerce power "must be considered in thelight of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce soindirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of ourcomplex society, would effectually obliterate the distinctionbetween what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government." 301 U. S., at 37; see alsoDarby, supra, at 119-120 (Congress may regulate intrastateactivity that has a "substantial effect" on interstate commerce); Wickard, supra, at 125 (Congress may regulate activity that "exerts a substantial economic effect on interstatecommerce"). Since that time, the Court has heeded thatwarning and undertaken to decide whether a rational basisexisted for concluding that a regulated activity sufficientlyaffected interstate commerce. See, e. g., Hodel v. VirginiaSurface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264,276-280 (1981); Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 155-156(1971); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 299-301 (1964);Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241,252-253 (1964).2Similarly, in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), theCourt reaffirmed that "the power to regulate commerce,though broad indeed, has limits" that "[t]he Court has amplepower" to enforce. Id., at 196, overruled on other grounds,National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976),overruled by Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit2 See also Hodel, 452 U. S., at 311 ("[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commercedoes not necessarily make it so") (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment);Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 273 ("[W]hether particular operationsaffect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutionalpower of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than alegislative question, and can be settled finally only by this Court") (Black,J., concurring).514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT558 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZOpinion of the CourtAuthority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). In response to the dissent'swarnings that the Court was powerless to enforce the limitations on Congress' commerce powers because "[a]ll activitiesaffecting commerce, even in the minutest degree,[Wickard],may be regulated and controlled by Congress," 392 U. S., at204 (Douglas, J., dissenting), the Wirtz Court replied thatthe dissent had misread precedent as "[n]either here nor inWickard has the Court declared that Congress may use arelatively trivial impact on commerce as an excuse for broadgeneral regulation of state or private activities," id., at 197,n. 27. Rather, "[t]he Court has said only that wherea general regulatory statute bears a substantial relation to commerce, the de minimis character of individual instances arising under that statute is of no consequence." Ibid. (firstemphasis added).Consistent with this structure, we have identified threebroad categories of activity that Congress may regulateunder its commerce power. Perez, supra, at 150; see alsoHodel, supra, at 276-277. First, Congress may regulate theuse of the channels of interstate commerce. See, e. g.,Darby, 312 U. S., at 114; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at256 (" `[T]he authority of Congress to keep the channels ofinterstate commerce free from immoral and injurious useshas been frequently sustained, and is no longer open to question' " (quoting Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S. 470, 491(1917))). Second, Congress is empowered to regulate andprotect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though thethreat may come only from intrastate activities. See, e. g.,Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914); Southern R. Co.v. United States, 222 U. S. 20 (1911) (upholding amendmentsto Safety Appliance Act as applied to vehicles used in intrastate commerce); Perez, supra, at 150 ("[F]or example, thedestruction of an aircraft (18 U. S. C. $ 32), or . . . thefts frominterstate shipments (18 U. S. C. $ 659)"). Finally, Congress'commerce authority includes the power to regulate those ac514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT559Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)Opinion of the Courttivities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce,Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 37, i. e., those activitiesthat substantially affect interstate commerce, Wirtz, supra,at 196, n. 27.Within this final category, admittedly, our case law has notbeen clear whether an activity must "affect" or "substan-tially affect" interstate commerce in order to be withinCongress' power to regulate it under the Commerce Clause.ComparePreseault v. ICC, 494 U. S. 1, 17 (1990), with Wirtz,supra, at 196, n. 27 (the Court has never declared that "Con-gress may use a relatively trivial impact on commerce asan excuse for broad general regulation of state or privateactivities"). We conclude, consistent with the great weightof our case law, that the proper test requires an analysis ofwhether the regulated activity "substantially affects" interstate commerce.We now turn to consider the power of Congress, in thelight of this framework, to enact $ 922(q). The first two categories of authority may be quickly disposed of: $ 922(q) is nota regulation of the use of the channels of interstate commerce, nor is it an attempt to prohibit the interstate transportation of a commodity through the channels of commerce;nor can $ 922(q) be justified as a regulation by which Congress has sought to protect an instrumentality of interstatecommerce or a thing in interstate commerce. Thus, if$ 922(q) is to be sustained, it must be under the third category as a regulation of an activity that substantially affectsinterstate commerce.First, we have upheld a wide variety of congressional Actsregulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstatecommerce. Examples include the regulation of intrastatecoal mining; Hodel, supra, intrastate extortionate credittransactions, Perez, supra, restaurants utilizing substantialinterstate supplies, McClung, supra, inns and hotels cateringto interstate guests, Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, and pro514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT560 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZOpinion of the Courtduction and consumption of homegrown wheat, Wickard v.Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942). These examples are by nomeans exhaustive, but the pattern is clear. Where economicactivity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislationregulating that activity will be sustained.EvenWickard, which is perhaps the most far reaching ex-ample of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity,involved economic activity in a way that the possession of agun in a school zone does not. Roscoe Filburn operated asmall farm in Ohio, on which, in the year involved, he raised23 acres of wheat. It was his practice to sow winter wheatin the fall, and after harvesting it in July to sell a portion ofthe crop, to feed part of it to poultry and livestock on thefarm, to use some in making flour for home consumption,and to keep the remainder for seeding future crops. TheSecretary of Agriculture assessed a penalty against himunder the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 because heharvested about 12 acres more wheat than his allotmentunder the Act permitted. The Act was designed to regulatethe volume of wheat moving in interstate and foreign com-merce in order to avoid surpluses and shortages, and concomitant fluctuation in wheat prices, which had previouslyobtained. The Court said, in an opinion sustaining the application of the Act to Filburn's activity:"One of the primary purposes of the Act in question wasto increase the market price of wheat and to that end tolimit the volume thereof that could affect the market.It can hardly be denied that a factor of such volume andvariability as home-consumed wheat would have a sub-stantial influence on price and market conditions. Thismay arise because being in marketable condition suchwheat overhangs the market and, if induced by risingprices, tends to flow into the market and check priceincreases. But if we assume that it is never marketed,it supplies a need of the man who grew it which wouldotherwise be reflected by purchases in the open market.514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT561Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)Opinion of the CourtHome-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheatin commerce." 317 U. S., at 128.Section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms hasnothing to do with "commerce" or any sort of economicenterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.3Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulationof economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme couldbe undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.It cannot, therefore, be sustained under our cases upholdingregulations of activities that arise out of or are connectedwith a commercial transaction, which viewed in the aggre-gate, substantially affects interstate commerce.Second, $ 922(q) contains no jurisdictional element whichwould ensure, through case-by-case inquiry, that the firearmpossession in question affects interstate commerce. For ex-ample, inUnited States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336 (1971), theCourt interpreted former 18 U. S. C. $ 1202(a), which made it3 Under our federal system, the " `States possess primary authority fordefining and enforcing the criminal law.' " Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507U. S. 619, 635 (1993) (quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128 (1982)); seealso Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 109 (1945) (plurality opinion)("Our national government is one of delegated powers alone. Under ourfederal system the administration of criminal justice rests with the Statesexcept as Congress, acting within the scope of those delegated powers,has created offenses against the United States"). When Congress criminalizes conduct already denounced as criminal by the States, it effectsa " `change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminaljurisdiction.' " United States v. Enmons, 410 U. S. 396, 411-412 (1973)(quoting United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971)). The Government acknowledges that $ 922(q) "displace[s] state policy choices in . . . thatits prohibitions apply even in States that have chosen not to outlaw theconduct in question." Brief for United States 29, n. 18; see also Statement of President George Bush on Signing the Crime Control Act of 1990,26 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1944, 1945 (Nov. 29, 1990) ("Most egregiously, section [922(q)] inappropriately overrides legitimate State firearms laws with a new and unnecessary Federal law. The policies reflected in these provisions could legitimately be adopted by the States,but they should not be imposed upon the States by the Congress").514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT562 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZOpinion of the Courta crime for a felon to "receiv[e], posses[s], or transpor[t] incommerce or affecting commerce . . . any firearm." 404U. S., at 337. The Court interpreted the possession compo-nent of $ 1202(a) to require an additional nexus to interstatecommerce both because the statute was ambiguous and because "unless Congress conveys its purpose clearly, it willnot be deemed to have significantly changed the federal-statebalance." Id., at 349. The Bass Court set aside the convic-tion because, although the Government had demonstratedthat Bass had possessed a firearm, it had failed "to showthe requisite nexus with interstate commerce."Id., at 347.The Court thus interpreted the statute to reserve the constitutional question whether Congress could regulate, withoutmore, the "mere possession" of firearms. See id., at 339,n. 4; see also United States v. Five Gambling Devices, 346U. S. 441, 448 (1953) (plurality opinion) ("The principle is oldand deeply imbedded in our jurisprudence that this Courtwill construe a statute in a manner that requires decision ofserious constitutional questions only if the statutory language leaves no reasonable alternative"). Unlike the statute in Bass, $ 922(q) has no express jurisdictional elementwhich might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have an explicit connection with oreffect on interstate commerce.Although as part of our independent evaluation of constitutionality under the Commerce Clause we of course consider legislative findings, and indeed even congressional committee findings, regarding effect on interstate commerce,see, e. g., Preseault v. ICC, 494 U. S., at 17, the Governmentconcedes that "[n]either the statute nor its legislative historycontain[s] express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a schoolzone." Brief for United States 5-6. We agree with theGovernment that Congress normally is not required to makeformal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activityhas on interstate commerce. See McClung, 379 U. S., at 304;514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT563Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)Opinion of the Courtsee also Perez, 402 U. S., at 156 ("Congress need [not] makeparticularized findings in order to legislate"). But to theextent that congressional findings would enable us to evalu-ate the legislative judgment that the activity in questionsubstantially affected interstate commerce, even though nosuch substantial effect was visible to the naked eye, they arelacking here.4The Government argues that Congress has accumulatedinstitutional expertise regarding the regulation of firearmsthrough previous enactments. Cf.Fullilove v. Klutznick,448 U. S. 448, 503 (1980) (Powell, J., concurring). We agree,however, with the Fifth Circuit that importation of previousfindings to justify $ 922(q) is especially inappropriate herebecause the "prior federal enactments or Congressionalfindings [do not] speak to the subject matter of section 922(q)or its relationship to interstate commerce. Indeed, section922(q) plows thoroughly new ground and represents a sharpbreak with the long-standing pattern of federal firearms leg-islation." 2 F. 3d, at 1366.The Government's essential contention, in fine, is that wemay determine here that $ 922(q) is valid because possessionof a firearm in a local school zone does indeed substantiallyaffect interstate commerce. Brief for United States 17.The Government argues that possession of a firearm in aschool zone may result in violent crime and that violentcrime can be expected to affect the functioning of the na-tional economy in two ways. First, the costs of violent4 We note that on September 13, 1994, President Clinton signed into lawthe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L.103-322, 108 Stat. 1796. Section 320904 of that Act, id., at 2125, amends$ 922(q) to include congressional findings regarding the effects of firearmpossession in and around schools upon interstate and foreign commerce.The Government does not rely upon these subsequent findings as a substitute for the absence of findings in the first instance. Tr. of Oral Arg. 25("[W]e're not relying on them in the strict sense of the word, but we thinkthat at a very minimum they indicate that reasons can be identified forwhy Congress wanted to regulate this particular activity").514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT564 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZOpinion of the Courtcrime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insur-ance, those costs are spread throughout the population. SeeUnited States v. Evans, 928 F. 2d 858, 862 (CA9 1991). Sec-ond, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals totravel to areas within the country that are perceived to beunsafe. Cf. Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 253. TheGovernment also argues that the presence of guns in schoolsposes a substantial threat to the educational process bythreatening the learning environment. A handicapped educational process, in turn, will result in a less productive citi-zenry. That, in turn, would have an adverse effect on theNation's economic well-being. As a result, the Governmentargues that Congress could rationally have concluded that$ 922(q) substantially affects interstate commerce.We pause to consider the implications of the Government'sarguments. The Government admits, under its "costs ofcrime" reasoning, that Congress could regulate not only allviolent crime, but all activities that might lead to violentcrime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstatecommerce. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8-9. Similarly, under theGovernment's "national productivity" reasoning, Congresscould regulate any activity that it found was related to theeconomic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example.Under the theories that the Government presents in supportof $ 922(q), it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federalpower, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement oreducation where States historically have been sovereign.Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments, weare hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual thatCongress is without power to regulate.Although Justice Breyer argues that acceptance of theGovernment's rationales would not authorize a general federal police power, he is unable to identify any activity thatthe States may regulate but Congress may not. JusticeBreyer posits that there might be some limitations on Con514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT565Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)Opinion of the Courtgress' commerce power, such as family law or certain aspectsof education.Post, at 624. These suggested limitations,when viewed in light of the dissent's expansive analysis, aredevoid of substance.Justice Breyer focuses, for the most part, on the threatthat firearm possession in and near schools poses to the edu-cational process and the potential economic consequencesflowing from that threat. Post, at 619-624. Specifically,the dissent reasons that (1) gun-related violence is a seriousproblem; (2) that problem, in turn, has an adverse effect onclassroom learning; and (3) that adverse effect on classroomlearning, in turn, represents a substantial threat to trade andcommerce. Post, at 623. This analysis would be equallyapplicable, if not more so, to subjects such as family law anddirect regulation of education.For instance, if Congress can, pursuant to its CommerceClause power, regulate activities that adversely affect thelearning environment, then, a fortiori, it also can regulatethe educational process directly. Congress could determinethat a school's curriculum has a "significant" effect on theextent of classroom learning. As a result, Congress couldmandate a federal curriculum for local elementary and secondary schools because what is taught in local schools has asignificant "effect on classroom learning," cf. ibid., and that,in turn, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce.Justice Breyer rejects our reading of precedent and argues that "Congress . . . could rationally conclude thatschools fall on the commercial side of the line." Post, at 629.Again, Justice Breyer's rationale lacks any real limits because, depending on the level of generality, any activity canbe looked upon as commercial. Under the dissent's rationale, Congress could just as easily look at child rearing as"fall[ing] on the commercial side of the line" because it provides a "valuable service--namely, to equip [children] withthe skills they need to survive in life and, more specifically,in the workplace." Ibid. We do not doubt that Congress514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT566 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZOpinion of the Courthas authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate nu-merous commercial activities that substantially affect interstate commerce and also affect the educational process.That authority, though broad, does not include the authorityto regulate each and every aspect of local schools.Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activityis commercial or noncommercial may in some cases resultin legal uncertainty. But, so long as Congress' authority islimited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, andso long as those enumerated powers are interpreted as hav-ing judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender "legaluncertainty."Post, at 630. As Chief Justice Marshallstated in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819):"Th[e] [federal] government is acknowledged by all tobe one of enumerated powers. The principle, that it canexercise only the powers granted to it . . . is now universally admitted. But the question respecting the extentof the powers actually granted, is perpetually arising,and will probably continue to arise, as long as our system shall exist." Id., at 405.See also Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 195 ("The enumera-tion presupposes something not enumerated"). The Constitution mandates this uncertainty by withholding from Congress a plenary police power that would authorize enactmentof every type of legislation. See Art. I, $ 8. Congress hasoperated within this framework of legal uncertainty eversince this Court determined that it was the Judiciary's duty"to say what the law is." Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch137, 177 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.). Any possible benefit fromeliminating this "legal uncertainty" would be at the expenseof the Constitution's system of enumerated powers.In Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 37, we held thatthe question of congressional power under the CommerceClause "is necessarily one of degree." To the same effect514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT567Cite as: 514 U. S. 549 (1995)Opinion of the Courtis the concurring opinion of Justice Cardozo in SchechterPoultry:"There is a view of causation that would obliterate thedistinction between what is national and what is local inthe activities of commerce. Motion at the outer rim iscommunicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recording instruments at the center. A society such as ours`is an elastic medium which transmits all tremorsthroughout its territory; the only question is of theirsize.' " 295 U. S., at 554 (quotingUnited States v.A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp., 76 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA21935) (L. Hand, J., concurring)).These are not precise formulations, and in the nature ofthings they cannot be. But we think they point the way toa correct decision of this case. The possession of a gun in alocal school zone is in no sense an economic activity thatmight, through repetition elsewhere, substantially affect anysort of interstate commerce. Respondent was a local stu-dent at a local school; there is no indication that he had recently moved in interstate commerce, and there is no re-quirement that his possession of the firearm have anyconcrete tie to interstate commerce.To uphold the Government's contentions here, we wouldhave to pile inference upon inference in a manner that wouldbid fair to convert congressional authority under the Com-merce Clause to a general police power of the sort retainedby the States. Admittedly, some of our prior cases havetaken long steps down that road, giving great deference tocongressional action. See supra, at 556-558. The broadlanguage in these opinions has suggested the possibility ofadditional expansion, but we decline here to proceed any further. To do so would require us to conclude that the Constitution's enumeration of powers does not presuppose something not enumerated, cf. Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, at 195,and that there never will be a distinction between what is514us3$52H 05-27-98 16:48:04 PAGES OPINPGT568 UNITED STATES v. LOPEZKennedy, J., concurringtruly national and what is truly local, cf. Jones & LaughlinSteel, supra, at 30. This we are unwilling to do.For the foregoing reasons the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is
