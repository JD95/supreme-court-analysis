The United States instituted civil forfeiture proceedings against the house, alleging that the property wassubject to forfeiture under 84 Stat. 1276, as amended, 21U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7), because it had been used for several yearsto facilitate the unlawful processing and distribution of a controlled substance. Ursery ultimately paid the United States$13,250 to settle the forfeiture claim in full. Shortly beforethe settlement was consummated, Ursery was indicted formanufacturing marijuana, in violation of $ 841(a)(1). A juryfound him guilty, and he was sentenced to 63 months inprison.The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit by a dividedvote reversed Ursery's criminal conviction, holding that theconviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the FifthAmendment of the United States Constitution. 59 F. 3d 568(1995). The court based its conclusion in part upon its beliefthat our decisions inUnited States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435(1989), andAustin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993),meant that any civil forfeiture under $ 881(a)(7) constitutespunishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.Ursery, in the court's view, had therefore been "punished" inthe forfeiture proceeding against his property, and could notbe subsequently criminally tried for violation of 21 U. S. C.$ 841(a)(1).No. 95-346: Following a jury trial, Charles Wesley Arltand James Wren were convicted of: conspiracy to aid andabet the manufacture of methamphetamine, in violation of 21U. S. C. $ 846; conspiracy to launder monetary instruments,in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 371; and numerous counts ofmoney laundering, in violation of $ 1956. The District Court518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT272 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the Courtsentenced Arlt to life in prison and a 10-year term of super-vised release, and imposed a fine of $250,000. Wren wassentenced to life imprisonment and a 5-year term of super-vised release.Before the criminal trial had started, the United Stateshad filed a civil in rem complaint against various propertyseized from, or titled to, Arlt and Wren, or Payback Mines,a corporation controlled by Arlt. The complaint allegedthat each piece of property was subject to forfeiture bothunder 18 U. S. C. $ 981(a)(1)(A), which provides that "[a]nyproperty . . . involved in a transaction or attempted transaction in violation of " $ 1956 (the money-laundering statute)"is subject to forfeiture to the United States"; and under 21U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6), which provides for the forfeiture of (i)"[a]ll . . . things of value furnished or intended to be furnishedby any person in exchange for" illegal drugs, (ii) "all proceeds traceable to such an exchange," and (iii) "all moneys,negotiable instruments, and securities used or intended to beused to facilitate" a federal drug felony. The parties agreedto defer litigation of the forfeiture action during the criminal prosecution. More than a year after the conclusion ofthe criminal trial, the District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment in the civil forfeitureproceeding.Arlt and Wren appealed the decision in the forfeiture action, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the forfeiture violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. 33 F. 3d 1210 (1994), amended 56 F. 3d 41(1995). The court's decision was based in part upon thesame view as that expressed by the Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit in Ursery's case--that our decisions in Halper,supra, and Austin, supra, meant that, as a categorical matter, forfeitures under $$ 981(a)(1)(A) and 881(a)(6) alwaysconstitute "punishment."We granted the Government's petition for certiorari ineach of the two cases, and we now reverse. 516 U. S. 1070(1996).518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT273Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIIThe Double Jeopardy Clause provides: "[N]or shall anyperson be subject for the same offence to be twice putin jeopardy of life or limb." U. S. Const., Amdt. 5. TheClause serves the function of preventing both "successivepunishments and . . . successive prosecutions." UnitedStates v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 696 (1993), citing North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969). The protection againstmultiple punishments prohibits the Government from " `punishing twice, or attempting a second time to punish criminally for the same offense.' " Witte v. United States, 515U. S. 389, 396 (1995) (emphasis deleted), quoting Helvering v.Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938).In the decisions that we review, the Courts of Appeals heldthat the civil forfeitures constituted "punishment," makingthem subject to the prohibitions of the Double JeopardyClause. The Government challenges that characterizationof the forfeitures, arguing that the courts were wrong toconclude that civil forfeitures are punitive for double jeopardy purposes.11 The Government raises three other challenges to the decisions that wereview. First, focusing on the decision of the Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit in No. 95-345, the Government contends that the DoubleJeopardy Clause applies only to prohibit a punishment imposed followinga "jeopardy," and that a civil forfeiture, regardless whether it is a "punishment," is not a "jeopardy." Thus, because Ursery had not been placed in"jeopardy" in the civil forfeiture proceeding against his house, the DoubleJeopardy Clause was inapplicable to his criminal prosecution. Second,the Government argues that the civil forfeiture of property is not the sameoffense as a criminal prosecution, and therefore that the double jeopardyprotection against multiple punishments for the same offense is not atissue here. Finally, the Government argues that a civil forfeiture actionthat is parallel and contemporaneous with a criminal prosecution shouldbe deemed to constitute a single proceeding within the meaning of theDouble Jeopardy Clause.Because we conclude that the civil forfeitures involved in these cases donot constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause, see infra,at 292, we do not address those three arguments in this opinion.518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT274 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the CourtASince the earliest years of this Nation, Congress has au-thorized the Government to seek parallelin rem civil forfeit-ure actions and criminal prosecutions based upon the sameunderlying events. See, e. g., Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, $ 12,1 Stat. 39 (goods unloaded at night or without a permit subject to forfeiture and persons unloading subject to criminalprosecution); $ 25, id., at 43 (persons convicted of buying orconcealing illegally imported goods subject to both monetaryfine andin rem forfeiture of the goods); $ 34, id., at 46 (impos-ing criminal penalty and in rem forfeiture where person convicted of relanding goods entitled to drawback); see also ThePalmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14-15 (1827) ("Many cases exist,where there is both a forfeiture in rem and a personal pen-alty"); cf. Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416U. S. 663, 683 (1974) (discussing adoption of forfeiture stat-utes by early Congresses). And, in a long line of cases, thisCourt has considered the application of the Double JeopardyClause to civil forfeitures, consistently concluding that theClause does not apply to such actions because they do notimpose punishment.One of the first cases to consider the relationship betweenthe Double Jeopardy Clause and civil forfeiture wasVariousItems of Personal Property v. United States, 282 U. S. 577(1931). In Various Items, the Waterloo Distilling Corporation had been ordered to forfeit a distillery, warehouse, anddenaturing plant, on the ground that the corporation hadconducted its distilling business in violation of federal law.The Government conceded that the corporation had beenconvicted of criminal violations prior to the initiation of theforfeiture proceeding, and admitted that the criminal conviction had been based upon "the transactions set forth . . .as a basis for the forfeiture."Id., at 579. Considering thecorporation's argument that the forfeiture action violated theDouble Jeopardy Clause, this Court unanimously held thatthe Clause was inapplicable to civil forfeiture actions:518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT275Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the Court"[This] forfeiture proceeding . . . is in rem. It is theproperty which is proceeded against, and, by resort to alegal fiction, held guilty and condemned as though itwere conscious instead of inanimate and insentient. Ina criminal prosecution it is the wrongdoer in person whois proceeded against, convicted, and punished.The for-feiture is no part of the punishment for the criminaloffense. The provision of the Fifth Amendment to theConstitution in respect of double jeopardy does notapply." Id., at 581 (citations omitted; emphasis added).In reaching its conclusion, the Court drew a sharp distinc-tion betweenin rem civil forfeitures and in personam civilpenalties such as fines: Though the latter could, in some circumstances, be punitive, the former could not. Ibid. Re-ferring to a case that was decided the same day as VariousItems, the Court made its point absolutely clear:"In United States v. La Franca, [282 U. S.] 568, we holdthat, under $ 5 of the Willis-Campbell Act, a civil actionto recover taxes, which in fact are penalties, is punitivein character and barred by a prior conviction of the defendant for a criminal offense involving the same trans-actions. This, however, is not that case, but a proceeding in rem to forfeit property used in committing anoffense." Id., at 580.Had the Court in Various Items found that a civil forfeit-ure could constitute a "punishment" under the Fifth Amendment, its holding would have been quite remarkable. Asthat Court recognized, "[a]t common law, in many cases, theright of forfeiture did not attach until the offending personhad been convicted and the record of conviction produced."Ibid. In other words, at common law, not only was it thecase that a criminal conviction did notbar a civil forfeiture,but, in fact, the civil forfeiture could not be instituted unlessa criminal conviction had already been obtained. Thoughthis Court had held that common-law rule inapplicable where518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT276 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the Courtthe right of forfeiture was "created by statute, in rem, cogni-zable on the revenue side of the exchequer,"The Palmyra,supra, at 14, it never had suggested that the Constitutionprohibited for statutory civil forfeiture what was requiredfor common-law civil forfeiture. For the Various ItemsCourt to have held that the forfeiture was prohibited by theprior criminal proceeding would have been directly contraryto the common-law rule, and would have called into questionthe constitutionality of forfeiture statutes thought constitutional for over a century. See United States v. CurtissWright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 327-328 (1936) (Evidenceof a longstanding legislative practice "goes a long way in thedirection of proving the presence of unassailable ground forthe constitutionality of the practice").Following its decision in Various Items, the Court did notconsider another double jeopardy case involving a civil forfeiture for 40 years. Then, in One Lot Emerald Cut Stonesv. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per curiam), theCourt's brief opinion reaffirmed the rule of Various Items.In Emerald Cut Stones, after having been acquitted ofsmuggling jewels into the United States, the owner of thejewels intervened in a proceeding to forfeit them as contraband. We rejected the owner's double jeopardy challengeto the forfeiture, holding that "[i]f for no other reason, theforfeiture is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of theFifth Amendment because it involves neither two criminaltrials nor two criminal punishments." 409 U. S., at 235.Noting that the forfeiture provisions had been codified separately from parallel criminal provisions, the Court determined that the forfeiture clearly was "a civil sanction." Id.,at 236. The forfeitures were not criminal punishments because they did not impose a second in personam penalty forthe criminal defendant's wrongdoing.In our most recent decision considering whether a civilforfeiture constitutes punishment under the Double JeopardyClause, we again affirmed the rule of Various Items. In518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT277Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the CourtUnited States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S.354 (1984), the owner of the defendant weapons was acquitted of charges of dealing firearms without a license. TheGovernment then brought a forfeiture action against thefirearms under 18 U. S. C. $ 924(d), alleging that they wereused or were intended to be used in violation of federal law.In another unanimous decision, we held that the forfeiturewas not barred by the prior criminal proceeding. We beganour analysis by stating the rule for our decision:"Unless the forfeiture sanction was intended as punishment, so that the proceeding is essentially criminal incharacter, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable.The question, then, is whether a $ 924(d) forfeiture proceeding is intended to be, or by its nature necessarily is,criminal and punitive, or civil and remedial."89 Firearms, supra, at 362 (citations omitted).Our inquiry proceeded in two stages. In the first stage,we looked to Congress' intent, and concluded that "Congressdesigned forfeiture under $ 924(d) as a remedial civil sanction." 465 U. S., at 363. This conclusion was based uponseveral findings. First, noting that the forfeiture proceeding was in rem, we found it significant that "[a]ctions in remhave traditionally been viewed as civil proceedings, withjurisdiction dependent upon seizure of a physical object."Ibid., citing Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416U. S., at 684. Second, we found that the forfeiture provision,because it reached both weapons used in violation of federallaw and those "intended to be used" in such a manner,reached a broader range of conduct than its criminal analog.Third, we concluded that the civil forfeiture "further[ed]broad remedial aims," including both "discouraging unregulated commerce in firearms" and "removing from circulation firearms that have been used or intended for use outsideregulated channels of commerce." 89 Firearms, supra, at364.518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT278 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the CourtIn the second stage of our analysis, we looked to " `whetherthe statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose oreffect as to negate' Congress' intention to establish a civilremedial mechanism," 465 U. S., at 365, quoting UnitedStates v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980). Consideringseveral factors that we had used previously in order to determine whether a civil proceeding was so punitive as to requireapplication of the full panoply of constitutional protectionsrequired in a criminal trial, see id., at 248, we found only oneof those factors to be present in the $ 924(d) forfeiture. Byitself, however, the fact that the behavior proscribed by theforfeiture was already a crime proved insufficient to turn theforfeiture into a punishment subject to the Double JeopardyClause. Hence, we found that the gun owner had "failed toestablish by the `clearest proof ' that Congress has provideda sanction so punitive as to `transfor[m] what was clearlyintended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.' " 89Firearms, supra, at 366, quoting Rex Trailer Co. v. UnitedStates, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956). We concluded our decisionby restating that civil forfeiture is "not an additional penaltyfor the commission of a criminal act, but rather is a separatecivil sanction, remedial in nature." 89 Firearms, supra,at 366.BOur cases reviewing civil forfeitures under the DoubleJeopardy Clause adhere to a remarkably consistent theme.Though the two-part analytical construct employed in 89Firearms was more refined, perhaps, than that we had usedover 50 years earlier in Various Items, the conclusion wasthe same in each case: In rem civil forfeiture is a remedialcivil sanction, distinct from potentially punitive in personamcivil penalties such as fines, and does not constitute a punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause. See Gore v.United States, 357 U. S. 386, 392 (1958) ("In applying a provision like that of double jeopardy, which is rooted in history518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT279Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the Courtand is not an evolving concept . . . , a long course of adjudica-tion in this Court carries impressive authority").In the cases that we currently review, the Court of Ap-peals for the Ninth Circuit recognized as much, concludingthat after 89 Firearms, "the law was clear that civil forfeitures did not constitute `punishment' for double jeopardy pur-poses." 33 F. 3d, at 1218. Nevertheless, that court readthree of our decisions to have "abandoned" 89 Firearms andthe oft-affirmed rule ofVarious Items. According to theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, through our decisionsinUnited States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), Austin v.United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993), and Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994), we"changed [our] collective mind," and "adopted a new test fordetermining whether a nominally civil sanction constitutes`punishment' for double jeopardy purposes." 33 F. 3d, at1218-1219. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitshared the view of the Ninth Circuit, though it did not directly rely upon Kurth Ranch. We turn now to considerwhether Halper, Austin, and Kurth Ranch accomplished theradical jurisprudential shift perceived by the Courts ofAppeals.In Halper, we considered "whether and under what circumstances a civil penalty may constitute `punishment' forthe purposes of double jeopardy analysis." Halper, supra,at 436. Based upon his submission of 65 inflated Medicareclaims, each of which overcharged the Government by $9,Halper was criminally convicted of 65 counts of violating thefalse-claims statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 287 (1982 ed.), as well as of16 counts of mail fraud, and was sentenced to two years inprison and fined $5,000. Following that criminal conviction,the Government successfully brought a civil action againstHalper under 31 U. S. C. $ 3729 (1982 ed. and Supp. II). TheDistrict Court hearing the civil action determined thatHalper was liable to the Government for over $130,000 under$ 3729, which then provided for liability in the amount of518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT280 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the Court$2,000 per violation, double the Government's actual dam-ages, and court costs. The court concluded that imposingthe full civil penalty would constitute a second punishmentfor Halper's already-punished criminal offense, however, andtherefore reduced Halper's liability to double the actual damages suffered by the Government and the costs of the civilaction. The Government directly appealed that decision tothis Court.This Court agreed with the District Court's analysis. Wedetermined that our precedent had established no absoluteand irrebuttable rule that a civil fine cannot be "punishment"under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Though it was well established that "a civil remedy does not rise to the level of`punishment' merely because Congress provided for civil recovery in excess of the Government's actual damages," wefound that our case law did "not foreclose the possibility thatin a particular case a civil penalty . . . may be so extreme andso divorced from the Government's damages and expenses asto constitute punishment." 490 U. S., at 442. Emphasizingthe case-specific nature of our inquiry, id., at 448, we compared the size of the fine imposed on Halper, $130,000, to thedamages actually suffered by the Government as a result ofHalper's actions, estimated by the District Court at $585.Noting that the fine was more than 220 times greater thanthe Government's damages, we agreed with the DistrictCourt that "Halper's $130,000 liability is sufficiently disproportionate that the sanction constitutes a second punishmentin violation of double jeopardy." Id., at 452. We remandedto the District Court so that it could hear evidence regardingthe Government's actual damages, and could then reduceHalper's liability to a nonpunitive level. Ibid.In Austin, we considered whether a civil forfeiture couldviolate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that "[e]xcessivebail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed . . . ."Aware that Austin had sold two grams of cocaine the pre518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT281Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the Courtvious day, police searched his mobile home and body shop.Their search revealed small amounts of marijuana and cocaine, a handgun, drug paraphernalia, and almost $5,000 incash. Austin was charged with one count of possessingcocaine with intent to distribute, to which he pleaded guilty.The Government then initiated a civil forfeiture proceedingagainst Austin's mobile home and auto shop, contending thatthey had been "used" or were "intended for use" in the com-mission of a drug offense. See 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and(a)(7). Austin contested the forfeiture on the ground of theExcessive Fines Clause, but the District Court and theCourt of Appeals held the forfeiture constitutional.We limited our review to the question "whether the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment applies to forfeitures of property under 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)."Austin, supra, at 604. We began our analysis by rejectingthe argument that the Excessive Fines Clause was limitedsolely to criminal proceedings: The relevant question was notwhether a particular proceeding was criminal or civil, wedetermined, but rather was whether forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) constituted "punishment" for the purposes ofthe Eighth Amendment. Austin, supra, at 610. In an effort to answer that question, we briefly reviewed the historyof civil forfeiture both in this country and in England, see509 U. S., at 611-618, taking a categorical approach that contrasted sharply with Halper's case-specific approach to determining whether a civil penalty constitutes punishment.Ultimately, we concluded that "forfeiture under [$$ 881(a)(4)and (a)(7)] constitutes `payment to a sovereign as punishmentfor some offense,' and, as such, is subject to the limitationsof the Eighth Amendment's Excessive Fines Clause." 509U. S., at 622 (citation omitted).In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch,supra, we considered whether a state tax imposed on marijuana was invalid under the Double Jeopardy Clause whenthe taxpayer had already been criminally convicted of own518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT282 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the Courting the marijuana that was taxed. We first established thatthe fact that Montana had labeled the civil sanction a "tax"did not end our analysis. We then turned to considerwhether the tax was so punitive as to constitute a punishment subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Several dif-ferences between the marijuana tax imposed by Montanaand the typical revenue-raising tax were readily apparent.The Montana tax was unique in that it was conditioned onthe commission of a crime and was imposed only after thetaxpayer had been arrested: Thus, only a person chargedwith a criminal offense was subject to the tax. We alsonoted that the taxpayer did not own or possess the taxedmarijuana at the time that the tax was imposed. Fromthese differences, we determined that the tax was motivatedby a " `penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gatheringof revenue.' " Id., at 781. Concluding that the Montana taxproceeding "was the functional equivalent of a successivecriminal prosecution," we affirmed the Court of Appeals'judgment barring the tax. Id., at 784.We think that the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitand the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit misreadHalper, Austin, and Kurth Ranch. None of those decisionspurported to overrule the well-established teaching of Various Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms. Halperinvolved not a civil forfeiture, but a civil penalty. That itsrule was limited to the latter context is clear from the deci-sion itself, from the historical distinction that we have drawnbetween civil forfeiture and civil penalties, and from thepractical difficulty of applyingHalper to a civil forfeiture.In Halper, we emphasized that our decision was limited tothe context of civil penalties:"What we announce now is a rule for the rare case, thecase such as the one before us, wherea fixed-penaltyprovision subjects a prolific but small-gauge offender toa sanction overwhelmingly disproportionate to the dam-ages he has caused. The rule is one of reason: Where a518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT283Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the Courtdefendant previously has sustained a criminal penaltyand the civil penalty sought in the subsequent proceeding bears no rational relation to the goal of compensat-ing the Government for its loss, but rather appears toqualify as `punishment' in the plain meaning of the word,then the defendant is entitled to an accounting of theGovernment's damages and costs to determine if thepenalty sought in fact constitutes a second punishment."490 U. S., at 449-450 (emphasis added).The narrow focus of Halper followed from the distinctionthat we have drawn historically between civil forfeiture andcivil penalties. Since at least Various Items, we have dis-tinguished civil penalties such as fines from civil forfeitureproceedings that are in rem. While a "civil action to re-cover . . . penaltie[s] is punitive in character," and much likea criminal prosecution in that "it is the wrongdoer in personwho is proceeded against . . . and punished," in anin remforfeiture proceeding, "[i]t is the property which is proceeded against, and by resort to a legal fiction, held guiltyand condemned." Various Items, 282 U. S., at 580-581.Thus, though for double jeopardy purposes we have neverbalanced the value of property forfeited in a particular caseagainst the harm suffered by the Government in that case,we have balanced the size of a particular civil penalty againstthe Government's harm. See, e. g., Rex Trailer Co. v.United States, 350 U. S., at 154 (fines not "so unreasonableor excessive" as to transform a civil remedy into a criminalpenalty); United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537(1943) (fine of $315,000 not so disproportionate to Government's harm of $101,500 as to transform the fine into punish-ment). Indeed, the rule set forth inHalper developed fromthe teaching of Rex Trailer and Hess. See Halper, supra,at 445-447.It is difficult to see how the rule of Halper could be appliedto a civil forfeiture. Civil penalties are designed as a roughform of "liquidated damages" for the harms suffered by the518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT284 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the CourtGovernment as a result of a defendant's conduct. See RexTrailer, supra, at 153-154. The civil penalty involved inHalper, for example, provided for a fixed monetary penaltyfor each false claim count on which the defendant was convicted in the criminal proceeding. Whether a "fixed-penaltyprovision" that seeks to compensate the Government forharm it has suffered is "so extreme" and "so divorced" fromthe penalty's nonpunitive purpose of compensating the Government as to be a punishment may be determined by bal-ancing the Government's harm against the size of the penalty. Civil forfeitures, in contrast to civil penalties, aredesigned to do more than simply compensate the Government. Forfeitures serve a variety of purposes, but are de-signed primarily to confiscate property used in violation ofthe law, and to require disgorgement of the fruits of illegalconduct. Though it may be possible to quantify the value ofthe property forfeited, it is virtually impossible to quantify,even approximately, the nonpunitive purposes served by aparticular civil forfeiture. Hence, it is practically difficult todetermine whether a particular forfeiture bears no rationalrelationship to the nonpunitive purposes of that forfeiture.Quite simply, the case-by-case balancing test set forth inHalper, in which a court must compare the harm suffered bythe Government against the size of the penalty imposed, isinapplicable to civil forfeiture.22 Justice Stevens' dissent is grounded in the different interpretationthat he gives Halper. He finds that Halper announced "two differentrules": a general rule, applicable to all civil sanctions, useful for determining whether a sanction is "of a punitive character"; and a "narrower rule,"similar to our understanding of the case, that requires "an accounting ofthe Government's damages and costs." Post, at 308. Justice Stevensfaults us in these cases for failing to apply the "general rule" of Halper.The problem with Justice Stevens' interpretation of Halper, ofcourse, and therefore with his entire argument, is that Halper did notannounce two rules. Nowhere in Halper does the Court set forth twodistinct rules or purport to apply a two-step analysis. Justice Stevensfinds his "general rule" in a dictum from Halper: " `[A] civil sanction that518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT285Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the CourtWe recognized as much in Kurth Ranch. In that case, theCourt expressly disclaimed reliance upon Halper, findingthat its case-specific approach was impossible to apply out-side the context of a fixed civil-penalty provision. Reviewing the Montana marijuana tax, we held that because "taxcannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather canonly be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes,is punishment.' " Post, at 306, quoting United States v. Halper, 490 U. S.435, 448 (1989). But the discussion immediately following that dictummakes clear that it states not a new and separate test for whether a sanction is a punishment, but rather only a rephrasing of Justice Stevens'"narrower" rule, i. e., the rule requiring an "accounting of the Government's damages and costs." Id., at 449."We therefore hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendantwho already has been punished . . . may not be subjected to an additionalcivil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly becharacterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution."We acknowledge that this inquiry will not be an exact pursuit. In ourdecided cases we have noted that the precise amount of the Government'sdamages and costs may prove to be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain.. . . [I]t would be difficult if not impossible in many cases for a court todetermine the precise dollar figure at which a civil sanction has accomplished its remedial purpose of making the Government whole, but beyondwhich the sanction takes on the quality of punishment." Id., at 448-449(emphasis added); see also id., at 449-451.The "general rule" discovered by Justice Stevens in Halper wouldsupplant, not mimic, see post, at 306, the rule of United States v. OneAssortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984), and One Lot EmeraldCut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972). Whether a particularsanction "cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose" is aninquiry radically different from that we have traditionally employed inorder to determine whether, as a categorical matter, a civil sanction issubject to the Double Jeopardy Clause. Yet nowhere in Halper does theCourt purport to make such a sweeping change in the law, instead emphasizing repeatedly the narrow scope of its decision. Halper, supra, at 449(announcing rule for "the rare case"). If the "general rule" of JusticeStevens were applied literally, then virtually every sanction would bedeclared to be a punishment: It is hard to imagine a sanction that has nopunitive aspect whatsoever. Justice Stevens' interpretation of Halperis both contrary to the decision itself and would create an unworkable ruleinconsistent with well-established precedent.518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT286 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the Courtstatutes serve a purpose quite different from civil penalties,. . . Halper's method of determining whether the exactionwas remedial or punitive simply does not work in the caseof a tax statute." Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S., at 784 (internalquotation marks omitted); see also id., at 786 (Rehnquist,C. J., dissenting) (Halper inapplicable outside of " `fixedpenalty provision[s]' " that are meant "to recover the costsincurred by the Government for bringing someone to bookfor some violation of law"). This is not to say that thereis no occasion for analysis of the Government's harm. 89Firearms makes clear the relevance of an evaluation of theharms alleged. The point is simply that Halper's casespecific approach is inapplicable to civil forfeitures.In the cases that we review, the Courts of Appeals did notfind Halper difficult to apply to civil forfeiture because theyconcluded that its case-by-case balancing approach had beensupplanted in Austin by a categorical approach that found acivil sanction to be punitive if it could not "fairly be saidsolely to serve a remedial purpose." See Austin, 509 U. S.,at 610; see also Halper, 490 U. S., at 448. But Austin, itmust be remembered, did not involve the Double JeopardyClause at all. Austin was decided solely under the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, a constitutionalprovision which we never have understood as parallel to, oreven related to, the Double Jeopardy Clause of the FifthAmendment. The only discussion of the Double JeopardyClause contained in Austin appears in a footnote that acknowledges our decisions holding that "[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to apply in civil forfeitureproceedings . . . where the forfeiture could properly be characterized as remedial." Austin, supra, at 608, n. 4. And inAustin we expressly recognized and approved our decisionsin One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S.232 (1972), and United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354 (1984). See Austin, supra, at 608, n. 4.518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT287Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the CourtWe acknowledged in Austin that our categorical approachunder the Excessive Fines Clause was wholly distinct fromthe case-by-case approach of Halper, and we explained thatthe difference in approach was based in a significant difference between the purposes of our analysis under each constitutional provision. See Austin, supra, at 622, n. 14. It isunnecessary in a case under the Excessive Fines Clause toinquire at a preliminary stage whether the civil sanction im-posed in that particular case is totally inconsistent with anyremedial goal. Because the second stage of inquiry underthe Excessive Fines Clause asks whether the particularsanction in question is so large as to be "excessive," see Austin, 509 U. S., at 622-623 (declining to establish criteria forexcessiveness), a preliminary-stage inquiry that focused onthe disproportionality of a particular sanction would be duplicative of the excessiveness analysis that would follow.See id., at 622, n. 14 ("[I]t appears to make little practicaldifference whether the Excessive Fines Clause applies to allforfeitures . . . or only to those that cannot be characterizedas purely remedial," because the Excessive Fines Clause"prohibits only the imposition of `excessive' fines, and a finethat serves purely remedial purposes cannot be considered`excessive' in any event"). Forfeitures effected under 21U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are subject to review for excessiveness under the Eighth Amendment after Austin; thisdoes not mean, however, that those forfeitures are so punitive as to constitute punishment for the purposes of doublejeopardy. The holding of Austin was limited to the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, and we declineto import the analysis of Austin into our double jeopardyjurisprudence.In sum, nothing in Halper, Kurth Ranch, or Austin purported to replace our traditional understanding that civil forfeiture does not constitute punishment for the purpose of theDouble Jeopardy Clause. Congress long has authorized theGovernment to bring parallel criminal proceedings and civil518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT288 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the Courtforfeiture proceedings, and this Court consistently has foundcivil forfeitures not to constitute punishment under the Double Jeopardy Clause. It would have been quite remarkablefor this Court both to have held unconstitutional a wellestablished practice, and to have overruled a long line ofprecedent, without having even suggested that it was doingso. Halper dealt with in personam civil penalties under theDouble Jeopardy Clause;Kurth Ranch with a tax proceedingunder the Double Jeopardy Clause; and Austin with civil forfeitures under the Excessive Fines Clause. None of thosecases dealt with the subject of these cases: in rem civil forfeitures for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.CWe turn now to consider the forfeitures in these casesunder the teaching ofVarious Items, Emerald Cut Stones,and89 Firearms. Because it provides a useful analyticaltool, we conduct our inquiry within the framework of thetwo-part test used in 89 Firearms. First, we ask whetherCongress intended proceedings under 21 U. S. C. $ 881 and18 U. S. C. $ 981 to be criminal or civil. Second, we turn toconsider whether the proceedings are so punitive in fact asto "persuade us that the forfeiture proceeding[s] may not le-gitimately be viewed as civil in nature," despite Congress'intent. 465 U. S., at 366.There is little doubt that Congress intended these forfeitures to be civil proceedings. As was the case in 89 Firearms, "Congress' intent in this regard is most clearly demon-strated by the procedural mechanisms it established forenforcing forfeitures under the statute[s]." Id., at 363.Both 21 U. S. C. $ 881 and 18 U. S. C. $ 981, which is entitled"Civil forfeiture," provide that the laws "relating to the sei-zure, summary and judicial forfeiture, and condemnation ofproperty for violation of the customs laws . . . shall applyto seizures and forfeitures incurred" under $$ 881 and 981.See 21 U. S. C. $ 881(d); 18 U. S. C. $ 981(d). Because forfeit518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT289Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the Courture proceedings under the customs laws are in rem, see 19U. S. C. $ 1602 et seq., it is clear that Congress intended thata forfeiture under $ 881 or $ 981, like the forfeiture reviewedin 89 Firearms, would be a proceeding in rem. Congressspecifically structured these forfeitures to be impersonal bytargeting the property itself. "In contrast to thein perso-nam nature of criminal actions, actions in rem have traditionally been viewed as civil proceedings, with jurisdictiondependent upon seizure of a physical object." 89 Firearms,supra, at 363, citing Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 684.Other procedural mechanisms governing forfeitures under$$ 881 and 981 also indicate that Congress intended such pro-ceedings to be civil. Forfeitures under either statute aregoverned by 19 U. S. C. $ 1607, which provides that actualnotice of the impending forfeiture is unnecessary when theGovernment cannot identify any party with an interest inthe seized article, and by $ 1609, which provides that seizedproperty is subject to forfeiture through a summary adminis-trative procedure if no party files a claim to the property.And 19 U. S. C. $ 1615, which governs the burden of proof inforfeiture proceedings under $$ 881 and 981, provides thatonce the Government has shown probable cause that theproperty is subject to forfeiture, then "the burden of proofshall lie upon [the] claimant." In sum, "[b]y creating suchdistinctly civil procedures for forfeitures under [$$ 881 and981], Congress has `indicate[d] clearly that it intended a civil,not a criminal sanction.' "89 Firearms, supra, at 363, quot-ing Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 402 (1938).33 Justice Stevens mischaracterizes our holding. We do not hold thatin rem civil forfeiture is per se exempt from the scope of the Double Jeopardy Clause. See post, at 300-305. Similarly, we do not rest our conclusion in these cases upon the long-recognized fiction that a forfeiture inrem punishes only malfeasant property rather than a particular person.See post, at 313-316. That a forfeiture is designated as civil by Congressand proceeds in rem establishes a presumption that it is not subject todouble jeopardy. See, e. g., 89 Firearms, 465 U. S., at 363. Nevertheless,where the "clearest proof" indicates that an in rem civil forfeiture is "so518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT290 UNITED STATES v. URSERYOpinion of the CourtMoving to the second stage of our analysis, we find thatthere is little evidence, much less the " `clearest proof ' " thatwe require, see 89 Firearms, supra, at 365, quoting Ward,448 U. S., at 249, suggesting that forfeiture proceedingsunder 21 U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(6) and (a)(7), and 18 U. S. C.$ 981(a)(1)(A), are so punitive in form and effect as to renderthem criminal despite Congress' intent to the contrary. Thestatutes involved in these cases are, in most significant respects, indistinguishable from those reviewed, and held notto be punitive, inVarious Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and89 Firearms.Most significant is that $ 981(a)(1)(A) and $$ 881(a)(6) and(a)(7), while perhaps having certain punitive aspects, serveimportant nonpunitive goals. Title 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7),under which Ursery's property was forfeited, provides forthe forfeiture of "all real property . . . which is used or in-tended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or tofacilitate the commission of " a federal drug felony. Requir-ing the forfeiture of property used to commit federal narcotics violations encourages property owners to take care inmanaging their property and ensures that they will not permit that property to be used for illegal purposes. See Ben-nis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) ("Forfeiture ofproperty prevents illegal uses . . . by imposing an economicpenalty, thereby rendering illegal behavior unprofitable"); 89Firearms, supra, at 364 (forfeiture "discourages unregulatedcommerce in firearms");Calero-Toledo, supra, at 687-688.In many circumstances, the forfeiture may abate a nuisance.See, e. g., United States v. 141st Street Corp., 911 F. 2d 870(CA2 1990) (forfeiting apartment building used to sell crackcocaine); see also Bennis, supra, at 452 (affirming applicationof Michigan statute abating car as a nuisance; forfeiture "prevent[s] further illicit use of " property); cf. 89 Firearms, 465punitive either in purpose or effect" as to be equivalent to a criminalproceeding, that forfeiture may be subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause.Id., at 365.518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT291Cite as: 518 U. S. 267 (1996)Opinion of the CourtU. S., at 364 (forfeiture "remov[ed] from circulation firearmsthat have been used or intended for use" illegally);EmeraldCut Stones, 409 U. S., at 237 (forfeiture "prevented forbiddenmerchandise from circulating in the United States").The forfeiture of the property claimed by Arlt and Wrentook place pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 981(a)(1)(A) and 21U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6). Section 981(a)(1)(A) provides for theforfeiture of "[a]ny property" involved in illegal money-laundering transactions. Section 881(a)(6) provides for theforfeiture of "[a]ll . . . things of value furnished or intendedto be furnished by any person in exchange for" illegal drugs;"all proceeds traceable to such an exchange"; and "all moneys, negotiable instruments, and securities used or intendedto be used to facilitate" a federal drug felony. The sameremedial purposes served by $ 881(a)(7) are served by$$ 881(a)(6) and 981(a)(1)(A). Only one point merits separate discussion. To the extent that $ 881(a)(6) applies to"proceeds" of illegal drug activity, it serves the additionalnonpunitive goal of ensuring that persons do not profit fromtheir illegal acts.Other considerations that we have found relevant to thequestion whether a proceeding is criminal also tend to support a conclusion that $ 981(a)(1)(A) and $$ 881(a)(6) and (a)(7)are civil proceedings. See Ward, supra, at 247-248, n. 7, 249(listing relevant factors and noting that they are neither exhaustive nor dispositive). First, in light of our decisions inVarious Items, Emerald Cut Stones, and 89 Firearms, andthe long tradition of federal statutes providing for a forfeiture proceeding following a criminal prosecution, it is absolutely clear that in rem civil forfeiture has not historicallybeen regarded as punishment, as we have understood thatterm under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second, there isno requirement in the statutes that we currently review thatthe Government demonstrate scienter in order to establishthat the property is subject to forfeiture; indeed, the property may be subject to forfeiture even if no party files a518us2$79H 05-20-99 06:35:19 PAGES OPINPGT292 UNITED STATES v. URSERYKennedy, J., concurringclaim to it and the Government never shows any connec-tion between the property and a particular person. See 19U. S. C. $ 1609. Though both $$ 881(a) and 981(a) contain an"innocent owner" exception, we do not think that such a provision, without more indication of an intent to punish, is rele-vant to the question whether a statute is punitive under theDouble Jeopardy Clause. Third, though both statutes mayfairly be said to serve the purpose of deterrence, we longhave held that this purpose may serve civil as well as crimi-nal goals. See,e. g., 89 Firearms, supra, at 364; Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 677-678. We recently reaffirmed thisconclusion in Bennis v. Michigan, supra, at 452, where weheld that "forfeiture . . . serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose." Finally, though bothstatutes are tied to criminal activity, as was the case in89 Firearms, this fact is insufficient to render the statutespunitive. See89 Firearms, supra, at 365-366. It is wellsettled that "Congress may impose both a criminal and a civilsanction in respect to the same act or omission," Helvering,303 U. S., at 399. By itself, the fact that a forfeiture statutehas some connection to a criminal violation is far fromthe "clearest proof " necessary to show that a proceeding iscriminal.We hold that these in rem civil forfeitures are neither"punishment" nor criminal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The judgments of the Court of Appeals for theSixth Circuit, in No. 95-345, and of the Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit, in No. 95-346, are, accordingly, reversed.
