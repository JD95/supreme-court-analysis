The Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C.$ 924(e) (ACCA), raises the penalty for possession of a firearm by a felon from a maximum of 10 years in prison to amandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum oflife in prison without parole if the defendant "has three pre-vious convictions . . . for a violent felony or a serious drugoffense." We granted certiorari to determine whether a de-fendant in a federal sentencing proceeding may collaterallyattack the validity of previous state convictions that are usedto enhance his sentence under the ACCA. We hold that adefendant has no such right (with the sole exception of con-victions obtained in violation of the right to counsel) to collaterally attack prior convictions.Baltimore City Police arrested petitioner Darren J. Custison July 1, 1991. A federal grand jury indicted him on threecounts: (1) possession of cocaine with intent to distribute inviolation of 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(1); (2) use of a firearm in con-nection with a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18U. S. C. $ 924(c); and (3) possession of a firearm by a convictedfelon in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g)(1). Before trial inthe United States District Court for the District of Mary-land, the Government notified Custis that it would seek anenhanced penalty for the $ 922(g)(1) offense under $ 924(e)(1).The notice charged that he had three prior felony convicKeyser, Assistant Attorneys General, and by the Attorneys General fortheir respective States as follows: Grant Woods of Arizona, Winston Bryant of Arkansas, Larry EchoHawk of Idaho, Chris Gorman of Kentucky,Scott Harshbarger of Massachusetts, Frank J.

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttions: (1) a 1985 Pennsylvania state-court conviction for rob-bery; (2) a 1985 Maryland state-court conviction for burglary;and (3) a 1989 Maryland state-court conviction for at-tempted burglary.The jury found Custis not guilty of possession with intentto distribute and not guilty of use of a firearm during a drugoffense, but convicted him of possession of a firearm and simple cocaine possession, a lesser included offense in the chargeof possession with intent to distribute cocaine. At the sentencing hearing, the Government moved to have Custis' sen-tence enhanced under $ 924(e)(1), based on the prior convictions included in the notice of sentence enhancement.Custis challenged the use of the two Maryland convictionsfor sentence enhancement. He argued that his lawyer forhis 1985 burglary conviction rendered unconstitutionally ineffective assistance and that his guilty plea was not knowingand intelligent as required by Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S.238 (1969). He claimed that his attorney had failed to advisehim of the defense of voluntary intoxication, and that hewould have gone to trial, rather than pleaded guilty, had hebeen aware of that defense. He challenged his 1989 conviction on the ground that it had been based upon a "stipulatedfacts" trial. He claimed that such a "stipulated facts" trialwas tantamount to a guilty plea and that his conviction wasfundamentally unfair because he had not been adequatelyadvised of his rights. Custis further asserts that he hadbeen denied effective assistance of counsel in that case because the stipulated facts established only attempted breaking and entering rather than attempted burglary understate law.The District Court initially rejected Custis' collateralattacks on his two Maryland state-court convictions. TheDistrict Court's letter ruling determined that the performance of Custis' attorney in the 1985 case did not fall belowthe standard of professional competence required underStrickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984). Order in511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:49 PAGES OPINPGT489Cite as: 511 U. S. 485 (1994)Opinion of the CourtNo. S 91-0334 (D. Md., Feb. 27, 1992), p. 1. It found thatcounsel's recommendation of a guilty plea was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Id., at 2. The District Courtalso rejected Custis' claim that the 1989 "stipulated facts"trial was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea. Id., at2-3.The District Court later reversed field and determinedthat it could not entertain Custis' challenges to his prior con-victions at all. It noted that "[u]nlike the statutory schemefor enhancement of sentences in drug cases, [$ 924(e)(1)] pro-vides no statutory right to challenge prior convictions reliedupon by the Government for enhancement." 786 F. Supp.533, 535-536 (Md. 1992). The District Court went on tostate that the Constitution bars the use of a prior convictionfor sentence enhancement only when there was a completedenial of counsel in the prior proceeding. Id., at 536, citingGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); United States v.Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972); and Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S.109 (1967). Based on Custis' offense level of 33 and his criminal history category of VI, the District Court imposed asentence of 235 months in prison.The Court of Appeals affirmed. 988 F. 2d 1355 (CA41993). It recognized the right of a defendant who had beencompletely deprived of counsel to assert a collateral attackon his prior convictions since such a defendant "has lost hisability to assert all his other constitutional rights." Id., at1360, citing Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 465 (1938). Citing the "substantial burden" on prosecutors and the districtcourts, the Court of Appeals dismissed all of Custis' challenges to his prior convictions as the "fact-intensive" typethat pose a risk of unduly delaying and protracting the entiresentencing process. 988 F. 2d, at 1361. The prospect ofsuch fact-intensive inquiries led it to express great reluctance at forcing district courts to overcome the " `inadequacyor unavailability of state court records and witnesses' " intrying to determine the validity of prior sentences.

Jones, 977 F. 2d 105, 109 (CA4 1992).In addition to the practical hurdles, the Court of Appealsspecified concerns over comity and federalism as other factors weighing against permitting collateral attacks. " `Federal courts are not forums in which to relitigate statetrials.' " 988 F. 2d, at 1361, quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463U. S. 880, 887 (1983). We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 913(1993), because the Court of Appeals' decision conflicted withrecent decisions from other Courts of Appeals that permitteddefendants to challenge prior convictions that are used insentencing under $ 924(e)(1).1Custis argues that the ACCA should be read to permitdefendants to challenge the constitutionality of convictionsused for sentencing purposes. Looking to the language ofthe statute, we do not believe $ 924(e) authorizes such collateral attacks. The ACCA provides an enhanced sentence forany person who unlawfully possesses a firearm in violationof 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g) 2 and "has three previous convictionsby any court referred to in section 922(g)(1) of this title fora violent felony or a serious drug offense . . . ." Section924(e) applies whenever a defendant is found to have suffered"three previous convictions" of the type specified. The stat1 See, e. g., United States v. Paleo, 967 F. 2d 7, 11 (CA1 1992); UnitedStates v. Merritt, 882 F. 2d 916, 918 (CA5 1989); United States v. McGlocklin, 8 F. 3d 1037 (CA6 1993) (en banc); United States v.

Franklin, 972 F. 2d 1253, 1257-1258 (CA11 1992).2 Title 18 U. S. C. $ 922 provides in pertinent part as follows:"(g) It shall be unlawful for any person--"(1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;. . . . ."to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in oraffecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearmor ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate orforeign commerce."511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:49 PAGES OPINPGT491Cite as: 511 U. S. 485 (1994)Opinion of the Courtute focuses on the fact of the conviction and nothing suggeststhat the prior final conviction may be subject to collateralattack for potential constitutional errors before it may becounted.Absent specific statutory authorization, Custis contendsthat an implied right to challenge the constitutionality ofprior convictions exists under $ 924(e). Again we disagree.The Gun Control Act of 1968, of which $ 924(e) is a part,strongly indicates that unchallenged prior convictions maybe used for purposes of $ 924(e). At least for prior violentfelonies, $ 921(a)(20) describes the circumstances in which aprior conviction may be counted for sentencing purposesunder $ 924(e):"What constitutes a conviction of . . . a crime shall bedetermined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. Any convic-tion which has been expunged, or set aside or for whicha person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposesof this chapter [18 U. S. C. $$ 921-930]."The provision that a court may not count a conviction "whichhas been . . . set aside" creates a clear negative implicationthat courtsmay count a conviction that has not been setaside.Congress' passage of other related statutes that expresslypermit repeat offenders to challenge prior convictions thatare used for enhancement purposes supports this negativeimplication. For example, 21 U. S. C. $ 851(c), which Congress enacted as part of the Comprehensive Drug AbusePrevention and Control Act of 1970, sets forth specific procedures allowing a defendant to challenge the validity of aprior conviction used to enhance the sentence for a federaldrug offense. Section 851(c)(1) states that "[i]f the persondenies any allegation of the information of prior conviction,or claims that any conviction alleged is invalid, he shall file511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:49 PAGES OPINPGT492 CUSTIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courta written response to the information." Section 851(c)(2)goes on to provide:"A person claiming that a conviction alleged in theinformation was obtained in violation of the Constitutionof the United States shall set forth his claim, and thefactual basis therefor, with particularity in his responseto the information. The person shall have the burdenof proof by a preponderance of the evidence on any issueof fact raised by the response. Any challenge to a priorconviction, not raised by response to the informationbefore an increased sentence is imposed in reliancethereon, shall be waived unless good cause be shown forfailure to make a timely challenge."The language of $ 851(c) shows that when Congress intendedto authorize collateral attacks on prior convictions at thetime of sentencing, it knew how to do so. Congress' omis-sion of similar language in $ 924(e) indicates that it did notintend to give defendants the right to challenge the validityof prior convictions under this statute. Cf.Gozlon-Peretz v.United States, 498 U. S. 395, 404 (1991) (" `[W]here Congressincludes particular language in one section of a statute butomits it in another section of the same Act, it is generallypresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely inthe disparate inclusion or exclusion' "), quoting Russello v.United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (internal quotationmarks omitted).Our decision in Lewis v. United States, 445 U. S. 55 (1980),also supports the conclusion that prior convictions used forsentence enhancement purposes under $ 924(e) are not subject to collateral attack in the sentence proceeding. Lewisinterpreted 18 U. S. C. App. $ 1202(a)(1) (1982 ed.), one of thepredecessors to the current felon-in-possession-of-a-firearmstatute. Section 1202(a)(1) was aimed at any person who"has been convicted by a court of the United States or of aState . . . of a felony." We concluded that " `[n]othing on the511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:49 PAGES OPINPGT493Cite as: 511 U. S. 485 (1994)Opinion of the Courtface of the statute suggests a congressional intent to limitits coverage to persons [whose convictions are not subject tocollateral attack].' " 445 U. S., at 60, quoting United Statesv.Culbert, 435 U. S. 371, 373 (1978). This lack of such intentin $ 1202(a)(1) also contrasted with other federal statutesthat explicitly permitted a defendant to challenge the valid-ity or constitutionality of the predicate felony. See,e. g., 18U. S. C. $ 3575(e) (note following ch. 227) (dangerous specialoffender) and 21 U. S. C. $ 851(c)(2) (recidivism under theComprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of1970). The absence of expressed intent, and the contrastwith other federal statutes, led us to determine that "thefirearms prosecution [under $ 1202(a)(1)] does not open thepredicate conviction to a new form of collateral attack." 445U. S., at 67.Similarly, $ 924(e) lacks any indication that Congress intended to permit collateral attacks on prior convictions usedfor sentence enhancement purposes. The contrast between$ 924(e) and statutes that expressly provide avenues for collateral attacks, as well as our decision in Lewis, supra, pointstrongly to the conclusion that Congress did not intend topermit collateral attacks on prior convictions under $ 924(e).Custis argues that regardless of whether $ 924(e) permitscollateral challenges to prior convictions, the Constitutionrequires that they be allowed. He relies upon our decisionsin Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109 (1967), and United Statesv. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443 (1972), in support of this argument.Both of these decisions relied upon our earlier decision inGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), holding that theSixth Amendment of the United States Constitution required that an indigent defendant in state-court proceedingshave counsel appointed for him. Gideon, in turn, overruledour earlier decision in Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 (1942),which had held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel,long applied in federal-court proceedings, was not itself madeapplicable to the States by the Due Process Clause. The511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:49 PAGES OPINPGT494 CUSTIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtDue Process Clause, Betts had held, required the appoint-ment of counsel for an indigent defendant in state courts onlyupon a showing of special circumstances. Id., at 473.But even beforeBetts v. Brady was decided, this Courthad held that the failure to appoint counsel for an indigentdefendant in a federal proceeding not only violated the SixthAmendment, but was subject to collateral attack in federalhabeas corpus. Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938). Ata time when the underlying habeas statute was construed toallow collateral attacks on final judgments of conviction onlywhere the rendering court lacked "jurisdiction"--albeit asomewhat expansive notion of "jurisdiction," see Moore v.Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923)--this Court attributed a jurisdictional significance to the failure to appoint counsel. TheCourt said:"If the accused, however, is not represented by counseland has not competently and intelligently waived hisconstitutional right, the Sixth Amendment stands as ajurisdictional bar to a valid conviction and sentence depriving him of his life or his liberty. . . . The judgmentof conviction pronounced by a court without jurisdictionis void, and one imprisoned thereunder may obtain release by habeas corpus." 304 U. S., at 468.When the Court later expanded the availability of federalhabeas to other constitutional violations, it did so by franklystating that the federal habeas statute made such reliefavailable for them, without claiming that the denial of theseconstitutional rights by the trial court would have deniedit jurisdiction. See, e. g., Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101,104-105 (1942) (coerced confession); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S.443 (1953). There is thus a historical basis in our jurisprudence of collateral attacks for treating the right to havecounsel appointed as unique, perhaps because of our oftstated view that "[t]he right to be heard would be, in many511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:50 PAGES OPINPGT495Cite as: 511 U. S. 485 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to beheard by counsel." Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 68-69(1932).Following our decision in Gideon, the Court decided Burgett v. Texas, supra. There the defendant was chargedunder a Texas recidivist statute with having been the subjectof four previous felony convictions. 389 U. S., at 111. Theprosecutor introduced certified records of one of the defendant's earlier convictions in Tennessee. Id., at 112. The defendant objected to the admission of this conviction on theground that he had not been represented by counsel and hadnot waived his right to counsel, but his objection was overruled by the trial court. Id., at 113. This Court reversed,finding that the certified records of the Tennessee convictionon their face raised a "presumption that petitioner was denied his right to counsel . . . , and therefore that his conviction was void." Id., at 114. The Court held that the admission of a prior criminal conviction that is constitutionallyinfirm under the standards of Gideon is inherently prejudicial and to permit use of such a tainted prior convictionfor sentence enhancement would undermine the principle ofGideon. 389 U. S., at 115.A similar situation arose in Tucker, supra. The defendanthad been convicted of bank robbery in California in 1953.At sentencing, the District Court conducted an inquiry intothe defendant's background, and, the record shows, gave explicit attention to the three previous felony convictions thatthe defendant had acknowledged at trial. The DistrictCourt sentenced him to 25 years in prison--the stiffest termauthorized by the applicable federal statute, 18 U. S. C.$ 2113(d). 404 U. S., at 444. Several years later, after having obtained a judicial determination that two of his priorconvictions were constitutionally invalid, the defendant fileda writ of habeas corpus in the District Court in which he hadbeen convicted of bank robbery. He challenged the use at511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:50 PAGES OPINPGT496 CUSTIS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courthis 1953 bank robbery trial of his three previous felony con-victions. This Court sustained his challenge insofar as hissentence was concerned, saying "Gideon . . . established anunequivocal rule `making it unconstitutional to try a personfor a felony in a state court unless he had a lawyer or hadvalidly waived one.' " Id., at 449, quoting Burgett v. Texas,supra, at 114. The Court held that "[e]rosion of the Gideonprinciple can be prevented here only by affirming the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals remanding this case to the trialcourt for reconsideration of the [defendant's] sentence." 404U. S., at 449.Custis invites us to extend the right to attack collaterallyprior convictions used for sentence enhancement beyond theright to have appointed counsel established in Gideon. Wedecline to do so. We think that since the decision in Johnson v. Zerbst more than half a century ago, and runningthrough our decisions in Burgett and Tucker, there has beena theme that failure to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant was a unique constitutional defect. Custis attackshis previous convictions claiming the denial of the effectiveassistance of counsel, that his guilty plea was not knowingand intelligent, and that he had not been adequately advisedof his rights in opting for a "stipulated facts" trial. None ofthese alleged constitutional violations rises to the level ofa jurisdictional defect resulting from the failure to appointcounsel at all. Johnson v. Zerbst, supra.Ease of administration also supports the distinction. Asrevealed in a number of the cases cited in this opinion, failureto appoint counsel at all will generally appear from the judgment roll itself, or from an accompanying minute order. Butdetermination of claims of ineffective assistance of counsel,and failure to assure that a guilty plea was voluntary, wouldrequire sentencing courts to rummage through frequentlynonexistent or difficult to obtain state-court transcripts orrecords that may date from another era, and may come fromany one of the 50 States.511us2$51H 11-05-97 14:06:50 PAGES OPINPGT497Cite as: 511 U. S. 485 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe interest in promoting the finality of judgments pro-vides additional support for our constitutional conclusion.As we have explained, "[i]nroads on the concept of finalitytend to undermine confidence in the integrity of our procedures" and inevitably delay and impair the orderly adminis-tration of justice.United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178,184, n. 11 (1979). We later noted in Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S.20 (1992), that principles of finality associated with habeascorpus actions apply with at least equal force when a defendant seeks to attack a previous conviction used for sentencing.By challenging the previous conviction, the defendant is asking a district court "to deprive [the] [state-court judgment]of [its] normal force and effect in a proceeding that ha[s] anindependent purpose other than to overturn the prior judg-men[t]."Id., at 30. These principles bear extra weight incases in which the prior convictions, such as one challengedby Custis, are based on guilty pleas, because when a guiltyplea is at issue, "the concern with finality served by the limitation on collateral attack has special force." United Statesv.Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 784 (1979) (footnote omitted).We therefore hold that $ 924(e) does not permit Custis touse the federal sentencing forum to gain review of his stateconvictions. Congress did not prescribe and the Constitution does not require such delay and protraction of the fed-eral sentencing process. We recognize, however, as did theCourt of Appeals, see 988 F. 2d, at 1363, that Custis, whowas still "in custody" for purposes of his state convictions atthe time of his federal sentencing under $ 924(e), may attackhis state sentences in Maryland or through federal habeasreview. See Maleng v. Cook, 490 U. S. 488, 492 (1989). IfCustis is successful in attacking these state sentences, hemay then apply for reopening of any federal sentence en-hanced by the state sentences. We express no opinion onthe appropriate disposition of such an application.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly
