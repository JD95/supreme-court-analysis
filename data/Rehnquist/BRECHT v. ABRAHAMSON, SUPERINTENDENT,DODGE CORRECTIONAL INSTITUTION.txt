S. 610 (1976), entitles petitioner to ha-beas corpus relief. We hold that it does not. Instead, thestandard for determining whether habeas relief must begranted is whether the Doyle error "had substantial and in-jurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict."Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 776 (1946). TheKotteakos harmless-error standard is better tailored to thenature and purpose of collateral review than the Chapmanstandard, and application of a less onerous harmless-errorstandard on habeas promotes the considerations underlyingour habeas jurisprudence. Applying this standard, we conclude that petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief.Petitioner Todd A. Brecht was serving time in a Georgiaprison for felony theft when his sister and her husband,Molly and Roger Hartman, paid the restitution for petitioner's crime and assumed temporary custody of him. TheHartmans brought petitioner home with them to Alma, Wisconsin, where he was to reside with them before entering ahalfway house. This caused some tension in the Hartmanhousehold because Roger Hartman, a local district attorney, disapproved of petitioner's heavy drinking habits andhomosexual orientation, not to mention his previous criminalexploits. To make the best of the situation, though, theHartmans told petitioner, on more than one occasion, that hewas not to drink alcohol or engage in homosexual activitiesin their home. Just one week after his arrival, however,petitioner violated this house rule.While the Hartmans were away, petitioner broke into theirliquor cabinet and began drinking. He then found a rifle inan upstairs room and began shooting cans in the backyard.When Roger Hartman returned home from work, petitionershot him in the back and sped off in Mrs. Hartman's car.1 Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966).507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT624 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the CourtHartman crawled to a neighbor's house to summon help.(The downstairs phone in the Hartmans' house was inoperable because petitioner had taken the receiver on the upstairsphone off the hook.) Help came, but Hartman's woundproved fatal. Meanwhile, petitioner had driven Mrs. Hartman's car into a ditch in a nearby town. When a police offi-cer stopped to offer assistance, petitioner told him that hissister knew about his car mishap and had called a tow truck.Petitioner then hitched a ride to Winona, Minnesota, wherehe was stopped by police. At first he tried to conceal hisidentity, but he later identified himself and was arrested.When he was told that he was being held for the shooting,petitioner replied that "it was a big mistake" and asked totalk with "somebody that would understand [him]." App.39, 78. Petitioner was returned to Wisconsin, and thereafter was given his Miranda warnings at an arraignment.Then petitioner was charged with first-degree murder.At trial in the Circuit Court for Buffalo County, he took thestand and admitted shooting Hartman, but claimed it wasan accident. According to petitioner, when he saw Hartmanpulling into the driveway on the evening of the shooting, heran to replace the gun in the upstairs room where he hadfound it. But as he was running toward the stairs in thedownstairs hallway, he tripped, causing the rifle to dischargethe fatal shot. After the shooting, Hartman disappeared,so petitioner drove off in Mrs. Hartman's car to find him.Upon spotting Hartman at his neighbor's door, however,petitioner panicked and drove away.The State argued that petitioner's account was belied bythe fact that he had failed to get help for Hartman, fled theHartmans' home immediately after the shooting, and lied tothe police officer who came upon him in the ditch about having called Mrs. Hartman. In addition, the State pointed outthat petitioner had failed to mention anything about theshooting being an accident to the officer who found him inthe ditch, the man who gave him a ride to Winona, or the507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT625Cite as: 507 U.

Over the objectionsof defense counsel, the State also asked petitioner duringcross-examination whether he had told anyone at any timebefore trial that the shooting was an accident, to which petitioner replied "no," and made several references to petition-er's pretrial silence during closing argument.2 Finally, theState offered extrinsic evidence tending to contradict peti-tioner's story, including the path the bullet traveled throughMr. Hartman's body (horizontal to slightly downward) andthe location where the rifle was found after the shooting(outside), as well as evidence of motive (petitioner's hostilitytoward Mr. Hartman because of his disapproval of petitioner's sexual orientation).The jury returned a guilty verdict, and petitioner wassentenced to life imprisonment. The Wisconsin Court of2 The State's cross-examination of petitioner included the followingexchange:"Q. In fact the first time you have ever told this story is when youtestified here today was it not?. . . . ."A. You mean the story of actually what happened?"Q. Yes."A. I knew what happened, I'm just telling it the way it happened, yes,I didn't have a chance to talk to anyone, I didn't want to call somebodyfrom a phone and give up my rights, so I didn't want to talk about it, nosir." App. 22-23.Then on re-cross-examination, the State further inquired:"Q. Did you tell anyone about what had happened in Alma?"A. No I did not." Id., at 23.During closing argument, the State urged the jury to "remember thatMr. Brecht never volunteered until in this courtroom what happened inthe Hartman residence . . . ." Id., at 30. It also made the followingstatement with regard to petitioner's pretrial silence: "He sits back hereand sees all of our evidence go in and then he comes out with this crazystory . . . ." Id., at 31. Finally, during its closing rebuttal, the Statesaid: "I know what I'd say [had I been in petitioner's shoes], I'd say, `holdon, this was a mistake, this was an accident, let me tell you what happened,' but he didn't say that did he. No, he waited until he hears ourstory." Id., at 36.507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT626 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the CourtAppeals set the conviction aside on the ground that theState's references to petitioner's post-Miranda silence, seen. 2, supra, violated due process under Doyle v. Ohio, 426U. S. 610 (1976), and that this error was sufficiently "prejudicial" to require reversal. State v. Brecht, 138 Wis. 2d 158,168-169, 405 N. W. 2d 718, 723 (1987). The Wisconsin Supreme Court reinstated the conviction. Although it agreedthat the State's use of petitioner's post-Miranda silence wasimpermissible, the court determined that this error " `washarmless beyond a reasonable doubt.' " State v. Brecht, 143Wis. 2d 297, 317, 421 N. W. 2d 96, 104 (1988) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18, 24 (1967)). In finding theDoyle violation harmless, the court noted that the State's"improper references to Brecht's silence were infrequent,"in that they "comprised less than two pages of a 900 pagetranscript, or a few minutes in a four day trial in whichtwenty-five witnesses testified," and that the State's evidence of guilt was compelling. 143 Wis. 2d, at 317, 421N. W. 2d, at 104.Petitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28U. S. C. $ 2254, reasserting his Doyle claim. The DistrictCourt agreed that the State's use of petitioner's postMiranda silence violated Doyle, but disagreed with the Wisconsin Supreme Court that this error was harmless beyonda reasonable doubt, and set aside the conviction. 759F. Supp. 500 (WD Wis. 1991). The District Court based itsharmless-error determination on its view that the State's evidence of guilt was not "overwhelming," and that the State'sreferences to petitioner's post-Miranda silence, though "notextensive," were "crucial" because petitioner's defenseturned on his credibility. Id., at 508. The Court of Appealsfor the Seventh Circuit reversed. It, too, concluded that theState's references to petitioner's post-Miranda silence violated Doyle, but it disagreed with both the standard that theDistrict Court had applied in conducting its harmless-error507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT627Cite as: 507 U.

Instead, because of the "prophylactic" na-ture of theDoyle rule, 944 F. 2d, at 1370, as well as the costsattendant to reversing state convictions on collateral review,id., at 1373, the Court of Appeals held that the standard fordetermining whether petitioner was entitled to habeas reliefwas whether the Doyle violation " `had substantial and inju-rious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict,' "944 F. 2d, at 1375 (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328U. S., at 776). Applying this standard, the Court of Appealsconcluded that petitioner was not entitled to relief because,"given the many more, and entirely proper, references to[petitioner's] silence preceding arraignment," he could notcontend with a "straight face" that the State's use of his postMiranda silence had a "substantial and injurious effect" onthe jury's verdict. 944 F. 2d, at 1376.We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict between Courtsof Appeals on the question whether the Chapman harmlesserror standard applies on collateral review of Doyle viola-tions, 504 U. S. 972 (1992),3 and now affirm.We are the sixth court to pass on the question whether theState's use for impeachment purposes of petitioner's postMiranda silence requires reversal of his murder conviction.Petitioner urges us to even the count, and decide matters inhis favor once and for all. He argues that the Chapmanharmless-error standard applies with equal force on collateralreview of Doyle error. According to petitioner, the need toprevent state courts from relaxing their standards on directreview of Doyle claims, and the confusion which would ensuewere we to adopt the Kotteakos harmless-error standard on3 Cf. Bass v. Nix, 909 F. 2d 297 (CA8 1990) (The Chapman harmlesserror standard governs in reviewing Doyle violations on collateralreview).507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT628 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the Courtcollateral review, require application of the Chapman stand-ard here. Before considering these arguments, however, wemust first characterize the nature of Doyle error itself.InDoyle v. Ohio, 426 U. S., at 619, we held that "the usefor impeachment purposes of [a defendant's] silence, at thetime of arrest and after receiving Miranda warnings, vio-late[s] the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." This rule "rests on `the fundamental unfairness ofimplicitly assuring a suspect that his silence will not be usedagainst him and then using his silence to impeach an explana-tion subsequently offered at trial.' "Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U. S. 284, 291 (1986) (quoting South Dakota v. Neville, 459 U. S. 553, 565 (1983)). The "implicit assurance"upon which we have relied in our Doyle line of cases is theright-to-remain-silent component of Miranda. Thus, theConstitution does not prohibit the use for impeachmentpurposes of a defendant's silence prior to arrest, Jenkinsv. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 239 (1980), or after arrest if noMiranda warnings are given, Fletcher v. Weir, 455 U. S.603, 606-607 (1982) (per curiam). Such silence is probativeand does not rest on any implied assurance by law enforcement authorities that it will carry no penalty. See 447 U. S.,at 239.This case illustrates the point well. The first time petitioner claimed that the shooting was an accident was whenhe took the stand at trial. It was entirely proper--and probative--for the State to impeach his testimony by pointingout that petitioner had failed to tell anyone before the timehe received his Miranda warnings at his arraignment aboutthe shooting being an accident. Indeed, if the shooting wasan accident, petitioner had every reason--including to clearhis name and preserve evidence supporting his version ofthe events--to offer his account immediately following theshooting. On the other hand, the State's references to petitioner's silence after that point in time, or more generallyto petitioner's failure to come forward with his version of507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT629Cite as: 507 U. S. 619 (1993)Opinion of the Courtevents at any time before trial, see n. 2, supra, crossed theDoyle line. For it is conceivable that, once petitioner hadbeen given his Miranda warnings, he decided to stand on hisright to remain silent because he believed his silence wouldnot be used against him at trial.The Court of Appeals characterized Doyle as "a prophylac-tic rule." 944 F. 2d, at 1370. It reasoned that, since theneed for Doyle stems from the implicit assurance that flowsfromMiranda warnings, and "the warnings required by Miranda are not themselves part of the Constitution," "Doyleis . . . a prophylactic rule designed to protect another prophylactic rule from erosion or misuse." Ibid. But Doyle wasnot simply a further extension of theMiranda prophylacticrule. Rather, as we have discussed, it is rooted in fundamental fairness and due process concerns. However realthese concerns,Doyle does not " `overprotec[t]' " them.Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 209 (1989) (O'Connor,J., concurring). Under the rationale of Doyle, due processis violated whenever the prosecution uses for impeachmentpurposes a defendant's post-Miranda silence. Doyle thusdoes not bear the hallmarks of a prophylactic rule.Instead, we think Doyle error fits squarely into the category of constitutional violations which we have characterizedas " `trial error.' " See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S.279, 307 (1991). Trial error "occur[s] during the presentation of the case to the jury," and is amenable to harmlesserror analysis because it "may . . . be quantitatively assessedin the context of other evidence presented in order to determine [the effect it had on the trial]." Id., at 307-308. Atthe other end of the spectrum of constitutional errors lie"structural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism,which defy analysis by `harmless-error' standards." Id., at309. The existence of such defects--deprivation of the rightto counsel,4 for example--requires automatic reversal of the4 Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963).507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT630 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the Courtconviction because they infect the entire trial process. Seeid., at 309-310. Since our landmark decision in Chapmanv. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), we have applied theharmless-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in reviewingclaims of constitutional error of the trial type.InChapman, we considered whether the prosecution'sreference to the defendants' failure to testify at trial, inviolation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,5 required reversal of their convictions. Werejected the argument that the Constitution requires a blan-ket rule of automatic reversal in the case of constitutionalerror, and concluded instead that "there may be some consti-tutional errors which in the setting of a particular case areso unimportant and insignificant that they may, consistentwith the Federal Constitution, be deemed harmless."Id.,at 22. After examining existing harmless-error rules,including the federal rule (28 U. S. C. $ 2111), we held that"before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless,the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harm-less beyond a reasonable doubt." 386 U. S., at 24. TheState bears the burden of proving that an error passes mus-ter under this standard.Chapman reached this Court on direct review, as havemost of the cases in which we have applied its harmlesserror standard. Although we have applied the Chapmanstandard in a handful of federal habeas cases, see, e. g., Yatesv.Evatt, 500 U. S. 391 (1991); Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570(1986); Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U. S. 371 (1972); Andersonv.Nelson, 390 U. S. 523 (1968) (per curiam), we have yetsquarely to address its applicability on collateral review.65 Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965).6 In Greer v. Miller, 483 U. S. 756 (1987), we granted certiorari to consider the same question presented here but did not reach this questionbecause we concluded that no Doyle error had occurred in that case. See483 U. S., at 761, n. 3, 765. But see id., at 768 (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment) ("I believe the question presented in the certiorari petition--507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT631Cite as: 507 U. S. 619 (1993)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner contends that we are bound by these habeas cases,by way of stare decisis, from holding that the Kotteakosharmless-error standard applies on habeas review of Doyleerror. But since we have never squarely addressed theissue, and have at most assumed the applicability of theChapman standard on habeas, we are free to addressthe issue on the merits. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S.651, 670-671 (1974).The federal habeas corpus statute is silent on this point.It permits federal courts to entertain a habeas petition onbehalf of a state prisoner "only on the ground that he is incustody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties ofthe United States," 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a), and directs simplythat the court "dispose of the matter as law and justice re-quire," $ 2243. The statute says nothing about the standardfor harmless-error review in habeas cases. Respondenturges us to fill this gap with theKotteakos standard, underwhich an error requires reversal only if it "had substantialand injurious effect or influence in determining the jury'sverdict."Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S., at 776.This standard is grounded in the federal harmless-error statute. 28 U. S. C. $ 2111 ("On the hearing of any appeal orwrit of certiorari in any case, the court shall give judgmentafter an examination of the record without regard to errorsor defects which do not affect the substantial rights of theparties").7 On its face $ 2111 might seem to address the situwhether a federal court should apply a different standard in reviewingDoyle errors in a habeas corpus action--should be answered in the affirmative") (emphasis in original).7 In Kotteakos, we construed $ 2111's statutory predecessor, 28 U. S. C.$ 391 (1925-1926 ed.). Section 391 provided: "On the hearing of anyappeal, certiorari, writ of error, or motion for a new trial, in any case,civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination ofthe entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors,defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of theparties." In formulating $ 391's harmless-error standard, we focusedon the phrase "affect the substantial rights of the parties," and held507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT632 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the Courtation at hand, but to date we have limited its application toclaims of nonconstitutional error in federal criminal cases.See, e. g., United States v. Lane, 474 U. S. 438 (1986).Petitioner asserts that Congress' failure to enact variousproposals since Chapman was decided that would have lim-ited the availability of habeas relief amounts to legislativedisapproval of application of a less stringent harmless-errorstandard on collateral review of constitutional error. Onlyone of these proposals merits discussion here. In 1972, a billwas proposed that would have amended 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 torequire habeas petitioners to show that " `a different resultwould probably have obtained if such constitutional violationhad not occurred.' " 118 Cong. Rec. 24936 (1972) (quotingS. 3833, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. (1972)). In response, the Attorney General suggested that the above provision be modifiedto make habeas relief available only where the petitioner" `suffered a substantial deprivation of his constitutionalrights at his trial.' " 118 Cong. Rec. 24939 (1972) (quotingletter from Richard G. Kleindienst, Attorney General, toEmanuel Celler, Chairman of the House Committee on theJudiciary (June 21, 1972)). This language of course parallelsthe federal harmless-error rule. But neither the AttorneyGeneral's suggestion nor the proposed bill itself was everenacted into law.As a general matter, we are "reluctant to draw inferencesfrom Congress' failure to act."Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 306 (1988) (citing American TruckingAssns., Inc. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 387 U. S. 397,that the test was whether the error "had substantial and injurious effector influence in determining the jury's verdict." 328 U. S., at 776. Although Congress tinkered with the language of $ 391 when it enacted$ 2111 in its place in 1949, Congress left untouched the phrase "affect thesubstantial rights of the parties." Thus, the enactment of $ 2111 did notalter the basis for the harmless-error standard announced in Kotteakos.If anything, Congress' deletion of the word "technical," makes $ 2111 moreamenable to harmless-error review of constitutional violations. Cf.United States v. Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 509-510, n. 7 (1983).507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT633Cite as: 507 U.

In the absence of any express statutoryguidance from Congress, it remains for this Court to determine what harmless-error standard applies on collateral review of petitioner's Doyle claim. We have filled the gaps ofthe habeas corpus statute with respect to other matters, see,e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 487 (1991); Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81 (1977); Sanders v. UnitedStates, 373 U. S. 1, 15 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293,312-313 (1963), and find it necessary to do so here. As always, in defining the scope of the writ, we look first to theconsiderations underlying our habeas jurisprudence, andthen determine whether the proposed rule would advance orinhibit these considerations by weighing the marginal costsand benefits of its application on collateral review.The principle that collateral review is different from directreview resounds throughout our habeas jurisprudence. See,e. g., Wright v. West, 505 U. S. 277, 292-293 (1992) (opinion ofThomas, J.); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 306 (1989) (opinionof O'Connor, J.); Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 556-557 (1987); Mackey v. United States, 401 U. S. 667, 682 (1971)(Harlan, J., concurring in judgments in part and dissentingin part). Direct review is the principal avenue for challenging a conviction. "When the process of direct review--which, if a federal question is involved, includes the right topetition this Court for a writ of certiorari--comes to an end,a presumption of finality and legality attaches to the conviction and sentence. The role of federal habeas proceedings,while important in assuring that constitutional rights areobserved, is secondary and limited. Federal courts are notforums in which to relitigate state trials." Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 887 (1983).In keeping with this distinction, the writ of habeas corpushas historically been regarded as an extraordinary remedy,"a bulwark against convictions that violate `fundamental fair507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT634 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the Courtness.' " Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126 (1982) (quotingWainwright v. Sykes, supra, at 97 (Stevens, J., concurring))."Those few who are ultimately successful [in obtaininghabeas relief] are persons whom society has grievouslywronged and for whom belated liberation is little enoughcompensation." Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 440-441 (1963).See also Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436, 447 (1986) (plurality opinion) ("The Court uniformly has been guided by theproposition that the writ should be available to afford reliefto those `persons whom society has grievously wronged' inlight of modern concepts of justice") (quoting Fay v. Noia,supra, at 440-441); Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S. 307, 332,n. 5 (1979) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (Habeascorpus "is designed to guard against extreme malfunctions inthe state criminal justice systems"). Accordingly, it hardlybears repeating that " `an error that may justify reversal ondirect appeal will not necessarily support a collateral attackon a final judgment.' " United States v. Frady, 456 U. S. 152,165 (1982) (quoting United States v. Addonizio, 442 U. S. 178,184 (1979)).8Recognizing the distinction between direct and collateralreview, we have applied different standards on habeas thanwould be applied on direct review with respect to mattersother than harmless-error analysis. Our recent retroactivityjurisprudence is a prime example. Although new rules al-ways have retroactive application to criminal cases on directreview, Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 320-328 (1987),we have held that they seldom have retroactive applicationto criminal cases on federal habeas, Teague v. Lane, supra, at305-310 (opinion ofO'Connor, J.). Other examples aboundthroughout our habeas cases. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v.8 For instance, we have held that an error of law does not provide abasis for habeas relief under 28 U. S. C. $ 2255 unless it constitutes " `afundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage ofjustice.' " United States v. Timmreck, 441 U. S. 780, 783 (1979) (quotingHill v.

Powell, 428 U. S.465, 489-496 (1976) (Claims under Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S.643 (1961), are not cognizable on habeas as long as the statecourts have provided a full and fair opportunity to litigatethem at trial or on direct review).The reason most frequently advanced in our cases for distinguishing between direct and collateral review is theState's interest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system. See,e. g., Wright v. West, supra, at 293 (opinion of Thomas, J.);McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S., at 491; Wainwright v. Sykes,433 U. S., at 90. We have also spoken of comity and federalism. "The States possess primary authority for definingand enforcing the criminal law. In criminal trials they alsohold the initial responsibility for vindicating constitutionalrights. Federal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States' sovereign power to punish offendersand their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights."Engle v. Isaac, supra, at 128. See also Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 748 (1991); McCleskey, supra, at 491. Finally, we have recognized that "[l]iberal allowance of thewrit . . . degrades the prominence of the trial itself," Engle,supra, at 127, and at the same time encourages habeaspetitioners to relitigate their claims on collateral review,see Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 547 (1982) (Stevens, J.,dissenting).In light of these considerations, we must decide whetherthe same harmless-error standard that the state courts ap507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT636 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the Courtplied on direct review of petitioner's Doyle claim also appliesin this habeas proceeding. We are the sixth court to passon the question whether the State's use for impeachmentpurposes of petitioner's post-Miranda silence in this caserequires reversal of his conviction. Each court that has reviewed the record has disagreed with the court before it asto whether the State's Doyle error was "harmless." Statecourts are fully qualified to identify constitutional error andevaluate its prejudicial effect on the trial process underChapman, and state courts often occupy a superior vantagepoint from which to evaluate the effect of trial error. SeeRushen v. Spain, 464 U. S. 114, 120 (1983) (per curiam).For these reasons, it scarcely seems logical to require federal habeas courts to engage in the identical approach toharmless-error review that Chapman requires state courtsto engage in on direct review.Petitioner argues that application of the Chapmanharmless-error standard on collateral review is necessary todeter state courts from relaxing their own guard in reviewing constitutional error and to discourage prosecutors fromcommitting error in the first place. Absent affirmative evidence that state-court judges are ignoring their oath, wediscount petitioner's argument that courts will respond toour ruling by violating their Article VI duty to uphold theConstitution. See Robb v. Connolly, 111 U. S. 624, 637(1884). Federalism, comity, and the constitutional obligationof state and federal courts all counsel against any presumption that a decision of this Court will "deter" lower federalor state courts from fully performing their sworn duty. SeeEngle, supra, at 128; Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S.218, 263-265 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring). In any event,we think the costs of applying the Chapman standard onfederal habeas outweigh the additional deterrent effect, ifany, that would be derived from its application on collateralreview.507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT637Cite as: 507 U. S. 619 (1993)Opinion of the CourtOverturning final and presumptively correct convictionson collateral review because the State cannot prove that anerror is harmless under Chapman undermines the States'interest in finality and infringes upon their sovereignty overcriminal matters. Moreover, granting habeas relief merelybecause there is a " `reasonable possibility' " that trial errorcontributed to the verdict, seeChapman v. California, 386U. S., at 24 (quoting Fahy v. Connecticut, 375 U. S. 85, 86(1963)), is at odds with the historic meaning of habeas corpus--to afford relief to those whom society has "grievouslywronged." Retrying defendants whose convictions are setaside also imposes significant "social costs," including theexpenditure of additional time and resources for all the parties involved, the "erosion of memory" and "dispersion ofwitnesses" that accompany the passage of time and makeobtaining convictions on retrial more difficult, and the frustration of "society's interest in the prompt administration ofjustice." United States v. Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 72 (1986)(internal quotation marks omitted). And since there is nostatute of limitations governing federal habeas, and the onlylaches recognized is that which affects the State's ability todefend against the claims raised on habeas, retrials followingthe grant of habeas relief ordinarily take place much laterthan do retrials following reversal on direct review.The imbalance of the costs and benefits of applying theChapman harmless-error standard on collateral review counsels in favor of applying a less onerous standard on habeasreview of constitutional error. The Kotteakos standard, webelieve, fills the bill. The test under Kotteakos is whetherthe error "had substantial and injurious effect or influencein determining the jury's verdict." 328 U. S., at 776.Under this standard, habeas petitioners may obtain plenaryreview of their constitutional claims, but they are not entitled to habeas relief based on trial error unless they can establish that it resulted in "actual prejudice." See UnitedStates v. Lane, 474 U. S. 438, 449 (1986). The Kotteakos507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT638 BRECHT v. ABRAHAMSONOpinion of the Courtstandard is thus better tailored to the nature and purpose ofcollateral review and more likely to promote the considerations underlying our recent habeas cases. Moreover, because the Kotteakos standard is grounded in the federalharmless-error rule, 28 U. S. C. $ 2111, federal courts mayturn to an existing body of case law in applying it. Therefore, contrary to the assertion of petitioner, application ofthe Kotteakos standard on collateral review is unlikely toconfuse matters for habeas courts.For the foregoing reasons, then, we hold that the Kotteakos harmless-error standard applies in determiningwhether habeas relief must be granted because of constitutional error of the trial type.9 All that remains to be decided is whether petitioner is entitled to relief under thisstandard based on the State's Doyle error. Because theCourt of Appeals applied the Kotteakos standard below, weproceed to this question ourselves rather than remand thecase for a new harmless-error determination. Cf. Yates v.Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 407 (1991). At trial, petitioner admitted shooting Hartman, but claimed it was an accident.The principal question before the jury, therefore, waswhether the State met its burden in proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the shooting was intentional. Our inquiry here is whether, in light of the record as a whole, theState's improper use for impeachment purposes of petitioner's post-Miranda silence, see n. 2, supra, "had substantialand injurious effect or influence in determining the jury'sverdict." We think it clear that it did not.9 Our holding does not foreclose the possibility that in an unusual case,a deliberate and especially egregious error of the trial type, or one that iscombined with a pattern of prosecutorial misconduct, might so infect theintegrity of the proceeding as to warrant the grant of habeas relief, evenif it did not substantially influence the jury's verdict. Cf. Greer v. Miller,483 U. S. 756, 769 (1987) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). We, ofcourse, are not presented with such a situation here.507us3$57I 11-18-96 22:37:13 PAGES OPINPGT639Cite as: 507 U. S. 619 (1993)Stevens, J., concurringThe State's references to petitioner's post-Miranda silencewere infrequent, comprising less than two pages of the900-page trial transcript in this case. And in view of theState's extensive and permissible references to petitioner'spre-Miranda silence--i. e., his failure to mention anythingabout the shooting being an accident to the officer who foundhim in the ditch, the man who gave him a ride to Winona, orthe officers who eventually arrested him--its referencesto petitioner's postMiranda silence were, in effect, cumulative. Moreover, the State's evidence of guilt was, if notoverwhelming, certainly weighty. The path of the bulletthrough Mr. Hartman's body was inconsistent with petition-er's testimony that the rifle had discharged as he was falling.The police officers who searched the Hartmans' home foundnothing in the downstairs hallway that could have causedpetitioner to trip. The rifle was found outside the house(where Hartman was shot), not inside where petitionerclaimed it had accidently fired, and there was a live roundrammed in the gun's chamber, suggesting that petitionerhad tried to fire a second shot. Finally, other circumstantialevidence, including the motive proffered by the State, alsopointed to petitioner's guilt.In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the Doyle errorthat occurred at petitioner's trial did not "substantial[ly] . . .influence" the jury's verdict. Petitioner is therefore notentitled to habeas relief, and the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is
