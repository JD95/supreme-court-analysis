Invoking this Court's original jurisdiction, the Common-wealth of Virginia seeks a declaration that it has a right towithdraw water from the Potomac River and to constructimprovements appurtenant to the Virginia shore free fromregulation by the State of Maryland. We granted Virginialeave to file a complaint, 530 U. S. 1201 (2000), and referredthe action to a Special Master, 531 U. S. 922 (2001). TheSpecial Master filed a Report recommending that we grantthe relief sought by Virginia. Maryland has filed exceptionsto that Report.Rising in the Appalachian Highlands of Maryland andWest Virginia, the Potomac River (River) flows nearly 400miles before emptying into Chesapeake Bay. For the lowerpart of its course, it forms the boundary between Marylandand the District of Columbia on the north, and West Virginiaand Virginia on the south.Control of the River has been disputed for nearly 400years. In the 17th century, both Maryland and Virginia laidclaim to the River pursuant to conflicting royal charters issued by different British monarchs. See Maryland v. WestVirginia, 217 U. S. 1, 24-29 (1910); Morris v. United States,174 U. S. 196, 223-225 (1899).Virginia traced her claim primarily to the 1609 charter is-sued by King James I to the London Company, and to a 1688patent for Virginia's Northern Neck, issued by King JamesII to Lord Thomas Culpeper.West Virginia, supra, at28-29; Morris, 174 U. S., at 223-224. Both the 1609 charterand the 1688 patent included the entire Potomac River.Id.,at 223.

In October of that same year,Maryland passed a resolution at a convention of her constitutional delegates that rejected the reservation in Virginia'sConstitution. Proceedings of the Conventions of the Province of Maryland, held at the City of Annapolis, in 1774, 1775,1776, pp. 292-293 (J. Lucas & E. Deaver eds. 1836).

Ofparticular relevance to this case, Article Seventh provided:"The citizens of each state respectively shall have fullproperty in the shores of Potowmack river adjoiningtheir lands, with all emoluments and advantages there-unto belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out wharves and other improvements, so as not toobstruct or injure the navigation of the river."Ibid.Although the 1785 Compact resolved many important nav-igational and jurisdictional issues, it did not determine theboundary line between the States, an issue that was "left . . .open to long continued disputes."Marine Railway & CoalCo. v.

West Virginia,217 U. S. 577, 579 (1910). On January 16, 1877, the arbitrators issued their award (hereinafter Black-Jenkins Award orAward), placing the boundary at the low-water mark on theVirginia shore of the Potomac.2 Although Maryland wasthus granted ownership of the entire bed of the River, Article Fourth of the Award further provided:"Virginia is entitled not only to full dominion over thesoil to low-water mark on the south shore of the Potomac, but has a right to such use of the river beyond theline of low-water mark as may be necessary to the full2 The "low-water mark" of a river is defined as "the point to which thewater recedes at its lowest stage."

MARYLANDOpinion of the Courtwas designed to improve water quality for Fairfax Countyresidents. Several Maryland officials opposed Virginia'sconstruction proposal, arguing that it would harm Maryland's interests by facilitating urban sprawl in Virginia. Inlate 1997, the Maryland Department of the Environment(MDE) refused to issue the permit, holding that Virginia hadnot demonstrated a sufficient need for the offshore intake.This marked the first time Maryland had denied such a permit to a Virginia entity. Virginia pursued MDE administrative appeals for more than two years, arguing at each stagethat it was entitled to build the water intake structure underthe 1785 Compact and the Black-Jenkins Award. In February 2000, Virginia, still lacking a permit, sought leave to filea bill of complaint in this Court, which we granted on March30, 2000.4 Ultimately, the MDE's "Final Decision Maker"determined that Virginia had demonstrated a sufficient needfor the project.

Rather, Maryland asserted that, assovereign over the River to the low-water mark, it was enti-tled to regulate Virginia's exercise of these rights.5 Ibid.Maryland further argued that even if the 1785 Compact andthe Award granted Virginia unrestricted rights of waterwayconstruction and water withdrawal, Virginia lost thoserights by acquiescing in Maryland's regulation of activitieson the Potomac.The Special Master recommended that we grant the reliefsought by Virginia. Interpreting the 1785 Compact and theBlack-Jenkins Award, he concluded that these two documents not only gave citizens of Virginia the right to con-struct improvements from their riparian property into theRiver, but gave the Commonwealth of Virginia the right touse the River beyond the low-water mark as necessary to thefull enjoyment of her riparian rights. The Special Masterrejected Maryland's claimed authority to regulate Virginia'sexercise of her rights, finding no support for that proposi-tion in either the 1785 Compact or the Award. Finally, theSpecial Master rejected Maryland's defense of acquiescenceby Virginia.Maryland filed exceptions to the Report of the SpecialMaster.

MARYLANDOpinion of the CourtAward govern the instant controversy. Determiningwhether Virginia's rights are subject to Maryland's regulatory authority obviously requires resort to those documents.We interpret a congressionally approved interstate compact"[ j]ust as if [we] were addressing a federal statute." NewJersey v. New York, 523 U. S. 767, 811 (1998); see also ibid.("[C]ongressional consent `transforms an interstate compact. . . into a law of the United States' " (quotingCuyler v.Adams, 449 U. S. 433, 438 (1981))). Article Seventh of the1785 Compact provides:"The citizens of each state respectively shall have fullproperty in the shores of Potowmack river adjoiningtheir lands, with all emoluments and advantages there-unto belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out wharves and other improvements, so as not toobstruct or injure the navigation of the river." Va.Code Ann. Compacts App., pp. 342-343.The plain language of Article Seventh thus grants to the "cit-izens of each state" "full property" rights in the "shores ofPotowmack river" and the "privilege" of building "improve-ments" from the shore. Notably absent is any grant or recognition of sovereign authority to regulate the exercise ofthis "privilege" of the "citizens of each state." The lack ofsuch a grant of regulatory authority in the first clause ofArticle Seventh contrasts with the second clause of ArticleSeventh and Article Eighth, which also recognized a rightheld by the "citizens" of each State:"[T]he right of fishing in the river shall be common to,and equally enjoyed by, the citizens of both states . . . .Eighth. All laws and regulations which may be neces-sary for the preservation of fish . . . shall be made withthe mutual consent and approbation of both states."Id., at 343.Thus, while the Article Seventh right to build improvementswas not explicitly subjected to any sovereign regulatory au540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 540 U. S. 56 (2003)Opinion of the Courtthority, the fishing right in the same article was subjected tomutually agreed-upon regulation. We agree with Virginiathat these differing approaches to rights contained in thesame article of the 1785 Compact indicate that the drafterscarefully delineated the instances in which the citizens of oneState would be subject to the regulatory authority of theother. Other portions of the 1785 Compact reflect this design. See Article Fourth (providing that certain vessels"may enter and trade in any part of either state, with a permit from the naval-officer of the district from which suchvessel departs with her cargo . . ."); Article Eighth (providing for joint regulation of navigation on the River); ArticleNinth (providing for a bistate commission to govern the erection of "light houses, beacons, buoys, or other signals"). Id.,at 342-343. If any inference at all is to be drawn from Article Seventh's silence on the subject of regulatory authority,we think it is that each State was left to regulate the activities of her own citizens.Maryland, however, argues that we must read Article Seventh's regulatory silence in her favor because her sovereignty over the River was "well-settled" by the time the1785 Compact was drafted. Exceptions of Maryland to Report of Special Master 19 (hereinafter Md. Brief). Marylandis doubtless correct that if her sovereignty over the Riverwas well settled as of 1785, we would apply a strong presumption against reading the Compact as stripping her authority to regulate activities on the River. See, e. g., Massachusetts v. New York, 271 U. S. 65, 89 (1926) ("[D]ominionover navigable waters, and property in the soil under them,are so identified with the exercise of the sovereign powersof government that a presumption against their separationfrom sovereignty must be indulged"). But we reject Maryland's historical premise.Each State has produced reams of historical evidence tosupport its respective view about the status of sovereigntyover the River as of 1785. We need not delve deeply into540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 VIRGINIA v. MARYLANDOpinion of the Courtthis historical record to decide this issue. Our own casesrecognize that the scope of Maryland's sovereignty over theRiver was in dispute both before and after the 1785 Compact.Morris, upon which Maryland relies, does not supporther argument. Therein, we observed that "[o]wing to theconflicting descriptions, as respected the Potomac River,contained in [the] royal grants, a controversy early arosebetween Virginia and Maryland." 174 U. S., at 224. Whilethe 1785 Compact resolved certain jurisdictional issues,it did not determine the boundary between the States.Ibid. Accordingly, the controversy over sovereignty was"still continuing . . . in 1874."Ibid. In Marine Railway,we likewise acknowledged that even after the 1785 Compact,"the question of boundary" was left "open to long continueddisputes." 257 U. S., at 64. See also Rhode Island, 12 Pet.,at 723 ("Maryland and Virginia were contending aboutboundaries in 1835 . . . and the dispute is yet an open one [in1838]"). Morris did ultimately decide that Maryland's 1632charter included the Potomac River from shore to shore, 174U. S., at 225, but this conclusion, reached in 1899, hardly ne-gates our statements in that and other cases recognizing thatthe dispute over the interstate boundary continued well intothe 19th century.The mere existence of the 1785 Compact further beliesMaryland's argument. After all, the 1785 Compact sought"to regulate and settle the jurisdiction and navigation" ofthe River. 1785-1786 Md. Laws ch. 1 (preamble). This endeavor would hardly have been required if, as Marylandclaims, her well-settled sovereignty gave her exclusive authority to regulate all activity on the River.6 Nowhere isthis more clear than with respect to the Article Seventhright of Virginia citizens to build improvements from theVirginia shore. In 1776, Virginia had purported to reserve6 For example, if Maryland had well-settled exclusive jurisdiction overthe River, it certainly would not have agreed to joint regulation of fishingas it did in Article Eighth of the 1785 Compact.540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 540 U.

Const., Art. XXI, reprinted in 9 W. Hening's Statutes atLarge 118. It would be anomalous to conclude that Maryland's sovereign authority to regulate the construction ofsuch improvements was so well established a mere nineyears later that the 1785 Compact's drafters did not evenneed to mention it.Accordingly, we read the 1785 Compact in light of the on-going dispute over sovereignty. Article Seventh simplyguaranteed that the citizens of each State would retainthe right to build wharves and improvements regardless ofwhich State ultimately was determined to be sovereign overthe River. That would not be decided until the BlackJenkins Award of 1877.The Black-Jenkins arbitrators held that Maryland was sovereign over the River to the low-water mark on the Virginiashore. See Act of Mar. 3, 1879, ch. 196, 20 Stat. 481-482."[I]n further explanation of this award, the arbitratorsdeem[ed] it proper to add" four articles, id., at 482, the lastof which provides:" `Virginia is entitled not only to full dominion over thesoil to low-water mark on the south shore of the Potomac, but has a right to such use of the river beyond theline of low-water mark as may be necessary to the fullenjoyment of her riparian ownership, without impedingthe navigation or otherwise interfering with the properuse of it by Maryland, agreeably to the compact of seventeen hundred and eighty-five.' " Ibid.Unlike the 1785 Compact's Article Seventh, which concernedthe rights of citizens, the plain language of Article Fourth ofthe Award gives Virginia, as a sovereign State, the right touse the River beyond the low-water mark. Nothing in Article Fourth suggests that Virginia's rights are subject to540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN70 VIRGINIA v. MARYLANDOpinion of the CourtMaryland's regulation. Indeed, Virginia's riparian rightsare limited only by Maryland's right of "proper use" and theproviso that Virginia not "imped[e] . . . navigation," limitations that hardly would have been necessary if Maryland retained the authority to regulate Virginia's actions. Maryland argues, however, that the Black-Jenkins Award simplyconfirmed her well-settled ownership of the Potomac, andthus the rights granted to Virginia in Article Fourth are subject to Maryland's regulatory authority.We have already rejected Maryland's contention that theextent of her sovereignty over the Potomac was well settledbefore the 1785 Compact. Similarly, we fail to see whyMaryland and Virginia would have submitted to binding arbitration "for the purpose of ascertaining and fixing theboundary" between them if that boundary was already wellsettled. Id., at 481 (preamble). Indeed, the opinion issuedby the arbitrators dispels any doubt that sovereignty was indispute, and confirms that Virginia's Article Fourth rightsare sovereign rights not subject to Maryland's regulation.At the beginning of their opinion, the arbitrators explainedthat their task was to "ascertain what boundaries were assigned to Maryland" by her 1632 charter. Black-JenkinsOpinion (1877), App. to Report, p. D-2. The arbitratorsthen outlined the extent of the existing dispute over theboundary:"The State of Virginia, through her Commissioners andother public authorities, adhered for many years to herclaim for a boundary on the left bank of the Potomac.But the gentlemen who represent her before us expressed with great candor their own opinion that a trueinterpretation of the King's concession would divide theriver between the States by a line running in the middleof it. This latter view they urged upon us with allproper earnestness, and it was opposed with equal zealby the counsel for Maryland, who contended that the540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN71Cite as: 540 U. S. 56 (2003)Opinion of the Courtwhole river was within the limits of the grant to LordBaltimore."Id., at D-7.Thus, contrary to Maryland's assertion, sovereignty over theRiver was hotly contested at the time of the arbitration.We see no reason, therefore, to depart from Article Fourth'splain language, which grants to Virginia the sovereign rightto use the River beyond the low-water mark.The reasoning contained in the Black-Jenkins Opinion confirms the plain language of Article Fourth of the Award. Al-though the arbitrators initially determined that the boundary contained in the 1632 charter was the high-water markon the Virginia shore,id., at D-9, they ultimately held thatVirginia had gained ownership by prescription of the soil upto the low-water mark,id., at D-18. In the same paragraph,the arbitrators explained that Virginia had a sovereign rightto build improvements appurtenant to her shore:"The evidence is sufficient to show that Virginia, fromthe earliest period of her history, used the South bankof the Potomac as if the soil to low water-mark had beenher own. She did not give this up by her Constitutionof 1776, when she surrendered other claims within thecharter limits of Maryland; but on the contrary, she ex-pressly reserved `the property of the Virginia shores orstrands bordering on either of said rivers, (Potomac andPocomoke,) and all improvements which have or will bemade thereon.' By the compact of 1785, Maryland as-sented to this, and declared that `the citizens of eachState respectively shall have full property on the shoresof Potomac and adjoining their lands, with all emoluments and advantages thereunto belonging, and theprivilege of making and carrying out wharves and otherimprovements.' . . . Taking all together, we considerit established that Virginia has a proprietory right onthe south shore to low water-mark, and, appurtenantthereto, has a privilege to erect any structures con540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN72 VIRGINIA v. MARYLANDOpinion of the Courtnected with the shore which may be necessary to thefull enjoyment of her riparian ownership, and whichshall not impede the free navigation or other commonuse of the river as a public highway."To that extent Virginia has shown her rights on theriver so clearly as to make them indisputable." Id., atD-18 to D-19.The arbitrators did not differentiate between Virginia's do-minion over the soil and her right to construct improvementsbeyond low-water mark. Indeed, Virginia's right "to erect. . . structures connected with the shore" is inseparable from,and "necessary to," the "full enjoyment of her riparian own-ership" of the soil to low-water mark.Ibid. Like her own-ership of the soil, Virginia gained the waterway constructionright by a long period of prescription. That right was "re-served" in her 1776 Constitution, "assented to" by Marylandin the 1785 Compact, and "indisputabl[y]" shown by Virginia.Ibid. Thus, the right to use the River beyond low-watermark is a right of Virginia qua sovereign, and was nowheremade subject to Maryland's regulatory authority. Mary-land's necessary concession that Virginia owns the soil tolow-water mark must also doom her claim that Virginia doesnot possess riparian rights appurtenant to those lands to construct improvements beyond the low-water mark and other-wise make use of the water in the River.77 The sovereign character of Virginia's Article Fourth riparian rights isfurther confirmed by the proposal of Maryland's representatives beforethe arbitrators. Maryland contended that the "true" boundary lineshould be drawn around "all wharves and other improvements now extending or which may hereafter be extended, by authority of Virginia fromthe Virginia shore into the [Potomac] beyond low water mark."

S. 56 (2003)Opinion of the CourtWe reject Maryland's remaining arguments. Maryland,as well asJustice Stevens, post, at 81 (dissenting opinion),contends that the Award merely confirmed the private property rights enjoyed by Virginia citizens under Article Sev-enth of the 1785 Compact and the common law, which rightsare in turn subject to Maryland's regulation as sovereignover the River. The arbitration proceedings, however, wereconvened to "ascertai[n] and fi[x] the boundary" between co-equal sovereigns, 20 Stat. 481 (preamble), not to adjudicatethe property rights of private citizens. Neither MarylandnorJustice Stevens provides any reason to believe thearbitrators were addressing private property rights whenthey awarded "Virginia" a right to use the River beyond thelow-water mark. Their interpretation, moreover, rendersArticle Fourth duplicative of the 1785 Compact and the com-mon law (which secured riparian owners' property rights)and the rest of the Black-Jenkins Award (which grantedMaryland sovereignty to low-water mark).8 Only by readto fix the boundary without the necessity of arbitration, Maryland's commissioners took the same position, which they described as follows:"The line along the Potomac River is described in our first propositionaccording to our construction of the compact of 1785, and as we are informed, is according to the general understanding of the citizens of bothStates residing upon or owning lands bordering on the shores of that river,and also in accordance with the actual claim and exercise of jurisdictionby the authorities of the two States hitherto." Id., at L-14 (Report andJournal of Proceedings of the Joint Commissioners to Adjust the BoundaryLine of the States of Maryland and Virginia 27 (1874)).Although the arbitrators did not accept Maryland's proposal to preserveVirginia's sovereign right to build improvements by including them withinVirginia's territory, they accomplished the same result in Article Fourthof the Award.8 Similarly, Justice Kennedy does not adequately explain why ArticleFourth--part of a document that grants unrestricted sovereign rights--would merely "affir[m] that Virginia, as much as its citizens, has riparianrights under the 1785 Compact," post, at 87 (dissenting opinion), whenVirginia, as owner of the soil to low-water mark, already possessed suchrights under the common law.540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN74 VIRGINIA v. MARYLANDOpinion of the Courting Article Fourth in accord with its plain language can thisCourt give effect to each portion of the Award. See, e. g.,TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U. S. 19, 31 (2001) ("It is `a cardi-nal principle of statutory construction' that `a statute ought,upon the whole, to be so construed that, if it can be pre-vented, no clause, sentence, or word shall be superfluous,void, or insignificant' ") (quoting Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S.167, 174 (2001) (some internal quotation marks omitted)).Relatedly, Maryland argues that the Award could not have"elevate[d]," Md. Brief 29, the private property rights of the1785 Compact to sovereign rights because the arbitratorsdisclaimed "authority for the construction of this compact,"Black-Jenkins Opinion (1877), App. to Report, at D-18.Again, Maryland mischaracterizes the arbitrators' decision.In granting Virginia sovereign riparian rights, the arbitra-tors did not construe or alter any private rights under the1785 Compact; rather, they held that Virginia had gainedsovereign rights by prescription.Finally, Maryland notes that under Article Fourth of theAward, Virginia must exercise her riparian rights on theRiver " `without impeding the navigation or otherwise inter-fering with the proper use of it by Maryland . . . .' " 20Stat. 482 (emphasis added). Maryland suggests that thislanguage indicates her continuing regulatory authority overVirginia's exercise of her riparian rights. This seems to usa strained reading. The far more natural reading accordswith the plain language of the Award and opinion: Marylandand Virginia each has a sovereign right to build improvements appurtenant to her own shore and to withdraw water,without interfering with the "proper use of " the River bythe other.99 Federal common law governs interstate bodies of water, ensuring thatthe water is equitably apportioned between the States and that neitherState harms the other's interest in the river. See, e. g., Colorado v. NewMexico, 459 U. S. 176, 183 (1982) ("Equitable apportionment is the doctrine540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN75Cite as: 540 U. S. 56 (2003)Opinion of the CourtJustice Kennedy, while acknowledging that Virginia hasa right to use the River, argues that Maryland may regulateVirginia's riparian usage so long as she does not exclude Virginia from the River altogether. Post, p. 82 (dissentingopinion). To reach this conclusion, he reasons that theBlack-Jenkins Opinion rested Virginia's prescriptive riparianrights solely on Maryland's assent to the riparian rightsgranted to private citizens in the 1785 Compact. Post, at87-89. According to Justice Kennedy, therefore, "Virginia's claims under Black-Jenkins rise as high as the Compactbut no higher." Post, at 89.We have already held that the Award's plain language permits no inference of Maryland's regulatory authority, supra,at 69-70; we also disagree that the arbitrators relied solelyon the 1785 Compact as support for Virginia's prescriptiverights. To the contrary, the arbitrators' opinion also reliedupon Virginia's riparian usage "from the earliest period ofher history" and her express reservation in her 1776 Constitution of the unrestricted right to build improvements fromthe Virginia shore. Black-Jenkins Opinion (1877), App. toReport, at D-18. Indeed, since the arbitrators disclaimed"authority for the construction of [the 1785] compact . . . because nothing which concern[ed] it" was before them, ibid.,it would be anomalous to conclude that Virginia's "sole right"under the Award "stem[s] from," and is "delimited" by,Article Seventh of the Compact. Post, at 90 (Kennedy, J.,dissenting).Accordingly, we conclude that the Black-Jenkins Awardgives Virginia sovereign authority, free from regulation byMaryland, to build improvements appurtenant to her shoreand to withdraw water from the River, subject to the constraints of federal common law and the Award.of federal common law that governs the disputes between States concerning their rights to use the water of an interstate stream").540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN76 VIRGINIA v. MARYLANDOpinion of the CourtWe next consider whether Virginia has lost her sovereignriparian rights by acquiescing in Maryland's regulation ofher water withdrawal and waterway construction activities.We recently considered in depth the "affirmative defense ofprescription and acquiescence" in New Jersey, 523 U. S., at807. To succeed in her defense, Maryland must " `show bya preponderance of the evidence . . . a long and continuous. . . assertion of sovereignty over' " Virginia's riparian activi-ties, as well as Virginia's acquiescence in her prescriptiveacts. Id., at 787 (quoting Illinois v. Kentucky, 500 U. S. 380,384 (1991)). Maryland has not carried her burden.Although "we have never established a minimum period ofprescription" necessary for one State to prevail over a coequal sovereign on a claim of prescription and acquiescence,New Jersey, 523 U. S., at 789, we have noted that the periodmust be "substantial," id., at 786. Maryland asserts that inthe 125 years since the Black-Jenkins Award, Virginia hasacquiesced in her pervasive exercise of police power overactivities occurring on piers and wharves beyond the lowwater mark. Among other things, Maryland claims, andVirginia does not dispute, that it has taxed structureserected on such improvements (i. e., restaurants, etc.); issuedlicenses for activities occurring thereon (i. e., liquor, gambling, etc.); and exercised exclusive criminal jurisdiction overcrimes occurring on such improvements beyond the lowwater mark. We agree with the Special Master that thisevidence has little or no bearing on the narrower questionwhether Virginia acquiesced in Maryland's efforts to regulate her right to construct the improvements in the firstinstance and to withdraw water from the River. See Report 79-82. With respect to Maryland's regulation of theseparticular rights, the claimed prescriptive period is muchshorter.It is undisputed that Maryland issued her first water withdrawal permit to a Virginia entity in March 1957 and herfirst waterway construction permit in April 1968. The pre540US1 Unit: $$U6 [11-01-05 11:12:29] PAGES PGT: OPIN77Cite as: 540 U. S. 56 (2003)Opinion of the Courtscriptive period ended, at the latest, in February 2000, whenVirginia sought leave to file a bill of complaint in this Court.Accordingly, Maryland has asserted a right to regulate Vir-ginia's water withdrawal for, at most, 43 years, and a right toregulate waterway construction for, at most, 32 years. Onlyonce before have we deemed such a short period of timesufficient to prove prescription in a case involving our origi-nal jurisdiction. SeeNebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584,594-595 (1993) (41 years). In that case, we held that Nebraska's sovereign right to water stored in certain inlandlakes was established by a decree issued in 1945. Id., at 595.We held, in the alternative, that "Wyoming's arguments areforeclosed by its postdecree acquiescence" for 41 years.Ibid. Here, it is Virginia's sovereign right that was clearlyestablished by a prior agreement, and Maryland that seeksto defeat those rights by showing Virginia's acquiescence.Under these circumstances, it is far from clear that such ashort prescriptive period is sufficient as a matter of law.Cf.New Jersey, 523 U. S., at 789 (noting that a prescriptiveperiod of 64 years is "not insufficient as a matter of generallaw"). But even assuming such a short prescriptive periodwould be adequate to overcome a sovereign right granted ina federally approved interstate compact, Maryland's claimfails because it has not proved Virginia's acquiescence.To succeed on the acquiescence prong of her defense,Maryland must show that Virginia "failed to protest" her assertion of sovereign authority over waterway constructionand water withdrawal. Id., at 807.10 As the Special Masterfound, however, Virginia vigorously protested Maryland's as-serted authority during the negotiations that led to the passage of $ 181 of the Water Resources Development Act of1976 (WRDA), 90 Stat. 2939-2940, codified at 42 U. S. C.$ 1962d-11a.10 Maryland's evidence that Virginia has never operated a permittingsystem for water withdrawal or waterway construction is insufficient tosatisfy Maryland's burden.
