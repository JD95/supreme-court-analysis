In this case we consider whether an airport terminal oper-ated by a public authority is a public forum and whether aregulation prohibiting solicitation in the interior of an air-port terminal violates the First Amendment.The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute.

Ibid.Respondent Walter Lee, now deceased, was the policesuperintendent of the Port Authority of New York and NewJersey and was charged with enforcing the regulation atissue. The Port Authority owns and operates three majorairports in the greater New York City area: John F. KennedyInternational Airport (Kennedy), La Guardia Airport (LaGuardia), and Newark International Airport (Newark). Thethree airports collectively form one of the world's busiestmetropolitan airport complexes. They serve approximately8% of this country's domestic airline market and more than50% of the trans-Atlantic market. By decade's end they areexpected to serve at least 110 million passengers annually.Id., at 578.The airports are funded by user fees and operated to makea regulated profit. Id., at 581. Most space at the three airports is leased to commercial airlines, which bear primaryresponsibility for the leasehold. The Port Authority retainscontrol over unleased portions, including La Guardia's Cen-tral Terminal Building, portions of Kennedy's InternationalArrivals Building, and Newark's North Terminal Building(we refer to these areas collectively as the "terminals").The terminals are generally accessible to the general publicand contain various commercial establishments such as restaurants, snack stands, bars, newsstands, and stores of vari-ous types. Id., at 578. Virtually all who visit the terminalsdo so for purposes related to air travel. These visitors prin-cipally include passengers, those meeting or seeing off passengers, flight crews, and terminal employees. Ibid.The Port Authority has adopted a regulation forbiddingwithin the terminals the repetitive solicitation of money ordistribution of literature. The regulation states:"1. The following conduct is prohibited within the inte-rior areas of buildings or structures at an air terminal505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT676 INTERNATIONAL SOC.

Id., at578-579.The regulation governs only the terminals; the Port Au-thority permits solicitation and distribution on the sidewalksoutside the terminal buildings. The regulation effectivelyprohibits ISKCON from performing sankirtan in the terminals. As a result, ISKCON brought suit seeking declara-tory and injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, allegingthat the regulation worked to deprive its members of rightsguaranteed under the First Amendment.1 The DistrictCourt analyzed the claim under the "traditional publicforum" doctrine. It concluded that the terminals were akinto public streets, 721 F. Supp. 572, 577 (SDNY 1989), thequintessential traditional public fora. This conclusion inturn meant that the Port Authority's terminal regulationcould be sustained only if it was narrowly tailored to supporta compelling state interest. Id., at 579. In the absence ofany argument that the blanket prohibition constituted such1 The suit was filed in 1975. ISKCON originally sought access to boththe airline controlled areas and to the terminals and as a result sued bothrespondent and various private airlines. The suit worked a meanderingcourse, see 721 F. Supp. 572, 573-574 (SDNY 1989), with the private airlines eventually being dismissed and leaving, as the sole remaining issue,ISKCON's claim against respondent seeking a declaration and injunctionagainst the regulation. The regulation at issue was not formally promulgated until 1988 although it represents a codification of presuit policy.App. to Pet. for Cert. 52. As noted in the text, supra this page, respondent concedes that sankirtan may be performed on the sidewalks outsidethe terminals.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT677Cite as: 505 U.

Relying on our recent decisionin United States v. Kokinda, 497 U. S. 720 (1990), a dividedpanel concluded that the terminals are not public fora. Asa result, the restrictions were required only to satisfy astandard of reasonableness. The Court of Appeals then concluded that, presented with the issue, this Court would findthat the ban on solicitation was reasonable, but the ban ondistribution was not. ISKCON and one of its members, alsoa petitioner here, sought certiorari respecting the Court ofAppeals' decision that the terminals are not public fora andupholding the solicitation ban. Respondent cross-petitionedrespecting the court's holding striking down the distributionban. We granted both petitions, 502 U.

But it is also wellsettled that the government need not permit all forms ofspeech on property that it owns and controls. Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U. S. 114, 129(1981);Greer v. Spock, 424 U. S. 828 (1976). Where the government is acting as a proprietor, managing its internal op-erations, rather than acting as lawmaker with the power toregulate or license, its action will not be subjected to theheightened review to which its actions as a lawmaker may besubject. Kokinda, supra, at 725 (plurality opinion) (citingCafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886,896 (1961)). Thus, we have upheld a ban on political advertisements in city-operated transit vehicles, Lehman v.Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 (1974), even though the citypermitted other types of advertising on those vehicles.Similarly, we have permitted a school district to limit accessto an internal mail system used to communicate with teachers employed by the district. Perry Ed. Assn. v. PerryLocal Educators' Assn., 460 U. S. 37 (1983).These cases reflect, either implicitly or explicitly, a "forumbased" approach for assessing restrictions that the government seeks to place on the use of its property. Cornelius v.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800(1985). Under this approach, regulation of speech on government property that has traditionally been available forpublic expression is subject to the highest scrutiny. Suchregulations survive only if they are narrowly drawn toachieve a compelling state interest. Perry, 460 U. S., at 45.The second category of public property is the designatedpublic forum, whether of a limited or unlimited character--property that the State has opened for expressive activityby part or all of the public. Ibid. Regulation of such property is subject to the same limitations as that governing atraditional public forum. Id., at 46. Finally, there is all re505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT679Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmaining public property. Limitations on expressive activityconducted on this last category of property must surviveonly a much more limited review. The challenged regula-tion need only be reasonable, as long as the regulation is notan effort to suppress the speaker's activity due to disagree-ment with the speaker's view.Ibid.The parties do not disagree that this is the proper framework. Rather, they disagree whether the airport terminalsare public fora or nonpublic fora. They also disagreewhether the regulation survives the "reasonableness" reviewgoverning nonpublic fora, should that prove the appropriatecategory.4 Like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that theterminals are nonpublic fora and that the regulation reasonably limits solicitation.The suggestion that the government has a high burden injustifying speech restrictions relating to traditional publicfora made its first appearance inHague v. Committee forIndustrial Organization, 307 U. S. 496, 515, 516 (1939). Justice Roberts, concluding that individuals have a right to use"streets and parks for communication of views," reasonedthat such a right flowed from the fact that "streets and parks. . . have immemorially been held in trust for the use of thepublic and, time out of mind, have been used for purposesof assembly, communicating thoughts between citizens, anddiscussing public questions." We confirmed this observa-tion inFrisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 481 (1988), where weheld that a residential street was a public forum.Our recent cases provide additional guidance on the char-acteristics of a public forum. In Cornelius we noted that atraditional public forum is property that has as "a principalpurpose . . . the free exchange of ideas." 473 U. S., at 800.Moreover, consistent with the notion that the government--like other property owners--"has power to preserve the4 Respondent also argues that the regulations survive under the strictscrutiny applicable to public fora. We find it unnecessary to reach thatquestion.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT680 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNACONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEEOpinion of the Courtproperty under its control for the use to which it is lawfullydedicated,"Greer, 424 U. S., at 836, the government does notcreate a public forum by inaction. Nor is a public forumcreated "whenever members of the public are permittedfreely to visit a place owned or operated by the Government." Ibid. The decision to create a public forum mustinstead be made "by intentionally opening a nontraditionalforum for public discourse." Cornelius, supra, at 802. Fi-nally, we have recognized that the location of property alsohas bearing because separation from acknowledged publicareas may serve to indicate that the separated property isa special enclave, subject to greater restriction. UnitedStates v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 179-180 (1983).These precedents foreclose the conclusion that airportterminals are public fora. Reflecting the general growth ofthe air travel industry, airport terminals have only recentlyachieved their contemporary size and character. See H.Hubbard, M. McClintock, & F. Williams, Airports: Their Location, Administration and Legal Basis 8 (1930) (noting thatthe United States had only 807 airports in 1930). But giventhe lateness with which the modern air terminal has made itsappearance, it hardly qualifies for the description of having"immemorially . . . time out of mind" been held in the publictrust and used for purposes of expressive activity. Hague,supra, at 515. Moreover, even within the rather short history of air transport, it is only "[i]n recent years [that] it hasbecome a common practice for various religious and nonprofit organizations to use commercial airports as a forumfor the distribution of literature, the solicitation of funds, theproselytizing of new members, and other similar activities."45 Fed. Reg. 35314 (1980). Thus, the tradition of airport activity does not demonstrate that airports have historicallybeen made available for speech activity. Nor can we saythat these particular terminals, or airport terminals generally, have been intentionally opened by their operators tosuch activity; the frequent and continuing litigation evidenc505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT681Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)Opinion of the Courting the operators' objections belies any such claim. See n. 2,supra. In short, there can be no argument that society'stime-tested judgment, expressed through acquiescence in acontinuing practice, has resolved the issue in petitioners'favor.Petitioners attempt to circumvent the history and practicegoverning airport activity by pointing our attention to thevariety of speech activity that they claim historically oc-curred at various "transportation nodes" such as rail stations, bus stations, wharves, and Ellis Island. Even if wewere inclined to accept petitioners' historical account describing speech activity at these locations, an account respondent contests, we think that such evidence is of littleimport for two reasons. First, much of the evidence is irrelevant to public fora analysis, because sites such as bus andrail terminals traditionally have had private ownership.See United Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455U. S. 678, 687 (1982); H. Grant & C. Bohi, The Country Railroad Station in America 11-15 (1978); U. S. Dept. of Transportation, The Intercity Bus Terminal Study 31 (Dec. 1984).The development of privately owned parks that ban speechactivity would not change the public fora status of publiclyheld parks. But the reverse is also true. The practices ofprivately held transportation centers do not bear on thegovernment's regulatory authority over a publicly ownedairport.Second, the relevant unit for our inquiry is an airport, not"transportation nodes" generally. When new methods oftransportation develop, new methods for accommodatingthat transportation are also likely to be needed. And witheach new step, it therefore will be a new inquiry whetherthe transportation necessities are compatible with variouskinds of expressive activity. To make a category of "transportation nodes," therefore, would unjustifiably elide whatmay prove to be critical differences of which we should rightfully take account. The "security magnet," for example, is505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT682 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNACONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEEOpinion of the Courtan airport commonplace that lacks a counterpart in busterminals and train stations. And public access to air terminals is also not infrequently restricted--just last yearthe Federal Aviation Administration required airports fora 4-month period to limit access to areas normally publiclyaccessible. See 14 CFR 107.11(f ) (1991) and U. S. Dept. ofTransportation News Release, Office of Assistant Secretaryfor Public Affairs, Jan. 18, 1991. To blithely equate air-ports with other transportation centers, therefore, would bea mistake.The differences among such facilities are unsurprisingsince, as the Court of Appeals noted, airports are commercialestablishments funded by users fees and designed to make aregulated profit, 925 F. 2d, at 581, and where nearly all whovisit do so for some travel related purpose, id., at 578. Ascommercial enterprises, airports must provide services attractive to the marketplace. In light of this, it cannot fairlybe said that an airport terminal has as a principal purposepromoting "the free exchange of ideas." Cornelius v.NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788, 800(1985). To the contrary, the record demonstrates that PortAuthority management considers the purpose of the terminals to be the facilitation of passenger air travel, not thepromotion of expression. Sloane Affidavit, || 11, App. 464;Defendant's Civil Rule 3(g) Statement, || 39, App. 453. Evenif we look beyond the intent of the Port Authority to themanner in which the terminals have been operated, the terminals have never been dedicated (except under the threatof court order) to expression in the form sought to be exercised here: i. e., the solicitation of contributions and the distribution of literature.The terminals here are far from atypical. Airport builders and managers focus their efforts on providing terminalsthat will contribute to efficient air travel. See, e. g., R. Horonjeff & F. McKelvey, Planning and Design of Airports 326(3d ed. 1983) ("The terminal is used to process passengers505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT683Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)Opinion of the Courtand baggage for the interface with aircraft and the groundtransportation modes"). The Federal Government is in accord; the Secretary of Transportation has been directed topublish a plan for airport development necessary "to anticipate and meet the needs of civil aeronautics, to meet requirements in support of the national defense . . . and to meetidentified needs of the Postal Service." 49 U. S. C. App.$ 2203(a)(1) (emphasis added); see also 45 Fed. Reg. 35317(1980) ("The purpose for which the [Dulles and National airport] terminal[s] [were] built and maintained is to processand serve air travelers efficiently"). Although many airports have expanded their function beyond merely contributing to efficient air travel, few have included among theirpurposes the designation of a forum for solicitation and distribution activities. See supra, at 680-681. Thus, we thinkthat neither by tradition nor purpose can the terminals bedescribed as satisfying the standards we have previously setout for identifying a public forum.The restrictions here challenged, therefore, need only satisfy a requirement of reasonableness. We reiterate what westated in Kokinda: The restriction " `need only be reasonable; it need not be the most reasonable or the only reasonable limitation.' " 497 U. S., at 730 (plurality opinion) (quoting Cornelius, supra, at 808). We have no doubt that underthis standard the prohibition on solicitation passes muster.We have on many prior occasions noted the disruptive effect that solicitation may have on business. "Solicitation requires action by those who would respond: The individualsolicited must decide whether or not to contribute (whichitself might involve reading the solicitor's literature or hearing his pitch), and then, having decided to do so, reach for awallet, search it for money, write a check, or produce a creditcard." Kokinda, supra, at 734; see Heffron, 452 U. S., at 663(Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).Passengers who wish to avoid the solicitor may have to altertheir paths, slowing both themselves and those around them.505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT684 INTERNATIONAL SOC. FOR KRISHNACONSCIOUSNESS, INC. v. LEEOpinion of the CourtThe result is that the normal flow of traffic is impeded. Id.,at 653. This is especially so in an airport, where "[a]irtravelers, who are often weighted down by cumbersome bag-gage . . . may be hurrying to catch a plane or to arrangeground transportation." 925 F. 2d, at 582. Delays may beparticularly costly in this setting, as a flight missed by onlya few minutes can result in hours worth of subsequentinconvenience.In addition, face-to-face solicitation presents risks of duress that are an appropriate target of regulation. The skill-ful, and unprincipled, solicitor can target the most vulnerable, including those accompanying children or those sufferingphysical impairment and who cannot easily avoid the solicitation. See, e. g., International Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, Inc. v. Barber, 506 F. Supp. 147, 159-163 (NDNY 1980),rev'd on other grounds, 650 F. 2d 430 (CA2 1981). The unsavory solicitor can also commit fraud through concealment ofhis affiliation or through deliberate efforts to shortchangethose who agree to purchase. 506 F. Supp., 159-163. See45 Fed. Reg. 35314-35315 (1980). Compounding this problem is the fact that, in an airport, the targets of such activityfrequently are on tight schedules. This in turn makes suchvisitors unlikely to stop and formally complain to airport authorities. As a result, the airport faces considerable difficulty in achieving its legitimate interest in monitoring solicitation activity to assure that travelers are not interferedwith unduly.The Port Authority has concluded that its interest in monitoring the activities can best be accomplished by limiting solicitation and distribution to the sidewalk areas outside theterminals. Sloane Supp. Affidavit, || 11, App. 514. Thissidewalk area is frequented by an overwhelming percentageof airport users, see id., at || 14, App. 515-516 (noting thatno more than 3% of air travelers passing through the terminals are doing so on intraterminal flights, i. e., transferringplanes). Thus the resulting access of those who would so505US3112L 06-12-96 18:30:49 PAGES OPINPGT685Cite as: 505 U. S. 672 (1992)Opinion of O'Connor, J.licit the general public is quite complete. In turn we think itwould be odd to conclude that the Port Authority's terminalregulation is unreasonable despite the Port Authority havingotherwise assured access to an area universally traveled.The inconveniences to passengers and the burdens on PortAuthority officials flowing from solicitation activity mayseem small, but viewed against the fact that "pedestrian con-gestion is one of the greatest problems facing the three terminals," 925 F. 2d, at 582, the Port Authority could reason-ably worry that even such incremental effects would provequite disruptive.5 Moreover, "[t]he justification for the Ruleshould not be measured by the disorder that would resultfrom granting an exemption solely to ISKCON." Heffron,supra, at 652. For if ISKCON is given access, so too mustother groups. "Obviously, there would be a much largerthreat to the State's interest in crowd control if all otherreligious, nonreligious, and noncommercial organizationscould likewise move freely." 452 U. S., at 653. As a result,we conclude that the solicitation ban is reasonable.For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals sustaining the ban on solicitation in Port Authorityterminals is
