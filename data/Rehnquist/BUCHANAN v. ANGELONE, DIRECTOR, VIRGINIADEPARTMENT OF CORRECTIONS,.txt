S. 269 (1998)Opinion of the CourtOn the afternoon of September 15, 1987, Douglas Bu-chanan murdered his father, stepmother, and two youngerbrothers. Buchanan was convicted of the capital murder ofmore than one person as part of the same act or transactionby a jury in the Circuit Court of Amherst County, Virginia.See Va. Code Ann. $ 18.2-31(7) (1996). A separate sentenc-ing hearing was held, in which the prosecutor sought thedeath penalty on the basis of Virginia's aggravating factorthat the crime was vile. See Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-264.3(1995).In his opening statement in this proceeding, the prosecutor told the jury that he would be asking for the death penalty based on vileness. He conceded that Buchanan had hada troubled childhood and informed the jury that it wouldhave to balance the things in petitioner's favor against thecrimes he had committed. App. 25-27. Defense counseloutlined the mitigating evidence he would present and toldthe jury that he was asking that petitioner not be executedbased on that evidence. Id., at 29. For two days, the juryheard evidence from seven defense witnesses and eightprosecution witnesses. Buchanan's witnesses recounted hismother's early death from breast cancer, his father's subsequent remarriage, and his parents' attempts to prevent himfrom seeing his maternal relatives. A psychiatrist also testified that Buchanan was under extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the crime, based largely on stress causedby the manner in which the family had dealt with and reacted to his mother's death. Two mental health experts testified for the prosecution. They agreed generally with thefactual events of petitioner's life but not with their effect onhis commission of the crimes.In closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury that"even if you find that there was that vileness . . . you do nothave to return the death sentence. I will not suggest thatto you." Id., at 43. While admitting the existence of mitigating evidence, and agreeing that the jury had to weigh that522US2 Unit: $U18 [01-28-00 18:06:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN272 BUCHANAN v. ANGELONEOpinion of the Courtevidence against petitioner's conduct, the prosecutor arguedthat the circumstances warranted the death penalty. Id., at43-44, 57-58. Defense counsel also explained the conceptof mitigation and noted that "practically any factor can beconsidered in mitigation." He discussed at length petition-er's lack of prior criminal activity, his extreme mental oremotional disturbance at the time of the offense, his signifi-cantly impaired capacity to appreciate the criminality of hisconduct or to conform his conduct to the law's requirements,and his youth. Counsel argued that these four mitigatingfactors, recognized in the Virginia Code, mitigated Buchan-an's offense.Id., at 59-61, 64-66.The Commonwealth and Buchanan agreed that the courtshould instruct the jury with Virginia's pattern capital sen-tencing instruction.1 That instruction told the jury that before it could fix the penalty at death, the Commonwealth firstmust prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the conduct wasvile. The instruction next stated that if the jury found thatcondition met, "then you may fix the punishment of the Defendant at death or if you believe from all the evidence thatthe death penalty is not justified, then you shall fix the pun1 The complete instruction is as follows:"You have convicted the defendant of an offense which may be punishable by death. You must decide whether the defendant should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment."Before the penalty can be fixed at death, the Commonwealth mustprove beyond a reasonable doubt that his conduct in committing the murders of [his family] was outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman, in that it involved torture, depravity of mind or aggravated batteryto the above four victims, or to any one of them."If you find from the evidence that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt the requirements of the preceding paragraph,then you may fix the punishment of the Defendant at death or if you believe from all the evidence that the death penalty is not justified, then youshall fix the punishment of the Defendant at life imprisonment."If the Commonwealth has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubtthe requirements of the second paragraph in this instruction, then youshall fix the punishment of the Defendant at life imprisonment."

Id., at 73.The instruction then stated that if the jury did not find thecondition met, the jury must impose a life sentence. Thisinstruction was given without objection. Id., at 39.Buchanan requested several additional jury instructions.He proposed four instructions on particular mitigatingfactors--no significant history of prior criminal activity;extreme mental or emotional disturbance; significantly impaired capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conductor to conform his conduct to the law's requirements; and hisage. These four factors are listed as facts in mitigation ofthe offense in the Virginia Code.2 Each of Buchanan's proposed instructions stated that if the jury found the factor toexist, "then that is a fact which mitigates against imposingthe death penalty, and you shall consider that fact in decidingwhether to impose a sentence of death or life imprisonment."Id., at 75-76.3 Buchanan also proposed an instruction stat-ing that, "[i]n addition to the mitigating factors specified inother instructions, you shall consider the circumstances sur-rounding the offense, the history and background of [Buchanan,] and any other facts in mitigation of the offense."Id., at 74. The court refused to give these instructions, relying on Virginia case law holding that it was not proper to2 "Evidence which may be admissible, subject to the rules of evidencegoverning admissibility, may include the circumstances surrounding theoffense, the history and background of the defendant, and any other factsin mitigation of the offense. Facts in mitigation may include, but shallnot be limited to, the following: (i) The defendant has no significant historyof prior criminal activity, (ii) the capital felony was committed while thedefendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, . . . (iv) at the time of the commission of the capital felony, thecapacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct orto conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired, (v) the age of the defendant at the time of the commission of thecapital offense . . . ." Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-264.4(B) (1995) (amended, notin relevant part).3 The proposed instruction on age simply told the jury that petitioner'sage "is a fact which mitigates" that the jury "shall consider." App. 75-76.522US2 Unit: $U18 [01-28-00 18:06:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN274 BUCHANAN v. ANGELONEOpinion of the Courtgive instructions singling out certain mitigating factors tothe sentencing jury.Id., at 39-40.The jury was instructed that once it reached a decision onits two options, imposing a life sentence or imposing thedeath penalty, the foreman should sign the correspondingverdict form. The death penalty verdict form stated thatthe jury had unanimously found petitioner's conduct to bevile and that "having considered the evidence in mitigationof the offense," it unanimously fixed his punishment at death.Id., at 77. When the jury returned with a verdict for thedeath penalty, the court read the verdict form and polledeach juror on his agreement with the verdict.The court, after a statutorily mandated sentencing hearing, see Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-264.5 (1995), subsequently imposed the sentence fixed by the jury. On direct appeal, theVirginia Supreme Court reviewed Buchanan's sentence forproportionality, see Va. Code Ann. $$ 17.110.1-17.110.2 (1996),and affirmed his conviction and death sentence. Buchananv. Commonwealth, 238 Va. 389, 384 S. E. 2d 757 (1989), cert.denied sub nom. Buchanan v. Virginia, 493 U. S. 1063 (1990).Petitioner then sought federal habeas relief. The DistrictCourt denied the petition. The Court of Appeals for theFourth Circuit affirmed. 103 F. 3d 344 (1996). That courtrecognized that the Eighth Amendment requires that a capital sentencing jury's discretion be " `guided and channeled byrequiring examination of specific factors that argue in favorof or against imposition of the death penalty' " in orderto eliminate arbitrariness and capriciousness. Id., at 347(quoting Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 258 (1976)). However, relying on our decision in Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S.862, 890 (1983), and on its own precedent, the court concludedthat the Eighth Amendment does not require States to adoptspecific standards for instructing juries on mitigating circumstances. 103 F. 3d, at 347. It therefore held that byallowing the jury to consider all relevant mitigating evidence, Virginia's sentencing procedure satisfied the Eighth522US2 Unit: $U18 [01-28-00 18:06:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN275Cite as: 522 U. S. 269 (1998)Opinion of the CourtAmendment requirement of individualized sentencing in cap-ital cases.Id., at 347-348. We granted certiorari, 520 U. S.1196 (1997), and now affirm.Petitioner contends that the trial court violated his Eighthand Fourteenth Amendment rights to be free from arbitraryand capricious imposition of the death penalty when it failedto provide the jury with express guidance on the concept ofmitigation, and to instruct the jury on particular statutorilydefined mitigating factors. This lack of guidance, it is argued, renders his sentence constitutionally unacceptable.Petitioner initially recognizes, as he must, that our caseshave distinguished between two different aspects of the capital sentencing process, the eligibility phase and the selectionphase. Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U. S. 967, 971 (1994).In the eligibility phase, the jury narrows the class of defendants eligible for the death penalty, often through consideration of aggravating circumstances. Ibid. In the selectionphase, the jury determines whether to impose a death sentence on an eligible defendant. Id., at 972. Petitioner concedes that it is only the selection phase that is at stake inhis case. He argues, however, that our decisions indicatethat the jury at the selection phase must both have discretion to make an individualized determination and have thatdiscretion limited and channeled. See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 206-207 (1976). He further argues thatthe Eighth Amendment therefore requires the court to instruct the jury on its obligation and authority to considermitigating evidence, and on particular mitigating factorsdeemed relevant by the State.No such rule has ever been adopted by this Court. Whilepetitioner appropriately recognizes the distinction betweenthe eligibility and selection phases, he fails to distinguish thediffering constitutional treatment we have accorded thosetwo aspects of capital sentencing. It is in regard to the eligibility phase that we have stressed the need for channelingand limiting the jury's discretion to ensure that the death522US2 Unit: $U18 [01-28-00 18:06:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN276 BUCHANAN v. ANGELONEOpinion of the Courtpenalty is a proportionate punishment and therefore not ar-bitrary or capricious in its imposition. In contrast, in theselection phase, we have emphasized the need for a broadinquiry into all relevant mitigating evidence to allow an individualized determination. Tuilaepa, supra, at 971-973;Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U. S. 1, 6-7 (1994); McCleskeyv.Kemp, 481 U. S. 279, 304-306 (1987); Stephens, supra, at878-879.In the selection phase, our cases have established that thesentencer may not be precluded from considering, and maynot refuse to consider, any constitutionally relevant mitigating evidence. Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 317-318(1989); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104, 113-114 (1982);Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978). However, thestate may shape and structure the jury's consideration ofmitigation so long as it does not preclude the jury from giving effect to any relevant mitigating evidence. Johnson v.Texas, 509 U. S. 350, 362 (1993); Penry, supra, at 326; Franklin v. Lynaugh, 487 U. S. 164, 181 (1988). Our consistentconcern has been that restrictions on the jury's sentencingdetermination not preclude the jury from being able to giveeffect to mitigating evidence. Thus, in Boyde v. California,494 U. S. 370 (1990), we held that the standard for determining whether jury instructions satisfy these principles was"whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury hasapplied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents theconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence." Id., at380; see also Johnson, supra, at 367-368.But we have never gone further and held that the statemust affirmatively structure in a particular way the mannerin which juries consider mitigating evidence. And indeed,our decisions suggest that complete jury discretion is constitutionally permissible. See Tuilaepa, supra, at 978-979(noting that at the selection phase, the state is not confinedto submitting specific propositional questions to the jury andmay indeed allow the jury unbridled discretion); Stephens,522US2 Unit: $U18 [01-28-00 18:06:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN277Cite as: 522 U. S. 269 (1998)Opinion of the Courtsupra, at 875 (rejecting the argument that a scheme permit-ting the jury to exercise "unbridled discretion" in determining whether to impose the death penalty after it has foundthe defendant eligible is unconstitutional, and noting that accepting that argument would require the Court to overruleGregg, supra).The jury instruction here did not violate these constitutional principles. The instruction did not foreclose thejury's consideration of any mitigating evidence. By directing the jury to base its decision on "all the evidence," theinstruction afforded jurors an opportunity to consider mitigating evidence. The instruction informed the jurors thatif they found the aggravating factor proved beyond a reasonable doubt then they "may fix" the penalty at death, butdirected that if they believed that all the evidence justifieda lesser sentence then they "shall" impose a life sentence.The jury was thus allowed to impose a life sentence evenif it found the aggravating factor proved. Moreover, incontrast to the Texas special issues scheme in question inPenry, supra, at 326, the instructions here did not constrainthe manner in which the jury was able to give effect tomitigation.44 The dissent relies on an argument regarding the Virginia patternsentencing instruction that petitioner belatedly attempted to adopt at oralargument. Post, at 280-284. This claim was waived, since petitionerexpressly agreed to the pattern instruction at trial, the instructionwas given without objection, and petitioner never raised this claimpreviously.In any event, the dissent's theory does not make sense. The dissentsuggests that the disjunctive "or" clauses in the third paragraph may leadthe jury to think that it can only impose life imprisonment if it does notfind the aggravator proved. But this interpretation is at odds with theordinary meaning of the instruction's language and structure. The instruction presents a simple decisional tree. The second paragraph statesthat the Commonwealth must prove the aggravator beyond a reasonabledoubt. The third and fourth paragraphs give the jury alternative tasksaccording to whether the Commonwealth succeeds or fails in meeting itsburden. The third paragraph states that "if" the aggravator is proved,522US2 Unit: $U18 [01-28-00 18:06:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN278 BUCHANAN v. ANGELONEOpinion of the CourtEven were we to entertain some doubt as to the clarityof the instructions, the entire context in which the instructions were given expressly informed the jury that it couldconsider mitigating evidence. In Boyde, we considered thevalidity of an instruction listing 11 factors that the jury wasto consider in determining punishment, including a catchallfactor allowing consideration of " `[a]ny other circumstancewhich extenuates the gravity of the crime.' " 494 U. S., at373-374. We expressly noted that even were the instruction at all unclear, "the context of the proceedings wouldhave led reasonable jurors to believe that evidence of petitioner's background and character could be considered inmitigation." Id., at 383. We found it unlikely that reasonable jurors would believe that the court's instructionstransformed four days of defense testimony on the defendant's background and character " `into a virtual charade.' " Ibid. (quoting California v. Brown, 479 U. S. 538,542 (1987)).Similarly, here, there were two days of testimony relatingto petitioner's family background and mental and emotionalproblems. It is not likely that the jury would disregard thisextensive testimony in making its decision, particularlygiven the instruction to consider "all the evidence." Further buttressing this conclusion are the extensive argumentsof both defense counsel and the prosecutor on the mitigatingevidence and the effect it should be given in the sentencingdetermination. The parties in effect agreed that there wassubstantial mitigating evidence and that the jury had tothe jury may choose between death and life. The fourth paragraph statesthat "if" the aggravator is not proved, the jury must impose life. The"if" clauses clearly condition the choices that follow. And since the fourthparagraph tells the jury what to do if the aggravator is not proved, thethird paragraph clearly involves only the jury's task if the aggravator isproved. The fact that counsel and the court agreed to this instruction isstrong evidence that the "misconception" envisioned by the dissent couldresult only from a strained parsing of the language.522US2 Unit: $U18 [01-28-00 18:06:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN279Cite as: 522 U. S. 269 (1998)Scalia, J., concurringweigh that evidence against petitioner's conduct in making adiscretionary decision on the appropriate penalty. In thiscontext, "there is not a reasonable likelihood that the jurorsin petitioner's case understood the challenged instructionsto preclude consideration of relevant mitigating evidence offered by petitioner." Boyde, supra, at 386; see also Johnson, 509 U. S., at 367.The absence of an instruction on the concept of mitigationand of instructions on particular statutorily defined mitigating factors did not violate the Eighth and FourteenthAmendments to the United States Constitution. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
