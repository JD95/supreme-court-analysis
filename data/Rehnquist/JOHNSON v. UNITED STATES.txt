In this case the trial court itself decided the issue of mate-riality in a perjury prosecution, rather than submitting itto the jury as our decision in United States v. Gaudin, 515U. S. 506 (1995), now requires. No objection was made bythe petitioner, Joyce B. Johnson, and we hold that the court'saction in this case was not "plain error" of the sort which anappellate court may notice under Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 52(b).In the late 1980's, a federal investigation into the cocaineand marijuana trafficking of Earl James Fields revealed thathe and his partner had amassed some $10 million from theirillicit activities. Following the money trail, federal authorities subpoenaed Johnson, Fields' long-time girlfriend, to tes-tify before a federal grand jury. Johnson, who is the motherof a child by Fields, earned about $34,000 a year at the Flor-ida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Shetestified before the grand jury that she owned five pieces ofreal property, including her house. That house was purchased by Johnson in 1991 for $75,600, and in the next twoyears she added sufficient improvements to it that in 1993it was appraised at $344,800. When asked the source of herhome improvement funds, Johnson stated that she had put$80,000 to $120,000 into her house, all of which had comefrom a box of cash given her late mother by one Gerald Talcott in 1985 or 1986.On the basis of this testimony, Johnson was indicted forperjury under 18 U. S. C. $ 1623. At trial, it was revealedthat Fields had negotiated the original purchase of Johnson'shome and that Johnson had paid for the property with eightdifferent cashier's checks, including two from a corporationin which Fields had an interest. It was also established thatGerald Talcott had died in April 1982, several years before*Justice Scalia joins all but Parts II-B and II-C of this opinion.520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN464 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe time Johnson claimed he had given her mother the boxfull of cash.At the close of Johnson's trial, and in accordance withthen-extant Circuit precedent, see,e. g., United States v.Molinares, 700 F. 2d 647, 653 (CA11 1983), the District Judgeinstructed the jury that the element of materiality was aquestion for the judge to decide, and that he had determinedthat her statements were material. App. 72. Johnson didnot object to this instruction. Indeed, when the prosecutionhad presented evidence concerning materiality during thetrial, she had then objected, on the ground that materialitywas a matter for the judge, and not the jury, to decide. Id.,at 61. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Johnsonwas sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment, three years' supervised release, and a $30,000 fine.After Johnson was convicted, but before her appeal to theCourt of Appeals, we decided United States v. Gaudin,supra, which held that the materiality of a false statementmust be submitted to the jury rather than decided by thetrial judge. On her appeal, Johnson argued that the trialjudge's failure to submit materiality to the jury rendered herconviction invalid underGaudin.Because Johnson had failed to object to the trial judge'sdeciding materiality, the Court of Appeals for the EleventhCircuit reviewed for plain error. Rule 52(b) of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure provides:"Plain Error. Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were notbrought to the attention of the court."Following our analysis in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S.725 (1993), the Court of Appeals assumed, arguendo, thatthe District Court's failure to submit materiality to the juryconstituted "error" that was "clear or obvious," but concluded nonetheless that any such error did not affect the"substantial rights" of the defendant. That conclusion was520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN465Cite as: 520 U. S. 461 (1997)Opinion of the Courtbased on the court's independent review of the record anddetermination that there was "overwhelming" evidence ofmateriality and that "[n]o reasonable juror could concludethat Johnson's false statements about the source of themoney . . . were not material to the grand jury's investiga-tion." App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a ( judgt. order reported at82 F. 3d 429 (CA11 1996)). Due to the conflict between thisdecision and the Ninth Circuit's en banc decision inUnitedStates v. Keys, 95 F. 3d 874 (1996), we granted certiorari.519 U. S. 989 (1996). We now affirm.ITitle 18 U. S. C. $ 1623 proscribes "knowingly mak[ing] anyfalse material declaration" under oath before a grand jury.Although we merely assumed in Gaudin that materiality isan element of making a false statement under 18 U. S. C.$ 1001, and although we recently held that materiality is notan element of making a false statement to a federally insuredbank under 18 U. S. C. $ 1014, United States v. Wells, 519U. S. 482 (1997), there is no doubt that materiality is an element of perjury under $ 1623. The statutory text expresslyrequires that the false declaration be "material." Gaudintherefore dictates that materiality be decided by the jury,not the court.Petitioner, however, did not object to the trial court'streatment of materiality. Rule 30 of the Federal Rules ofCriminal Procedure provides: "No party may assign as errorany portion of the [ jury] charge or omission therefrom unlessthat party objects thereto before the jury retires to considerits verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that partyobjects and the grounds of the objection." This Rule is sim-ply the embodiment of the "familiar" principle that a right" `may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by thefailure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunalhaving jurisdiction to determine it.' " Olano, supra, at 731(quoting Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944)).520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN466 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe Rule is mitigated, however, by Rule 52(b), which allowsplain errors affecting substantial rights to be noticed eventhough there was no objection.Petitioner argues that she need not fall within the "limited" and "circumscribed" strictures of Olano, because theerror she complains of here is "structural," and so is outsideRule 52(b) altogether. But the seriousness of the errorclaimed does not remove consideration of it from the ambitof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. None of thecases discussing "structural error," upon which petitioner relies, were direct appeals from judgments of conviction in thefederal system. Several came from state courts which hadconsidered the claimed error under their own rules. SeeGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991); Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508U. S. 275 (1993). Others came here by way of federal habeaschallenges to state convictions. See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474U. S. 254 (1986); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168 (1984).None of them were subject to the provisions of Rule 52.But it is that Rule which by its terms governs direct appeals from judgments of conviction in the federal system,and therefore governs this case. We cautioned against anyunwarranted expansion of Rule 52(b) in United States v.Young, 470 U. S. 1 (1985), because it "would skew the Rule's`careful balancing of our need to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time aroundagainst our insistence that obvious injustice be promptly redressed,' " id., at 15 (quoting United States v. Frady, 456U. S. 152, 163 (1982)). Even less appropriate than an unwarranted expansion of the Rule would be the creation out ofwhole cloth of an exception to it, an exception which we haveno authority to make. See Carlisle v. United States, 517U. S. 416, 425-426 (1996).IIWe therefore turn to apply here Rule 52(b) as outlined inOlano. Under that test, before an appellate court can cor520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN467Cite as: 520 U. S. 461 (1997)Opinion of the Courtrect an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) "error,"(2) that is "plain," and (3) that "affect[s] substantial rights."507 U. S., at 732. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error " ` "seriously affect[s] thefairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings." ' " Ibid. (quoting United States v. Young, supra, at15, in turn quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157,160 (1936)).AThere is no doubt that if petitioner's trial occurred today,the failure to submit materiality to the jury would be errorunder Gaudin. Under Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314(1987), a "new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutionsis to be applied retroactively to all cases . . . pending ondirect review . . . , with no exception for cases in which thenew rule constitutes a `clear break' with the past." Id., at328. Because petitioner is still on direct review, Griffithrequires that we apply Gaudin retroactively. Accordingly,under Gaudin there was "error," and the first prong ofOlano is satisfied.BThe second prong is more difficult. Olano explained thatthe word "plain" is "synonymous with `clear' or, equivalently,`obvious.' " 507 U. S., at 734. But Olano refrained from deciding when an error must be plain to be reviewable. "At aminimum," Olano concluded, the error must be plain "undercurrent law." Ibid. In the case with which we are facedtoday, the error is certainly clear under "current law," but itwas by no means clear at the time of trial.The Government contends that for an error to be "plain,"it must have been so both at the time of trial and at the timeof appellate consideration. In this case, it says, petitionershould have objected to the court's deciding the issue of materiality, even though near-uniform precedent both from this520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN468 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtCourt and from the Courts of Appeals held that courseproper.1 Petitioner, on the other hand, urges that such arule would result in counsel's inevitably making a long andvirtually useless laundry list of objections to rulings thatwere plainly supported by existing precedent. We agreewith petitioner on this point, and hold that in a case such asthis--where the law at the time of trial was settled andclearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal--it is enoughthat an error be "plain" at the time of appellate consider-ation. Here, at the time of trial it was settled that the issueof materiality was to be decided by the court, not the jury;by the time of appellate consideration, the law had changed,and it is now settled that materiality is an issue for the jury.The second part of the Olano test is therefore satisfied.CBut even though the error be "plain," it must also "affec[t]substantial rights." It is at this point that petitioner's argument that the failure to submit an element of the offense tothe jury is "structural error" becomes relevant. She contends in effect that if an error is so serious as to defyharmless-error analysis, it must also "affec[t] substantialrights." A "structural" error, we explained in Arizona v.Fulminante, is a "defect affecting the framework withinwhich the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in thetrial process itself," 499 U. S., at 310. We have found struc-tural errors only in a very limited class of cases: See Gideon1 See United States v. Corsino, 812 F. 2d 26, 31, n. 3 (CA1 1987); UnitedStates v. Bernard, 384 F. 2d 915, 916 (CA2 1967); United States v. Greber,760 F. 2d 68, 73 (CA3 1985); Nilson Van & Storage Co. v. Marsh, 755 F. 2d362, 367 (CA4 1985); United States v.

S.39 (1984) (the right to a public trial); Sullivan v. Louisiana,508 U. S. 275 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instructionto jury).It is by no means clear that the error here fits within thislimited class of cases. Sullivan v. Louisiana, the case mostclosely on point, held that the erroneous definition of "rea-sonable doubt" vitiated all of the jury's findings because onecould only speculate what a properly charged jury mighthave done.Id., at 280. The failure to submit materialityto the jury, as in this case, can just as easily be analogizedto improperly instructing the jury on an element of the of-fense, e. g., Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391 (1991); Carella v.California, 491 U. S. 263 (1989) (per curiam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987); Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570 (1986),an error which is subject to harmless-error analysis, as it canbe to failing to give a proper reasonable-doubt instructionaltogether. Cf. California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2, 5 (1996)(per curiam) ("The specific error at issue here--an error inthe instruction that defined the crime--is . . . as easily characterized as a `misdescription of an element' of the crime, asit is characterized as an error of `omission' ").DBut we need not decide that question because, even assum-ing that the failure to submit materiality to the jury "affec[ted] substantial rights," it does not meet the final re-quirement ofOlano. When the first three parts of Olanoare satisfied, an appellate court must then determinewhether the forfeited error " `seriously affect[s] the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings' " before520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN470 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtit may exercise its discretion to correct the error. Olano,507 U. S., at 736 (quotingAtkinson, 297 U. S., at 160).In this case that question must be answered in the nega-tive. As the Court of Appeals noted, the evidence supporting materiality was "overwhelming." App. to Pet. for Cert.9a. Materiality was essentially uncontroverted at trial 2 andhas remained so on appeal. The grand jury here was investigating petitioner's long-time boyfriend's alleged cocaineand marijuana trafficking and the "disposition of moneywhich was proceeds of this cocaine and [marijuana] distri-bution activity, including the possible concealment of suchproceeds as investments in real estate." App. 5-6. Beforethe Eleventh Circuit and in her briefing before this Court,petitioner has presented no plausible argument that the falsestatement under oath for which she was convicted--lyingabout the source of the tens of thousands of dollars she usedto improve her home--was somehow not material to thegrand jury investigation.On this record there is no basis for concluding that theerror "seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or publicreputation of judicial proceedings." Indeed, it would be thereversal of a conviction such as this which would have thateffect. "Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on thejudgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial processand bestirs the public to ridicule it." R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970). No "miscarriage of justice"will result here if we do not notice the error, Olano, supra,at 736, and we decline to do so. The judgment of the Courtof Appeals is therefore Affirmed.2 The Government represents--and petitioner has not disputed--thatthe sum total of petitioner's argument at trial concerning materiality consisted of the following conclusory sentence: " `I would argue that the element of materiality has been insufficiently proven and that the Courtought to grant a judgment of acquittal.'

BOSSIER PARISHSCHOOL BOARDet al.appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of columbiaNo. 95-1455. Argued December 9, 1996--Decided May 12, 1997*Appellee Bossier Parish School Board (Board) is subject to the preclearance requirements of $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) andmust therefore obtain the approval of either the United States AttorneyGeneral or the United States District Court for the District of Columbiabefore implementing any changes to a voting "qualification, prerequisite,standard, practice, or procedure." Based on the 1990 census, the Boardredrew its 12 single-member districts, adopting the redistricting planthat the Attorney General had recently precleared for use in electionsof the parish's primary governing body (the Jury plan). In doing so,the Board rejected a plan proposed by the National Association for theAdvancement of Colored People (NAACP), which would have createdtwo majority-black districts. The Attorney General objected to preclearance, finding that the NAACP plan, which had not been availablewhen the Jury plan was originally approved, demonstrated that blackresidents were sufficiently numerous and geographically compact toconstitute a majority in two districts; that, compared with this alternative, the Board's plan unnecessarily limited the opportunity for minority voters to elect their candidates of choice and thereby dilutedtheir voting strength in violation of $ 2 of the Act; and that the Attorney General must withhold preclearance where necessary to preventa clear $ 2 violation. The Board then filed this action with the District Court, and appellant Price and others intervened as defendants.A three-judge panel granted the preclearance request, rejecting appellants' contention that a voting change's failure to satisfy $ 2 constitutedan independent reason to deny preclearance under $ 5 and their relatedargument that a court must still consider evidence of a $ 2 violation asevidence of discriminatory purpose under $ 5.Held:1. Preclearance under $ 5 may not be denied solely on the basis thata covered jurisdiction's new voting "standard, practice, or procedure"violates $ 2.

BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Syllabusbat different evils and, accordingly, to impose very different duties uponthe States. See Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 883 (plurality opinion).Section 5 freezes election procedures in a covered jurisdiction until thatjurisdiction proves that its proposed changes do not have the purpose,and will not have the effect, of denying or abridging the right to voteon account of race. See Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 140. It isdesigned to combat only those effects that are retrogressive. Retrogression, by definition, requires a comparison of a jurisdiction's new voting plan with its existing plan, see Holder, supra, at 883 (plurality opinion), and necessarily implies that the jurisdiction's existing plan is thebenchmark against which the "effect" of voting changes is measured.Section 2, on the other hand, applies in all jurisdictions and uses as itsbenchmark for comparison in vote dilution claims a hypothetical, undiluted plan. Making compliance with $ 5 contingent upon compliancewith $ 2, as appellants urge, would, for all intents and purposes, replacethe standards for $ 5 with those for $ 2, thus contradicting more than 20years of precedent interpreting $ 5. See, e. g., Beer, supra. Appellants' contentions that their reading of $ 5 is supported by the Beer decision, by the Attorney General's regulations, and by public policy considerations are rejected. Pp. 476-485.2. Evidence showing that a jurisdiction's redistricting plan dilutes minorities' voting power may be relevant to establish a jurisdiction's "intent to retrogress" under $ 5, so there is no need to decide today whethersuch evidence is relevant to establish other types of discriminatory intent or whether $ 5's purpose inquiry ever extends beyond the searchfor retrogressive intent. Because this Court cannot say with confidencethat the District Court considered the evidence proffered to show thatthe Board's reapportionment plan was dilutive, this aspect of that court'sholding must be vacated. Pp. 486-490.(a) Section 2 evidence may be "relevant" within the meaning ofFederal Rule of Evidence 401, for the fact that a plan has a dilutiveimpact makes it "more probable" that the jurisdiction adopting that planacted with an intent to retrogress than "it would be without the evidence." This does not, of course, mean that evidence of a plan's dilutiveimpact is dispositive of the $ 5 purpose inquiry. Indeed, if it were, $ 2would be effectively incorporated into $ 5, a result this Court finds unsatisfactory. In conducting their inquiry into a jurisdiction's motivationin enacting voting changes, courts should look for guidance to ArlingtonHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252,which sets forth a framework for examining discriminatory purpose.Pp. 486-489.(b) This Court is unable to determine whether the District Courtdeemed irrelevant all evidence of the dilutive impact of the redistricting520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN473Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Syllabusplan adopted by the Board. While some language in its opinion is consistent with today's holding that the existence of less dilutive optionswas at least relevant to the purpose inquiry, the District Court alsoappears to have endorsed the notion that dilutive impact evidence isirrelevant even to an inquiry into retrogressive intent. The DistrictCourt will have the opportunity to apply the Arlington Heights test onremand as well as to address appellants' additional arguments that iterred in refusing to consider evidence that the Board was in violationof an ongoing injunction to remedy any remaining vestiges of a dualschool system.

BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the CourtJustice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.Today we clarify the relationship between $ 2 and $ 5 ofthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, 439, as amended,42 U. S. C. $$ 1973, 1973c. Specifically, we decide two ques-tions: (i) whether preclearance must be denied under $ 5whenever a covered jurisdiction's new voting "standard,practice, or procedure" violates $ 2; and (ii) whether evidencethat a new "standard, practice, or procedure" has a dilutiveimpact is always irrelevant to the inquiry whether the covered jurisdiction acted with "the purpose . . . of denying orabridging the right to vote on account of race or color" under$ 5. We answer both in the negative.IAppellee Bossier Parish School Board (Board) is a jurisdic-tion subject to the preclearance requirements of $ 5 of theVoting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, and musttherefore obtain the approval of either the United States Attorney General or the United States District Court for theDistrict of Columbia before implementing any changes to avoting "qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-cedure." The Board has 12 members who are elected fromsingle-member districts by majority vote to serve 4-yearterms. When the 1990 census revealed wide population disparities among its districts, see App. to Juris. Statement 93a(Stipulations of Fact and Law || 82), the Board decided toredraw the districts to equalize the population distribution.During this process, the Board considered two redistricting plans. It considered, and initially rejected, the redis-tricting plan that had been recently adopted by the BossierParish Police Jury, the parish's primary governing body (theJury plan), to govern its own elections. Just months before,the Attorney General had precleared the Jury plan, whichalso contained 12 districts. Id., at 88a (Stipulations || 68).None of the 12 districts in the Board's existing plan or in theJury plan contained a majority of black residents. Id., at520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN475Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Opinion of the Court93a (Stipulations || 82) (under 1990 population statistics inthe Board's existing districts, the three districts with highestblack concentrations contain 46.63%, 43.79%, and 30.13%black residents, respectively);id., at 85a (Stipulations || 59)(population statistics for the Jury plan, with none of theplan's 12 districts containing a black majority). Because theBoard's adoption of the Jury plan would have maintained thestatus quo regarding the number of black-majority districts,the parties stipulated that the Jury plan was not "retrogressive." Id., at 141a (Stipulations || 252) ("The . . . plan is notretrogressive to minority voting strength compared to theexisting benchmark plan . . ."). Appellant George Price,president of the local chapter of the National Association forthe Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), presented theBoard with a second option--a plan that created two districts each containing not only a majority of black residents,but a majority of voting-age black residents. Id., at 98a(Stipulations || 98). Over vocal opposition from local residents, black and white alike, the Board voted to adopt theJury plan as its own, reasoning that the Jury plan wouldalmost certainly be precleared again and that the NAACPplan would require the Board to split 46 electoral precincts.But the Board's hopes for rapid preclearance were dashedwhen the Attorney General interposed a formal objection tothe Board's plan on the basis of "new information" not available when the Justice Department had precleared the planfor the Police Jury--namely, the NAACP's plan, which demonstrated that "black residents are sufficiently numerous andgeographically compact so as to constitute a majority in twosingle-member districts." Id., at 155a-156a (Attorney General's August 30, 1993, objection letter). The objection letter asserted that the Board's plan violated $ 2 of the Act, 42U. S. C. $ 1973, because it "unnecessarily limit[ed] the opportunity for minority voters to elect their candidates of choice,"App. to Juris. Statement, at 156a, as compared to the newalternative.

Ibid.The Board then filed this action seeking preclearanceunder $ 5 in the District Court for the District of Columbia.Appellant Price and others intervened as defendants. Thethree-judge panel granted the Board's request for preclear-ance, over the dissent of one judge. 907 F. Supp. 434, 437(1995). The District Court squarely rejected the appellants'contention that a voting change's alleged failure to satisfy $ 2constituted an independent reason to deny preclearanceunder $ 5: "We hold, as has every court that has consideredthe question, that a political subdivision that does not violateeither the `effect' or the `purpose' prong of section 5 cannotbe denied preclearance because of an alleged section 2 viola-tion."Id., at 440-441. Given this holding, the DistrictCourt quite properly expressed no opinion on whether theJury plan in fact violated $ 2, and its refusal to reach outand decide the issue in dicta does not require us, asJusticeStevens insists, to "assume that the record discloses a `clearviolation' of $ 2." See post, at 499 (opinion dissenting in partand concurring in part). That issue has yet to be decidedby any court. The District Court did, however, reject appellants' related argument that a court "must still considerevidence of a section 2 violation as evidence of discriminatory purpose under section 5."

Two of the weapons in the FederalGovernment's formidable arsenal are $ 5 and $ 2 of the Act.Although we have consistently understood these sections tocombat different evils and, accordingly, to impose very different duties upon the States, see Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S.874, 883 (1994) (plurality opinion) (noting how the two sections "differ in structure, purpose, and application"), appel-lants nevertheless ask us to hold that a violation of $ 2 is anindependent reason to deny preclearance under $ 5. UnlikeJustice Stevens, post, at 502-503, and n. 5 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part), we entertain little doubtthat the Department of Justice or other litigants would"routinely" attempt to avail themselves of this new reasonfor denying preclearance, so that recognizing $ 2 violationsas a basis for denying $ 5 preclearance would inevitably makecompliance with $ 5 contingent upon compliance with $ 2.Doing so would, for all intents and purposes, replace thestandards for $ 5 with those for $ 2. Because this would con-tradict our longstanding interpretation of these two sectionsof the Act, we reject appellants' position.Section 5, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, was enacted as"a response to a common practice in some jurisdictionsof staying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing new discriminatory voting laws as soon as the oldones had been struck down. . . . Congress therefore decided, as the Supreme Court held it could, `to shift theadvantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators ofthe evil to its victim,' by `freezing election proceduresin the covered areas unless the changes can be shownto be nondiscriminatory.' " Beer v. United States, 425U. S. 130, 140 (1976) (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94-196,pp. 57-58 (1970)).In light of this limited purpose, $ 5 applies only to certainStates and their political subdivisions. Such a covered ju520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN478 RENO v.

S. C. $ 1973c. To obtain judicial preclearance, the juris-diction bears the burden of proving that the change "doesnot have the purpose and will not have the effect of denyingor abridging the right to vote on account of race or color."Ibid.; City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 183, n. 18(1980) (covered jurisdiction bears burden of proof). Because$ 5 focuses on "freez[ing] election procedures," a plan has animpermissible "effect" under $ 5 only if it "would lead to aretrogression in the position of racial minorities with respectto their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer,supra, at 141.Retrogression, by definition, requires a comparison of ajurisdiction's new voting plan with its existing plan. SeeHolder, supra, at 883 (plurality opinion) ("Under $ 5, then,the proposed voting practice is measured against the existing voting practice to determine whether retrogressionwould result from the proposed change"). It also necessarily implies that the jurisdiction's existing plan is the benchmark against which the "effect" of voting changes is measured. In Beer, for example, we concluded that the city ofNew Orleans' reapportionment of its council districts, whichcreated one district with a majority of voting-age blackswhere before there had been none, had no discriminatory"effect." 425 U. S., at 141-142 ("It is thus apparent that alegislative reapportionment that enhances the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of theelectoral franchise can hardly have the `effect' of diluting orabridging the right to vote on account of race within themeaning of $ 5"). Likewise, in City of Lockhart v. UnitedStates, 460 U. S. 125 (1983), we found that the city's new charter had no retrogressive "effect" even though it maintained520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN479Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Opinion of the Courtthe city's prior practice of electing its council members atlarge from numbered posts, and instituted a new practice ofelecting two of the city's four council members every year(instead of electing all the council members every two years).While each practice could "have a discriminatory effectunder some circumstances," id., at 135, the fact remainedthat "[s]ince the new plan did not increase the degree of discrimination against [the city's Mexican-American population], it was entitled to $ 5 preclearance [because it was notretrogressive]," id., at 134 (emphasis added).Section 2, on the other hand, was designed as a meansof eradicating voting practices that "minimize or cancel outthe voting strength and political effectiveness of minoritygroups," S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 28. Under this broader mandate, $ 2 bars all States and their political subdivisions frommaintaining any voting "standard, practice, or procedure"that "results in a denial or abridgement of the right . . . tovote on account of race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(a). Avoting practice is impermissibly dilutive within the meaningof $ 2"if, based on the totality of the circumstances, it isshown that the political processes leading to nominationor election in the State or political subdivision are notequally open to participation by [members of a classdefined by race or color] in that its members have lessopportunity than other members of the electorate toparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b).A plaintiff claiming vote dilution under $ 2 must initially establish that: (i) "[the racial group] is sufficiently large andgeographically compact to constitute a majority in a singlemember district"; (ii) the group is "politically cohesive"; and(iii) "the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enableit . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate."520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN480 RENO v.

The plaintiff must alsodemonstrate that the totality of the circumstances supportsa finding that the voting scheme is dilutive.Johnson v. DeGrandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1011 (1994); see Gingles, supra, at44-45 (listing factors to be considered by a court in assessingthe totality of the circumstances). Because the very conceptof vote dilution implies--and, indeed, necessitates--the ex-istence of an "undiluted" practice against which the fact ofdilution may be measured, a $ 2 plaintiff must also postulatea reasonable alternative voting practice to serve as thebenchmark "undiluted" voting practice. Holder v. Hall, 512U. S., at 881 (plurality opinion); id., at 950-951 (Blackmun,J., dissenting).Appellants contend that preclearance must be deniedunder $ 5 whenever a covered jurisdiction's redistricting planviolates $ 2. The upshot of this position is to shift the focusof $ 5 from nonretrogression to vote dilution, and to changethe $ 5 benchmark from a jurisdiction's existing plan to ahypothetical, undiluted plan.But $ 5, we have held, is designed to combat only thoseeffects that are retrogressive. See supra, at 477-479. Toadopt appellants' position, we would have to call into question more than 20 years of precedent interpreting $ 5. See,e. g., Beer, supra; City of Lockhart, supra. This we declineto do. Section 5 already imposes upon a covered jurisdictionthe difficult burden of proving the absence of discriminatorypurpose and effect. See, e. g., Elkins v. United States, 364U. S. 206, 219 (1960) ("[A]s a practical matter it is never easyto prove a negative"). To require a jurisdiction to litigatewhether its proposed redistricting plan also has a dilutive"result" before it can implement that plan--even if the Attorney General bears the burden of proving that "result"--is toincrease further the serious federalism costs already implicated by $ 5. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 926 (1995)(noting the "federalism costs exacted by $ 5 preclearance").520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN481Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Opinion of the CourtAppellants nevertheless contend that we should adopttheir reading of $ 5 because it is supported by our decisionin Beer, by the Attorney General's regulations, and by con-siderations of public policy. InBeer, we held that $ 5 prohibited only retrogressive effects and further observed that "anameliorative new legislative apportionment cannot violate$ 5 unless the new apportionment itself so discriminates onthe basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution." 425U. S., at 141. Although there had been no allegation thatthe redistricting plan in Beer "so . . . discriminate[d] on thebasis of race or color as to be unconstitutional," we cited indicta a few cases to illustrate when a redistricting plan mightbe found to be constitutionally offensive. Id., at 142, n. 14.Among them was our decision in White v. Regester, 412 U. S.755 (1973), in which we sustained a vote dilution challenge,brought under the Equal Protection Clause, to the use ofmultimember election districts in two Texas counties. Appellants argue that "[b]ecause vote dilution standards underthe Constitution and Section 2 were generally coextensiveat the time Beer was decided, Beer's discussion meant thatpractices that violated Section 2 would not be entitled topreclearance under Section 5." Brief for Federal Appellant 36-37.Even assuming, arguendo, that appellants' argument hadsome support in 1976, it is no longer valid today becausethe applicable statutory and constitutional standards havechanged. Since 1980, a plaintiff bringing a constitutionalvote dilution challenge, whether under the Fourteenth orFifteenth Amendment, has been required to establish thatthe State or political subdivision acted with a discriminatorypurpose. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 62 (1980) (plurality opinion) ("Our decisions . . . have made clear that action by a State that is racially neutral on its face violates theFifteenth Amendment only if motivated by a discriminatorypurpose"); id., at 66 ("[O]nly if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the Equal Protection520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN482 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the CourtClause of the Fourteenth Amendment"); see also ArlingtonHeights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429U. S. 252, 265 (1977) ("Proof of racially discriminatory intentor purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause"). When Congress amended $ 2 in 1982, itclearly expressed its desire that $ 2 not have an intent com-ponent, see S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 2 ("Th[e 1982] amendmentis designed to make clear that proof of discriminatory intentis not required to establish a violation of Section 2"). Because now the Constitution requires a showing of intent that$ 2 does not, a violation of $ 2 is no longera fortiori a violation of the Constitution. Congress itself has acknowledgedthis fact. See id., at 39 ("The Voting Rights Act is the bestexample of Congress' power to enact implementing legislation that goes beyond the direct prohibitions of the Constitution itself ").Justice Stevens argues that the subsequent divergenceof constitutional and statutory standards is of no momentbecause, in his view, we "did not [in Beer] purport to distinguish between challenges brought under the Constitutionand those brought under the [Voting Rights] statute." Post,at 504 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part).Our citation to White, he posits, incorporated White's standard into our exception for nonretrogressive apportionmentsthat violate $ 5, whether or not that standard continued tocoincide with the constitutional standard. In essence, Justice Stevens reads Beer as creating an exception for nonretrogressive apportionments that so discriminate on thebasis of race or color as to violate any federal law that happens to coincide with what would have amounted to a constitutional violation in 1976. But this reading flatly contradicts the plain language of the exception we recognized,which applies solely to apportionments that "so discriminat[e] on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution." Beer, supra, at 141 (emphasis added). We citedWhite, not for itself, but because it embodied the current520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN483Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Opinion of the Courtconstitutional standard for a violation of the Equal Protec-tion Clause. See also 425 U. S., at 143, n. 14 (noting thatNew Orleans' plan did "not remotely approach a violation oftheconstitutional standards enunciated in" White and othercited cases (emphasis added)). When White ceased to represent the current understanding of the Constitution, a viola-tion of its standard--even though that standard was laterincorporated in $ 2--no longer constituted grounds for denialof preclearance underBeer.Appellants' next claim is that we must defer to the At-torney General's regulations interpreting the Act, one ofwhich states:"In those instances in which the Attorney Generalconcludes that, as proposed, the submitted change isfree of discriminatory purpose and retrogressive effect,but also concludes that a bar to implementation ofthe change is necessary to prevent a clear violation ofamended Section 2, the Attorney General shall withholdSection 5 preclearance." 28 CFR $ 51.55(b)(2) (1996).Although we normally accord the Attorney General's con-struction of the Act great deference, "we only do so if Congress has not expressed its intent with respect to the ques-tion, and then only if the administrative interpretation isreasonable." Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S.491, 508 (1992). Given our longstanding interpretation of $ 5,seesupra, at 477-479, 480-482 and this page, which Congresshas declined to alter by amending the language of $ 5, Arkansas Best Corp. v. Commissioner, 485 U. S. 212, 222, n. 7 (1988)(placing some weight on Congress' failure to express disfavorwith our 25-year interpretation of a tax statute), we believeCongress has made it sufficiently clear that a violation of $ 2is not grounds in and of itself for denying preclearance under$ 5. That there may be some suggestion to the contrary inthe Senate Report to the 1982 Voting Rights Act amendments, S. Rep. No. 97-417, supra, at 12, n. 31, does not520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN484 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtchange our view. With those amendments, Congress, amongother things, renewed $ 5 but did so without changing itsapplicable standard. We doubt that Congress would departfrom the settled interpretation of $ 5 and impose a demonstrably greater burden on the jurisdictions covered by $ 5,see supra, at 480, by dropping a footnote in a Senate Reportinstead of amending the statute itself. SeePierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 567 (1988) ("Quite obviously, reenactingprecisely the same language would be a strange way to makea change"). See also City of Lockhart v. United States, 460U. S. 125 (1983) (reaching its holding over Justice Marshall'sdissent, which raised the argument now advanced by appel-lants regarding this passage in the Senate Report).Nor does the portion of the House Report cited by JusticeStevens unambiguously call for the incorporation of $ 2 into$ 5. That portion of the Report states:"[M]any voting and election practices currently in effect are outside the scope of [$ 5] . . . because they werein existence before 1965. . . . Under the Voting RightsAct, whether a discriminatory practice or procedure isof recent origin affects only the mechanism that triggersrelief, i. e., litigation [under $ 2] or preclearance [under$ 5]." H. R. Rep. No. 97-227, p. 28 (1981).The obvious thrust of this passage is to establish that pre1965 discriminatory practices are not free from scrutinyunder the Act just because they need not be preclearedunder $ 5: Such practices might still violate $ 2. But to saythat pre-1965 practices can be reached solely by $ 2 is not tosay that all post-1965 changes that might violate $ 2 may bereached by both $ 2 and $ 5 or that "the substantive standards for $ 2 and $ 5 [are] the same," see post, at 506 (opiniondissenting in part and concurring in part). Our ultimate conclusion is also not undercut by statements found in the "postenactment legislative record," see post, at 506, n. 9, giventhat "the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN485Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Opinion of the Courtbasis for inferring the intent of an earlier one." UnitedStates v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). We therefore decline to give these sources controlling weight.Appellants' final appeal is to notions of public policy.They assert that if the district court or Attorney Generalexamined whether a covered jurisdiction's redistricting planviolates $ 2 at the same time as ruling on preclearance under$ 5, there would be no need for two separate actions and judi-cial resources would be conserved. Appellants are undoubtedly correct that adopting their interpretation of $ 5 wouldserve judicial economy in those cases where a $ 2 challengefollows a $ 5 proceeding. But this does not always happen,and the burden on judicial resources might actually increaseif appellants' position prevailed because $ 2 litigation wouldeffectively be incorporated into every $ 5 proceeding.Appellants lastly argue that preclearance is an equitableremedy, obtained through a declaratory judgment action indistrict court, see 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, or through the exerciseof the Attorney General's discretion, see 28 CFR $ 51.52(a)(1996). A finding that a redistricting plan violates $ 2 of theAct, they contend, is an equitable "defense," on the basis ofwhich a decisionmaker should, in the exercise of its equitable discretion, be free to deny preclearance. This argument,however, is an attempt to obtain through equity that whichthe law--i. e., the settled interpretation of $ 5--forbids. Because "it is well established that `[c]ourts of equity can nomore disregard statutory and constitutional requirementsand provisions than can courts of law,' " INS v. Pangilinan,486 U. S. 875, 883 (1988) (citing Hedges v. Dixon County, 150U. S. 182, 192 (1893)), this argument must fail.Of course, the Attorney General or a private plaintiff remains free to initiate a $ 2 proceeding if either believes thata jurisdiction's newly enacted voting "qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure" may violate that section. All we hold today is that preclearance under $ 5 maynot be denied on that basis alone.520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN486 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the CourtIIIAppellants next contend that evidence showing that ajurisdiction's redistricting plan dilutes the voting power ofminorities is at least relevant in a $ 5 proceeding becauseit tends to prove that the jurisdiction enacted its plan witha discriminatory "purpose." The District Court, reasoningthat "[t]he line [between $ 2 and $ 5] cannot be blurred byallowing a defendant to do indirectly what it cannot do di-rectly," 907 F. Supp., at 445, rejected this argument and heldthat it "will not permit section 2 evidence to prove discrimi-natory purpose under section 5," ibid. Because we hold thatsome of this "$ 2 evidence" may be relevant to establish ajurisdiction's "intent to retrogress" and cannot say with confidence that the District Court considered the evidence prof-fered to show that the Board's reapportionment plan wasdilutive, we vacate this aspect of the District Court's hold-ing and remand. In light of this conclusion, we leave openfor another day the question whether the $ 5 purpose in-quiry ever extends beyond the search for retrogressive intent. See Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490U. S. 454, 465, n. 5 (1989) (declining to decide an issue that"is not necessary to our decision"). Reserving this questionis particularly appropriate when, as in this suit, it was notsquarely addressed by the decision below or in the parties'briefs on appeal. See Brief for Federal Appellant 23; Brieffor Appellant Price et al. 31-33, 34-35; Brief for Appellee42-43. But in doing so, we do not, contrary toJusticeStevens' view, see post, at 499 (opinion dissenting in partand concurring in part), necessarily assume that the Boardenacted the Jury plan with some nonretrogressive, but nev-ertheless discriminatory, "purpose." The existence of sucha purpose, and its relevance to $ 5, are issues to be decidedon remand.Although $ 5 warrants a denial of preclearance if a coveredjurisdiction's voting change "ha[s] the purpose [or] . . . theeffect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN487Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Opinion of the Courtof race or color," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, we have consistentlyinterpreted this language in light of the purpose underlying$ 5--"to insure that no voting-procedure changes would bemade that would lead to a retrogression in the position ofracial minorities." Beer, 425 U. S., at 141. Accordingly, wehave adhered to the view that the only "effect" that violates$ 5 is a retrogressive one.Ibid.; City of Lockhart, 460 U. S.,at 134.Evidence is "relevant" if it has "any tendency to make theexistence of any fact that is of consequence to the determina-tion of the action more probable or less probable than itwould be without the evidence." Fed. Rule Evid. 401. Aswe observed in Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 266, the impact of an official action is often probative of why the actionwas taken in the first place since people usually intend thenatural consequences of their actions. Thus, a jurisdictionthat enacts a plan having a dilutive impact is more likely tohave acted with a discriminatory intent to dilute minorityvoting strength than a jurisdiction whose plan has no suchimpact. A jurisdiction that acts with an intent to dilute minority voting strength is more likely to act with an intentto worsen the position of minority voters--i. e., an intent toretrogress--than a jurisdiction acting with no intent to dilute. The fact that a plan has a dilutive impact thereforemakes it "more probable" that the jurisdiction adopting thatplan acted with an intent to retrogress than "it would bewithout the evidence." To be sure, the link between dilutiveimpact and intent to retrogress is far from direct, but "thebasic standard of relevance . . . is a liberal one," Daubertv. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579, 587(1993), and one we think is met here.That evidence of a plan's dilutive impact may be relevantto the $ 5 purpose inquiry does not, of course, mean that suchevidence is dispositive of that inquiry. In fact, we have previously observed that a jurisdiction's single decision to choosea redistricting plan that has a dilutive impact does not, with520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN488 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtout more, suffice to establish that the jurisdiction acted witha discriminatory purpose.Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 914,n. 6 (1996) ("[W]e doubt that a showing of discriminatoryeffect under $ 2, alone, could support a claim of discriminatory purpose under $ 5"). This is true whether the jurisdiction chose the more dilutive plan because it better comportedwith its traditional districting principles, seeMiller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 922 (rejecting argument that a jurisdiction'sfailure to adopt the plan with the greatest possible numberof majority black districts establishes that it acted with adiscriminatory purpose);Shaw, supra, at 912-913 (same), orif it chose the plan for no reason at all. Indeed, if a plan'sdilutive impact were dispositive, we would effectively incorporate $ 2 into $ 5, which is a result we find unsatisfactoryno matter how it is packaged. See Part II, supra.As our discussion illustrates, assessing a jurisdiction's motivation in enacting voting changes is a complex task requiring a "sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and directevidence as may be available." Arlington Heights, 429U. S., at 266. In conducting this inquiry, courts should lookto our decision in Arlington Heights for guidance. There,we set forth a framework for analyzing "whether invidiousdiscriminatory purpose was a motivating factor" in a government body's decisionmaking. Ibid. In addition to servingas the framework for examining discriminatory purpose incases brought under the Equal Protection Clause for overtwo decades, see, e. g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 644 (1993)(citing Arlington Heights standard in context of Equal Protection Clause challenge to racial gerrymander of districts);Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U. S. 613, 618 (1982) (evaluating votedilution claim under Equal Protection Clause using Arlington Heights test); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 70-74 (same), the Arlington Heights framework has also been used, at least inpart, to evaluate purpose in our previous $ 5 cases. SeePleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462, 469-470(1987) (considering city's history in rejecting annexation of520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN489Cite as: 520 U. S. 471 (1997)Opinion of the Courtblack neighborhood and its departure from normal proce-dures when calculating costs of annexation alternatives); seealso Busbee v. Smith, 549 F. Supp. 494, 516-517 (DC 1982),summarily aff 'd, 459 U. S. 1166 (1983) (referring toArlingtonHeights test); Port Arthur v. United States, 517 F. Supp. 987,1019, aff 'd, 459 U. S. 159 (1982) (same).The "important starting point" for assessing discriminatory intent under Arlington Heights is "the impact of theofficial action whether it `bears more heavily on one racethan another.' " 429 U. S., at 266 (citing Washington v.Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 242 (1976)). In a $ 5 case, "impact"might include a plan's retrogressive effect and, for the reasons discussed above, its dilutive impact. Other considerations relevant to the purpose inquiry include, among otherthings, "the historical background of the [ jurisdiction's] decision"; "[t]he specific sequence of events leading up to thechallenged decision"; "[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence"; and "[t]he legislative or administrative history, especially . . . [any] contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body." 429 U. S., at 266-268.We are unable to determine from the District Court's opinion in this action whether it deemed irrelevant all evidenceof the dilutive impact of the redistricting plan adopted bythe Board. At one point, the District Court correctly statedthat "the adoption of one nonretrogressive plan rather thananother nonretrogressive plan that contains more majorityblack districts cannot by itself give rise to the inference of discriminatory intent." 907 F. Supp., at 450 (emphasis added).This passage implies that the District Court believed thatthe existence of less dilutive options was at least relevant to,though not dispositive of, its purpose inquiry. While thislanguage is consistent with our holding today, see supra, at486-488, the District Court also declared that "we will notpermit section 2 evidence to prove discriminatory purposeunder section 5," supra, at 486. With this statement, theDistrict Court appears to endorse the notion that evidence520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN490 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Thomas, J., concurringof dilutive impact is irrelevant even to an inquiry into retro-gressive intent, a notion we reject. See supra, at 486-488.The Board contends that the District Court actually "pre-sumed that white majority districts had [a dilutive] effect,"Brief for Appellee 35, and "cut directly to the dispositivequestion `started' by the existence of [a dilutive] impact: didthe Board have `legitimate, nondiscriminatory motives' foradopting its plan[?]"Id., at 33. Even if the Board werecorrect, the District Court gave no indication that it wasassuming the plan's dilutive effect, and we hesitate to attrib-ute to the District Court a rationale it might not have employed. Because we are not satisfied that the District Courtconsidered evidence of the dilutive impact of the Board's re-districting plan, we vacate this aspect of the District Court'sopinion. The District Court will have the opportunity toapply theArlington Heights test on remand as well as toaddress appellants' additional arguments that it erred in re-fusing to consider evidence that the Board was in violationof an ongoing injunction "to `remedy any remaining vestigesof [a] dual [school] system,' " 907 F. Supp., at 449, n. 18.* * *The judgment of the District Court is vacated, and thecase is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis decision.
