Negonsott, is a member of the Kick-apoo Tribe and a resident of the Kickapoo Reservation inBrown County, Kansas. In March 1985, he was arrested bythe county sheriff in connection with the shooting of anotherIndian on the Kickapoo Reservation. After a jury trial inthe Brown County District Court, petitioner was foundguilty of aggravated battery. Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 21-3414(1988). The District Court set the conviction aside, however, on the ground that the Federal Government had exclu-sive jurisdiction to prosecute petitioner for the shootingunder the Indian Major Crimes Act, 18 U. S. C. $ 1153. TheKansas Supreme Court reinstated petitioner's conviction,holding that the Kansas Act conferred jurisdiction on Kansasto prosecute "all crimes committed by or against Indians onIndian reservations located in Kansas." State v. Nioce, 239Kan. 127, 131, 716 P. 2d 585, 588 (1986). On remand, theBrown County District Court sentenced petitioner to impris-onment for a term of 3 to 10 years.Petitioner then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpusunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, reasserting his claim that Kansaslacked jurisdiction to prosecute him for aggravated battery.The District Court dismissed his petition, 696 F.

The Court of Appeals foundthe language of the Kansas Act ambiguous as to "whetherCongress intended to grant Kansas courts concurrent jurisdiction with federal courts over the crimes enumerated inthe [Indian] Major Crimes Act, or whether by the secondsentence of the Kansas Act Congress intended to retain exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts over those specificcrimes."Id., at 820-821.

See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 288 (1982 ed.). These latteroffenses typically are subject to the jurisdiction of the concerned Indian tribe, unless they are among those enumerated in the Indian Major Crimes Act.

This case concerns the first major grant of jurisdiction to a State overoffenses involving Indians committed in Indian country, theKansas Act, which provides in full:"Jurisdiction is conferred on the State of Kansas overoffenses committed by or against Indians on Indianreservations, including trust or restricted allotments,within the State of Kansas, to the same extent as itscourts have jurisdiction over offenses committed else-where within the State in accordance with the laws ofthe State."This section shall not deprive the courts of theUnited States of jurisdiction over offenses defined bythe laws of the United States committed by or againstIndians on Indian reservations."

See Act of May 31, 1946, ch. 279, 60Stat. 229; Act of June 30, 1948, ch. 759, 62 Stat. 1161.Kansas asserted jurisdiction to prosecute petitioner for aggravated battery under the Kansas Act. Petitioner chal-lenges the State's jurisdiction in this regard. He contendsthat Congress added the second sentence of the Kansas Actto preserve the "exclusive" character of federal jurisdictionover the offenses enumerated in the Indian Major CrimesAct, and since the conduct resulting in his conviction for aggravated battery is punishable as at least two offenses listedin the Indian Major Crimes Act,3 Kansas lacked jurisdictionto prosecute him in connection with the shooting incident.According to petitioner, the Kansas Act was intended to confer jurisdiction on Kansas only over misdemeanor offensesinvolving Indians on Indian reservations. To construe thestatute otherwise, petitioner asserts, would effect an "im-plied repeal" of the Indian Major Crimes Act. Moreover,petitioner continues, the construction adopted by the Courtof Appeals below is at odds with the legislative history ofthe Kansas Act as well as the canon that statutes are to beliberally construed in favor of Indians.A"Our task is to give effect to the will of Congress, andwhere its will has been expressed in reasonably plain terms,that language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive."Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc., 458 U. S. 564, 570 (1982)(internal quotation marks omitted). In analyzing petitioner's contentions, then, we begin with the text of the Kansas3 The Indian Major Crimes Act does not explicitly refer to the offenseof aggravated battery, but it lists "assault with a dangerous weapon" and"assault resulting in serious bodily injury." 18 U. S. C. $ 1153(a). Theseoffenses are defined at 18 U. S. C. $$ 113(c) and (f). We assume, for thesake of deciding this case, that the state-law offense for which petitionerwas convicted, Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 21-3414 (1988), is comparable to one orboth of these federal offenses.507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT105Cite as: 507 U. S. 99 (1993)Opinion of the CourtAct itself. The first sentence confers jurisdiction on "Kan-sas over offenses committed by or against Indians on Indianreservations . . . to the same extent as its courts have juris-diction over offenses committed elsewhere within the Statein accordance with the laws of the State." $ 3243. Standing alone, this sentence unambiguously confers jurisdictionon Kansas to prosecute all offenses--major and minor--committed by or against Indians on Indian reservations in ac-cordance with state law. Petitioner does not assert otherwise. Instead, he rests his case on the second sentence ofthe Kansas Act, which states that nothing in the Act shall"deprive" federal courts of their "jurisdiction over offensesdefined by the laws of the United States." Ibid. But themost logical meaning of this proviso, we believe, is that federal courts shall retain their jurisdiction to try all offensessubject to federal jurisdiction under 18 U. S. C. $$ 1152 and1153, while Kansas courts shall have jurisdiction to try persons for the same conduct when it violates state law.This interpretation is quite consistent with the first sentence's conferral of jurisdiction on Kansas over all offensescommitted by or against Indians on Indian reservations inaccordance with state law. The Court of Appeals referredto this state of affairs in terms of Kansas courts having "concurrent jurisdiction" with federal courts over the offensesenumerated in the Indian Major Crimes Act. See 933 F. 2d,at 820-821. But the Kansas Act does not confer jurisdictionon Kansas to prosecute individuals for the federal offenseslisted in the Indian Major Crimes Act; it confers jurisdictionto prosecute individuals in accordance with state law for conduct that is also punishable under federal law pursuant to theIndian Major Crimes Act. Strictly speaking, then, federalcourts retain their exclusive jurisdiction to try individualsfor offenses covered by the Indian Major Crimes Act, and inthis sense, the Kansas Act in fact confers only concurrent"legislative" jurisdiction on the State to define and prosecutesimilar offenses.507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT106 NEGONSOTT v. SAMUELSOpinion of the CourtOur reading of the Kansas Act is the only one that giveseffect "to every clause and word of [the] statute." Moskalv. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 109-110 (1990) (internal quo-tation marks omitted). Petitioner's construction of the Act'ssecond sentence renders federal jurisdiction exclusive when-ever the underlying conduct is punishable under federal lawpursuant to either 18 U. S. C. $$ 1152 or 1153. Kansas is left,then, with jurisdiction over only those minor offenses committed by one Indian against the person or property of an-other. This result can hardly be reconciled with the firstsentence's unqualified grant of jurisdiction to Kansas to pros-ecute all state-law offenses committed by or against Indianson Indian reservations. Moreover, contrary to the assertionof petitioner, our construction of the Kansas Act does notwork an "implied repeal" of the Indian Major Crimes Act.As we have noted, federal courts retain their exclusive jurisdiction to try individuals for major federal crimes committedby or against Indians in Indian country. In any event, tothe extent that the Kansas Act altered the jurisdictionallandscape, the alteration is not merely by implication: TheAct explicitly conferred jurisdiction on Kansas over all of-fenses involving Indians on Indian reservations.BAlthough we think resort to secondary materials is unnec-essary to decide this case, the legislative history of the Kansas Act supports our construction. Both the House and Sen-ate Reports accompanying the Act consist almost entirely ofa letter and memorandum from Acting Secretary of the Inte-rior, E. K. Burlew, to the Chairmen of the House and SenateIndian Affairs Committees, which provide a background ac-count of the forces leading to the enactment of the KansasAct. See H. R. Rep. No. 1999, 76th Cong., 3d Sess. (1940)(hereinafter H. R. Rep.); S. Rep. No. 1523, 76th Cong., 3dSess. (1940) (hereinafter S. Rep.). According to Acting Sec-retary Burlew, in practice, Kansas had exercised jurisdictionover all offenses committed on Indian reservations involving507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT107Cite as: 507 U. S. 99 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIndians, "even where the criminal act charged constitutedone of the major offenses listed in [the Indian Major CrimesAct]," because such offenses were otherwise left unenforcedby the concerned tribes (who were without tribal courts).H. R. Rep., at 4; S. Rep., at 3. The Indian tribes of Kansasdid not object to this scheme, but welcomed it. When theauthority of the Kansas courts to entertain such prosecutionswas called into question, the tribes "expressed a wish thatthe jurisdiction hitherto exercised by the State courts becontinued." H. R. Rep., at 4; S. Rep., at 4. Thus, the Kansas Act was designed to "merely confirm a relationship whichthe State has willingly assumed, which the Indians havewillingly accepted, and which has produced successful re-sults, over a considerable period of years." H. R. Rep., at5; S. Rep., at 5.4Since Kansas had exercised jurisdiction over offenses covered by the Indian Major Crimes Act, and the Kansas Actwas enacted to ratify the existing scheme ofde facto statejurisdiction over all offenses committed on Indian reservations, it follows that Congress did not intend to retain exclu-sive federal jurisdiction over the prosecution of majorcrimes. In view of the experimental nature of the KansasAct, Congress simply intended to retain jurisdiction over4 Amici Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska et al. allege that at leastone tribe, the Potawatomi Indian Tribe, opposed the Kansas Act. Brieffor Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska et al. as Amici Curiae 17. According to amici, the Tribe sent a telegram to the Chairman of the HouseCommittee on Indian Affairs, Representative W. Rogers, voicing its opposition to the Act, which was followed by an exchange of several letters.See id., at 17-18. This correspondence is not contained in the reprintedlegislative history of the Act, but instead rests in the National Archives.Although one of Chairman Rogers' letters to the Tribe states: " `Your letters are being filed with the House Committee on Indian Affairs,' " id., at17 (quoting letter of May 10, 1939), we have no way of knowing to whatextent, if at all, the Tribe's opposition to the Kansas Act was brought tothe attention of other Members of Congress. Therefore, we regard thebackground account set forth in the House and Senate Reports as conclusive for purposes of discerning Congress' understanding of the forces leading to the introduction of the bill which became the Kansas Act.507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT108 NEGONSOTT v. SAMUELSOpinion of the Courtoffenses already subject to federal jurisdiction under 18U. S. C. $$ 1152 and 1153 in the event that the Kansas Actdid not solve the identified enforcement problem (i. e., in casethe State declined to exercise its jurisdiction). This explanation squares with Acting Secretary Burlew's conclusionthat, although the Kansas Act's "proposed relinquishment ofjurisdiction to the State of Kansas appropriately extends tothose offenses which are provided for in existing Federalstatutes as well as those which are not," "[t]he prosecutionin the Federal courts of those offenses which are now opento such prosecution will not be precluded under the bill inany particular instance where this course may be deemedadvisable." H. R. Rep., at 5; S. Rep., at 4.Petitioner argues that Congress' amendments to the original version of the bill which became the Kansas Act confirmthat it did not intend to confer jurisdiction on Kansas overconduct covered by the Indian Major Crimes Act. As originally drafted, the bill provided "[t]hat concurrent jurisdiction is hereby relinquished to the State of Kansas to prosecute Indians and others for offenses by or against Indiansor others, committed on Indian reservations in Kansas," andexplicitly stated that the Indian Major Crimes Act as wellas other statutes granting federal jurisdiction over offensescommitted in Indian country "are modified accordingly." 86Cong. Rec. 5596 (1940). Congress eventually deleted theoriginal bill's reference to "concurrent jurisdiction" as wellas its reference to the effect of the bill on the Indian MajorCrimes Act. Rather than supporting petitioner's construction of the Kansas Act, however, we think these amendmentsare in accord with our reading of the statute.The amendments to the original bill were proposed by Acting Secretary Burlew in his letter and memorandum to thecommittee chairmen in order to reflect more accurately the"legal situation as it now exists or as intended to be created."H. R. Rep., at 3; S. Rep., at 2. He explained:507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT109Cite as: 507 U. S. 99 (1993)Opinion of the Court"The bill proposes to relinquish concurrent jurisdictionto the State of Kansas, intending thereby to give theState jurisdiction of all types of crimes, whether majoror minor, defined by State law. However, the FederalGovernment has exercised jurisdiction only over majorcrimes. Therefore, strictly speaking, this is not a caseof relinquishing to a State a jurisdiction concurrent withthat of the United States, but a case of conferring uponthe State complete criminal jurisdiction, retaining, however, jurisdiction in the Federal courts to prosecutecrimes by or against Indians defined by Federal law."Ibid.Thus, the original bill was amended to make clear that thestatute conferred jurisdiction on Kansas over more offensesthan were subject to federal jurisdiction under existingfederal law, and not, as petitioner suggests, to narrow thecategory of offenses subject to prosecution in state courtto minor offenses excluded from federal jurisdiction under18 U. S. C. $ 1152.There is no explanation in the legislative history why Congress deleted the original bill's reference to the effect of thestatute on the Indian Major Crimes Act and adopted the general language of the second sentence of $ 3243 in its place.But we think it is likely that Congress simply thought itpreferable to refer generally to the fact that the Act did not"deprive" federal courts of their jurisdiction over offensesdefined by federal law, rather than to list the specific statutespursuant to which the Federal Government had exercisedjurisdiction to prosecute offenses committed by or againstIndians in Indian country. In any event, to the extent onemay draw a negative inference from Congress' decision todelete the specific reference to the effect of the Kansas Acton the Indian Major Crimes Act, we think this is too slendera reed upon which to rest departure from the clear importof the text of the Kansas Act.507US1$33Z 11-18-96 18:55:39 PAGES OPINPGT110 NEGONSOTT v. SAMUELSOpinion of the CourtCFinally, we find petitioner's resort to general principles ofIndian law unavailing. Petitioner cites our opinion inBryanv. Itasca County, 426 U. S. 373 (1976), for the proposition that"laws must be liberally construed to favor Indians." Brieffor Petitioner 11. What we actually said in Bryan, was that" `statutes passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes. . . are to be liberally construed, doubtful expressions beingresolved in favor of the Indians.' " 426 U. S., at 392 (quotingAlaska Pacific Fisheries v. United States, 248 U. S. 78, 89(1918)). Petitioner claims that the Court of Appeals' construction of the Kansas Act harms Indians by eliminatingthe historically exclusive stewardship of the Federal Government over major crimes committed by Indians in Indiancountry, and subjecting Indians to the possibility of dualprosecution by state and federal authorities.It is not entirely clear to us that the Kansas Act is a statute "passed for the benefit of dependent Indian tribes." Butif it does fall into that category, it seems likely that Congressthought that the Act's conferral of criminal jurisdiction onthe State would be a "benefit" to the tribes in question. Wesee no reason to equate "benefit of dependent Indian tribes,"as that language is used in Bryan, with "benefit of accusedIndian criminals," without regard to the interests of the vic-tims of these crimes or of the tribe itself. But in any event,for the reasons previously discussed, we think that the Kan-sas Act quite unambiguously confers jurisdiction on theState over major offenses committed by or against Indianson Indian reservations, and we therefore have no occasion toresort to this canon of statutory construction.

A PARCEL OF LAND, BUILDINGS, APPURTENANCES, AND IMPROVEMENTS,KNOWN AS 92 BUENA VISTA AVENUE,RUMSON, NEW JERSEY, et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuitNo. 91-781. Argued October 13, 1992--Decided February 24, 1993The Government filed an in rem action against the parcel of land on whichrespondent's home is located, alleging that she had purchased the property with funds given her by Joseph Brenna that were "the proceedstraceable" to illegal drug trafficking, and that the property was therefore subject to seizure and forfeiture under the Comprehensive DrugAbuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6). TheDistrict Court ruled, among other things, that respondent, who claimsthat she had no knowledge of the origins of the funds used to buy herhouse, could not invoke the "innocent owner" defense in $ 881(a)(6),which provides that "no property shall be forfeited . . . , to the extentof the interest of an owner, by reason of any act . . . established by thatowner to have been committed . . . without the knowledge or consent ofthat owner." The Court of Appeals remanded on interlocutory appeal,rejecting the District Court's reasoning that the innocent owner defensemay be invoked only by persons who are bona fide purchasers for valueand by those who acquired their property interests before the acts giving rise to the forfeiture took place.Held: The judgment is affirmed.937 F. 2d 98, affirmed.Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Blackmun, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Souter, concluded that an owner's lack of knowledgeof the fact that her home had been purchased with the proceeds of illegaldrug transactions constitutes a defense to a forfeiture proceeding underthe statute. Pp. 118-131.(a) The task of construing the statute must be approached with caution. Although customs, piracy, and revenue laws have long providedfor the official seizure and forfeiture of tangible property used in thecommission of criminal activity, the statute marked an important expansion of governmental power by authorizing the forfeiture of proceedsfrom the sale of illegal goods and by creating an express and novelprotection for innocent owners. Pp. 118-123.507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT112 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LANDSyllabus(b) The statute's use of the unqualified term "owner" in three placesis sufficiently unambiguous to foreclose any contention that the protection afforded to innocent owners is limited to bona fide purchasers.That the funds respondent used to purchase her home were a gift doesnot, therefore, disqualify her from claiming that she is such an owner.P. 123.(c) Contrary to the Government's contention, the statute did not vestownership in the United States at the moment when the proceeds of theillegal drug transaction were used to pay the purchase price of the property at issue, thereby preventing respondent from ever becoming an"owner." Neither of the "relation back" doctrines relied on by the Government--the doctrine embodied in $ 881(h), which provides that "[a]llright, title and interest in property described in subsection (a) . . . shallvest in the United States upon commission of the act giving rise toforfeiture under this section," or the common-law doctrine, under whicha forfeiture decree effectively vests title to the offending res in the Government as of the date of the offending conduct--makes the Government an owner of property before forfeiture has been decreed. Assuming that the common-law doctrine applies, it is clear that the fictionaland retroactive vesting of title thereunder is not self-executing, but occurs only when the Government wins a judgment of forfeiture. Untilthen, someone else owns the property and may invoke any availabledefense, including the assertion that she is an innocent owner. A reading of $ 881(h) demonstrates that it did not dispense with, but merelycodified, the common-law doctrine and leads to the same result. Thelegislative history reveals that $ 881(h) applies only to property that issubject to civil forfeiture under $ 881(a). Although proceeds traceableto illegal drug transactions are, in $ 881(h)'s words, "property describedin subsection" (a)(6), the latter subsection exempts from civil forfeitureproceeds owned by one unaware of their criminal source and thereforemust allow an assertion of the innocent owner defense before $ 881(h)applies. Pp. 123-129.(d) This Court need not resolve, inter alia, the parties' dispute as tothe point at which guilty knowledge of the tainted character of propertywill deprive a party of an innocent owner defense, because respondenthas assumed the burden of convincing the trier of fact that she hadno knowledge of the alleged source of Brenna's gift when she receivedit. Pp. 129-131.Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, concluded:1. While it is true that $ 881(a)(6)'s "innocent owner" exception produces the same result as would an "innocent owner" exception to traditional common-law forfeiture (with its relation-back principle), that conclusion cannot be based upon the plurality's implausible reading of the507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT113Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)Syllabusphrase "property described in subsection (a)." Rather, the resultreached in this case is correct because $ 881(h) is best read as an expression of the traditional relation-back doctrine, which is a doctrine of retroactive vesting of title that takes effect only upon entry of the judicialorder of forfeiture or condemnation. Under the alternative reading--that $ 881(h) provides for immediate, undecreed, secret vesting of titlein the United States at the time of the illegal transaction--either theplain language of $ 881(a)(6)'s innocent-owner provision must be slightedor the provision must be deprived of all effect. Additionally, the traditional relation-back principle is the only interpretation of $ 881(h) thatmakes sense within the structure of the applicable customs forfeitureprocedures, under which the Government does not gain title until thereis a forfeiture decree, and provides the only explanation for the textualdistinction between $ 881(a)(6)'s innocent "owner" and $ 853's innocent"transferee" provisions. Pp. 131-138.2. There is no proper basis for the plurality's conclusion that respondent has assumed the burden of proving that she had no knowledge ofthe alleged source of Brenna's gift when she received it, as opposed towhen the illegal acts giving rise to forfeiture occurred. The issue ofwhat is the relevant time for purposes of determining lack of knowledgeis not fairly included in the question on which the Court granted certiorari, and the Court need not resolve it.

Respondentthereafter asserted a claim to the property, was granted theright to defend the action,3 and filed a motion for summaryjudgment.During pretrial proceedings, the following facts were established. In 1982, Joseph Brenna gave respondent approximately $240,000 to purchase the home that she and her threechildren have occupied ever since. Respondent is the soleowner of the property. From 1981 until their separation in1987, she maintained an intimate personal relationship withBrenna. There is probable cause to believe that the fundsused to buy the house were proceeds of illegal drug trafficking, but respondent swears that she had no knowledge ofits origins.drug transaction, and was therefore subject to forfeiture pursuant to$ 881(a)(7), which provides:"The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States andno property right shall exist in them:. . . . ."(7) All real property, including any right, title, and interest (includingany leasehold interest) in the whole of any lot or tract of land and anyappurtenances or improvements, which is used, or intended to be used, inany manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year's imprisonment,except that no property shall be forfeited under this paragraph, to theextent of an interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omitted without theknowledge or consent of that owner."No issue concerning the Government's claim under subparagraph (7) ispresented before us.3 The United States Marshals Service entered into an agreement withrespondent that allows her to remain in possession of the property pending the outcome of the litigation.507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT116 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LANDOpinion of Stevens, J.Among the grounds advanced in support of her motion forsummary judgment was the claim that she was an innocentowner under $ 881(a)(6). The District Court rejected thisdefense for two reasons: First, it ruled that "the innocentowner defense may only be invoked by those who can demon-strate that they are bona fidepurchasers for value" (empha-sis in original);4 second, the court read the statute to offerthe innocent owner defense only to persons who acquired aninterest in the property before the acts giving rise to theforfeiture took place.5Respondent was allowed to take an interlocutory appealpursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b). One of the controllingquestions of law presented to the Court of Appeals was:"Whether an innocent owner defense may be assertedby a person who is not a bona fide purchaser for valueconcerning a parcel of land where the government hasestablished probable cause to believe that the parcel ofland was purchased with monies traceable to drug pro-ceeds." 742 F. Supp. 189, 192 (NJ 1990).Answering that question in the affirmative, the Court ofAppeals remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether respondent was, in fact, an innocent owner.4 "I find that the claimant cannot successfully invoke the `innocentowner' defense here, because she admits that she received the proceeds topurchase the premises as a gift from Mr. Brenna. More particularly, Ifind that where, as here, the government has demonstrated probable causeto believe that property is traceable to proceeds from drug transactions,the innocent owner defense may only be invoked by those who can demonstrate that they are bona fide purchasers for value." 738 F. Supp. 854,860 (NJ 1990).5 "In particular, the `innocent owner defense' at issue provides that `noproperty shall be forfeited . . . to the extent of the interest of an owner,by reason of any act or omission . . . committed or omitted without theknowledge or consent of that owner.' 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6) (emphasissupplied).

S. 111 (1993)Opinion of Stevens, J.The Court of Appeals refused to limit the innocent ownerdefense to bona fide purchasers for value because the plainlanguage of the statute contains no such limitation,6 becauseit read the legislative history as indicating that the term"owner" should be broadly construed,7 and because the difference between the text of $ 881(a)(6) and the text of thecriminal forfeiture statute evidenced congressional intentnot to restrict the civil section in the same way.8The Court of Appeals also rejected the argument that respondent could not be an innocent owner unless she acquiredthe property before the drug transaction occurred. In advancing that argument the Government had relied on the"relation back" doctrine embodied in $ 881(h), which providesthat "[a]ll right, title, and interest in property described insubsection (a) of this section shall vest in the United Statesupon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture underthis section." The court held that the relation back doctrineapplied only to "property described in subsection (a)" andthat the property at issue would not fit that description ifrespondent could establish her innocent owner defense.The court concluded that the Government's interpretation of$ 881(h) "would essentially serve to emasculate the innocentowner defense provided for in section 881(a)(6).

Colonial courtsregularly exercised jurisdiction to enforce English and localstatutes authorizing the seizure of ships and goods used inviolation of customs and revenue laws.9 Indeed, the misuse9 "Long before the adoption of the Constitution the common law courtsin the Colonies--and later in the states during the period of Confederation--were exercising jurisdiction in rem in the enforcement of forfeiturestatutes. Like the Exchequer, in cases of seizure on navigable watersthey exercised a jurisdiction concurrently with the courts of admiralty.But the vice-admiralty courts in the Colonies did not begin to functionwith any real continuity until about 1700 or shortly afterward.

By that time, the jurisdictionof common law courts to condemn ships and cargoes for violation of theNavigation Acts had been firmly established, apparently without question,and was regularly exercised throughout the colonies.

S. 476, 481-482(1965), Justice Stewart explained: "Vivid in the memory of the newly independent Americans were those general warrants known as writs of assistance under which officers of the Crown had so bedeviled the colonists.The hated writs of assistance had given customs officials blanket authorityto search where they pleased for goods imported in violation of the Britishtax laws. They were denounced by James Otis as `the worst instrumentof arbitrary power, the most destructive of English liberty, and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in an English law book,'because they placed `the liberty of every man in the hands of every pettyofficer.' The historic occasion of that denunciation, in 1761 at Boston, hasbeen characterized as `perhaps the most prominent event which inaugurated the resistance of the colonies to the oppressions of the mother country. "Then and there," said John Adams, "then and there was the firstscene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain.Then and there the child Independence was born."

The vessel which commits the aggression is treated as the offender, as the guilty instrument or thing to which the forfeiture attaches,without any reference whatsoever to the character or conduct of theowner.

Nor is there any thing new in a provision of this sort. It isnot an uncommon course in the admiralty, acting under the law of nations,to treat the vessel in which or by which, or by the master or crew thereof,a wrong or offense has been done as the offender, without any regardwhatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the ownerthereof. And this is done from the necessity of the case, as the only adequate means of suppressing the offence or wrong, or insuring an indemnityto the injured party. The doctrine also is familiarly applied to cases ofsmuggling and other misconduct under our revenue laws; and has beenapplied to other kindred cases, such as cases arising on embargo and nonintercourse acts. In short, the acts of the master and crew, in cases ofthis sort, bind the interest of the owner of the ship, whether he be innocentor guilty; and he impliedly submits to whatever the law denounces as aforfeiture attached to the ship by reason of their unlawful or wantonwrongs."

United States, 2 How. 210, 233-234 (1844).14 "Beyond controversy, the title of the premises and property was inthe claimant; and it is equally certain that he leased the same to the lesseefor the purposes of a distillery, and with the knowledge that the lesseeintended to use the premises to carry on that business, and that he diduse the same for that purpose."Fraud is not imputed to the owner of the premises; but the evidenceand the verdict of the jury warrant the conclusion that the frauds chargedin the information were satisfactorily proved, from which it follows thatthe decree of condemnation is correct, if it be true, as heretofore explained,that it was the property and not the claimant that was put to trial underthe pleadings; and we are also of the opinion that the theory adopted bythe court below, that, if the lessee of the premises and the operator of thedistillery committed the alleged frauds, the government was entitled to averdict, even though the jury were of the opinion that the claimant wasignorant of the fraudulent acts or omissions of the distiller."

S. 111 (1993)Opinion of Stevens, J.In all of these early cases the Government's right to takepossession of property stemmed from the misuse of the property itself. Indeed, until our decision in Warden, Md. Peni-tentiary v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294 (1967), the Government hadpower to seize only property that " `the private citizen wasnot permitted to possess.' "15 The holding in that case thatthe Fourth Amendment did not prohibit the seizure of "mereevidence" marked an important expansion of governmentalpower. See Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U. S. 547, 577-580 (1978) (Stevens, J., dissenting).The decision by Congress in 1978 to amend the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, 84Stat. 1236, to authorize the seizure and forfeiture of proceedsof illegal drug transactions, see 92 Stat. 3777, also marked animportant expansion of governmental power.16 Before thatamendment, the statute had authorized forfeiture of only the15 "Thus stolen property--the fruits of crime--was always subject toseizure. And the power to search for stolen property was gradually extended to cover `any property which the private citizen was not permittedto possess,' which included instrumentalities of crime (because of the earlynotion that items used in crime were forfeited to the State) and contraband. Kaplan, Search and Seizure: A No-Man's Land in the CriminalLaw, 49 Calif. L. Rev. 474, 475. No separate governmental interest inseizing evidence to apprehend and convict criminals was recognized; itwas required that some property interest be asserted. The remedialstructure also reflected these dual premises. Trespass, replevin, and theother means of redress for persons aggrieved by searches and seizures,depended upon proof of a superior property interest. And since a lawfulseizure presupposed a superior claim, it was inconceivable that a personcould recover property lawfully seized." Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S.,at 303-304.16 A precedent for this expansion had been established in 1970 by theRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), see 18U. S. C. $ 1963(a). Even RICO, however, did not specifically provide forthe forfeiture of "proceeds" until 1984, when Congress added $ 1963(a)(3)to resolve any doubt whether it intended the statute to reach so far.

Because the statute,after its 1978 amendment, does authorize the forfeiture ofsuch proceeds and also contains an express and novel protec17 Section 511(a) of the 1970 Act, 84 Stat. 1276, provided:"The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the United States and noproperty right shall exist in them:"(1) All controlled substances which have been manufactured, distributed, dispensed, or acquired in violation of this title."(2) All raw materials, products, and equipment of any kind which areused, or intended for use, in manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing, or exporting any controlled substance in violation ofthis title."(3) All property which is used, or intended for use, as a container forproperty described in paragraph (1) or (2)."(4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles, or vessels, which areused, or are intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitatethe transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of propertydescribed in paragraph (1) or (2), except that--"(A) no conveyance used by any person as a common carrier in thetransaction of business as a common carrier shall be forfeited under theprovisions of this section unless it shall appear that the owner or otherperson in charge of such conveyance was a consenting party or privy to aviolation of this title or title III; and"(B) no conveyance shall be forfeited under the provisions of this sectionby reason of any act or omission established by the owner thereof to havebeen committed or omitted by any person other than such owner whilesuch conveyance was unlawfully in the possession of a person other thanthe owner in violation of the criminal laws of the United States, or ofany State."(5) All books, records, and research, including formulas, microfilm,tapes, and data which are used, or intended for use, in violation of thistitle."507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT123Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)Opinion of Stevens, J.tion for innocent owners, we approach the task of construingit with caution.IIIThe Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the protec-tion afforded to innocent owners is not limited to bona fidepurchasers. The text of the statute is the strongest supportfor this conclusion. The statute authorizes the forfeiture ofmoneys exchanged for a controlled substance, and "all pro-ceeds traceable to such an exchange," with one unequivocalexception:"[N]o property shall be forfeited under this paragraph,to the extent of the interest of an owner, by reason ofany act or omission established by that owner to havebeen committed or omitted without the knowledge orconsent of that owner." 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(6).The term "owner" is used three times and each time it isunqualified. Such language is sufficiently unambiguous toforeclose any contention that it applies only to bona fide pur-chasers. Presumably that explains why the Governmentdoes not now challenge this aspect of the Court of Appeals'ruling.That the funds respondent used to purchase her homewere a gift does not, therefore, disqualify respondent fromclaiming that she is an owner who had no knowledge of thealleged fact that those funds were "proceeds traceable" toillegal sales of controlled substances. Under the terms ofthe statute, her status would be precisely the same if, insteadof having received a gift of $240,000 from Brenna, she hadsold him a house for that price and used the proceeds to buythe property at issue. IVAlthough the Government does not challenge our interpre-tation of the statutory term "owner," it insists that respondent is not the "owner" of a house she bought in 1982 and haslived in ever since. Indeed, it contends that she never has507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT124 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LANDOpinion of Stevens, J.been the owner of this parcel of land because the statutevested ownership in the United States at the moment whenthe proceeds of an illegal drug transaction were used to paythe purchase price. In support of its position, the Government relies on both the text of the 1984 amendment to thestatute and the common-law relation back doctrine. Weconclude, however, that neither the amendment nor thecommon-law rule makes the Government an owner of property before forfeiture has been decreed.In analyzing the Government's relation back argument, itis important to remember that respondent invokes the innocent owner defense against a claim that proceeds traceableto an illegal transaction are forfeitable. The Governmentcontends that the money that Brenna received in exchangefor narcotics became Government property at the momentBrenna received it and that respondent's house became Government property when that tainted money was used in itspurchase. Because neither the money nor the house couldhave constituted forfeitable proceeds until after an illegaltransaction occurred, the Government's submission wouldeffectively eliminate the innocent owner defense in almostevery imaginable case in which proceeds could be forfeited.It seems unlikely that Congress would create a meaninglessdefense. Moreover, considering that a logical application ofthe Government's submission would result in the forfeitureof property innocently acquired by persons who had beenpaid with illegal proceeds for providing goods or services todrug traffickers,18 the burden of persuading us that Congressintended such an inequitable result is especially heavy.18 At oral argument the Government suggested that a narrow interpretation of the word "proceeds" would "probably" prevent this absurdity.See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27. The Government's brief, however, took the unequivocal position that the statute withholds the innocent owner defensefrom anyone who acquires proceeds after the illegal transaction took place.See Brief for United States 10, 21, 25, 27.507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT125Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)Opinion of Stevens, J.The Government recognizes that the 1984 amendment didnot go into effect until two years after respondent acquiredthe property at issue in this case. It therefore relies heavilyon the common-law relation back doctrine applied to in remforfeitures. That doctrine applied the fiction that propertyused in violation of law was itself the wrongdoer that mustbe held to account for the harms it had caused.19 Becausethe property, or "res," was treated as the wrongdoer, it wasappropriate to regard it as the actual party to the in remforfeiture proceeding. Under the relation back doctrine, adecree of forfeiture had the effect of vesting title to the of-fending res in the Government as of the date of its offendingconduct. Because we are not aware of any common-lawprecedent for treating proceeds traceable to an unlawful exchange as a fictional wrongdoer subject to forfeiture, it is notentirely clear that the common-law relation back doctrine isapplicable. Assuming that the doctrine does apply, how-ever, it is nevertheless clear that under the common-law rulethe fictional and retroactive vesting was not self-executing.Chief Justice Marshall explained that forfeiture does notautomatically vest title to property in the Government:"It has been proved, that in all forfeitures accruing atcommon law, nothing vests in the government until somelegal step shall be taken for the assertion of its right,after which, for many purposes, the doctrine of relationcarries back the title to the commission of the offence."United States v. Grundy, 3 Cranch 337, 350-351 (1806).2019 See Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U. S. 663, 680-684 (1974).20 In his dissent, Justice Kennedy advocates the adoption of a newcommon-law rule that would avoid the need to construe the terms of thestatute that created the Government's right to forfeit proceeds of drugtransactions. Under his suggested self-executing rule, patterned after anamalgam of the law of trusts and the law of secured transactions, theGovernment would be treated as the owner of a secured or beneficial interest in forfeitable proceeds even before a decree of forfeiture is entered.The various authorities that he cites support the proposition that if such507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT126 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LANDOpinion of Stevens, J.The same rule applied when a statute (a statute that con-tained no specific relation back provision) authorized theforfeiture. In a passage to which the Government has re-ferred us,21 we stated our understanding of how the Government's title to forfeited property relates back to the momentof forfeitability:"By the settled doctrine of this court, whenever astatute enacts that upon the commission of a certain actspecific property used in or connected with that act shallbe forfeited, the forfeiture takes effect immediatelyupon the commission of the act; the right to the propertythen vests in the United States,although their title isnot perfected until judicial condemnation; the forfeiture constitutes a statutory transfer of the right to theUnited States at the time the offence is committed; andan interest exists, it may be extinguished by a sale to a bona fide purchaser; they provide no support for the assumption that such an interestsprings into existence independently. As a matter of common law, hisproposal is inconsistent with Chief Justice Marshall's statement that"nothing vests in the government until some legal step shall be taken,"and with the cases cited by Justice Scalia, post, at 132. As a matter ofstatutory law, it is improper to rely on $ 881(a) as the source of the Government's interest in proceeds without also giving effect to the statutorylanguage defining the scope of that interest. That a statutory provisioncontains "puzzling" language, or seems unwise, is not an appropriate reason for simply ignoring its text.Justice Kennedy's dramatic suggestion that our construction of the1984 amendment "rips out," post, at 145, the "centerpiece of the Nation'sdrug enforcement laws," post, at 144, rests on what he characterizes asthe "safe" assumption that the innocent owner defense would be availableto "an associate" of a criminal who could "shelter the proceeds from forfeiture, to be reacquired once he is clear from law enforcement authorities,"ibid. As a matter of fact, forfeitable proceeds are much more likely to bepossessed by drug dealers themselves than by transferees sufficiently remote to qualify as innocent owners; as a matter of law, it is quite clearthat neither an "associate" in the criminal enterprise nor a temporarycustodian of drug proceeds would qualify as an innocent owner; indeed,neither would a sham bona fide purchaser.21 See Pet. for Cert. 9-10; Brief for United States 17.507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT127Cite as: 507 U. S. 111 (1993)Opinion of Stevens, J.the condemnation, when obtained, relates back to thattime, and avoids all intermediate sales and alienations,even to purchasers in good faith." United States v.Stowell, 133 U. S., at 16-17 (emphases added).If the Government wins a judgment of forfeiture under thecommon-law rule--which applied to common-law forfeituresand to forfeitures under statutes without specific relationback provisions--the vesting of its title in the property relates back to the moment when the property became forfeitable. Until the Government does win such a judgment,however, someone else owns the property. That person maytherefore invoke any defense available to the owner of theproperty before the forfeiture is decreed.In this case a statute allows respondent to prove that sheis an innocent owner. And, as the Chief Justice further explained in Grundy, if a forfeiture is authorized by statute,"the rules of the common law may be dispensed with," 3Cranch, at 351. Congress had the opportunity to dispensewith the common-law doctrine when it enacted $ 881(h); aswe read that subsection, however, Congress merely codifiedthe common-law rule. Because that rule was never appliedto the forfeiture of proceeds, and because the statute nowcontains an innocent owner defense, it may not be immediately clear that they lead to the same result.The 1984 amendment provides:"All right, title, and interest in property described insubsection (a) of this section shall vest in the UnitedStates upon commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture under this section." 21 U. S. C. $ 881(h).Because proceeds traceable to illegal drug transactions area species of "property described in subsection (a)," the Government argues that this provision has the effect of preventing such proceeds from becoming the property of anyoneother than the United States. The argument fails.507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT128 UNITED STATES v. PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LANDOpinion of Stevens, J.Although proceeds subject to $ 881(h) are "described" inthe first part of subsection (a)(6), the last clause of that subsection exempts certain proceeds--proceeds owned by oneunaware of their criminal source--from forfeiture. As theSenate Report on the 1984 amendment correctly observed,the amendment applies only to "property which is subject tocivil forfeiture under section 881(a)." 22 Under $ 881(a)(6),the property of one who can satisfy the innocent owner defense is not subject to civil forfeiture. Because the successof any defense available under $ 881(a) will necessarily determine whether $ 881(h) applies, $ 881(a)(6) must allow an assertion of the defense before $ 881(h) applies.2322 The Report provides:"Section 306 also adds two new subsections at the end of section 881.The first provides that all right, title, and interest in property which issubject to civil forfeiture under section 881(a) vests in the United Statesupon the commission of the acts giving rise to the forfeiture." S. Rep.No. 98-225, p. 215 (1983) (emphasis added).23 The logic of the Government's argument would apparently apply aswell to the innocent owner defense added to the statute in 1988. Thatamendment provides, in part:"[N]o conveyance shall be forfeited under this paragraph to the extentof an interest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established bythat owner to have been committed or omitted without the knowledge,consent, or willful blindness of the owner." $ 6075(3)(C), 102 Stat. 4324.That amendment presumably was enacted to protect lessors like the ownerwhose yacht was forfeited in a proceeding that led this Court to observe:"It therefore has been implied that it would be difficult to reject the constitutional claim of an owner whose property subjected to forfeiture had beentaken from him without his privity or consent. See, [Peisch v. Ware, 4Cranch 347, 364 (1808)]; Goldsmith-Grant Co. v. United States, 254 U. S.,at 512; United States v. One Ford Coupe Automobile, 272 U. S., at 333;Van Oster v. Kansas, 272 U. S., at 467. Similarly, the same might be saidof an owner who proved not only that he was uninvolved in and unawareof the wrongful activity, but also that he had done all that reasonablycould be expected to prevent the proscribed use of his property; for, inthat circumstance, it would be difficult to conclude that forfeiture servedlegitimate purposes and was not unduly oppressive.

S. 111 (1993)Opinion of Stevens, J.Therefore, when Congress enacted this innocent owner de-fense, and then specifically inserted this relation back provision into the statute, it did not disturb the common-lawrights of either owners of forfeitable property or the Government. The common-law rule had always allowed owners toinvoke defenses made available to thembefore the Govern-ment's title vested, and after title did vest, the common-lawrule had always related that title back to the date of thecommission of the act that made the specific property forfeitable. Our decision denies the Government no benefits of therelation back doctrine. The Government cannot profit fromthe common-law doctrine of relation back until it has ob-tained a judgment of forfeiture. And it cannot profit fromthe statutory version of that doctrine in $ 881(h) until re-spondent has had the chance to invoke and offer evidence tosupport the innocent owner defense under $ 881(a)(6).VAs a postscript we identify two issues that the partieshave addressed, but that need not be decided.The Government has argued that the Court of Appeals'construction of the statute is highly implausible because itwould enable a transferee of the proceeds of an illegal ex-change to qualify as an innocent owner if she was unawareof the illegal transaction when it occurred but learned aboutit before she accepted the forfeitable proceeds. Respondentdisputes this reading of the statute and argues that both leg-islative history and common sense suggest that the transferee's lack of knowledge must be established as of the timethe proceeds at issue are transferred.24 Moreover, whetherUnited States, 364 U.

PARCEL OF RUMSON, N. J., LANDOpinion of Stevens, J.or not the text of the statute is sufficiently ambiguous tojustify resort to the legislative history, equitable doctrinesmay foreclose the assertion of an innocent owner defense bya party with guilty knowledge of the tainted character of theproperty. In all events, we need not resolve this issue inthis case; respondent has assumed the burden of convincingthe trier of fact that she had no knowledge of the allegedsource of Brenna's gift in 1982, when she received it.25 Inits order denying respondent's motion for summary judg-ment, the District Court assumed that respondent couldprove what she had alleged, as did the Court of Appeals inallowing the interlocutory appeal from that order. Wemerely decide, as did both of those courts, whether her as-serted defense was insufficient as a matter of law.26At oral argument, the Government also suggested that thestatutory reference to "all proceeds traceable to such an ex-change" is subject to a narrowing construction that mightavoid some of the harsh consequences suggested in the various amici briefs expressing concerns about the impact of thestatute on real estate titles. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-10, 19-25. If a house were received in exchange for a quantity ofillegal substances and that house were in turn exchanged foranother house, would the traceable proceeds consist of thefirst house, the second house, or both, with the Governmenthaving an election between the two?

SinceGoodwin did not have any knowledge of the alleged criminal transactionuntil long after the transfer, she should be protected by the innocentowner clause." Brief for Respondent 37-38.26 If she can show that she was unaware of the illegal source of the fundsat the time Brenna transferred them to her, then she was necessarilyunaware that they were the profits of an illegal transaction at the time ofthe transaction itself.507US1$34K 11-18-96 19:09:09 PAGES OPINPGT131Cite as: 507 U.
