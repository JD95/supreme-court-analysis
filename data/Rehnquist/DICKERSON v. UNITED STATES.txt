UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtevidence. In the wake of that decision, Congress enacted18 U. S. C. $ 3501, which in essence laid down a rule that theadmissibility of such statements should turn only on whetheror not they were voluntarily made. We hold thatMiranda,being a constitutional decision of this Court, may not bein effect overruled by an Act of Congress, and we declineto overrule Miranda ourselves. We therefore hold thatMiranda and its progeny in this Court govern the admissi-bility of statements made during custodial interrogation inboth state and federal courts.Petitioner Dickerson was indicted for bank robbery, conspiracy to commit bank robbery, and using a firearm in thecourse of committing a crime of violence, all in violation ofthe applicable provisions of Title 18 of the United StatesCode. Before trial, Dickerson moved to suppress a statement he had made at a Federal Bureau of Investigation fieldoffice, on the grounds that he had not received "Mirandawarnings" before being interrogated. The District Courtgranted his motion to suppress, and the Government took aninterlocutory appeal to the United States Court of Appealsfor the Fourth Circuit. That court, by a divided vote, reversed the District Court's suppression order. It agreedwith the District Court's conclusion that petitioner had notreceived Miranda warnings before making his statement.But it went on to hold that $ 3501, which in effect makes theadmissibility of statements such as Dickerson's turn solelyon whether they were made voluntarily, was satisfied inthis case. It then concluded that our decision in Mirandawas not a constitutional holding, and that, therefore, Congress could by statute have the final say on the question ofadmissibility. 166 F. 3d 667 (1999).Because of the importance of the questions raised by theCourt of Appeals' decision, we granted certiorari, 528 U. S.1045 (1999), and now reverse.We begin with a brief historical account of the law governing the admission of confessions. Prior to Miranda, we530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN433Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Opinion of the Courtevaluated the admissibility of a suspect's confession under avoluntariness test. The roots of this test developed in thecommon law, as the courts of England and then the UnitedStates recognized that coerced confessions are inherently untrustworthy. See, e. g., King v. Rudd, 1 Leach 115, 117-118,122-123, 168 Eng. Rep. 160, 161, 164 (K. B. 1783) (Lord Mansfield, C. J.) (stating that the English courts excluded confessions obtained by threats and promises); King v. Warickshall, 1 Leach 262, 263-264, 168 Eng. Rep. 234, 235 (K. B.1783) ("A free and voluntary confession is deserving of thehighest credit, because it is presumed to flow from the strongest sense of guilt . . . but a confession forced from the mindby the flattery of hope, or by the torture of fear, comes inso questionable a shape . . . that no credit ought to be givento it; and therefore it is rejected"); King v. Parratt, 4 Car. &P. 570, 172 Eng. Rep. 829 (N. P. 1831); Queen v. Garner,1 Den. 329, 169 Eng. Rep. 267 (Ct. Crim. App. 1848); Queenv. Baldry, 2 Den. 430, 169 Eng. Rep. 568 (Ct. Crim. App.1852); Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S. 574 (1884); Piercev. United States, 160 U. S. 355, 357 (1896). Over time, ourcases recognized two constitutional bases for the requirement that a confession be voluntary to be admitted into evidence: the Fifth Amendment right against self-incriminationand the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.See, e. g., Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 542 (1897)(stating that the voluntariness test "is controlled by thatportion of the Fifth Amendment . . . commanding that noperson `shall be compelled in any criminal case to be awitness against himself ' "); Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S.278 (1936) (reversing a criminal conviction under the DueProcess Clause because it was based on a confession obtainedby physical coercion).While Bram was decided before Brown and its progeny,for the middle third of the 20th century our cases basedthe rule against admitting coerced confessions primarily, ifnot exclusively, on notions of due process. We applied the530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN434 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdue process voluntariness test in "some 30 different casesdecided during the era that intervened between Brownand Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 [(1964)]." Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 223 (1973). See, e. g.,Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Ashcraft v.Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Chambers v. Florida, 309U. S. 227 (1940). Those cases refined the test into an inquirythat examines "whether a defendant's will was overborne"by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession.Schneckloth, 412 U. S., at 226. The due process test takesinto consideration "the totality of all the surrounding circumstances--both the characteristics of the accused andthe details of the interrogation." Ibid. See also Haynes,supra, at 513; Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49, 55 (1962);Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433, 440 (1961) ("[A]ll the circumstances attendant upon the confession must be taken intoaccount"); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 404 (1945)("If all the attendant circumstances indicate that the confession was coerced or compelled, it may not be used to convicta defendant"). The determination "depend[s] upon a weighing of the circumstances of pressure against the power ofresistance of the person confessing." Stein v. New York, 346U. S. 156, 185 (1953).We have never abandoned this due process jurisprudence,and thus continue to exclude confessions that were obtainedinvoluntarily. But our decisions in Malloy v. Hogan, 378U. S. 1 (1964), and Miranda changed the focus of much ofthe inquiry in determining the admissibility of suspects' incriminating statements. In Malloy, we held that the FifthAmendment's Self-Incrimination Clause is incorporated inthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment andthus applies to the States. 378 U. S., at 6-11. We decidedMiranda on the heels of Malloy.In Miranda, we noted that the advent of modern custodial police interrogation brought with it an increased con530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN435Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Opinion of the Courtcern about confessions obtained by coercion.1 384 U. S., at445-458. Because custodial police interrogation, by its verynature, isolates and pressures the individual, we statedthat "[e]ven without employing brutality, the `third degree'or [other] specific stratagems, . . . custodial interrogationexacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on theweakness of individuals." Id., at 455. We concluded thatthe coercion inherent in custodial interrogation blurs theline between voluntary and involuntary statements, andthus heightens the risk that an individual will not be "accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment . . . not tobe compelled to incriminate himself."Id., at 439. Accord-ingly, we laid down "concrete constitutional guidelines forlaw enforcement agencies and courts to follow." Id., at 442.Those guidelines established that the admissibility in evidence of any statement given during custodial interrogationof a suspect would depend on whether the police providedthe suspect with four warnings. These warnings (whichhave come to be known colloquially as "Miranda rights") are:a suspect "has the right to remain silent, that anything hesays can be used against him in a court of law, that he hasthe right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannotafford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to anyquestioning if he so desires." Id., at 479.Two years after Miranda was decided, Congress enacted$ 3501. That section provides, in relevant part:"(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the UnitedStates or by the District of Columbia, a confession . . .shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.Before such confession is received in evidence, the trial1 While our cases have long interpreted the Due Process and SelfIncrimination Clauses to require that a suspect be accorded a fair trialfree from coerced testimony, our application of those Clauses to the context of custodial police interrogation is relatively recent because the routine practice of such interrogation is itself a relatively new development.See, e. g., Miranda, 384 U. S., at 445-458.530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN436 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtjudge shall, out of the presence of the jury, determineany issue as to voluntariness. If the trial judge determines that the confession was voluntarily made it shallbe admitted in evidence and the trial judge shall permitthe jury to hear relevant evidence on the issue of volun-tariness and shall instruct the jury to give such weightto the confession as the jury feels it deserves under allthe circumstances."(b) The trial judge in determining the issue of vol-untariness shall take into consideration all the circumstances surrounding the giving of the confession, includ-ing (1) the time elapsing between arrest and arraignmentof the defendant making the confession, if it was madeafter arrest and before arraignment, (2) whether suchdefendant knew the nature of the offense with which hewas charged or of which he was suspected at the timeof making the confession, (3) whether or not such de-fendant was advised or knew that he was not requiredto make any statement and that any such statementcould be used against him, (4) whether or not such defendant had been advised prior to questioning of hisright to the assistance of counsel; and (5) whether ornot such defendant was without the assistance of counselwhen questioned and when giving such confession."The presence or absence of any of the above-mentioned factors to be taken into consideration by thejudge need not be conclusive on the issue of voluntari-ness of the confession."Given $ 3501's express designation of voluntariness asthe touchstone of admissibility, its omission of any warningrequirement, and the instruction for trial courts to considera nonexclusive list of factors relevant to the circumstancesof a confession, we agree with the Court of Appeals thatCongress intended by its enactment to overrule Miranda.See also Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452, 464 (1994)(Scalia, J., concurring) (stating that, prior to Miranda,530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN437Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Opinion of the Court"voluntariness vel non was the touchstone of admissibility ofconfessions"). Because of the obvious conflict between ourdecision in Miranda and $ 3501, we must address whetherCongress has constitutional authority to thus supersedeMiranda. If Congress has such authority, $ 3501's totality-of-the-circumstances approach must prevail overMiranda'srequirement of warnings; if not, that section must yield toMiranda's more specific requirements.The law in this area is clear. This Court has supervisoryauthority over the federal courts, and we may use that au-thority to prescribe rules of evidence and procedure thatare binding in those tribunals. Carlisle v. United States,517 U. S. 416, 426 (1996). However, the power to judiciallycreate and enforce nonconstitutional "rules of procedureand evidence for the federal courts exists only in the absence of a relevant Act of Congress." Palermo v. UnitedStates, 360 U. S. 343, 353, n. 11 (1959) (citing Funk v. UnitedStates, 290 U. S. 371, 382 (1933), and Gordon v. United States,344 U. S. 414, 418 (1953)). Congress retains the ultimateauthority to modify or set aside any judicially created rulesof evidence and procedure that are not required by the Constitution. Palermo, supra, at 345-348; Carlisle, supra, at426; Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 265 (1980).But Congress may not legislatively supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the Constitution. See, e. g.,City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517-521 (1997). Thiscase therefore turns on whether the Miranda Court announced a constitutional rule or merely exercised its supervisory authority to regulate evidence in the absence of congressional direction. Recognizing this point, the Court ofAppeals surveyed Miranda and its progeny to determine theconstitutional status of the Miranda decision. 166 F. 3d,at 687-692. Relying on the fact that we have created several exceptions to Miranda's warnings requirement and thatwe have repeatedly referred to the Miranda warnings as"prophylactic," New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649, 653530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN438 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court(1984), and "not themselves rights protected by the Constitu-tion,"Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433, 444 (1974),2 theCourt of Appeals concluded that the protections announcedinMiranda are not constitutionally required. 166 F. 3d, at687-690.We disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion, although we concede that there is language in some of ouropinions that supports the view taken by that court. Butfirst and foremost of the factors on the other side--thatMiranda is a constitutional decision--is that both Mirandaand two of its companion cases applied the rule to proceedings in state courts--to wit, Arizona, California, and NewYork. See 384 U. S., at 491-494, 497-499. Since that time,we have consistently applied Miranda's rule to prosecutionsarising in state courts. See,e. g., Stansbury v. California,511 U. S. 318 (1994) (per curiam); Minnick v. Mississippi, 498U. S. 146 (1990);Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 675 (1988);Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 481-482 (1981). It is beyond dispute that we do not hold a supervisory power overthe courts of the several States. Smith v. Phillips, 455 U. S.209, 221 (1982) ("Federal courts hold no supervisory authority over state judicial proceedings and may intervene onlyto correct wrongs of constitutional dimension"); Cicenia v.Lagay, 357 U. S. 504, 508-509 (1958). With respect to proceedings in state courts, our "authority is limited to enforcing the commands of the United States Constitution."Mu'Min v. Virginia, 500 U. S. 415, 422 (1991). See alsoHarris v. Rivera, 454 U. S. 339, 344-345 (1981) (per curiam)(stating that "[f]ederal judges . . . may not require the ob2 See also Davis v. United States, 512 U.

Barrett, 479 U. S. 523, 528 (1987) ("[T]he MirandaCourt adopted prophylactic rules designed to insulate the exercise of FifthAmendment rights"); Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298, 306 (1985); Edwardsv.

S. 428 (2000)Opinion of the Courtservance of any special procedures" in state courts "exceptwhen necessary to assure compliance with the dictates of theFederal Constitution").3The Miranda opinion itself begins by stating that theCourt granted certiorari "to explore some facets of the prob-lems . . . of applying the privilege against self-incriminationto in-custody interrogation, and to give concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courtsto follow." 384 U. S., at 441-442 (emphasis added). In fact,the majority opinion is replete with statements indicatingthat the majority thought it was announcing a constitutionalrule.4 Indeed, the Court's ultimate conclusion was that the3 Our conclusion regarding Miranda's constitutional basis is furtherbuttressed by the fact that we have allowed prisoners to bring allegedMiranda violations before the federal courts in habeas corpus proceedings. See Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U. S. 99 (1995); Withrow, supra, at690-695. Habeas corpus proceedings are available only for claims that aperson "is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treatiesof the United States." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a). Since the Miranda rule isclearly not based on federal laws or treaties, our decision allowing habeasreview for Miranda claims obviously assumes that Miranda is of constitutional origin.4 See 384 U. S., at 445 ("The constitutional issue we decide in each ofthese cases is the admissibility of statements obtained from a defendantquestioned while in custody"), 457 (stating that the Miranda Court wasconcerned with "adequate safeguards to protect precious Fifth Amendment rights"), 458 (examining the "history and precedent underlying theSelf-Incrimination Clause to determine its applicability in this situation"),476 ("The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is . . . fundamentalwith respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation"), 479 ("The wholethrust of our foregoing discussion demonstrates that the Constitution hasprescribed the rights of the individual when confronted with the powerof government when it provided in the Fifth Amendment that an individual cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself"), 481, n. 52(stating that the Court dealt with "constitutional standards in relationto statements made"), 490 ("[T]he issues presented are of constitutionaldimensions and must be determined by the courts"), 489 (stating that theMiranda Court was dealing "with rights grounded in a specific requirement of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution").530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN440 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtunwarned confessions obtained in the four cases before theCourt in Miranda "were obtained from the defendant undercircumstances that did not meet constitutional standards forprotection of the privilege."5 Id., at 491.Additional support for our conclusion that Miranda isconstitutionally based is found in the Miranda Court's invitation for legislative action to protect the constitutionalright against coerced self-incrimination. After discussingthe "compelling pressures" inherent in custodial police in-terrogation, theMiranda Court concluded that, "[i]n orderto combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity toexercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accusedmust be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights andthe exercise of those rights must be fully honored." Id., at467. However, the Court emphasized that it could not foresee "the potential alternatives for protecting the privilegewhich might be devised by Congress or the States," and itaccordingly opined that the Constitution would not precludelegislative solutions that differed from the prescribedMi-randa warnings but which were "at least as effective inapprising accused persons of their right of silence and in as-suring a continuous opportunity to exercise it."6 Ibid.5 Many of our subsequent cases have also referred to Miranda's constitutional underpinnings. See, e. g., Withrow, supra, at 691 (" `Prophylactic' though it may be, in protecting a defendant's Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination, Miranda safeguards a `fundamentaltrial right' "); Illinois v. Perkins, 496 U. S. 292, 296 (1990) (describing Miranda's warning requirement as resting on "the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination"); Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 411(1990) ("[T]he Fifth Amendment bars police-initiated interrogation following a suspect's request for counsel in the context of a separate investigation"); Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625, 629 (1986) ("The Fifth Amendment protection against compelled self-incrimination provides the rightto counsel at custodial interrogations"); Moran v. Burbine, 475 U. S. 412,427 (1986) (referring to Miranda as "our interpretation of the FederalConstitution"); Edwards, supra, at 481-482.6 The Court of Appeals relied in part on our statement that the Mirandadecision in no way "creates a `constitutional straightjacket.' " See 166 F.3d 667, 672 (CA4 1999) (quoting Miranda, 384 U. S., at 467). However, a530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN441Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals also relied on the fact that we have,after ourMiranda decision, made exceptions from its rulein cases such as New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984),andHarris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971). See 166 F.3d, at 672, 689-691. But we have also broadened the appli-cation of theMiranda doctrine in cases such as Doyle v.Ohio, 426 U. S. 610 (1976), and Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S.675 (1988). These decisions illustrate the principle--notthatMiranda is not a constitutional rule--but that no constitutional rule is immutable. No court laying down a generalrule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in whichcounsel will seek to apply it, and the sort of modificationsrepresented by these cases are as much a normal part ofconstitutional law as the original decision.The Court of Appeals also noted that inOregon v. Elstad,470 U. S. 298 (1985), we stated that " `[t]he Miranda ex-clusionary rule . . . serves the Fifth Amendment and sweepsmore broadly than the Fifth Amendment itself.' " 166 F. 3d,at 690 (quotingElstad, supra, at 306). Our decision in thatcase--refusing to apply the traditional "fruits" doctrine developed in Fourth Amendment cases--does not prove thatMiranda is a nonconstitutional decision, but simply recognizes the fact that unreasonable searches under the FourthAmendment are different from unwarned interrogationunder the Fifth Amendment.As an alternative argument for sustaining the Court ofAppeals' decision, the court-invited amicus curiae 7 contendsthat the section complies with the requirement that a legislative alternative to Miranda be equally as effective in preventing coerced confessions. See Brief for Paul G. Cassellreview of our opinion in Miranda clarifies that this disclaimer was intended to indicate that the Constitution does not require police to administer the particular Miranda warnings, not that the Constitution does notrequire a procedure that is effective in securing Fifth Amendment rights.7 Because no party to the underlying litigation argued in favor of $ 3501'sconstitutionality in this Court, we invited Professor Paul Cassell to assistour deliberations by arguing in support of the judgment below.530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN442 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtas Amicus Curiae 28-39. We agree with the amicus' contention that there are more remedies available for abusivepolice conduct than there were at the time Miranda was decided, see, e. g., Wilkins v. May, 872 F. 2d 190, 194 (CA7 1989)(applying Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,403 U. S. 388 (1971), to hold that a suspect may bring a federal cause of action under the Due Process Clause for policemisconduct during custodial interrogation). But we do notagree that these additional measures supplement $ 3501'sprotections sufficiently to meet the constitutional minimum.Miranda requires procedures that will warn a suspect incustody of his right to remain silent and which will assurethe suspect that the exercise of that right will be honored.See, e. g., 384 U. S., at 467. As discussed above, $ 3501 explicitly eschews a requirement of preinterrogation warningsin favor of an approach that looks to the administration ofsuch warnings as only one factor in determining the voluntariness of a suspect's confession. The additional remediescited by amicus do not, in our view, render them, togetherwith $ 3501, an adequate substitute for the warnings required by Miranda.The dissent argues that it is judicial overreaching for thisCourt to hold $ 3501 unconstitutional unless we hold that theMiranda warnings are required by the Constitution, in thesense that nothing else will suffice to satisfy constitutionalrequirements. Post, at 453-454, 465 (opinion of Scalia, J.).But we need not go further than Miranda to decide this case.In Miranda, the Court noted that reliance on the traditionaltotality-of-the-circumstances test raised a risk of overlookingan involuntary custodial confession, 384 U. S, at 457, a riskthat the Court found unacceptably great when the confessionis offered in the case in chief to prove guilt. The Courttherefore concluded that something more than the totalitytest was necessary. See ibid.; see also id., at 467, 490-491.As discussed above, $ 3501 reinstates the totality test as530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN443Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Opinion of the Courtsufficient. Section 3501 therefore cannot be sustained ifMiranda is to remain the law.Whether or not we would agree with Miranda's reasoningand its resulting rule, were we addressing the issue in thefirst instance, the principles of stare decisis weigh heavilyagainst overruling it now. See,e. g., Rhode Island v. Innis,446 U. S. 291, 304 (1980) (Burger, C. J., concurring in judgment) ("The meaning of Miranda has become reasonablyclear and law enforcement practices have adjusted to itsstrictures; I would neither overrule Miranda, disparage it,nor extend it at this late date"). While " `stare decisis isnot an inexorable command,' " State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522U. S. 3, 20 (1997) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808,828 (1991)), particularly when we are interpreting the Constitution, Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997), "evenin constitutional cases, the doctrine carries such persuasive force that we have always required a departure fromprecedent to be supported by some `special justification.' "United States v. International Business Machines Corp.,517 U. S. 843, 856 (1996) (quoting Payne, supra, at 842 (Sou-ter, J., concurring), in turn quoting Arizona v. Rumsey, 467U. S. 203, 212 (1984)).We do not think there is such justification for overrulingMiranda. Miranda has become embedded in routine policepractice to the point where the warnings have become partof our national culture. See Mitchell v. United States, 526U. S. 314, 331-332 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (stating thatthe fact that a rule has found " `wide acceptance in the legalculture' " is "adequate reason not to overrule" it). While wehave overruled our precedents when subsequent cases haveundermined their doctrinal underpinnings, see, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989), wedo not believe that this has happened to the Miranda decision. If anything, our subsequent cases have reduced theimpact of the Miranda rule on legitimate law enforcementwhile reaffirming the decision's core ruling that unwarned530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN444 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingstatements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution'scase in chief.The disadvantage of the Miranda rule is that statementswhich may be by no means involuntary, made by a defendantwho is aware of his "rights," may nonetheless be excludedand a guilty defendant go free as a result. But experiencesuggests that the totality-of-the-circumstances test which$ 3501 seeks to revive is more difficult thanMiranda for lawenforcement officers to conform to, and for courts to apply ina consistent manner. See, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373U. S., at 515 ("The line between proper and permissiblepolice conduct and techniques and methods offensive to dueprocess is, at best, a difficult one to draw"). The requirement that Miranda warnings be given does not, of course,dispense with the voluntariness inquiry. But as we saidin Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U. S. 420 (1984), "[c]ases inwhich a defendant can make a colorable argument that aself-incriminating statement was `compelled' despite the factthat the law enforcement authorities adhered to the dictatesof Miranda are rare." Id., at 433, n. 20.In sum, we conclude thatMiranda announced a consti-tutional rule that Congress may not supersede legislatively.Following the rule of stare decisis, we decline to overruleMiranda ourselves.8 The judgment of the Court of Appealsis therefore Reversed.Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,dissenting.Those to whom judicial decisions are an unconnectedseries of judgments that produce either favored or disfa8 Various other contentions and suggestions have been pressed by thenumerous amici, but because of the procedural posture of this case we donot think it appropriate to consider them.

Those who understand thejudicial process will appreciate that today's decision is not areaffirmation of Miranda, but a radical revision of the mostsignificant element ofMiranda (as of all cases): the rationalethat gives it a permanent place in our jurisprudence.Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), held that an Actof Congress will not be enforced by the courts if what itprescribes violates the Constitution of the United States.That was the basis on whichMiranda was decided. Onewill search today's opinion in vain, however, for a statement(surely simple enough to make) that what 18 U. S. C. $ 3501prescribes--the use at trial of a voluntary confession, evenwhen a Miranda warning or its equivalent has failed to begiven--violates the Constitution. The reason the statementdoes not appear is not only (and perhaps not so much) thatit would be absurd, inasmuch as $ 3501 excludes from trialprecisely what the Constitution excludes from trial, viz.,compelled confessions; but also that Justices whose votes areneeded to compose today's majority are on record as believing that a violation of Miranda is not a violation of theConstitution. See Davis v. United States, 512 U. S. 452,457-458 (1994) (opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, J.,joined); Duckworth v. Eagan, 492 U. S. 195, 203 (1989) (opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, J., joined); Oregon v.Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985) (opinion of the Court by O'Con-nor, J.); New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S. 649 (1984) (opinionof the Court by Rehnquist, J.). And so, to justify today'sagreed-upon result, the Court must adopt a significant new,if not entirely comprehensible, principle of constitutional law.As the Court chooses to describe that principle, statutes ofCongress can be disregarded, not only when what they prescribe violates the Constitution, but when what they prescribe contradicts a decision of this Court that "announced aconstitutional rule," ante, at 437. As I shall discuss in some530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN446 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingdetail, the only thing that can possibly mean in the contextof this case is that this Court has the power, not merely toapply the Constitution but to expand it, imposing what itregards as useful "prophylactic" restrictions upon Congressand the States. That is an immense and frightening anti-democratic power, and it does not exist.It takes only a small step to bring today's opinion out ofthe realm of power-judging and into the mainstream of legalreasoning: The Court need only go beyond its carefullycouched iterations that "Miranda is a constitutional deci-sion," ante, at 438, that "Miranda is constitutionally based,"ante, at 440, that Miranda has "constitutional underpin-nings," ante, at 440, n. 5, and come out and say quite clearly:"We reaffirm today that custodial interrogation that is notpreceded by Miranda warnings or their equivalent violatesthe Constitution of the United States." It cannot say that,because a majority of the Court does not believe it. TheCourt therefore acts in plain violation of the Constitutionwhen it denies effect to this Act of Congress.IEarly in this Nation's history, this Court established thesound proposition that constitutional government in a system of separated powers requires judges to regard as in-operative any legislative Act, even of Congress itself, that is"repugnant to the Constitution.""So if a law be in opposition to the constitution; if boththe law and the constitution apply to a particular case,so that the court must either decide that case conforma-bly to the law, disregarding the constitution; or conformably to the constitution, disregarding the law; the courtmust determine which of these conflicting rules governsthe case." Marbury, supra, at 178.The power we recognized in Marbury will thus permit us,indeed require us, to "disregar[d]" $ 3501, a duly enacted530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN447Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingstatute governing the admissibility of evidence in the federalcourts, only if it "be in opposition to the constitution"--here,assertedly, the dictates of the Fifth Amendment.It was once possible to characterize the so-called Mirandarule as resting (however implausibly) upon the propositionthat what the statute here before us permits--the admissionat trial of un-Mirandized confessions--violates the Constitution. That is the fairest reading of the Miranda case itself.The Court began by announcing that the Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination applied in the context ofextrajudicial custodial interrogation, see 384 U. S., at 460-467--itself a doubtful proposition as a matter both of historyand precedent, see id., at 510-511 (Harlan, J., dissenting)(characterizing the Court's conclusion that the Fifth Amendment privilege, rather than the Due Process Clause, governed station house confessions as a "trompe l'oeil"). Having extended the privilege into the confines of the stationhouse, the Court liberally sprinkled throughout its sprawling60-page opinion suggestions that, because of the compulsioninherent in custodial interrogation, the privilege was violated by any statement thus obtained that did not conformto the rules set forth in Miranda, or some functional equivalent. See id., at 458 ("Unless adequate protective devicesare employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodialsurroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant cantruly be the product of his free choice" (emphases added));id., at 461 ("An individual swept from familiar surroundingsinto police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, andsubjected to the techniques of persuasion described abovecannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak"); id.,at 467 ("We have concluded that without proper safeguardsthe process of in-custody interrogation . . . contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where hewould not otherwise do so freely"); id., at 457, n. 26 (noting530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN448 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingthe "absurdity of denying that a confession obtained underthese circumstances is compelled").The dissenters, for their part, also understood Miranda'sholding to be based on the "premise . . . that pressure onthe suspect must be eliminated though it be only the subtleinfluence of the atmosphere and surroundings."Id., at 512(Harlan, J., dissenting). See also id., at 535 (White, J., dissenting) ("[I]t has never been suggested, until today, thatsuch questioning was so coercive and accused persons solacking in hardihood that the very first response to the veryfirst question following the commencement of custody mustbe conclusively presumed to be the product of an overbornewill"). And at least one case decided shortly after Mirandaexplicitly confirmed the view. See Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S.324, 326 (1969) ("[T]he use of these admissions obtained inthe absence of the required warnings was a flat violationof the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment asconstrued in Miranda").So understood, Miranda was objectionable for innumerable reasons, not least the fact that cases spanning more than70 years had rejected its core premise that, absent the warnings and an effective waiver of the right to remain silent andof the (thitherto unknown) right to have an attorney present,a statement obtained pursuant to custodial interrogation wasnecessarily the product of compulsion. See Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958) (confession not involuntary despite denial of access to counsel); Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S.504 (1958) (same); Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303(1912) (lack of warnings and counsel did not render statement before United States Commissioner involuntary); Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 (1896) (same). Moreover,history and precedent aside, the decision in Miranda, if readas an explication of what the Constitution requires, is preposterous. There is, for example, simply no basis in reasonfor concluding that a response to the very first questionasked, by a suspect who already knows all of the rights de530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingscribed in the Miranda warning, is anything other than avolitional act. SeeMiranda, supra, at 533-534 (White, J.,dissenting). And even if one assumes that the eliminationof compulsion absolutely requires informing even the mostknowledgeable suspect of his right to remain silent, it can-not conceivably require the right to havecounsel present.There is a world of difference, which the Court recognizedunder the traditional voluntariness test but ignored in Miranda, between compelling a suspect to incriminate himselfand preventing him from foolishly doing so of his own accord.Only the latter (which isnot required by the Constitution)could explain the Court's inclusion of a right to counsel andthe requirement that it, too, be knowingly and intelligentlywaived. Counsel's presence is not required to tell the suspect that he need not speak; the interrogators can do that.The only good reason for having counsel there is that he canbe counted on to advise the suspect that he should notspeak. See Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 59 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring in result in part and dissenting in part)("[A]ny lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under anycircumstances").Preventing foolish (rather than compelled) confessions islikewise the only conceivable basis for the rules (suggestedin Miranda, see 384 U. S., at 444-445, 473-474), that courtsmust exclude any confession elicited by questioning conducted, without interruption, after the suspect has indicated a desire to stand on his right to remain silent, seeMichigan v. Mosley, 423 U. S. 96, 105-106 (1975), or initiatedby police after the suspect has expressed a desire to havecounsel present, see Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477, 484-485 (1981). Nonthreatening attempts to persuade the suspect to reconsider that initial decision are not, withoutmore, enough to render a change of heart the product ofanything other than the suspect's free will. Thus, what ismost remarkable about the Miranda decision--and what530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN450 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingmade it unacceptable as a matter of straightforward con-stitutional interpretation in the Marbury tradition--is itspalpable hostility toward the act of confession per se, ratherthan toward what the Constitution abhors, compelled confession. See United States v. Washington, 431 U. S. 181, 187(1977) ("[F]ar from being prohibited by the Constitution,admissions of guilt by wrongdoers, if not coerced, are in-herently desirable"). The Constitution is not, unlike theMiranda majority, offended by a criminal's commendablequalm of conscience or fortunate fit of stupidity. Cf.Min-nick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 166-167 (1990) (Scalia,J., dissenting).For these reasons, and others more than adequately devel-oped in theMiranda dissents and in the subsequent worksof the decision's many critics, any conclusion that a violationof the Miranda rules necessarily amounts to a violation ofthe privilege against compelled self-incrimination can claimno support in history, precedent, or common sense, and as aresult would at least presumptively be worth reconsideringeven at this late date. But that is unnecessary, since theCourt has (thankfully) long since abandoned the notion thatfailure to comply with Miranda's rules is itself a violation ofthe Constitution.IIAs the Court today acknowledges, since Miranda we haveexplicitly, and repeatedly, interpreted that decision as havingannounced, not the circumstances in which custodial interro-gation runs afoul of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment,but rather only "prophylactic" rules that go beyond the rightagainst compelled self-incrimination. Of course the seeds ofthis "prophylactic" interpretation of Miranda were presentin the decision itself. See Miranda, 384 U. S., at 439 (discussing the "necessity for procedures which assure that the[suspect] is accorded his privilege"); id., at 447 ("[u]nless aproper limitation upon custodial interrogation is achieved--such as these decisions will advance--there can be no assur530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN451Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingance that practices of this nature will be eradicated"); id.,at 457 ("[i]n these cases, we might not find the defendants'statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms");ibid. (noting "concern for adequate safeguards to protectprecious Fifth Amendment rights" and the "potentiality forcompulsion" in Ernesto Miranda's interrogation). In subsequent cases, the seeds have sprouted and borne fruit: TheCourt has squarely concluded that it is possible--indeed notuncommon--for the police to violateMiranda without alsoviolating the Constitution.Michigan v. Tucker, 417 U. S. 433 (1974), an opinion forthe Court written by then-Justice Rehnquist, rejected thetrue-to-Marbury, failure-to-warn-as-constitutional-violationinterpretation of Miranda. It held that exclusion of the"fruits" of a Miranda violation--the statement of a witnesswhose identity the defendant had revealed while in custody--was not required. The opinion explained that thequestion whether the "police conduct complained of directlyinfringed upon respondent's right against compulsory selfincrimination" was a "separate question" from "whether itinstead violated only the prophylactic rules developed toprotect that right." 417 U. S., at 439. The "proceduralsafeguards" adopted in Miranda, the Court said, "were notthemselves rights protected by the Constitution but wereinstead measures to insure that the right against compulsoryself-incrimination was protected," and to "provide practicalreinforcement for the right," 417 U. S., at 444. Comparingthe particular facts of the custodial interrogation with the"historical circumstances underlying the privilege," ibid.,the Court concluded, unequivocally, that the defendant'sstatement could not be termed "involuntary as that term hasbeen defined in the decisions of this Court," id., at 445, andthus that there had been no constitutional violation, notwithstanding the clear violation of the "procedural rules laterestablished in Miranda," ibid. Lest there be any confusionon the point, the Court reiterated that the "police conduct at530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN452 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingissue here did not abridge respondent's constitutional privi-lege against compulsory self-incrimination, but departedonly from the prophylactic standards later laid down by thisCourt inMiranda to safeguard that privilege." Id., at 446.It is clear from our cases, of course, that if the statement inTucker had been obtained in violation of the Fifth Amendment, the statement and its fruits would have been excluded.See Nix v. Williams, 467 U. S. 431, 442 (1984).The next year, inOregon v. Hass, 420 U. S. 714 (1975), theCourt held that a defendant's statement taken in violationofMiranda that was nonetheless voluntary could be used attrial for impeachment purposes. This holding turned uponthe recognition that violation of Miranda is not unconstitutional compulsion, since statements obtained in actual violation of the privilege against compelled self-incrimination,"as opposed to . . . taken in violation of Miranda," quitesimply "may not be put to any testimonial use whateveragainst [the defendant] in a criminal trial," including as impeachment evidence. New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450,459 (1979). See also Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 397-398 (1978) (holding that while statements obtained in violation of Miranda may be used for impeachment if otherwisetrustworthy, the Constitution prohibits "any criminal trialuse against a defendant of his involuntary statement").Nearly a decade later, in New York v. Quarles, 467 U. S.649 (1984), the Court relied upon the fact that "[t]he prophylactic Miranda warnings . . . are `not themselves rightsprotected by the Constitution,' " id., at 654 (quoting Tucker,supra, at 444), to create a "public safety" exception. In thatcase, police apprehended, after a chase in a grocery store, arape suspect known to be carrying a gun. After handcuffingand searching him (and finding no gun)--but before reading him his Miranda warnings--the police demanded toknow where the gun was. The defendant nodded in thedirection of some empty cartons and responded that "thegun is over there." The Court held that both the unwarned530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN453Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingstatement--"the gun is over there"--and the recoveredweapon were admissible in the prosecution's case in chiefunder a "public safety exception" to the "prophylactic rulesenunciated inMiranda." 467 U. S., at 653. It explicitlyacknowledged that if the Miranda warnings were an im-perative of the Fifth Amendment itself, such an exigencyexception would be impossible, since the Fifth Amendment'sbar on compelled self-incrimination is absolute, and its" `strictures, unlike the Fourth's are not removed by showingreasonableness,' " 467 U. S., at 653, n. 3. (For the latter rea-son, the Court found it necessary to note that respondent didnot "claim that [his] statements were actually compelled bypolice conduct which overcame his will to resist," id., at 654.)The next year, the Court again declined to apply the "fruitof the poisonous tree" doctrine to a Miranda violation, thistime allowing the admission of a suspect's properly warnedstatement even though it had been preceded (and, arguably,induced) by an earlier inculpatory statement taken in violation of Miranda. Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U. S. 298 (1985).As in Tucker, the Court distinguished the case from thoseholding that a confession obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search is inadmissible, on the ground that theviolation of Miranda does not involve an "actual infringement of the suspect's constitutional rights," 470 U. S., at 308.Miranda, the Court explained, "sweeps more broadly thanthe Fifth Amendment itself," and "Miranda's preventivemedicine provides a remedy even to the defendant who hassuffered no identifiable constitutional harm." 470 U. S., at306-307. "[E]rrors [that] are made by law enforcementofficers in administering the prophylactic Miranda procedures . . . should not breed the same irremediable consequences as police infringement of the Fifth Amendmentitself." Id., at 308-309.In light of these cases, and our statements to the sameeffect in others, see, e. g., Davis v. United States, 512 U. S., at457-458; Withrow v. Williams, 507 U. S. 680, 690-691 (1993);530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN454 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingEagan, 492 U. S., at 203, it is simply no longer possible forthe Court to conclude, even if it wanted to, that a violationof Miranda's rules is a violation of the Constitution. But asI explained at the outset, that is what is required before theCourt may disregard a law of Congress governing the admis-sibility of evidence in federal court. The Court today insiststhat the decision in Miranda is a "constitutional" one, ante,at 432, 438; that it has "constitutional underpinnings,"ante,at 440, n. 5; a "constitutional basis" and a "constitutional origin," ante, at 439, n. 3; that it was "constitutionally based,"ante, at 440; and that it announced a "constitutional rule,"ante, at 437, 439, 441, 444. It is fine to play these wordgames; but what makes a decision "constitutional" in the onlysense relevant here--in the sense that renders it imperviousto supersession by congressional legislation such as $ 3501--is the determination that the Constitution requires the resultthat the decision announces and the statute ignores. By disregarding congressional action that concededly does not vio-late the Constitution, the Court flagrantly offends fundamental principles of separation of powers, and arrogates to itselfprerogatives reserved to the representatives of the people.The Court seeks to avoid this conclusion in two ways:First, by misdescribing these postMiranda cases as meredicta. The Court concedes only "that there is language insome of our opinions that supports the view" that Miranda'sprotections are not "constitutionally required." Ante, at438. It is not a matter of language; it is a matter of hold-ings. The proposition that failure to comply with Miranda'srules does not establish a constitutional violation was centralto the holdings of Tucker, Hass, Quarles, and Elstad.The second way the Court seeks to avoid the impact ofthese cases is simply to disclaim responsibility for reasoneddecisionmaking. It says:"These decisions illustrate the principle--not that Miranda is not a constitutional rule--but that no constitu-tional rule is immutable. No court laying down a gen530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN455Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingeral rule can possibly foresee the various circumstancesin which counsel will seek to apply it, and the sort ofmodifications represented by these cases are as much anormal part of constitutional law as the original decision." Ante, at 441.The issue, however, is not whether court rules are "mutable";they assuredly are. It is not whether, in the light of "various circumstances," they can be "modifi[ed]"; they assuredlycan. The issue is whether,as mutated and modified, theymust make sense. The requirement that they do so is theonly thing that prevents this Court from being some sortof nine-headed Caesar, giving thumbs-up or thumbs-down towhatever outcome, case by case, suits or offends its collectivefancy. And if confessions procured in violation ofMirandaare confessions "compelled" in violation of the Constitution,the post-Miranda decisions I have discussed do not makesense. The only reasoned basis for their outcome was thata violation of Miranda is not a violation of the Constitution.If, for example, as the Court acknowledges was the holdingof Elstad, "the traditional `fruits' doctrine developed inFourth Amendment cases" (that the fruits of evidence obtained unconstitutionally must be excluded from trial) doesnot apply to the fruits of Miranda violations, ante, at 441;and if the reason for the difference is not that Miranda viola-tions are not constitutional violations (which is plainly andflatly what Elstad said); then the Court must come up withsomeother explanation for the difference. (That will takequite a bit of doing, by the way, since it is not clear onthe face of the Fourth Amendment that evidence obtained inviolation of that guarantee must be excluded from trial,whereas it is clear on the face of the Fifth Amendment thatunconstitutionally compelled confessions cannot be used.)To say simply that "unreasonable searches under the FourthAmendment are different from unwarned interrogationunder the Fifth Amendment," ante, at 441, is true but su-premely unhelpful.530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN456 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingFinally, the Court asserts that Miranda must be a "consti-tutional decision" announcing a "constitutional rule," andthus immune to congressional modification, because we havesince its inception applied it to the States. If this argumentis meant as an invocation of stare decisis, it fails because,though it is true that our cases applyingMiranda againstthe States must be reconsidered if Miranda is not requiredby the Constitution, it is likewise true that our cases (dis-cussed above) based on the principle thatMiranda is notrequired by the Constitution will have to be reconsidered ifitis. So the stare decisis argument is a wash. If, on theother hand, the argument is meant as an appeal to logicrather than stare decisis, it is a classic example of beggingthe question: Congress's attempt to set aside Miranda, sinceit represents an assertion that violation of Miranda is not aviolation of the Constitution, also represents an assertionthat the Court has no power to impose Miranda on theStates. To answer this assertion--not by showing why violation of Miranda is a violation of the Constitution--but byasserting that Miranda does apply against the States, is toassume precisely the point at issue. In my view, our continued application of the Miranda code to the States despiteour consistent statements that running afoul of its dictatesdoes not necessarily--or even usually--result in an actualconstitutional violation, represents not the source of Miranda's salvation but rather evidence of its ultimate illegitimacy. See generally J. Grano, Confessions, Truth, and theLaw 173-198 (1993); Grano, Prophylactic Rules in CriminalProcedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U.L. Rev. 100 (1985). As Justice Stevens has elsewhere explained: "This Court's power to require state courts to exclude probative self-incriminatory statements rests entirelyon the premise that the use of such evidence violates theFederal Constitution. . . . If the Court does not accept thatpremise, it must regard the holding in the Miranda case itself, as well as all of the federal jurisprudence that has530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN457Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingevolved from that decision, as nothing more than an illegiti-mate exercise of raw judicial power." Elstad, 470 U. S., at370 (dissenting opinion). Quite so.IIIThere was available to the Court a means of reconcilingthe established proposition that a violation ofMiranda doesnot itself offend the Fifth Amendment with the Court's assertion of a right to ignore the present statute. That meansof reconciliation was argued strenuously by both petitionerand the United States, who were evidently more concernedthan the Court is with maintaining the coherence of ourjurisprudence. It is not mentioned in the Court's opinionbecause, I assume, a majority of the Justices intent on reversing believes that incoherence is the lesser evil. Theymay be right.Petitioner and the United States contend that there isnothing at all exceptional, much less unconstitutional, aboutthe Court's adopting prophylactic rules to buttress con-stitutional rights, and enforcing them against Congress andthe States. Indeed, the United States argues that "[p]ro-phylactic rules are now and have been for many years a feature of this Court's constitutional adjudication." Brief forUnited States 47. That statement is not wholly inaccurate,if by "many years" one means since the mid-1960's. How-ever, in their zeal to validate what is in my view a lawlesspractice, the United States and petitioner greatly overstatethe frequency with which we have engaged in it. For instance, petitioner cites several cases in which the Court quitesimply exercised its traditional judicial power to define thescope of constitutional protections and, relatedly, the cir-cumstances in which they are violated. See Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U. S. 419, 436-437(1982) (holding that a permanent physical occupation constitutes a per se taking); Maine v. Moulton, 474 U. S. 159, 176(1985) (holding that the Sixth Amendment right to the assist530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN458 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingance of counsel is actually "violated when the State obtainsincriminating statements by knowingly circumventing theaccused's right to have counsel present in a confrontationbetween the accused and a state agent").Similarly unsupportive of the supposed practice is Brutonv. United States, 391 U. S. 123 (1968), where we concludedthat the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment forbids the admission of a nontestifying codefendant's faciallyincriminating confession in a joint trial, even where the juryhas been given a limiting instruction. That decision wasbased, not upon the theory that this was desirable protection "beyond" what the Confrontation Clause technically required; but rather upon the self-evident proposition that theinability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging out-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined with the conclusion that in thesecircumstances a mere jury instruction can never be reliedupon to prevent the testimony from being damaging, seeRichardson v. Marsh, 481 U. S. 200, 207-208 (1987).The United States also relies on our cases involving thequestion whether a State's procedure for appointed counsel'swithdrawal of representation on appeal satisfies the State'sconstitutional obligation to " `affor[d] adequate and effectiveappellate review to indigent defendants.' " Smith v. Robbins, 528 U. S. 259, 276 (2000) (quoting Griffin v. Illinois, 351U. S. 12, 20 (1956)). In Anders v. California, 386 U. S. 738(1967), we concluded that California's procedure governingwithdrawal fell short of the constitutional minimum, and weoutlined a procedure that would meet that standard. Butas we made clear earlier this Term in Smith, which uphelda procedure different from the one Anders suggested, thebenchmark of constitutionality is the constitutional requirement of adequate representation, and not some excrescenceupon that requirement decreed, for safety's sake, by thisCourt.530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN459Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingIn a footnote, the United States directs our attention tocertain overprotective First Amendment rules that we haveadopted to ensure "breathing space" for expression. SeeGertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340, 342 (1974)(recognizing that in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376U. S. 254 (1964), we "extended a measure of strategic protection to defamatory falsehood" of public officials); Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U. S. 51, 58 (1965) (setting forth "pro-cedural safeguards designed to obviate the dangers of acensorship system" with respect to motion picture obscen-ity). In these cases, and others involving the First Amendment, the Court has acknowledged that in order to guaranteethat protected speech is not "chilled" and thus forgone, it isin some instances necessary to incorporate in our substantiverules a "measure of strategic protection." But that is because the Court has viewed the importation of "chill" asitself a violation of the First Amendment--not because theCourt thought it could go beyond what the First Amendmentdemanded in order to provide some prophylaxis.Petitioner and the United States are right on target, however, in characterizing the Court's actions in a case decidedwithin a few years of Miranda, North Carolina v. Pearce,395 U. S. 711 (1969). There, the Court concluded that dueprocess would be offended were a judge vindictively to resentence with added severity a defendant who had successfully appealed his original conviction. Rather than simplyannounce that vindictive sentencing violates the Due ProcessClause, the Court went on to hold that "[i]n order to assure the absence of such a [vindictive] motivation, . . . thereasons for [imposing the increased sentence] must affirmatively appear" and must "be based upon objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencingproceeding." Id., at 726. The Court later explicitly acknowledged Pearce's prophylactic character, see Michigan v.Payne, 412 U. S. 47, 53 (1973). It is true, therefore, that the530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN460 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingcase exhibits the same fundamental flaw as does Mirandawhen deprived (as it has been) of its original (implausible)pretension to announcement of what the Constitution itselfrequired. That is, although the Due Process Clause maywell prohibit punishment based on judicial vindictiveness,the Constitution by no means vests in the courts "any general power to prescribe particular devices `in order to assurethe absence of such a motivation,' " 395 U. S., at 741 (Black,J., dissenting). Justice Black surely had the right idea whenhe derided the Court's requirement as "pure legislation ifthere ever was legislation,"ibid., although in truth Pearce'srule pales as a legislative achievement when compared to thedetailed code promulgated inMiranda.1The foregoing demonstrates that, petitioner's and theUnited States' suggestions to the contrary notwithstanding,what the Court did in Miranda (assuming, as later caseshold, thatMiranda went beyond what the Constitution actually requires) is in fact extraordinary. That the Courthas, on rare and recent occasion, repeated the mistake doesnot transform error into truth, but illustrates the potentialfor future mischief that the error entails. Where the Constitution has wished to lodge in one of the branches of theFederal Government some limited power to supplement itsguarantees, it has said so. See Amdt. 14, $ 5 ("The Congressshall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, theprovisions of this article"). The power with which theCourt would endow itself under a "prophylactic" justificationfor Miranda goes far beyond what it has permitted Congressto do under authority of that text. Whereas we have in1 As for Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986), upon which petitionerand the United States also rely, in that case we extended to the SixthAmendment, postindictment, context the Miranda-based prophylactic ruleof Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U. S. 477 (1981), that the police cannot initiateinterrogation after counsel has been requested. I think it less a separateinstance of claimed judicial power to impose constitutional prophylaxisthan a direct, logic-driven consequence of Miranda itself.530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN461Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingsisted that congressional action under $ 5 of the FourteenthAmendment must be "congruent" with, and "proportional"to, a constitutional violation, see City of Boerne v. Flores,521 U. S. 507, 520 (1997), the Miranda nontextual power toembellish confers authority to prescribe preventive meas-ures against not only constitutionally prohibited compelledconfessions, but also (as discussed earlier) foolhardy ones.I applaud, therefore, the refusal of the Justices in the majority to enunciate this boundless doctrine of judicial em-powerment as a means of rendering today's decision rational.In nonetheless joining the Court's judgment, however, theyoverlook two truisms: that actions speak louder than silence,and that (in judge-made law at least) logic will out. Sincethere is in fact no other principle that can reconcile today'sjudgment with the post-Miranda cases that the Court re-fuses to abandon, what today's decision will stand for,whether the Justices can bring themselves to say it or not,is the power of the Supreme Court to write a prophylactic,extraconstitutional Constitution, binding on Congress andthe States.IVThus, while I agree with the Court that $ 3501 cannot beupheld without also concluding that Miranda represents anillegitimate exercise of our authority to review state-courtjudgments, I do not share the Court's hesitation in reaching that conclusion. For while the Court is also correct thatthe doctrine ofstare decisis demands some "special justifi-cation" for a departure from longstanding precedent--evenprecedent of the constitutional variety--that criterion ismore than met here. To repeatJustice Stevens' cogentobservation, it is "[o]bviou[s]" that "the Court's power to reverse Miranda's conviction rested entirely on the deter-mination that a violation of the Federal Constitution hadoccurred." Elstad, 470 U. S., at 367, n. 9 (dissenting opinion)(emphasis added). Despite the Court's Orwellian assertionto the contrary, it is undeniable that later cases (discussed530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN462 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingabove) have "undermined [Miranda's] doctrinal underpin-nings," ante, at 443, denying constitutional violation and thusstripping the holding of its only constitutionally legitimatesupport. Miranda's critics and supporters alike have longmade this point. See Office of Legal Policy, U. S. Dept. ofJustice, Report to Attorney General on Law of Pre-TrialInterrogation 97 (Feb. 12, 1986) ("The current Court has re-pudiated the premises on whichMiranda was based, buthas drawn back from recognizing the full implications of itsdecisions"); id., at 78 ("Michigan v. Tucker accordingly repu-diated the doctrinal basis of the Miranda decision"); Sonenshein, Miranda and the Burger Court: Trends and Counter-trends, 13 Loyola U. Chi. L. J. 405, 407-408 (1982) ("Althoughthe Burger Court has not overruled Miranda, the Court hasconsistently undermined the rationales, assumptions, andvalues which gave Miranda life"); id., at 425-426 ("Seem-ingly, the Court [in Michigan v. Tucker] utterly destroyedboth Miranda's rationale and its holding"); Stone, The Mi-randa Doctrine in the Burger Court, 1977 S. Ct. Rev. 99, 118("Mr. Justice Rehnquist's conclusion that there is a violationof the Self-Incrimination Clause only if a confession is involuntary . . . is an outright rejection of the core premisesofMiranda").The Court cites Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491U. S. 164, 173 (1989), as accurately reflecting our standardfor overruling, see ante, at 443--which I am pleased to accept, even though Patterson was speaking of overruling stat-utory cases and the standard for constitutional decisions issomewhat more lenient. What is set forth there reads asthough it was written precisely with the current status ofMiranda in mind:"In cases where statutory precedents have been over-ruled, the primary reason for the Court's shift in position has been the intervening development of the law,through either the growth of judicial doctrine or furtheraction taken by Congress. Where such changes have530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN463Cite as: 530 U.

S., at 173.Neither am I persuaded by the argument for retainingMiranda that touts its supposed workability as comparedwith the totality-of-the-circumstances test it purported toreplace. Miranda's proponents cite ad nauseam the factthat the Court was called upon to make difficult and subtledistinctions in applying the "voluntariness" test in some30-odd due process "coerced confessions" cases in the 30years between Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 (1936),andMiranda. It is not immediately apparent, however,that the judicial burden has been eased by the "bright-line"rules adopted in Miranda. In fact, in the 34 years sinceMiranda was decided, this Court has been called upon todecide nearly 60 cases involving a host of Miranda issues,most of them predicted with remarkable prescience by Justice White in his Miranda dissent. 384 U. S., at 545.Moreover, it is not clear why the Court thinks that the"totality-of-the-circumstances test . . . is more difficult thanMiranda for law enforcement officers to conform to, and forcourts to apply in a consistent manner." Ante, at 444. In-deed, I find myself persuaded byJustice O'Connor's rejection of this same argument in her opinion in Williams,507 U. S., at 711-712 (O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist,C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in part):"Miranda, for all its alleged brightness, is not withoutits difficulties; and voluntariness is not without itsstrengths. . . .". . . Miranda creates as many close questions as itresolves. The task of determining whether a defendantis in `custody' has proved to be `a slippery one.' Andthe supposedly `bright' lines that separate interrogation530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN464 DICKERSON v. UNITED STATESScalia, J., dissentingfrom spontaneous declaration, the exercise of a rightfrom waiver, and the adequate warning from the inadequate, likewise have turned out to be rather dim andill defined. . . ."The totality-of-the-circumstances approach, on theother hand, permits each fact to be taken into accountwithout resort to formal and dispositive labels. By dis-pensing with the difficulty of producing a yes-or-no answer to questions that are often better answered inshades and degrees,the voluntariness inquiry often canmake judicial decisionmaking easier rather than moreonerous." (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)But even were I to agree that the old totality-of-the-circumstances test was more cumbersome, it is simply nottrue that Miranda has banished it from the law and replacedit with a new test. Under the current regime, which theCourt today retains in its entirety, courts are frequentlycalled upon to undertakeboth inquiries. That is because, asexplained earlier, voluntariness remains the constitutionalstandard, and as such continues to govern the admissibilityfor impeachment purposes of statements taken in violationof Miranda, the admissibility of the "fruits" of such state-ments, and the admissibility of statements challenged as unconstitutionally obtained despite the interrogator's compli-ance withMiranda, see, e. g., Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U. S.157 (1986).Finally, I am not convinced by petitioner's argument thatMiranda should be preserved because the decision occupiesa special place in the "public's consciousness." Brief forPetitioner 44. As far as I am aware, the public is not underthe illusion that we are infallible. I see little harm in admit-ting that we made a mistake in taking away from the peoplethe ability to decide for themselves what protections (beyondthose required by the Constitution) are reasonably affordablein the criminal investigatory process. And I see much tobe gained by reaffirming for the people the wonderful reality530US2 Unit: $U78 [10-22-01 16:56:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN465Cite as: 530 U. S. 428 (2000)Scalia, J., dissentingthat they govern themselves--which means that "[t]he pow-ers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution"that the people adopted, "nor prohibited . . . to the States"by that Constitution, "are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people," U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.2* * *Today's judgment converts Miranda from a milestone ofjudicial overreaching into the very Cheops' Pyramid (or perhaps the Sphinx would be a better analogue) of judicial ar-rogance. In imposing its Court-made code upon the States,the original opinion at least asserted that it was demandedby the Constitution. Today's decision does not pretend thatit is--and yet still asserts the right to impose it against thewill of the people's representatives in Congress. Far frombelieving that stare decisis compels this result, I believe wecannot allow to remain on the books even a celebrated decision--especially a celebrated decision--that has come tostand for the proposition that the Supreme Court has powerto impose extraconstitutional constraints upon Congress andthe States. This is not the system that was established bythe Framers, or that would be established by any sane sup-porter of government by the people.I dissent from today's decision, and, until $ 3501 is re-pealed, will continue to apply it in all cases where there hasbeen a sustainable finding that the defendant's confessionwas voluntary.2 The Court cites my dissenting opinion in Mitchell v. United States,526 U. S. 314, 331-332 (1999), for the proposition that "the fact that a rulehas found `wide acceptance in the legal culture' is `adequate reason not tooverrule' it." Ante, at 443. But the legal culture is not the same as the"public's consciousness"; and unlike the rule at issue in Mitchell (prohibiting comment on a defendant's refusal to testify), Miranda has been continually criticized by lawyers, law enforcement officials, and scholars since itspronouncement (not to mention by Congress, as $ 3501 shows). In Mitchell, moreover, the constitutional underpinnings of the earlier rule had notbeen demolished by subsequent cases.530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN466 OCTOBER TERM, 1999SyllabusAPPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYcertiorari to the supreme court of new jerseyNo. 99-478. Argued March 28, 2000--Decided June 26, 2000Petitioner Apprendi fired several shots into the home of an AfricanAmerican family and made a statement--which he later retracted--thathe did not want the family in his neighborhood because of their race.He was charged under New Jersey law with, inter alia, second-degreepossession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose, which carries a prisonterm of 5 to 10 years. The count did not refer to the State's hate crimestatute, which provides for an enhanced sentence if a trial judge finds,by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant committed thecrime with a purpose to intimidate a person or group because of, interalia, race. After Apprendi pleaded guilty, the prosecutor filed a motionto enhance the sentence. The court found by a preponderance of theevidence that the shooting was racially motivated and sentenced Apprendi to a 12-year term on the firearms count. In upholding the sentence, the appeals court rejected Apprendi's claim that the Due ProcessClause requires that a bias finding be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The State Supreme Court affirmed.Held: The Constitution requires that any fact that increases the penaltyfor a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, other than thefact of a prior conviction, must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Pp. 474-497.(a) The answer to the narrow constitutional question presented--whether Apprendi's sentence was permissible, given that it exceeds the10-year maximum for the offense charged--was foreshadowed by theholding in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, that, with regard tofederal law, the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the SixthAmendment's notice and jury trial guarantees require that any factother than prior conviction that increases the maximum penalty for acrime must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and provedbeyond a reasonable doubt. The Fourteenth Amendment commandsthe same answer when a state statute is involved. Pp. 474-476.(b) The Fourteenth Amendment right to due process and the SixthAmendment right to trial by jury, taken together, entitle a criminaldefendant to a jury determination that he is guilty of every elementof the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.E. g., In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364. The historical foundation forthese principles extends down centuries into the common law. While530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN467Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Syllabusjudges in this country have long exercised discretion in sentencing,such discretion is bound by the range of sentencing options prescribedby the legislature. See, e. g., United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443,447. The historic inseparability of verdict and judgment and the consistent limitation on judges' discretion highlight the novelty of ascheme that removes the jury from the determination of a fact thatexposes the defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he couldreceive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdictalone. Pp. 476-485.(c) McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, was the first case inwhich the Court used "sentencing factor" to refer to a fact that was notfound by the jury but could affect the sentence imposed by the judge.In finding that the scheme at issue there did not run afoul of Winship'sstrictures, this Court did not budge from the position that (1) constitutional limits exist to States' authority to define away facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense, 477 U. S., at 85-88, and (2) a statescheme that keeps from the jury facts exposing defendants to greater oradditional punishment may raise serious constitutional concerns, id., at88. Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224--in which theCourt upheld a federal law allowing a judge to impose an enhanced sentence based on prior convictions not alleged in the indictment--represents at best an exceptional departure from the historicpractice. Pp. 485-490.(d) In light of the constitutional rule expressed here, New Jersey'spractice cannot stand. It allows a jury to convict a defendant of asecond-degree offense on its finding beyond a reasonable doubt andthen allows a judge to impose punishment identical to that New Jerseyprovides for first-degree crimes on his finding, by a preponderance ofthe evidence, that the defendant's purpose was to intimidate his victimbased on the victim's particular characteristic. The State's argumentthat the biased purpose finding is not an "element" of a distinct hatecrime offense but a "sentencing factor" of motive is nothing more thana disagreement with the rule applied in this case. Beyond this, theargument cannot succeed on its own terms. It does not matter howthe required finding is labeled, but whether it exposes the defendant toa greater punishment than that authorized by the jury's verdict, asdoes the sentencing "enhancement" here. The degree of culpability thelegislature associates with factually distinct conduct has significant implications both for a defendant's liberty and for the heightened stigmaassociated with an offense the legislature has selected as worthy ofgreater punishment. That the State placed the enhancer within thecriminal code's sentencing provisions does not mean that it is not anessential element of the offense. Pp. 491-497.159 N.

N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 2C:44-3(e) (West Supp.1999-2000). The extended term authorized by the hatecrime law for second-degree offenses is imprisonment for"between 10 and 20 years." $ 2C:43-7(a)(3).The question presented is whether the Due Process Clauseof the Fourteenth Amendment requires that a factual deter-mination authorizing an increase in the maximum prison sentence for an offense from 10 to 20 years be made by a juryon the basis of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.IAt 2:04 a.m. on December 22, 1994, petitioner Charles C.Apprendi, Jr., fired several .22-caliber bullets into the homeof an African-American family that had recently moved intoa previously all-white neighborhood in Vineland, New Jersey.Apprendi was promptly arrested and, at 3:05 a.m., admittedthat he was the shooter. After further questioning, at 6:04a.m., he made a statement--which he later retracted--thateven though he did not know the occupants of the house personally, "because they are black in color he does not wantthem in the neighborhood." 159 N. J. 7, 10, 731 A. 2d 485,486 (1999).A New Jersey grand jury returned a 23-count indictmentcharging Apprendi with four first-degree, eight second-degree, six third-degree, and five fourth-degree offenses.The charges alleged shootings on four different dates, as wellas the unlawful possession of various weapons. None of thecounts referred to the hate crime statute, and none allegedthat Apprendi acted with a racially biased purpose.The parties entered into a plea agreement, pursuant towhich Apprendi pleaded guilty to two counts (3 and 18) ofsecond-degree possession of a firearm for an unlawful pur530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN470 APPRENDI v.

Ann. $ 2C:39-4a (West 1995), and one count(22) of the third-degree offense of unlawful possession of anantipersonnel bomb, $ 2C:39-3a; the prosecutor dismissed theother 20 counts. Under state law, a second-degree offensecarries a penalty range of 5 to 10 years, $ 2C:43-6(a)(2); athird-degree offense carries a penalty range of between 3and 5 years, $ 2C:43-6(a)(3). As part of the plea agreement,however, the State reserved the right to request the courtto impose a higher "enhanced" sentence on count 18 (whichwas based on the December 22 shooting) on the ground thatthat offense was committed with a biased purpose, as described in $ 2C:44-3(e). Apprendi, correspondingly, reserved the right to challenge the hate crime sentence enhancement on the ground that it violates the United StatesConstitution.At the plea hearing, the trial judge heard sufficient evidence to establish Apprendi's guilt on counts 3, 18, and 22;the judge then confirmed that Apprendi understood themaximum sentences that could be imposed on those counts.Because the plea agreement provided that the sentence onthe sole third-degree offense (count 22) would run concurrently with the other sentences, the potential sentences onthe two second-degree counts were critical. If the judgefound no basis for the biased purpose enhancement, themaximum consecutive sentences on those counts wouldamount to 20 years in aggregate; if, however, the judge enhanced the sentence on count 18, the maximum on that countalone would be 20 years and the maximum for the two countsin aggregate would be 30 years, with a 15-year period ofparole ineligibility.After the trial judge accepted the three guilty pleas, theprosecutor filed a formal motion for an extended term. Thetrial judge thereafter held an evidentiary hearing on theissue of Apprendi's "purpose" for the shooting on December22. Apprendi adduced evidence from a psychologist andfrom seven character witnesses who testified that he did not530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN471Cite as: 530 U.

He also took the standhimself, explaining that the incident was an unintended consequence of overindulgence in alcohol, denying that he wasin any way biased against African-Americans, and denyingthat his statement to the police had been accurately de-scribed.

Having found "by a preponderanceof the evidence" that Apprendi's actions were taken "with apurpose to intimidate" as provided by the statute,id., at138a, 139a, 144a, the trial judge held that the hate crimeenhancement applied. Rejecting Apprendi's constitutionalchallenge to the statute, the judge sentenced him to a 12-year term of imprisonment on count 18, and to shorter concurrent sentences on the other two counts.Apprendi appealed, arguing, inter alia, that the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution requires thatthe finding of bias upon which his hate crime sentence wasbased must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970). Over dissent, the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey upheldthe enhanced sentence. 304 N. J. Super. 147, 698 A. 2d 1265(1997). Relying on our decision in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.

Super., at 156,698 A. 2d, at 1269.A divided New Jersey Supreme Court affirmed. 159 N. J.7, 731 A. 2d 485 (1999). The court began by explaining thatwhile due process only requires the State to prove the "elements" of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt, the merefact that a state legislature has placed a criminal component"within the sentencing provisions" of the criminal code "doesnot mean that the finding of a biased purpose to intimidateis not an essential element of the offense." Id., at 20, 731A. 2d, at 492. "Were that the case," the court continued,"the Legislature could just as easily allow judges, not juries,to determine if a kidnapping victim has been released unharmed." Ibid. (citing state precedent requiring such afinding to be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt). Neither could the constitutional question besettled simply by defining the hate crime statute's "purposeto intimidate" as "motive" and thereby excluding the provision from any traditional conception of an "element" of acrime. Even if one could characterize the language thisway--and the court doubted that such a characterization wasaccurate--proof of motive did not ordinarily "increase thepenal consequences to an actor." Ibid. Such "[l]abels," thecourt concluded, would not yield an answer to Apprendi'sconstitutional question. Ibid.While noting that we had just last year expressed seriousdoubt concerning the constitutionality of allowing penaltyenhancing findings to be determined by a judge by a preponderance of the evidence, Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN473Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Opinion of the Court227 (1999), the court concluded that those doubts were notessential to our holding. Turning then, as the appeals courthad, to McMillan, as well as to Almendarez-Torres v. UnitedStates, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), the court undertook a multifactorinquiry and then held that the hate crime provision wasvalid. In the majority's view, the statute did not allow impermissible burden shifting, and did not "create a separateoffense calling for a separate penalty." 159 N. J., at 24, 731A. 2d, at 494. Rather, "the Legislature simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts tobear on punishment and dictated the weight to be given thatfactor." Ibid., 731 A. 2d, at 494-495. As had the appealscourt, the majority recognized that the state statute was unlike that in McMillan inasmuch as it increased the maximumpenalty to which a defendant could be subject. But it wasnot clear that this difference alone would "change the constitutional calculus," especially where, as here, "there is rarelyany doubt whether the defendants committed the crimeswith the purpose of intimidating the victim on the basis ofrace or ethnicity." 159 N. J., at 24-25, 731 A. 2d, at 495.Moreover, in light of concerns "idiosyncratic" to hate crimestatutes drawn carefully to avoid "punishing thought itself,"the enhancement served as an appropriate balance betweenthose concerns and the State's compelling interest in vindicating the right "to be free of invidious discrimination."Id., at 25-26, 731 A. 2d, at 495.The dissent rejected this conclusion, believing instead thatthe case turned on two critical characteristics: (1) "[A] defendant's mental state in committing the subject offense . . .necessarily involves a finding so integral to the charged offense that it must be characterized as an element thereof ";and (2) "the significantly increased sentencing range triggered by . . . the finding of a purpose to intimidate" meansthat the purpose "must be treated as a material element[that] must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt."530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN474 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the CourtId., at 30, 731 A. 2d, at 498. In the dissent's view, the factsincreasing sentences in both Almendarez-Torres (recidivism)and Jones (serious bodily injury) were quite distinct fromNew Jersey's required finding of purpose here; the latterfinding turns directly on the conduct of the defendant duringthe crime and defines a level of culpability necessary to formthe hate crime offense. While acknowledging "analyticaltensions" in this Court's postWinship jurisprudence, thedissenters concluded that "there can be little doubt that thesentencing factor applied to this defendant--the purpose tointimidate a victim because of race--must fairly be regardedas an element of the crime requiring inclusion in the indict-ment and proof beyond a reasonable doubt." 159 N. J., at51, 731 A. 2d, at 512.We granted certiorari, 528 U. S. 1018 (1999), and nowreverse. IIIt is appropriate to begin by explaining why certain as-pects of the case are not relevant to the narrow issue thatwe must resolve. First, the State has argued that evenwithout the trial judge's finding of racial bias, the judgecould have imposed consecutive sentences on counts 3 and 18that would have produced the 12-year term of imprisonmentthat Apprendi received; Apprendi's actual sentence was thuswithin the range authorized by statute for the three offensesto which he pleaded guilty. Brief for Respondent 4. Theconstitutional question, however, is whether the 12-yearsentence imposed on count 18 was permissible, given thatit was above the 10-year maximum for the offense chargedin that count. The finding is legally significant because itincreased--indeed, it doubled--the maximum range withinwhich the judge could exercise his discretion, convertingwhat otherwise was a maximum 10-year sentence on thatcount into a minimum sentence. The sentences on counts 3and 22 have no more relevance to our disposition than thedismissal of the remaining 18 counts.530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN475Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Opinion of the CourtSecond, although the constitutionality of basing an en-hanced sentence on racial bias was argued in the New Jerseycourts, that issue was not raised here.1 The substantivebasis for New Jersey's enhancement is thus not at issue; theadequacy of New Jersey's procedure is. The strength of thestate interests that are served by the hate crime legislationhas no more bearing on this procedural question than thestrength of the interests served by other provisions of thecriminal code.Third, we reject the suggestion by the State SupremeCourt that "there is rarely any doubt" concerning the exist-ence of the biased purpose that will support an enhancedsentence, 159 N. J., at 25, 731 A. 2d, at 495. In this verycase, that issue was the subject of the full evidentiary hearing we described. We assume that both the purpose of theoffender, and even the known identity of the victim, willsometimes be hotly disputed, and that the outcome may welldepend in some cases on the standard of proof and the identity of the factfinder.Fourth, because there is no ambiguity in New Jersey'sstatutory scheme, this case does not raise any question con-cerning the State's power to manipulate the prosecutor'sburden of proof by, for example, relying on a presumptionrather than evidence to establish an element of an offense,cf. Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975); Sandstrom v.Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979), or by placing the affirmativedefense label on "at least some elements" of traditionalcrimes, Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977).The prosecutor did not invoke any presumption to buttressthe evidence of racial bias and did not claim that Apprendihad the burden of disproving an improper motive. Thequestion whether Apprendi had a constitutional right to1 We have previously rejected a First Amendment challenge to anenhanced sentence based on a jury finding that the defendant had intentionally selected his victim because of the victim's race. Wisconsinv. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 480 (1993).530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN476 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the Courthave a jury find such bias on the basis of proof beyond areasonable doubt is starkly presented.Our answer to that question was foreshadowed by ouropinion in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999), construing a federal statute. We there noted that "under theDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the noticeand jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact(other than prior conviction) that increases the maximumpenalty for a crime must be charged in an indictment, sub-mitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt."Id., at 243, n. 6. The Fourteenth Amendment commands thesame answer in this case involving a state statute.IIIIn his 1881 lecture on the criminal law, Oliver WendellHolmes, Jr., observed: "The law threatens certain pains ifyou do certain things, intending thereby to give you a newmotive for not doing them. If you persist in doing them,it has to inflict the pains in order that its threats may con-tinue to be believed."2 New Jersey threatened Apprendiwith certain pains if he unlawfully possessed a weapon andwith additional pains if he selected his victims with a purpose to intimidate them because of their race. As a matterof simple justice, it seems obvious that the procedural safeguards designed to protect Apprendi from unwarrantedpains should apply equally to the two acts that New Jerseyhas singled out for punishment. Merely using the label"sentence enhancement" to describe the latter surely doesnot provide a principled basis for treating them differently.At stake in this case are constitutional protections ofsurpassing importance: the proscription of any deprivationof liberty without "due process of law," Amdt. 14, and theguarantee that "[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accusedshall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an im2 O. Holmes, The Common Law 40 (M. Howe ed. 1963).530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN477Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Opinion of the Courtpartial jury," Amdt. 6.3 Taken together, these rights in-disputably entitle a criminal defendant to "a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of the crime withwhich he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt." UnitedStates v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 510 (1995); see also Sullivanv. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 278 (1993); Winship, 397 U. S., at364 ("[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused againstconviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt ofevery fact necessary to constitute the crime with which heis charged").As we have, unanimously, explained, Gaudin, 515 U. S.,at 510-511, the historical foundation for our recognition ofthese principles extends down centuries into the commonlaw. "[T]o guard against a spirit of oppression and tyrannyon the part of rulers," and "as the great bulwark of [our]civil and political liberties," 2 J. Story, Commentaries on theConstitution of the United States 540-541 (4th ed. 1873),trial by jury has been understood to require that "the truthof every accusation, whether preferred in the shape ofindictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards beconfirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the de-fendant's] equals and neighbours . . . ." 4 W. Blackstone,Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (here-inafter Blackstone) (emphasis added). See alsoDuncan v.Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-154 (1968).3 Apprendi has not here asserted a constitutional claim based on theomission of any reference to sentence enhancement or racial bias in theindictment. He relies entirely on the fact that the "due process of law"that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the States to provide to personsaccused of crime encompasses the right to a trial by jury, Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), and the right to have every element of theoffense proved beyond a reasonable doubt, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358(1970). That Amendment has not, however, been construed to include theFifth Amendment right to "presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury"that was implicated in our recent decision in Almendarez-Torres v. UnitedStates, 523 U. S. 224 (1998). We thus do not address the indictment question separately today.530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN478 APPRENDI v.

We wenton to explain that the reliance on the "reasonable doubt"standard among common-law jurisdictions " `reflect[s] a pro-found judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered.' " Id., at 361-362 (quotingDuncan, 391 U. S., at 155).Any possible distinction between an "element" of a felonyoffense and a "sentencing factor" was unknown to the prac-tice of criminal indictment, trial by jury, and judgment bycourt 4 as it existed during the years surrounding our Na-tion's founding. As a general rule, criminal proceedingswere submitted to a jury after being initiated by an in-dictment containing "all the facts and circumstances whichconstitute the offence, . . . stated with such certainty andprecision, that the defendant . . . may be enabled to determine the species of offence they constitute, in order that hemay prepare his defence accordingly . . . andthat there maybe no doubt as to the judgment which should be given, if thedefendant be convicted." J. Archbold, Pleading and Evi-dence in Criminal Cases 44 (15th ed. 1862) (emphasis added).The defendant's ability to predict with certainty the judg-ment from the face of the felony indictment flowed from theinvariable linkage of punishment with crime. See 4 Black4 "[A]fter trial and conviction are past," the defendant is submitted to"judgment" by the court, 4 Blackstone 368--the stage approximating inmodern terms the imposition of sentence.530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN479Cite as: 530 U.

The substantivecriminal law tended to be sanction-specific; it prescribed aparticular sentence for each offense. The judge was meantsimply to impose that sentence (unless he thought in thecircumstances that the sentence was so inappropriate thathe should invoke the pardon process to commute it)."

S. 227 (1999), juriesdevised extralegal ways of avoiding a guilty verdict, at least of the moresevere form of the offense alleged, if the punishment associated with theoffense seemed to them disproportionate to the seriousness of the conductof the particular defendant. Id., at 245 ("This power to thwart Parliament and Crown took the form not only of flat-out acquittals in the faceof guilt but of what today we would call verdicts of guilty to lesser included offenses, manifestations of what Blackstone described as `piousperjury' on the jurors' part. 4 Blackstone 238-239").6 As the principal dissent would chide us for this single citation to Blackstone's third volume, rather than his fourth, post, at 525-526 (opinion ofO'Connor, J.), we suggest that Blackstone himself directs us to it for thesepurposes. See 4 Blackstone 343 ("The antiquity and excellence of this[jury] trial, for the settling of civil property, has before been explained atlarge"). See 3 id., at 379 ("Upon these accounts the trial by jury ever hasbeen, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law.And, if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property, how much must that advantage be heightened, when it is applied tocriminal cases!"); 4 id., at 343 ("And it will hold much stronger in criminalcases; since, in times of difficulty and danger, more is to be apprehendedfrom the violence and partiality of judges appointed by the crown, in suitsbetween the king and the subject, than in disputes between one individual and another, to settle the metes and boundaries of private property");530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN480 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the Courtment, though pronounced or awarded by the judges, is nottheir determination or sentence, but the determination andsentence of the law." 3 Blackstone 396 (emphasis deleted).7This practice at common law held true when indictmentswere issued pursuant to statute. Just as the circumstancesof the crime and the intent of the defendant at the time ofcommission were often essential elements to be alleged inthe indictment, so too were the circumstances mandating aparticular punishment. "Where a statute annexes a higherdegree of punishment to a common-law felony, if committedunder particular circumstances, an indictment for the offence, in order to bring the defendant within that higher degree of punishment, must expressly charge it to have beencommitted under those circumstances, and must state thecircumstances with certainty and precision. [2 M. Hale,Pleas of the Crown *170]." Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases, at 51. If, then, "upon an indictment under the statute, the prosecutor prove the felony tohave been committed, but fail in proving it to have been committed under the circumstances specified in the statute, the4 id., at 344 ("What was said of juries in general, and the trial thereby, incivil cases, will greatly shorten our present remarks, with regard to thetrial of criminal suits; indictments, informations, and appeals").7 The common law of punishment for misdemeanors--those "smallerfaults, and omissions of less consequence," 4 id., at 5--was, as we noted inJones, 526 U. S., at 244, substantially more dependent upon judicial discretion. Subject to the limitations that the punishment not "touch life orlimb," that it be proportionate to the offense, and, by the 17th century, thatit not be "cruel or unusual," judges most commonly imposed discretionary"sentences" of fines or whippings upon misdemeanants.

We have often noted thatjudges in this country have long exercised discretion of thisnature in imposing sentence within statutory limits in theindividual case. See,e. g., Williams v. New York, 337 U. S.241, 246 (1949) ("[B]oth before and since the American colonies became a nation, courts in this country and in Englandpracticed a policy under which a sentencing judge couldexercise a wide discretion in the sources and types of evi-dence used to assist him in determining the kind and extentof punishment to be imposed within limits fixed by law"(emphasis added)). As in Williams, our periodic recognitionof judges' broad discretion in sentencing--since the 19th-century shift in this country from statutes providing fixedterm sentences to those providing judges discretion withina permissible range, Note, The Admissibility of CharacterEvidence in Determining Sentence, 9 U. Chi. L. Rev. 715(1942)--has been regularly accompanied by the qualificationthat that discretion was bound by the range of sentencingoptions prescribed by the legislature. See,e. g., UnitedStates v.

S., at 247-248.11 But practice must at leastadhere to the basic principles undergirding the requirements of trying to a jury all facts necessary to constitute astatutory offense, and proving those facts beyond reason10 In support of its novel view that this Court has "long recognized" thatnot all facts affecting punishment need go to the jury, post, at 524, theprincipal dissent cites three cases decided within the past quarter century;and each of these is plainly distinguishable. Rather than offer any historical account of its own that would support the notion of a "sentencing factor" legally increasing punishment beyond the statutory maximum--andJustice Thomas' concurring opinion in this case makes clear that such anexercise would be futile--the dissent proceeds by mischaracterizing ouraccount. The evidence we describe that punishment was, by law, tied tothe offense (enabling the defendant to discern, barring pardon or clergy,his punishment from the face of the indictment), and the evidence thatAmerican judges have exercised sentencing discretion within a legallyprescribed range (enabling the defendant to discern from the statute ofindictment what maximum punishment conviction under that statute couldbring), point to a single, consistent conclusion: The judge's role in sentencing is constrained at its outer limits by the facts alleged in the indictment and found by the jury. Put simply, facts that expose a defendantto a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were bydefinition "elements" of a separate legal offense.11 As we stated in Jones: "One contributor to the ratification debates, forexample, commenting on the jury trial guarantee in Art.

Wethus require this, among other, procedural protections inorder to "provid[e] concrete substance for the presumptionof innocence," and to reduce the risk of imposing such deprivations erroneously. Ibid. If a defendant faces punishmentbeyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both the loss of liberty and the stigma attaching tothe offense are heightened; it necessarily follows that thedefendant should not--at the moment the State is put toproof of those circumstances--be deprived of protectionsthat have, until that point, unquestionably attached.Since Winship, we have made clear beyond peradventurethat Winship's due process and associated jury protectionsextend, to some degree, "to determinations that [go] not toa defendant's guilt or innocence, but simply to the lengthof his sentence." Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 251(Scalia, J., dissenting). This was a primary lesson of Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684 (1975), in which we invalidateda Maine statute that presumed that a defendant who actedwith an intent to kill possessed the "malice aforethought"necessary to constitute the State's murder offense (andtherefore, was subject to that crime's associated punishmentof life imprisonment). The statute placed the burden on thedefendant of proving, in rebutting the statutory presumption, that he acted with a lesser degree of culpability, suchas in the heat of passion, to win a reduction in the offensefrom murder to manslaughter (and thus a reduction of themaximum punishment of 20 years).The State had posited in Mullaney that requiring a defendant to prove heat-of-passion intent to overcome a pre530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN485Cite as: 530 U.

Rejecting this argument, we acknowledgedthat criminal law "is concerned not only with guilt or in-nocence in the abstract, but also with the degree of criminal culpability" assessed. 421 U.

S. 197, 198 (1977), posed no direct challenge tothis aspect of Mullaney. In upholding a New York law allowing defendants to raise and prove extreme emotional distress as an affirmative defense to murder, Patterson made clear that the state law still required theState to prove every element of that State's offense of murder and itsaccompanying punishment. "No further facts are either presumed orinferred in order to constitute the crime." 432 U. S., at 205-206. NewYork, unlike Maine, had not made malice aforethought, or any describedmens rea, part of its statutory definition of second-degree murder; onecould tell from the face of the statute that if one intended to cause thedeath of another person and did cause that death, one could be subjectto sentence for a second-degree offense. Id., at 198. Responding to theargument that our view could be seen "to permit state legislatures toreallocate burdens of proof by labeling as affirmative defenses at leastsome elements of the crimes now defined in their statutes," the Courtmade clear in the very next breath that there were "obviously constitutional limits beyond which the States may not go in this regard."

According to its provisions, anyone convicted ofcertain felonies would be subject to a mandatory minimumpenalty of five years' imprisonment if the judge found, by apreponderance of the evidence, that the person "visibly pos-sessed a firearm" in the course of committing one of the specified felonies. 477 U. S., at 81-82. Articulating for the firsttime, and then applying, a multifactor set of criteria for determining whether the Winship protections applied to barsuch a system, we concluded that the Pennsylvania statutedid not run afoul of our previous admonitions against re-lieving the State of its burden of proving guilt, or tailoringthe mere form of a criminal statute solely to avoid Winship'sstrictures. 477 U. S., at 86-88.We did not, however, there budge from the position that(1) constitutional limits exist to States' authority to defineaway facts necessary to constitute a criminal offense, id., at85-88, and (2) that a state scheme that keeps from the juryfacts that "expos[e] [defendants] to greater or additional pun-ishment," id., at 88, may raise serious constitutional concern.As we explained:"Section 9712 neither alters the maximum penalty forthe crime committed nor creates a separate offensecalling for a separate penalty; it operates solely to limitthe sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penaltywithin the range already available to it without the spe-cial finding of visible possession of a firearm. . . . Thestatute gives no impression of having been tailored topermit the visible possession finding to be a tail whichwags the dog of the substantive offense. Petitioners'claim that visible possession under the Pennsylvaniastatute is `really' an element of the offenses for whichthey are being punished--that Pennsylvania has in effect defined a new set of upgraded felonies--would haveat least more superficial appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to greater or additional punish530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN487Cite as: 530 U.

Id., at 87-88.13Finally, as we made plain in Jones last Term, AlmendarezTorres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), represents atbest an exceptional departure from the historic practice thatwe have described. In that case, we considered a federalgrand jury indictment, which charged the petitioner with"having been `found in the United States . . . after beingdeported,' " in violation of 8 U. S. C. $ 1326(a)--an offensecarrying a maximum sentence of two years. 523 U. S., at227. Almendarez-Torres pleaded guilty to the indictment,admitting at the plea hearing that he had been deported,that he had unlawfully reentered this country, and that"the earlier deportation had taken place `pursuant to'three earlier `convictions' for aggravated felonies." Ibid.The Government then filed a presentence report indicatingthat Almendarez-Torres' offense fell within the bounds of$ 1326(b) because, as specified in that provision, his originaldeportation had been subsequent to an aggravated felonyconviction; accordingly, Almendarez-Torres could be subject to a sentence of up to 20 years. Almendarez-Torresobjected, contending that because the indictment "had notmentioned his earlier aggravated felony convictions," hecould be sentenced to no more than two years in prison.Ibid.13 The principal dissent accuses us of today "overruling McMillan."Post, at 533. We do not overrule McMillan. We limit its holding tocases that do not involve the imposition of a sentence more severe thanthe statutory maximum for the offense established by the jury's verdict--a limitation identified in the McMillan opinion itself. Conscious of thelikelihood that legislative decisions may have been made in reliance onMcMillan, we reserve for another day the question whether stare decisisconsiderations preclude reconsideration of its narrower holding.530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN488 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the CourtRejecting Almendarez-Torres' objection, we concludedthat sentencing him to a term higher than that attached tothe offense alleged in the indictment did not violate the stric-tures of Winship in that case. Because Almendarez-Torreshad admitted the three earlier convictions for aggravatedfelonies--all of which had been entered pursuant to proceedings with substantial procedural safeguards of their own--no question concerning the right to a jury trial or the standard of proof that would apply to a contested issue of fact wasbefore the Court. Although our conclusion in that case wasbased in part on our application of the criteria we had in-voked inMcMillan, the specific question decided concernedthe sufficiency of the indictment. More important, as Jonesmade crystal clear, 526 U. S., at 248-249, our conclusion inAlmendarez-Torres turned heavily upon the fact that the additional sentence to which the defendant was subject was"the prior commission of a serious crime." 523 U. S., at 230;see also id., at 243 (explaining that "recidivism . . . is a tra-ditional, if not the most traditional, basis for a sentencingcourt's increasing an offender's sentence"); id., at 244 (em-phasizing "the fact that recidivism `does not relate to thecommission of the offense . . .' "); Jones, 526 U. S., at 249-250,n. 10 ("The majority and the dissenters inAlmendarez-Torres disagreed over the legitimacy of the Court's decisionto restrict its holding to recidivism, but both sides agreedthat the Court had done just that"). Both the certainty thatprocedural safeguards attached to any "fact" of prior convic-tion, and the reality that Almendarez-Torres did not challenge the accuracy of that "fact" in his case, mitigated thedue process and Sixth Amendment concerns otherwise implicated in allowing a judge to determine a "fact" increasingpunishment beyond the maximum of the statutory range.1414 The principal dissent's contention that our decision in Monge v. California, 524 U. S. 721 (1998), "demonstrates that Almendarez-Torres was"something other than a limited exception to the jury trial rule is both530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN489Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Opinion of the CourtEven though it is arguable that Almendarez-Torres wasincorrectly decided,15 and that a logical application of ourreasoning today should apply if the recidivist issue wereinaccurate and misleading. Post, at 536. Monge was another recidivismcase in which the question presented and the bulk of the Court's analysisrelated to the scope of double jeopardy protections in sentencing. Thedissent extracts from that decision the majority's statement that "theCourt has rejected an absolute rule that an enhancement constitutes anelement of the offense any time that it increases the maximum sentence."524 U. S., at 729. Far from being part of "reasoning essential" to theCourt's holding, post, at 536, that statement was in response to a dissentby Justice Scalia on an issue that the Court itself had, a few sentencesearlier, insisted "was neither considered by the state courts nor discussedin petitioner's brief before this Court." 524 U. S., at 728. Moreover, thesole citation supporting the Monge Court's proposition that "the Courthas rejected" such a rule was none other than Almendarez-Torres; as wehave explained, that case simply cannot bear that broad reading. Mosttelling of Monge's distance from the issue at stake in this case is that thedouble jeopardy question in Monge arose because the State had failed tosatisfy its own statutory burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubtthat the defendant had committed a prior offense (and was thereforesubject to an enhanced, recidivism-based sentence). 524 U. S., at 725("According to California law, a number of procedural safeguards surround the assessment of prior conviction allegations: Defendants may invoke the right to a jury trial . . . ; the prosecution must prove the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt; and the rules of evidence apply"). TheCourt thus itself warned against a contrary double jeopardy rule thatcould "create disincentives that would diminish these important procedural protections." Id., at 734.15 In addition to the reasons set forth in Justice Scalia's dissent, 523U. S., at 248-260, it is noteworthy that the Court's extensive discussion ofthe term "sentencing factor" virtually ignored the pedigree of the pleadingrequirement at issue. The rule was succinctly stated by Justice Cliffordin his separate opinion in United States v. Reese, 92 U. S. 214, 232-233(1876): "[T]he indictment must contain an allegation of every fact which islegally essential to the punishment to be inflicted." As he explained in"[s]peaking of that principle, Mr. Bishop says it pervades the entire systemof the adjudged law of criminal procedure, as appears by all the cases;that, wherever we move in that department of our jurisprudence, we comein contact with it; and that we can no more escape from it than from530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN490 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the Courtcontested, Apprendi does not contest the decision's validityand we need not revisit it for purposes of our decision todayto treat the case as a narrow exception to the general rulewe recalled at the outset. Given its unique facts, it surelydoes not warrant rejection of the otherwise uniform courseof decision during the entire history of our jurisprudence.In sum, our reexamination of our cases in this area, andof the history upon which they rely, confirms the opinion thatwe expressed in Jones. Other than the fact of a prior con-viction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submittedto a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. With thatexception, we endorse the statement of the rule set forth inthe concurring opinions in that case: "[I]t is unconstitutionalfor a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment offacts that increase the prescribed range of penalties to whicha criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear thatsuch facts must be established by proof beyond a reasonabledoubt." 526 U.

Smith, 1 Barn. & Ald. 99."16 The principal dissent would reject the Court's rule as a "meaninglessformalism," because it can conceive of hypothetical statutes that wouldcomply with the rule and achieve the same result as the New Jersey statute. Post, at 539-542. While a State could, hypothetically, undertake torevise its entire criminal code in the manner the dissent suggests, post, at540--extending all statutory maximum sentences to, for example, 50 yearsand giving judges guided discretion as to a few specially selected factorswithin that range--this possibility seems remote. Among other reasons,structural democratic constraints exist to discourage legislatures fromenacting penal statutes that expose every defendant convicted of, for example, weapons possession, to a maximum sentence exceeding that whichis, in the legislature's judgment, generally proportional to the crime.This is as it should be. Our rule ensures that a State is obliged "to makeits choices concerning the substantive content of its criminal laws with fullawareness of the consequences, unable to mask substantive policy choices"530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN491Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Opinion of the CourtVThe New Jersey statutory scheme that Apprendi asks usto invalidate allows a jury to convict a defendant of asecond-degree offense based on its finding beyond a reasonable doubt that he unlawfully possessed a prohibited weapon;after a subsequent and separate proceeding, it then allows ajudge to impose punishment identical to that New Jerseyprovides for crimes of the first degree, N. J. Stat. Ann.$ 2C:43-6(a)(1) (West 1999), based upon the judge's finding,by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant's"purpose" for unlawfully possessing the weapon was "to intimidate" his victim on the basis of a particular characteristicthe victim possessed. In light of the constitutional rule exof exposing all who are convicted to the maximum sentence it provides.Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S., at 228-229, n. 13 (Powell, J., dissenting).So exposed, "[t]he political check on potentially harsh legislative action isthen more likely to operate." Ibid.In all events, if such an extensive revision of the State's entire criminalcode were enacted for the purpose the dissent suggests, or if New Jerseysimply reversed the burden of the hate crime finding (effectively assuminga crime was performed with a purpose to intimidate and then requiring adefendant to prove that it was not, post, at 542), we would be required toquestion whether the revision was constitutional under this Court's priordecisions. See Patterson, 432 U. S., at 210; Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S.684, 698-702 (1975).Finally, the principal dissent ignores the distinction the Court has oftenrecognized, see, e. g., Martin v. Ohio, 480 U. S. 228 (1987), between factsin aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation. See post, at 541-542. If facts found by a jury support a guilty verdict of murder, the judgeis authorized by that jury verdict to sentence the defendant to the maximum sentence provided by the murder statute. If the defendant can escape the statutory maximum by showing, for example, that he is a warveteran, then a judge that finds the fact of veteran status is neither exposing the defendant to a deprivation of liberty greater than that authorizedby the verdict according to statute, nor is the judge imposing upon thedefendant a greater stigma than that accompanying the jury verdict alone.Core concerns animating the jury and burden-of-proof requirements arethus absent from such a scheme.530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN492 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the Courtplained above, and all of the cases supporting it, this practicecannot stand.New Jersey's defense of its hate crime enhancement stat-ute has three primary components: (1) The required findingof biased purpose is not an "element" of a distinct hate crimeoffense, but rather the traditional "sentencing factor" of motive; (2) McMillan holds that the legislature can authorize ajudge to find a traditional sentencing factor on the basis of apreponderance of the evidence; and (3) Almendarez-TorresextendedMcMillan's holding to encompass factors that au-thorize a judge to impose a sentence beyond the maximumprovided by the substantive statute under which a defendantis charged. None of these persuades us that the constitutional rule that emerges from our history and case lawshould incorporate an exception for this New Jersey statute.New Jersey's first point is nothing more than a disagree-ment with the rule we apply today. Beyond this, we do notsee how the argument can succeed on its own terms. Thestate high court evinced substantial skepticism at the suggestion that the hate crime statute's "purpose to intimidate"was simply an inquiry into "motive." We share that skepticism. The text of the statute requires the factfinder to de-termine whether the defendant possessed, at the time hecommitted the subject act, a "purpose to intimidate" on ac-count of,inter alia, race. By its very terms, this statutemandates an examination of the defendant's state of mind--a concept known well to the criminal law as the defendant'smens rea.17 It makes no difference in identifying the nature17 Among the most common definitions of mens rea is "criminal intent."Black's Law Dictionary 1137 (rev. 4th ed. 1968). That dictionary unsurprisingly defines "purpose" as synonymous with intent, id., at 1400, and"intent" as, among other things, "a state of mind," id., at 947. But weneed not venture beyond New Jersey's own criminal code for a definitionof purpose that makes it central to the description of a criminal offense.As the dissenting judge on the state appeals court pointed out, accordingto the New Jersey Criminal Code, "[a] person acts purposely with respectto the nature of his conduct or a result thereof if it is his conscious object530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN493Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Opinion of the Courtof this finding that Apprendi was also required, in order toreceive the sentence he did for weapons possession, to havepossessed the weapon with a "purpose to use [the weapon]unlawfully against the person or property of another,"$ 2C:39-4(a). A second mens rea requirement hardly de-feats the reality that the enhancement statute imposes of itsown force an intent requirement necessary for the imposi-tion of sentence. On the contrary, the fact that the languageand structure of the "purpose to use" criminal offense isidentical in relevant respects to the language and structure of the "purpose to intimidate" provision demonstratesto us that it is precisely a particular criminalmens rea thatthe hate crime enhancement statute seeks to target. Thedefendant's intent in committing a crime is perhaps asclose as one might hope to come to a core criminal offense"element." 18to engage in conduct of that nature or to cause such a result." N. J. Stat.Ann. $ 2C:2-2(b)(1) (West 1999). The hate crime statute's application tothose who act "with a purpose to intimidate because of" certain statusbased characteristics places it squarely within the inquiry whether it wasa defendant's "conscious object" to intimidate for that reason.18 Whatever the effect of the State Supreme Court's comment that thelaw here targets "motive," 159 N. J. 7, 20, 731 A. 2d 485, 492 (1999)--and itis highly doubtful that one could characterize that comment as a "binding"interpretation of the state statute, see Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U. S., at483-484 (declining to be bound by state court's characterization of statelaw's "operative effect"), even if the court had not immediately thereaftercalled into direct question its "ability to view this finding as merely asearch for motive," 159 N. J., at 21, 731 A. 2d, at 492--a State cannotthrough mere characterization change the nature of the conduct actuallytargeted. It is as clear as day that this hate crime law defines a particularkind of prohibited intent, and a particular intent is more often than notthe sine qua non of a violation of a criminal law.When the principal dissent at long last confronts the actual statute atissue in this case in the final few pages of its opinion, it offers in responseto this interpretation only that our reading is contrary to "settled precedent" in Mitchell. Post, at 553. Setting aside the fact that Wisconsin'shate crime statute was, in text and substance, different from New Jersey's,Mitchell did not even begin to consider whether the Wisconsin hate crime530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN494 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the CourtThe foregoing notwithstanding, however, the New JerseySupreme Court correctly recognized that it does not matterwhether the required finding is characterized as one of in-tent or of motive, because "[l]abels do not afford an acceptable answer." 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Thatpoint applies as well to the constitutionally novel and elusive distinction between "elements" and "sentencing factors." McMillan, 477 U. S., at 86 (noting that the sentenc-ing factor--visible possession of a firearm--"might well havebeen included as an element of the enumerated offenses").Despite what appears to us the clear "elemental" nature ofthe factor here, the relevant inquiry is one not of form,but of effect--does the required finding expose the defendantto a greater punishment than that authorized by the jury'sguilty verdict?19As the New Jersey Supreme Court itself understood inrejecting the argument that the required "motive" findingwas simply a "traditional" sentencing factor, proof of motivedid not ordinarily "increase the penal consequences to anactor." 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Indeed, the effectof New Jersey's sentencing "enhancement" here is unquestionably to turn a second-degree offense into a first-degreeoffense, under the State's own criminal code. The law thusruns directly into our warning in Mullaney that Winship isrequirement was an offense "element" or not; it did not have to--therequired finding under the Wisconsin statute was made by the jury.19 This is not to suggest that the term "sentencing factor" is devoid ofmeaning. The term appropriately describes a circumstance, which maybe either aggravating or mitigating in character, that supports a specificsentence within the range authorized by the jury's finding that the defendant is guilty of a particular offense. On the other hand, when the term"sentence enhancement" is used to describe an increase beyond the maximum authorized statutory sentence, it is the functional equivalent of anelement of a greater offense than the one covered by the jury's guiltyverdict. Indeed, it fits squarely within the usual definition of an "element" of the offense. See post, at 501-502 (Thomas, J., concurring) (reviewing the relevant authorities).530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN495Cite as: 530 U. S. 466 (2000)Opinion of the Courtconcerned as much with the category of substantive offenseas "with the degree of criminal culpability" assessed. 421U. S., at 698. This concern flows not only from the historicalpedigree of the jury and burden rights, but also from thepowerful interests those rights serve. The degree of crimi-nal culpability the legislature chooses to associate with particular, factually distinct conduct has significant implicationsboth for a defendant's very liberty, and for the heightenedstigma associated with an offense the legislature has selectedas worthy of greater punishment.The preceding discussion should make clear why the State'sreliance on McMillan is likewise misplaced. The differentialin sentence between what Apprendi would have receivedwithout the finding of biased purpose and what he could receive with it is not, it is true, as extreme as the differencebetween a small fine and mandatory life imprisonment.Mullaney, 421 U. S., at 700. But it can hardly be said thatthe potential doubling of one's sentence--from 10 years to20--has no more than a nominal effect. Both in terms ofabsolute years behind bars, and because of the more severestigma attached, the differential here is unquestionably ofconstitutional significance. When a judge's finding basedon a mere preponderance of the evidence authorizes an increase in the maximum punishment, it is appropriately characterized as "a tail which wags the dog of the substantiveoffense." McMillan, 477 U. S., at 88.New Jersey would also point to the fact that the Statedid not, in placing the required biased purpose finding in asentencing enhancement provision, create a "separate offense calling for a separate penalty." Ibid. As for this, weagree wholeheartedly with the New Jersey Supreme Courtthat merely because the state legislature placed its hatecrime sentence "enhancer" "within the sentencing provisions" of the criminal code "does not mean that the findingof a biased purpose to intimidate is not an essential elementof the offense." 159 N. J., at 20, 731 A. 2d, at 492. Indeed,530US2 Unit: $U79 [11-08-01 06:47:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN496 APPRENDI v. NEW JERSEYOpinion of the Courtthe fact that New Jersey, along with numerous other States,has also made precisely the same conduct the subject of anindependent substantive offense makes it clear that the merepresence of this "enhancement" in a sentencing statute doesnot define its character.20New Jersey's reliance on Almendarez-Torres is also unavailing. The reasons supporting an exception from thegeneral rule for the statute construed in that case do notapply to the New Jersey statute. Whereas recidivism "doesnot relate to the commission of the offense" itself, 523 U. S.,at 230, 244, New Jersey's biased purpose inquiry goes precisely to what happened in the "commission of the offense."Moreover, there is a vast difference between accepting thevalidity of a prior judgment of conviction entered in a proceeding in which the defendant had the right to a jury trialand the right to require the prosecutor to prove guilt beyonda reasonable doubt, and allowing the judge to find the required fact under a lesser standard of proof.Finally, this Court has previously considered and rejectedthe argument that the principles guiding our decision todayrender invalid state capital sentencing schemes requiringjudges, after a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of acapital crime, to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death. Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S.639, 647-649 (1990); id., at 709-714 (Stevens, J., dissenting).For reasons we have explained, the capital cases are notcontrolling:20 Including New Jersey, N. J. Stat.
