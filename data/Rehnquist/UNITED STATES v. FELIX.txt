The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment tothe United States Constitution provides: "[N]or shall anyperson be subject for the same offence to be twice put injeopardy of life or limb."During the summer of 1987, respondent Frank DennisFelix operated a facility in Beggs, Oklahoma, at which hemanufactured methamphetamine in violation of applicablefederal statutes. In July, this facility was raided and shutdown by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents.Felix thereupon ordered precursor chemicals and equipmentfor the manufacture of methamphetamine to be delivered tohim at Joplin, Missouri. DEA agents observed the transferof these items and arrested Felix shortly afterwards. Hewas charged and tried in the Western District of Missourifor the offense of attempting to manufacture the illegal drugbetween August 26 and August 31, 1987. This charge wasbased upon the delivery of the materials to him at Joplin.He was tried, found guilty, and his conviction and sentencewere affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the EighthCircuit.In February 1989, Felix was charged in the Eastern Dis-trict of Oklahoma with both conspiracy and substantivecounts in connection with the operation of the facility atBeggs. He was tried and convicted, but the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed most of the counts onwhich he had been found guilty because of its view that trialon these counts constituted double jeopardy in violation ofthe Fifth Amendment. We hold that prosecution of a defendant for conspiracy, where certain of the overt acts relied*Edward T. M. Garland and Donald F.

S. 378 (1992)Opinion of the Courtupon by the Government are based on substantive offensesfor which the defendant has been previously convicted, doesnot violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.IAt Felix's trial for attempting to manufacture metham-phetamine in Missouri, the Government showed that on August 26, 1987, Felix asked to purchase chemicals and equip-ment needed for the manufacture of methamphetamine fromGeorge Dwinnells, a DEA informant. Felix made a downpayment of $7,500 toward the purchase, and in later telephone conversations instructed Dwinnells to deliver theitems to a Joplin, Missouri, hotel on August 31, 1987. Dwinnells met Felix at the hotel on that date with the merchan-dise. After Felix inspected the items and hitched his car tothe trailer in which the items had been transported, Govern-ment officials arrested him.Felix's defense in the Missouri case was that "he never hadcriminal intent, but had been acting under the mistakenbelief that he was working in a covert DEA operation."United States v. Felix, 867 F. 2d 1068, 1074 (CA8 1989). Inorder to establish Felix's criminal intent with respect to theitems delivered in Missouri, the Government introduced evi-dence that Felix had manufactured methamphetamine inOklahoma earlier in 1987. See Fed. Rule Evid. 404(b) (Evi-dence of prior acts is admissible to show "motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or ab-sence of mistake or accident"). The evidence showed thatduring the spring of 1987, Felix had purchased precursor ma-terials from Dwinnells and had furnished those items to PaulRoach in exchange for lessons on how to manufacture meth-amphetamine. Roach, who testified for the Government atFelix's Missouri trial, stated that he and Felix had producedmethamphetamine in a trailer near Beggs, Oklahoma. Government agents had seized the trailer, which was indeedbeing used as a methamphetamine lab, on July 13, 1987.503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT382 UNITED STATES v. FELIXOpinion of the CourtThe agents did not arrest Felix at that time, however; helater told Dwinnells that he had avoided arrest by hidingin the nearby woods. In accordance with Rule 404(b), theDistrict Court instructed the jury that the evidence of theOklahoma transactions was admissible only to show Felix'sstate of mind with respect to the chemicals and equipmenthe attempted to purchase in Missouri. The jury convictedFelix, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 867 F. 2d, at 1070-1076.The Government subsequently named Felix in 8 counts ofan 11-count indictment filed in the United States DistrictCourt for the Eastern District of Oklahoma. Count 1charged that Felix and five others conspired, between May1, 1987, and August 31, 1987, to manufacture, possess, anddistribute methamphetamine. Felix was named in nine ofthe overt acts supporting the conspiracy charge; two of thosenine overt acts were based on conduct that had been thesubject of the earlier Missouri prosecution. Overt act 17charged that "[o]n August 26, 1987, Frank Dennis Felix,while in Tulsa, Oklahoma, provided money for the purchaseof chemicals and equipment necessary in the manufacture ofmethamphetamine." Overt act 18 charged that "[o]n August 31, 1987, Frank Dennis Felix, while at a location in Missouri, possessed chemicals and equipment necessary in themanufacture of methamphetamine." Along with the conspiracy charge, Felix was named in seven substantive counts.Counts 2 through 5 alleged that on or about July 13, 1987, inthe Eastern District of Oklahoma, Felix had manufacturedmethamphetamine, possessed methamphetamine with intentto distribute it, possessed methamphetamine oil with intentto manufacture methamphetamine, and manufactured phenylacetone, a methamphetamine precursor. Count 6 chargedthat, between June 1, 1987, and July 13, 1987, in the EasternDistrict of Oklahoma, Felix and a codefendant had maintained a methamphetamine manufacturing lab. Counts 9and 10 charged that, on or about June 21, 1987, and July 13,503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT383Cite as: 503 U. S. 378 (1992)Opinion of the Court1987, Felix had traveled from Texas to the Eastern Districtof Oklahoma with the intent to promote the manufacture ofmethamphetamine and had thereafter attempted to promotethat activity. At trial, the Government introduced much ofthe same evidence of the Missouri and Oklahoma transactions that had been introduced in the Missouri trial. Thejury convicted Felix of all the crimes with which he wascharged.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed Felix's convictions on counts 1 through 6 ofthe Oklahoma indictment. The court began by quoting ourstatement in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), that theDouble Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecutionwhere the government, " `to establish an essential elementof an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conductthat constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.' " 926 F. 2d 1522, 1527 (1991) (quoting Grady v. Corbin, supra, at 521). With respect to count1, the conspiracy charge, the court observed that in both theMissouri and Oklahoma trials, the Government proved thatFelix had learned to make methamphetamine in Oklahoma,had thereafter manufactured the drug at the lab near Beggs,Oklahoma, and had sought to purchase more chemicals andequipment in Missouri after the raid on the Oklahoma lab.Based on the significant duplication of conduct proved ineach trial, the court concluded that the Oklahoma conspiracy count was barred under the Double Jeopardy Clausebecause it charged "the same conduct for which he was previously convicted in Missouri." 926 F. 2d, at 1530. Withrespect to the substantive offenses charged in counts 2through 6, the court noted that the direct evidence supporting these charges--the fact that Felix had purchasedchemicals and equipment during the spring of 1987, and hadsubsequently manufactured methamphetamine at the Beggs,Oklahoma, trailer--had been introduced at the previous Missouri trial to show intent. The court concluded that this503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT384 UNITED STATES v. FELIXOpinion of the Courtduplication "subjected Felix to a successive trial for thesame conduct," and therefore reversed Felix's convictions oncounts 2 through 6. Id., at 1530-1531.1We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 806 (1991), to considerwhether the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the prosecutionof Felix for these crimes.2 We hold that it does not, andso reverse. IIWe first consider whether the Double Jeopardy Clausebars Felix's prosecution on the substantive drug offensescontained in counts 2 through 6 of the Oklahoma indictment.The Court of Appeals held that the Government was fore1 The Court of Appeals affirmed Felix's convictions on counts 9 and 10of the indictment, which charged unlawful interstate travel. The courtconcluded that the conduct alleged in those counts was not sufficientlyrelated to the conduct proved in the earlier Missouri trial to require theirdismissal under the Double Jeopardy Clause. 926 F. 2d, at 1531.2 The Courts of Appeals have differed in applying Grady to successiveprosecutions for offenses arising out of a continuing course of conduct,such as the conspiracy prosecution in this case. In United States v. Calderone, 917 F. 2d 717 (1990), the Second Circuit held that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred a conspiracy prosecution where the defendant hadbeen previously prosecuted for a "broader" conspiracy that entirely encompassed the actions alleged in the second, "narrower" conspiracy. Thecourt based its decision on our language in Grady, concluding that the"conduct" at issue in a conspiracy prosecution is not the agreement itself,but the conduct from which the Government asks the jury to infer anagreement. See id., at 721-722. The Second Circuit later followed thatreasoning in holding that a conspiracy prosecution is barred if certainovert acts supporting the conspiracy charge involve substantive offensesfor which the defendant has been previously prosecuted. United Statesv. Gambino, 920 F. 2d 1108 (1990). The Tenth Circuit agreed with thatposition in upholding Felix's double jeopardy claim below. 926 F. 2d1522 (1991).On the other hand, two Courts of Appeals have concluded that the Government is not barred from bringing a successive conspiracy prosecution,even where it seeks to base the conspiracy offense on previously prosecuted conduct. United States v. Rivera-Feliciano, 930 F. 2d 951 (CA11991); United States v. Clark, 928 F. 2d 639 (CA4 1991).503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT385Cite as: 503 U. S. 378 (1992)Opinion of the Courtclosed from prosecuting these charges, because it had pre-sented evidence of the Oklahoma drug operation at the priortrial in order to help demonstrate Felix's criminal intent withrespect to the Missouri transaction.At its root, the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the duplicative prosecution of a defendant for the "same offence."U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; seeBlockburger v. United States, 284U. S. 299 (1932). An examination of the indictments belowshows that Felix was charged in the Missouri case only withattempting to manufacture methamphetamine in Missouri, inlate August 1987. App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a-63a. In thefive substantive drug counts of the Oklahoma indictment thatare at issue here, Felix was charged with various drug offenses that took place in Oklahoma, in June and July 1987.Id., at 55a-57a. The crimes charged in the Oklahoma indictment were related to the operation of the methamphetaminelab near Beggs, Oklahoma, in the summer of 1987, while thecrime charged in the Missouri indictment dealt solely withFelix's attempt to purchase chemicals and equipment fromDwinnells in order to continue methamphetamine operationsafter the Beggs lab was raided. The actual crimes chargedin each case were different in both time and place; there wasabsolutely no common conduct linking the alleged offenses.In short, none of the offenses for which Felix was prosecuted in the Oklahoma indictment is in any sense the "sameoffence" as the offence for which he was prosecuted inMissouri.The Court of Appeals appears to have acknowledged asmuch, as it concentrated not on the actual crimes prosecutedin the separate trials, but instead on the type of evidencepresented by the Government during the two trials. Thecourt found it decisive that the Government had introducedevidence of Felix's involvement in the Oklahoma lab to helpshow criminal intent for purposes of the Missouri trial. Butit is clear that, no matter how much evidence of the Oklahoma transactions was introduced by the Government to503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT386 UNITED STATES v. FELIXOpinion of the Courthelp show Felix's state of mind, he was not prosecuted in theMissouri trial for any offense other than the Missouri attempt offense with which he was charged. Thus, the Courtof Appeals holding must rest on an assumption that if theGovernment offers in evidence in one prosecution acts ofmisconduct that might ultimately be charged as criminal of-fenses in a second prosecution, the latter prosecution isbarred under the Double Jeopardy Clause.But such an assumption is not supportable; our precedentshold that a mere overlap in proof between two prosecutionsdoes not establish a double jeopardy violation. The Courtof Appeals relied on the above-quoted language from ouropinion in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S., at 521, in reaching itsresult. But we think that this is an extravagant reading ofGrady, which disclaimed any intention of adopting a " `sameevidence' " test. Id., at 521, and n. 12; accord, Gavieres v.United States, 220 U. S. 338 (1911). Our decision two Termsago in Dowling v. United States, 493 U. S. 342 (1990), driveshome this point.In that case, Dowling was charged with bank robbery. Tohelp prove his identity at trial, the Government introducedevidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) concerningthe unrelated robbery of a woman named Vena Henry. Shetestified that she had been robbed by a man wearing a knitted mask similar to the one used by the bank robber, andthat she had been able to identify the intruder as Dowlingafter unmasking him during a struggle. We upheld the introduction of Henry's testimony at the bank robbery trial,despite the fact that Dowling had previously been acquittedof the Henry charges. The primary ruling of that case wasour conclusion that the collateral-estoppel component of theDouble Jeopardy Clause offered Dowling no protection despite his earlier acquittal, because the relevance of evidenceoffered under Rule 404(b) was governed by a lower standardof proof than that required for a conviction. See 493 U. S.,at 348-349 (citing Huddleston v. United States, 485 U. S. 681,503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT387Cite as: 503 U. S. 378 (1992)Opinion of the Court689 (1988)). But it is clear that we would not have had toreach the collateral-estoppel question if the mere introduction, pursuant to Rule 404(b), of evidence concerning theHenry robbery constituted a second prosecution of thatcrime for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. Under-lying our approval of the Henry evidence inDowling is anendorsement of the basic, yet important, principle that theintroduction of relevant evidence of particular misconduct ina case is not the same thing as prosecution for that conduct.3That principle is clearly applicable here. At the Missouritrial, the Government did not in any way prosecute Felixfor the Oklahoma methamphetamine transactions; it simplyintroduced those transactions as prior acts evidence underRule 404(b). The Government was therefore free to prose-cute Felix in the trial below for the substantive drug crimesdetailed in counts 2 through 6.IIIWe next examine whether the Court of Appeals erred inholding that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars the prosecution of Felix for the conspiracy charge contained in count 1of the indictment. Here, too, that court--with considerable3 There is an obvious distinction between Dowling and this case, but onethat makes no difference for purposes of our analysis here. In Dowling,the defendant was first prosecuted for the Henry robbery, and evidenceconcerning that robbery was subsequently admitted for Rule 404(b) purposes at a second prosecution. In this case, evidence of the Oklahomadrug transactions was first admitted for Rule 404(b) purposes at the Missouri trial, and Felix was subsequently prosecuted for the Oklahoma drugtransactions. The first situation might raise collateral-estoppel concernsas a result of an initial acquittal, concerns we confronted in Dowling, whilethe latter situation would not. But both situations would be equally affected by a rule that the admission of evidence concerning a crime underRule 404(b) constitutes prosecution for that crime; under such a rule, theDouble Jeopardy Clause would have barred the subsequent admission ofthe Henry evidence in Dowling, and it would bar the subsequent prosecution of the Oklahoma drug crimes in this case. We decline to adopt sucha rule.503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT388 UNITED STATES v. FELIXOpinion of the Courtjustification--relied upon language from our Grady opinionto support its conclusion. There is no doubt that the conspiracy charge presents a more difficult question than thesubstantive drug offenses dealt with in Part II above, because with respect to it there exists more than a mere overlap in evidence. Of the nine overt acts supporting the con-spiracy charge against Felix, two were based on the conductfor which he had been previously prosecuted in Missouri.But we hold that because of long established precedent inthis area, which was not questioned in Grady, Felix's claimof double jeopardy fails.Felix contends, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that language from Grady bars the conspiracy prosecution. Therewe said that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a prosecutionwhere the Government, "to establish an essential element ofan offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conductthat constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." 495 U. S., at 521. Taken out ofcontext, and read literally, this language supports the defense of double jeopardy. But we decline to read the language so expansively, because of the context in which Gradyarose and because of difficulties which have already arisenin its interpretation.Grady involved a defendant who had driven his car acrossthe median line of a two-way highway and struck an oncoming car, killing one of the occupants. The State charged thedefendant with driving while intoxicated and with failing tokeep right of the median, and the defendant pleaded guiltyto those two traffic violations. Two months later, the Stateprosecuted the defendant on homicide and assault chargesarising from the accident, and the defendant argued that thiswas a violation of his rights under the Double JeopardyClause. In our decision, we recognized our previous holdings that the traditional Blockburger test governing doublejeopardy claims bars a subsequent prosecution if one of thetwo offenses is a lesser included offense of the other. See503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT389Cite as: 503 U. S. 378 (1992)Opinion of the CourtGrady v. Corbin, supra, at 519 (citing Brown v. Ohio, 432U. S. 161 (1977);Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977)).Although the traffic offenses involved in Grady were nottechnically lesser included offenses of the homicide and assault charges, we analogized the case to the situation wehad previously confronted in Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410(1980). There, the State sought to prosecute the defendantfor involuntary manslaughter after a car accident. Westated, in dicta, that if the State found it necessary to relyon a previous failure to reduce speed conviction to sustainthe manslaughter charge, the Double Jeopardy Clause mightprotect the defendant. See id., at 420. Despite the factthat neither offense was technically a lesser included offenseof the other, we observed that, in such a circumstance, thefailure to slow offense might be viewed as a "species oflesser-included offense." Ibid. In Grady, the State soughtto rely on the two previous traffic offense convictions tosustain the homicide and assault charges, presenting thesituation about which we had speculated in Vitale. In concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the subsequent homicide and assault prosecutions, we simply adoptedthe suggestion we had previously made in dicta in Vitale.Grady v. Corbin, supra, at 521.But long antedating any of these cases, and not questionedin any of them, is the rule that a substantive crime and aconspiracy to commit that crime are not the "same offence"for double jeopardy purposes.For example, in United States v. Bayer, 331 U. S. 532(1947), a military officer had been convicted in court-martialproceedings of discrediting the military service by acceptingpayments in return for transferring soldiers to noncombatunits. We held that his subsequent prosecution in federalcourt on charges of conspiring to defraud the Government ofhis faithful services was not barred by the Double JeopardyClause, despite the fact that it was based on the same underlying incidents, because the "essence" of a conspiracy offense503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT390 UNITED STATES v. FELIXOpinion of the Court"is in the agreement or confederation to commit a crime."Id., at 542. In language applicable here, we pointedly statedthat "the same overt acts charged in a conspiracy count mayalso be charged and proved as substantive offenses, for theagreement to do the act is distinct from the act itself."Ibid.; see also Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U. S. 640, 643(1946) ("[T]he commission of the substantive offense and aconspiracy to commit it are separate and distinct offenses . . .[a]nd the plea of double jeopardy is no defense to a convictionfor both offenses"). We have continued to recognize thisprinciple over the years. SeeIannelli v. United States, 420U. S. 770, 777-779 (1975); Garrett v. United States, 471 U. S.773, 778 (1985) ("[C]onspiracy is a distinct offense from thecompleted object of the conspiracy"); cf. id., at 793 ("[I]t doesnot violate the Double Jeopardy Clause . . . to prosecute [acontinuing criminal enterprise] offense after a prior conviction for one of the predicate offenses").In a related context, we recently cautioned against "readytransposition of the `lesser included offense' principles ofdouble jeopardy from the classically simple situation presented in Brown [v. Ohio] to the multilayered conduct, bothas to time and to place, involved in [continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) prosecutions]." Id., at 789. The great majority of conspiracy prosecutions involve similar allegationsof multilayered conduct as to time and place; the conspiracycharge against Felix is a perfect example. Reliance on thelesser included offense analysis, however useful in the context of a "single course of conduct," is therefore much lesshelpful in analyzing subsequent conspiracy prosecutions thatare supported by previously prosecuted overt acts, just asit falls short in examining CCE offenses that are based onpreviously prosecuted predicate acts. Id., at 788-789.Faced with the necessity of reconciling this longstandingauthority with our language in Grady, we choose to adhereto the Bayer-Pinkerton line of cases dealing with the distinction between conspiracy to commit an offense and the503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT391Cite as: 503 U. S. 378 (1992)Opinion of the Courtoffense itself. These are separate offenses for double jeop-ardy purposes. The majority in the Court of Appeals belowessentially read Grady as substituting for the "same offence"language of the Double Jeopardy Clause a test based onwhether the two prosecutions involve the "same conduct."The dissenting judge in the Court of Appeals thought thatthis was an oversimplification, pointing to the fact that theword "conduct" in the previously quoted sentence fromGrady is modified by the phrase " `that constitutes an offensefor which the defendant has already been prosecuted.' " 926F. 2d, at 1532 (Anderson, J., dissenting) (quotingGrady v.Corbin, 495 U. S., at 521). The Court of Appeals for theSecond Circuit, in United States v. Calderone, 917 F. 2d 717(1990), upheld a claim of double jeopardy by a divided vote,with each judge on the panel writing an opinion interpretingthe crucial language from Grady differently. That court decided that the "conduct" at issue in a conspiracy prosecutionis not the agreement itself, but the conduct from which theGovernment asks the jury to infer that there was an agreement. 917 F. 2d, at 721. Judge Newman filed a concurringopinion, concluding that Grady bars a subsequent prosecution only when previously prosecuted conduct will be usedto establish the entirety of an element of the second crime.See 917 F. 2d, at 723-725 (Newman, J., concurring). OtherCourts of Appeals, as described in more detail in n. 2, supra,have rejected double jeopardy claims in similar situations.It appears that while Grady eschewed a "same evidence"test and Garrett rejected a " `single transaction' " test, Garrett v. United States, supra, at 790, the line between thosetests and the "same conduct" language of Grady is not easyto discern.We think it best not to enmesh in such subtleties the established doctrine that a conspiracy to commit a crime is a separate offense from the crime itself. Thus, in this case, theconspiracy charge against Felix was an offense distinct fromany crime for which he had been previously prosecuted, and503us2$52H 11-14-95 17:55:23 PAGES OPINPGT392 UNITED STATES v. FELIXOpinion of Stevens, J.the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar his prosecution onthat charge.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly
