The Court of Appeals forthe Ninth Circuit reversed the conviction of respondents forviolation of this Act.

Undercover police posed as pornography retailers andtargeted X-Citement Video for investigation. During thecourse of the sting operation, the media exposed Traci Lordsfor her roles in pornographic films while under the age of18. Police Officer Steven Takeshita expressed an interest inobtaining Traci Lords tapes. Gottesman complied, sellingTakeshita 49 videotapes featuring Lords before her 18thbirthday. Two months later, Gottesman shipped eight tapesof the underage Traci Lords to Takeshita in Hawaii.These two transactions formed the basis for a federal indictment under the child pornography statute.

The NinthCircuit remanded to the District Court for reconsiderationin light of United States v. Thomas, 893 F. 2d 1066 (CA9),cert. denied, 498 U. S. 826 (1990). In that case, the NinthCircuit had held $ 2252 did not contain a scienter requirement, but had not reached the constitutional questions. Onremand, the District Court refused to set aside the judgmentof conviction.On appeal for the second time, Gottesman reiterated hisconstitutional arguments. This time, the court reached themerits of his claims and, by a divided vote, found $ 2252 facially unconstitutional. The court first held that 18 U. S. C.$ 2256 met constitutional standards in setting the age ofmajority at age 18, substituting lascivious for lewd, andprohibiting actual or simulated bestiality and sadistic ormasochistic abuse. 982 F. 2d 1285, 1288-1289 (CA9 1992).It then discussed $ 2252, noting it was bound by its conclusionin Thomas to construe the Act as lacking a scienter requirement for the age of minority. The court concluded that caselaw from this Court required that the defendant must haveknowledge at least of the nature and character of the materials. 982 F. 2d, at 1290, citing Smith v. California, 361U. S. 147 (1959); New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747 (1982); andHamling v. United States, 418 U. S. 87 (1974). The courtextended these cases to hold that the First Amendment requires that the defendant possess knowledge of the particular fact that one performer had not reached the age ofmajority at the time the visual depiction was produced. 982F. 2d, at 1291. Because the court found the statute did notrequire such a showing, it reversed respondents' convictions.We granted certiorari, 510 U. S. 1163 (1994), and nowreverse.Title 18 U. S. C. $ 2252 (1988 ed. and Supp. V) provides, inrelevant part:513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT68 UNITED STATES v. X-CITEMENT VIDEO, INC.Opinion of the Court"(a) Any person who--"(1) knowingly transports or ships in interstate orforeign commerce by any means including by computeror mails, any visual depiction, if--"(A) the producing of such visual depiction involvesthe use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and"(B) such visual depiction is of such conduct;"(2) knowingly receives, or distributes, any visual depiction that has been mailed, or has been shipped ortransported in interstate or foreign commerce, or whichcontains materials which have been mailed or so shippedor transported, by any means including by computer, orknowingly reproduces any visual depiction for distribution in interstate or foreign commerce or through themails, if--"(A) the producing of such visual depiction involvesthe use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and"(B) such visual depiction is of such conduct;. . . . ."shall be punished as provided in subsection (b) of thissection."The critical determination which we must make is whetherthe term "knowingly" in subsections (1) and (2) modifies thephrase "the use of a minor" in subsections (1)(A) and (2)(A).The most natural grammatical reading, adopted by the NinthCircuit, suggests that the term "knowingly" modifies onlythe surrounding verbs: transports, ships, receives, distributes, or reproduces. Under this construction, the word"knowingly" would not modify the elements of the minorityof the performers, or the sexually explicit nature of the material, because they are set forth in independent clauses separated by interruptive punctuation. But we do not thinkthis is the end of the matter, both because of anomalies which513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT69Cite as: 513 U. S. 64 (1994)Opinion of the Courtresult from this construction, and because of the respectivepresumptions that some form of scienter is to be implied ina criminal statute even if not expressed, and that a statuteis to be construed where fairly possible so as to avoid substantial constitutional questions.If the term "knowingly" applies only to the relevant verbsin $ 2252--transporting, shipping, receiving, distributing,and reproducing--we would have to conclude that Congresswished to distinguish between someone who knowinglytransported a particular package of film whose contents wereunknown to him, and someone who unknowingly transportedthat package. It would seem odd, to say the least, that Congress distinguished between someone who inadvertentlydropped an item into the mail without realizing it, and someone who consciously placed the same item in the mail, butwas nonetheless unconcerned about whether the person hadany knowledge of the prohibited contents of the package.Some applications of respondents' position would produceresults that were not merely odd, but positively absurd. Ifwe were to conclude that "knowingly" only modifies the relevant verbs in $ 2252, we would sweep within the ambit of thestatute actors who had no idea that they were even dealingwith sexually explicit material. For instance, a retail druggist who returns an uninspected roll of developed film to acustomer "knowingly distributes" a visual depiction andwould be criminally liable if it were later discovered thatthe visual depiction contained images of children engaged insexually explicit conduct. Or, a new resident of an apartment might receive mail for the prior resident and store themail unopened. If the prior tenant had requested deliveryof materials covered by $ 2252, his residential successor couldbe prosecuted for "knowing receipt" of such materials. Similarly, a Federal Express courier who delivers a box in whichthe shipper has declared the contents to be "film" "knowingly transports" such film. We do not assume that Congress, in passing laws, intended such results. Public Citi513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT70 UNITED STATES v. X-CITEMENT VIDEO, INC.Opinion of the Courtzen v. Department of Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 453-455 (1989);United States v. Turkette, 452 U. S. 576, 580 (1981).Our reluctance to simply follow the most grammaticalreading of the statute is heightened by our cases interpretingcriminal statutes to include broadly applicable scienter requirements, even where the statute by its terms does notcontain them. The landmark opinion inMorissette v.United States, 342 U. S. 246 (1952), discussed the common-law history ofmens rea as applied to the elements of thefederal embezzlement statute. That statute read: "Whoeverembezzles, steals, purloins, or knowingly converts to his useor the use of another, or without authority, sells, conveys ordisposes of any record, voucher, money, or thing of value ofthe United States . . . [s]hall be fined." 18 U. S. C. $ 641,cited in Morissette, 342 U. S., at 248, n. 2. Perhaps evenmore obviously than in the statute presently before us, theword "knowingly" in its isolated position suggested that itonly attached to the verb "converts," and required only thatthe defendant intentionally assume dominion over the property. But the Court used the background presumption ofevil intent to conclude that the term "knowingly" also required that the defendant have knowledge of the facts thatmade the taking a conversion--i. e., that the property belonged to the United States. Id., at 271. See also UnitedStates v. United States Gypsum Co., 438 U. S. 422, 438 (1978)("[F]ar more than the simple omission of the appropriatephrase from the statutory definition is necessary to justifydispensing with an intent requirement").Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985), posed achallenge to a federal statute prohibiting certain actionswith respect to food stamps. The statute's use of "knowingly" could be read only to modify "uses, transfers, acquires,alters, or possesses" or it could be read also to modify "inany manner not authorized by [the statute]." Noting thatneither interpretation posed constitutional problems, id., at424, n. 6, the Court held the scienter requirement applied to513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT71Cite as: 513 U. S. 64 (1994)Opinion of the Courtboth elements by invoking the background principle set forthinMorissette. In addition, the Court was concerned withthe broader reading which would "criminalize a broad rangeof apparently innocent conduct." 471 U. S., at 426. Imposing criminal liability on an unwitting food stamp recipientwho purchased groceries at a store that inflated its prices tosuch purchasers struck the Court as beyond the intendedreach of the statute.The same analysis drove the recent conclusion inStaplesv. United States, 511 U. S. 600 (1994), that to be criminallyliable a defendant must know that his weapon possessed automatic firing capability so as to make it a machinegun asdefined by the National Firearms Act. Congress had notexpressly imposed any mens rea requirement in the provision criminalizing the possession of a firearm in the absenceof proper registration. 26 U. S. C. $ 5861(d). The Courtfirst rejected the argument that the statute described a public welfare offense, traditionally excepted from the background principle favoring scienter. Morissette, supra, at255. The Court then expressed concern with a statutoryreading that would criminalize behavior that a defendant believed fell within "a long tradition of widespread lawful gunownership by private individuals." Staples, 511 U. S., at610. The Court also emphasized the harsh penalties attaching to violations of the statute as a "significant considerationin determining whether the statute should be construed asdispensing with mens rea." Id., at 616.Applying these principles, we think the Ninth Circuit'splain language reading of $ 2252 is not so plain. First, $ 2252is not a public welfare offense. Persons do not harbor settled expectations that the contents of magazines and film aregenerally subject to stringent public regulation. In fact,First Amendment constraints presuppose the opposite view.Rather, the statute is more akin to the common-law offensesagainst the "state, the person, property, or public morals,"Morissette, supra, at 255, that presume a scienter require513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT72 UNITED STATES v. X-CITEMENT VIDEO, INC.Opinion of the Courtment in the absence of express contrary intent.2 Second,Staples' concern with harsh penalties looms equally large respecting $ 2252: Violations are punishable by up to 10 yearsin prison as well as substantial fines and forfeiture. 18U. S. C. $$ 2252(b), 2253, 2254. See also Morissette, supra,at 260.Morissette, reinforced by Staples, instructs that the pre-sumption in favor of a scienter requirement should apply toeach of the statutory elements that criminalize otherwise in-nocent conduct.Staples held that the features of a gun astechnically described by the firearm registration Act wassuch an element. Its holding rested upon "the nature of theparticular device or substance Congress has subjected toregulation and the expectations that individuals may legiti-mately have in dealing with the regulated items."Staples,supra, at 619. Age of minority in $ 2252 indisputably possesses the same status as an elemental fact because nonob-scene, sexually explicit materials involving persons over theage of 17 are protected by the First Amendment. Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 549-550 (1993); SableCommunications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 126(1989); FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U. S. 215, 224 (1990);Smith v. California, 361 U. S., at 152.3 In the light of these2 Morissette's treatment of the common-law presumption of mens rearecognized that the presumption expressly excepted "sex offenses, suchas rape, in which the victim's actual age was determinative despite defendant's reasonable belief that the girl had reached age of consent." 342U. S., at 251, n. 8. But as in the criminalization of pornography production at 18 U. S. C. $ 2251, see infra, at 76, n. 5, the perpetrator confrontsthe underage victim personally and may reasonably be required to ascertain that victim's age. The opportunity for reasonable mistake as to ageincreases significantly once the victim is reduced to a visual depiction,unavailable for questioning by the distributor or receiver. Thus we donot think the common-law treatment of sex offenses militates against ourconstruction of the present statute.3 In this regard, age of minority is not a "jurisdictional fact" that enhances an offense otherwise committed with an evil intent. See, e. g.,United States v. Feola, 420 U. S. 671 (1975). There, the Court did not513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT73Cite as: 513 U. S. 64 (1994)Opinion of the Courtdecisions, one would reasonably expect to be free from regu-lation when trafficking in sexually explicit, though not obscene, materials involving adults. Therefore, the age of theperformers is the crucial element separating legal innocencefrom wrongful conduct.The legislative history of the statute evolved over a periodof years, and perhaps for that reason speaks somewhat indistinctly to the question whether "knowingly" in the statutemodifies the elements of subsections (1)(A) and (2)(A)--thatthe visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging insexually explicit conduct--or merely the verbs "transport orship" in subsection (1) and "receive or distribute . . . [or]reproduce" in subsection (2). In 1959, we held inSmith v.California, supra, that a California statute that dispensedwith any mens rea requirement as to the contents of an ob-scene book would violate the First Amendment.Id., at 154.When Congress began dealing with child pornography in1977, the content of the legislative debates suggest that itwas aware of this decision. See, e. g., 123 Cong. Rec. 30935(1977) ("It is intended that they have knowledge of the typeof material . . . proscribed by this bill. The legislative history should be clear on that so as to remove any chance itwill lead into constitutional problems"). Even if that werenot the case, we do not impute to Congress an intent to passlegislation that is inconsistent with the Constitution as construed by this Court. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298,319 (1957) ("In [construing the statute] we should not assumethat Congress chose to disregard a constitutional dangerzone so clearly marked"). When first passed, $ 2252 punrequire knowledge of "jurisdictional facts"--that the target of an assaultwas a federal officer. Criminal intent serves to separate those who understand the wrongful nature of their act from those who do not, but doesnot require knowledge of the precise consequences that may flow fromthat act once aware that the act is wrongful. Id., at 685. Cf. Hamlingv. United States, 418 U. S. 87, 120 (1974) (knowledge that the materials atissue are legally obscene not required).513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT74 UNITED STATES v. X-CITEMENT VIDEO, INC.Opinion of the Courtished one who "knowingly transports or ships in interstateor foreign commerce or mails, for the purpose of sale or distribution for sale, any obscene visual or print medium" if itinvolved the use of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Pub. L. 95-225, 92 Stat. 7 (emphasis added). Assum-ing awareness ofSmith, at a minimum, "knowingly" was in-tended to modify "obscene" in the 1978 version.In 1984, Congress amended the statute to its current form,broadening its application to those sexually explicit materials that, while not obscene as defined by Miller v. Califor-nia, 413 U. S. 15 (1973),4 could be restricted without violatingthe First Amendment as explained by New York v. Ferber,458 U. S. 747 (1982). When Congress eliminated the adjective "obscene," all of the elements defining the character andcontent of the materials at issue were relegated to subsections (1)(a) and (2)(a). In this effort to expand the child por-nography statute to its full constitutional limits, Congressnowhere expressed an intent to eliminate the mens rea re-quirement that had previously attached to the character andcontent of the material through the word obscene.The Committee Reports and legislative debate speak moreopaquely as to the desire of Congress for a scienter require-ment with respect to the age of minority. An early formof the proposed legislation, S. 2011, was rejected principallybecause it failed to distinguish between obscene and nonobscene materials. S. Rep. No. 95-438, p. 12 (1977). Inevaluating the proposal, the Justice Department offered itsthoughts:"[T]he word `knowingly' in the second line of section2251 is unnecessary and should be stricken. . . . Unless`knowingly' is deleted here, the bill might be subject toan interpretation requiring the Government to prove4 The Miller test for obscenity asks whether the work, taken as a whole,"appeals to the prurient interest," "depicts or describes [sexual conduct]in a patently offensive way," and "lacks serious literary, artistic, political,or scientific value." Miller, 413 U. S., at 24.513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT75Cite as: 513 U. S. 64 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe defendant's knowledge of everything that follows`knowingly', including the age of the child. We assumethat it is not the intention of the drafters to require theGovernment to prove that the defendant knew the childwas under age sixteen but merely to prove that the childwas, in fact, less than age sixteen. . . ."On the other hand, the use of the word `knowingly'in subsection 2252(a)(1) is appropriate to make it clearthat the bill does not apply to common carriers or otherinnocent transporters who have no knowledge of the na-ture or character of the material they are transporting.To clarify the situation, the legislative history might re-flect that the defendant's knowledge of the age of thechild is not an element of the offense but that the bill isnot intended to apply to innocent transportation withno knowledge of the nature or character of the materialinvolved." Id., at 28-29.Respondents point to this language as an unambiguous reve-lation that Congress omitted a scienter requirement. Butthe bill eventually reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted some, but not all, of the Department's sugges-tions; most notably, it restricted the prohibition in $ 2251 toobscene materials. Id., at 2. The Committee did not makeany clarification with respect to scienter as to the age ofminority. In fact, the version reported by the Committeeeliminated $ 2252 altogether.Ibid. At that juncture, Senator Roth introduced an amendment which would be anotherprecursor of $ 2252. In one paragraph, the amendment forbade any person to "knowingly transport [or] ship . . . [any]visual medium depicting a minor engaged in sexually explicitconduct." 123 Cong. Rec. 33047 (1977). In an exchangeduring debate, Senator Percy inquired:"Would this not mean that the distributor or seller musthave either, first, actual knowledge that the materialsdo contain child pornographic depictions or, second, cir513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT76 UNITED STATES v. X-CITEMENT VIDEO, INC.Opinion of the Courtcumstances must be such that he should have had suchactual knowledge, and that mere inadvertence or negligence would not alone be enough to render his actionsunlawful?" Id., at 33050.Senator Roth replied:"That is absolutely correct. This amendment, limitedas it is by the phrase `knowingly,' insures that only thosesellers and distributors who are consciously and deliber-ately engaged in the marketing of child pornography . . .are subject to prosecution . . . ." Ibid.The parallel House bill did not contain a comparable provi-sion to $ 2252 of the Senate bill, and limited $ 2251 prosecutions to obscene materials. The Conference Committeeadopted the substance of the Roth amendment in large part,but followed the House version by restricting the proscribeddepictions to obscene ones. The new bill did restructure the$ 2252 provision somewhat, setting off the age of minorityrequirement in a separate subclause. S. Conf. Rep. No. 95-601, p. 2 (1977). Most importantly, the new bill retained theadverb "knowingly" in $ 2252 while simultaneously deletingthe word "knowingly" from $ 2251(a). The Conference Com-mittee explained the deletion in $ 2251(a) as reflecting an "intent that it is not a necessary element of a prosecution thatthe defendant knew the actual age of the child." Id., at 5.5Respondents point to the appearance of "knowingly" in5 The difference in congressional intent with respect to $ 2251 versus$ 2252 reflects the reality that producers are more conveniently able toascertain the age of performers. It thus makes sense to impose the riskof error on producers. United States v. United States District Court forCentral District of California, 858 F. 2d 534, 543, n. 6 (CA9 1988). Although producers may be convicted under $ 2251(a) without proof they hadknowledge of age, Congress has independently required both primary andsecondary producers to record the ages of performers with independentpenalties for failure to comply. 18 U. S. C. $$ 2257(a) and (i) (1988 ed. andSupp. V); American Library Assn. v. Reno, 33 F. 3d 78 (CADC 1994).513us1$$6H 03-28-98 14:53:05 PAGES OPINPGT77Cite as: 513 U.

Respondents offer in support oftheir premise only the legislative history discussing an intentto exclude a scienter requirement from$ 2251(a). Because$$ 2251(a) and 2251(c) were passed at different times and contain different wording, the intent to exclude scienter from$ 2251(a) does not imply an intent to exclude scienter from$ 2251(c).6The legislative history can be summarized by saying thatit persuasively indicates that Congress intended that theterm "knowingly" apply to the requirement that the depiction be of sexually explicit conduct; it is a good deal less clearfrom the Committee Reports and floor debates that Congressintended that the requirement extend also to the age of theperformers. But, turning once again to the statute itself, ifthe term "knowingly" applies to the sexually explicit conductdepicted, it is emancipated from merely modifying the verbsin subsections (1) and (2). And as a matter of grammar it is6 Congress amended $ 2251 to insert subsection (c) in 1986. Pub. L. 99-628, 100 Stat. 3510. That provision created new offenses relating to theadvertising of the availability of child pornography or soliciting childrento participate in such depictions. The legislative history of $ 2251(c) doesaddress the scienter requirement: "The government must prove that thedefendant knew the character of the visual depictions as depicting a minorengaging in sexually explicit conduct, but need not prove that the defendant actually knew the person depicted was in fact under 18 years of ageor that the depictions violated Federal law." H. R. Rep. No. 99-910, p. 6(1986). It may be argued that since the House Committee Report rejectsany requirement of scienter as to the age of minority for $ 2251(c), theHouse Committee thought that there was no such requirement in $ 2252.But the views of one Congress as to the meaning of an Act passed by anearlier Congress are not ordinarily of great weight, United States v. Clark,445 U. S. 23, 33, n. 9 (1980), citing United States v. Southwestern CableCo., 392 U. S. 157, 170 (1968), and the views of the committee of one Houseof another Congress are of even less weight, Pierce v. Underwood, 487U.

X-CITEMENT VIDEO, INC.Opinion of the Courtdifficult to conclude that the word "knowingly" modifies oneof the elements in subsections (1)(A) and (2)(A), but not theother.A final canon of statutory construction supports the reading that the term "knowingly" applies to both elements.Cases such as Ferber, 458 U. S., at 765 ("As with obscenitylaws, criminal responsibility may not be imposed withoutsome element of scienter on the part of the defendant");Smith v. California, 361 U. S. 147 (1959); Hamling v. UnitedStates, 418 U. S. 87 (1974); and Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U. S.103, 115 (1990), suggest that a statute completely bereft of ascienter requirement as to the age of the performers wouldraise serious constitutional doubts. It is therefore incumbent upon us to read the statute to eliminate those doubtsso long as such a reading is not plainly contrary to the intentof Congress. Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida GulfCoast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568,575 (1988).For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the term"knowingly" in $ 2252 extends both to the sexually explicitnature of the material and to the age of the performers.As an alternative grounds for upholding the reversal oftheir convictions, respondents reiterate their constitutionalchallenge to 18 U. S. C. $ 2256. These claims were not encompassed in the question on which this Court granted certiorari, but a prevailing party, without cross-petitioning, is"entitled under our precedents to urge any grounds whichwould lend support to the judgment below." Dayton Bd. ofEd. v. Brinkman, 433 U. S. 406, 419 (1977). Respondentsargue that $ 2256 is unconstitutionally vague and overbroadbecause it makes the age of majority 18, rather than 16 asdid the New York statute upheld in New York v. Ferber,supra, and because Congress replaced the term "lewd" withthe term "lascivious" in defining illegal exhibition of the genitals of children.

The Court of Appeals did notreach this issue because of its determination that $ 2252 wasunconstitutional on its face, and we decline to decide it here.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is
