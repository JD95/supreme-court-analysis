S. 255 (1999)Opinion of the Courtcontractor, the subcontractor sought to collect directly fromthe Army by asserting an equitable lien on certain fundsheld by the Army. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that $ 10(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act(APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 702, waived the Government's immunityfor the subcontractor's claim. We hold that $ 702 did notnullify the long settled rule that sovereign immunity barscreditors from enforcing liens on Government property.Participating in a business development program for socially and economically disadvantaged firms run by the SmallBusiness Administration (SBA), the Department of theArmy contracted with Verdan Technology, Inc., in September 1993, to install a telephone switching system at an Armydepot in Umatilla, Oregon. Verdan, in turn, employed respondent Blue Fox, Inc., as a subcontractor on the project toconstruct a concrete block building to house the telephonesystem and to install certain safety and support systems.Under the Miller Act, 40 U. S. C. $$ 270a-270d, a contractor that performs "construction, alteration, or repair of anypublic building or public work of the United States" generally must post two types of bonds. $ 270a(a). First, thecontractor must post a "performance bond . . . for the protection of the United States" against defaults by the contractor.$ 270a(a)(1). Second, the contractor must post a "paymentbond . . . for the protection of all persons supplying labor andmaterial." $ 270a(a)(2). The Miller Act gives the subcontractors and other suppliers "the right to sue on such payment bond for the amount, or the balance thereof, unpaidat the time of institution of such suit and to prosecute saidaction to final execution and judgment for the sum or sumsjustly due him." $ 270b(a). Although the Army's originalsolicitation in this case required the contractor to furnishpayment and performance bonds if the contract price exceeded $25,000, the Army later amended the solicitation,treated the contract as a "services contract," and deleted525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN258 DEPARTMENT OF ARMY v. BLUE FOX, INC.Opinion of the Courtthe bond requirements. Verdan therefore did not post anyMiller Act bonds.Blue Fox performed its obligations, but Verdan failed topay it the $46,586.14 that remained due on the subcontract.After receiving notices from Blue Fox that it had not beenfully paid, the Army nonetheless disbursed a total of$86,132.33 to Verdan as payment for all work that Verdanhad completed. In January 1995, the Army terminated itscontract with Verdan for various defaults and another con-tractor completed the Umatilla project. Blue Fox obtaineda default judgment in tribal court against Verdan. Seeingthat it could not collect from Verdan or its officers, it suedthe Army for the balance due on its contract with Verdan inFederal District Court.1Predicating jurisdiction on 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 and the APA,Blue Fox sought an "equitable lien" on any funds from theVerdan contract not paid to Verdan, or any funds availableor appropriated for completion of the Umatilla project, andan order directing payment of those funds to it. Blue Foxalso sought an injunction preventing the Army from payingany more money on the Verdan contract or on the follow-oncontract until Blue Fox was paid. By the time of the suit,however, the Army had paid all amounts due on the Verdancontract, Blue Fox failed to obtain any preliminary relief,and the Army subsequently paid the replacement contractorthe funds remaining on the Verdan contract plus additionalfunds.21 Although Blue Fox also named the SBA as a defendant, the DistrictCourt granted summary judgment in the SBA's favor, the Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, and Blue Fox has not challenged that ruling.2 The Army paid the replacement contractor, in part, with the fundsfrom the undisbursed balance on the Verdan contract (approximately$85,000) which had been designated for certain work that Verdan failedto complete. No funds due to Verdan for work actually performed hadbeen held back or retained by the Army. The Army paid the replacementcontractor in July 1995, two months after Blue Fox filed its action againstthe Army in the District Court.525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN259Cite as: 525 U. S. 255 (1999)Opinion of the CourtOn cross-motions for summary judgment, the DistrictCourt held that the waiver of sovereign immunity providedby the APA did not apply to respondent's claim against theArmy. The District Court thus concluded that it did nothave jurisdiction over respondent's claim and accordinglygranted the Army's motion for summary judgment. In asplit decision, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitreversed in relevant part. See Blue Fox Inc. v. Small Business Admin., 121 F. 3d 1357 (1997). The majority held thatunder this Court's decision in Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487U. S. 879 (1988), the APA waives immunity for equitable actions. Based in part on its analysis of several of our casesexamining a surety's right of subrogation, the majority heldthat the APA had waived the Army's immunity from BlueFox's suit to recover the amount withheld by the Army.The majority concluded that the lien attached to funds retained by the Army but owed to Verdan at the time theArmy received Blue Fox's notice that Verdan had failed topay. The majority stated that "[t]he Army cannot escapeBlue Fox's equitable lien by wrongly paying out funds to theprime contractor when it had notice of Blue Fox's unpaidclaims." 121 F. 3d, at 1363.The dissenting judge stated that "no matter how you sliceBlue Fox's claim, it seeks funds from the treasury to compensate for the Army's failure to require Verdan to post a bond."Id., at 1364 (opinion of Rymer, J.). In her view, Congresschose to protect subcontractors like Blue Fox through thebond requirements of the Miller Act, not by waiving immunity in the APA to permit subcontractors to sue theUnited States directly for amounts owed to them by theprime contractor. Because this rule has been "conventionalwisdom for at least fifty years," she did not agree that Congress had waived the Army's sovereign immunity from BlueFox's suit. Ibid. The Government petitioned for review,and we granted certiorari to decide whether the APA has525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN260 DEPARTMENT OF ARMY v. BLUE FOX, INC.Opinion of the Courtwaived the Government's immunity from suits to enforce anequitable lien. 524 U. S. 951 (1998)."Absent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the FederalGovernment and its agencies from suit." FDIC v. Meyer,510 U. S. 471, 475 (1994). Congress, of course, has waivedits immunity for a wide range of suits, including those thatseek traditional money damages. Examples are the FederalTort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2671et seq., and the TuckerAct, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491.3 They are not involved here. Respondent sued the Army under $ 10(a) of the APA, whichprovides in relevant part:"A person suffering legal wrong because of agency ac-tion, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency actionwithin the meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled tojudicial review thereof. An action in a court of theUnited States seeking relief other than money damagesand stating a claim that an agency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacityor under color of legal authority shall not be dismissednor relief therein be denied on the ground that it isagainst the United States or that the United States is anindispensable party." 5 U. S. C. $ 702 (emphasis added).Respondent asks us to hold, as did the court below, that thisprovision, which waives the Government's immunity from3 The Federal Tort Claims Act provides that, subject to certain exceptions, "[t]he United States shall be liable, respecting the provisions of thistitle relating to tort claims, in the same manner and to the same extent asa private individual under like circumstances." 28 U.

TheTucker Act grants the Court of Claims jurisdiction "to render judgmentupon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States,or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort."28 U. S. C. $ 1491(a)(1). The Tucker Act also gives federal district courtsconcurrent jurisdiction over claims founded upon the same substantivegrounds for relief but not exceeding $10,000 in damages. See $ 1346(a)(2).525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN261Cite as: 525 U. S. 255 (1999)Opinion of the Courtactions seeking relief "other than money damages," allowssubcontractors to place liens on funds held by the UnitedStates Government for work completed on a prime contract.We have frequently held, however, that a waiver of sovereignimmunity is to be strictly construed, in terms of its scope,in favor of the sovereign. See, e. g., Lane v. Pen~ a, 518 U. S.187, 192 (1996) (citing cases);Library of Congress v. Shaw,478 U. S. 310, 318 (1986). Such a waiver must also be"unequivocally expressed" in the statutory text. SeeLane,supra, at 192. Respondent's claim must therefore meet thishigh standard.Respondent argues, and the court below held, that ouranalysis of $ 702 in Bowen compels the allowance of respondent's lien. We disagree. In Bowen, we examined the textand legislative history of $ 702 to determine whether theCommonwealth of Massachusetts could sue the Secretary ofHealth and Human Services to enforce a provision of theMedicaid Act that required the payment of certain amountsto the State for Medicaid services. We held that the State'scomplaint in Bowen was not barred by the APA's prohibitionon suits for money damages. The Court of Appeals belowread our decision in Bowen as interpreting $ 702's referenceto "other than money damages" as waiving immunity fromall actions that are equitable in nature. See 121 F. 3d, at1361 ("Since the APA waives immunity for equitable actions,the district court had jurisdiction under the APA").Bowen's analysis of $ 702, however, did not turn on distinctions between "equitable" actions and other actions, norcould such a distinction have driven the Court's analysis inlight of $ 702's language. As Bowen recognized, the crucialquestion under $ 702 is not whether a particular claim forrelief is "equitable" (a term found nowhere in $ 702), butrather what Congress meant by "other than money damages"(the precise terms of $ 702). Bowen held that Congress employed this language to distinguish between specific reliefand compensatory, or substitute, relief. The Court stated:525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN262 DEPARTMENT OF ARMY v. BLUE FOX, INC.Opinion of the Court" `We begin with the ordinary meaning of the wordsCongress employed. The term "money damages," 5U. S. C. $ 702, we think, normally refers to a sum ofmoney used as compensatory relief. Damages aregiven to the plaintiff to substitute for a suffered loss,whereas specific remedies "are not substitute remedies at all, but attempt to give the plaintiff the verything to which he was entitled." ' " 487 U. S., at 895(quoting Maryland Dept. of Human Resources v. Department of Health and Human Services, 763 F. 2d1441, 1446 (CADC 1985) (citation omitted)).Bowen also concluded from its analysis of relevant legislativehistory that "the drafters had in mind the time-honored distinction between damages and specific relief." 487 U. S.,at 897. Bowen's interpretation of $ 702 thus hinged on thedistinction between specific relief and substitute relief, notbetween equitable and nonequitable categories of remedies.We accordingly applied this interpretation of $ 702 to theState's suit to overturn a decision by the Secretary disallowing reimbursement under the Medicaid Act. We held thatthe State's suit was not one "seeking money incompensationfor the damage sustained by the failure of the Federal Government to pay as mandated; rather, it [was] a suit seekingto enforce the statutory mandate itself, which happens tobe one for the payment of money." Id., at 900. The Courttherefore concluded that the substance of the State's suit wasone for specific relief, not money damages, and hence the suitfell within $ 702's waiver of immunity.It is clear from Bowen that the equitable nature of the liensought by respondent here does not mean that its ultimateclaim was not one for "money damages" within the meaningof $ 702. Liens, whether equitable or legal, are merely ameans to the end of satisfying a claim for the recovery ofmoney. Indeed, equitable liens by their nature constitutesubstitute or compensatory relief rather than specific relief.An equitable lien does not "give the plaintiff the very thing525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN263Cite as: 525 U. S. 255 (1999)Opinion of the Courtto which he was entitled," id., at 895 (citations and internalquotation marks omitted); instead, it merely grants a plaintiff "a security interest in the property, which [the plaintiff]can then use to satisfy a money claim," usually a claim forunjust enrichment, 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies $ 4.3(3),p. 601 (2d ed. 1993); see also Laycock, The Scope and Signifi-cance of Restitution, 67 Texas L. Rev. 1277, 1290 (1989) ("Theequitable lien is a hybrid, granting a money judgment andsecuring its collection with a lien on the specific thing").Commentators have warned not to view equitable liens asanything more than substitute relief:"[T]he form of the remedy requires that [a] lien orcharge should be established, and then enforced, andthe amount due obtained by a sale total or partial ofthe fund, or by a sequestration of its rents, profits, andproceeds. These preliminary steps may, on a casualview, be misleading as to the nature of the remedy,and may cause it to appear to be something more thancompensatory; but a closer view shows that all thesesteps are merely auxiliary, and that thereal remedy, thefinal object of the proceeding, is the pecuniary recovery."1 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence $ 112, p. 148 (5thed. 1941).See also Dobbs, supra, at 601 (equitable lien foreclosure"results in only a monetary payment to the plaintiff and ob-viously does not carry with it the advantages of recoveringspecific property").We accordingly hold that the sort of equitable lien soughtby respondent here constitutes a claim for "money damages";its goal is to seize or attach money in the hands of theGovernment as compensation for the loss resulting fromthe default of the prime contractor. As a form of substitute and not specific relief, respondent's action to enforcean equitable lien falls outside of $ 702's waiver of sovereignimmunity.525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN264 DEPARTMENT OF ARMY v. BLUE FOX, INC.Opinion of the CourtOur holding today is in accord with our precedent estab-lishing that sovereign immunity bars creditors from attaching or garnishing funds in the Treasury, see Buchanan v.Alexander, 4 How. 20 (1845), or enforcing liens against property owned by the United States, see United States v. Ansonia Brass & Copper Co., 218 U. S. 452, 471 (1910); UnitedStates ex rel. Hill v. American Surety Co. of N. Y., 200 U. S.197, 203 (1906) ("As against the United States, no lien can beprovided upon its public buildings or grounds"). Respondent points to nothing in the text or history of $ 702 thatsuggests that Congress intended to overrule this precedent,let alone anything that " `unequivocally express[es]' " suchan intent. Lane, 518 U. S., at 192.Instead, recognizing that sovereign immunity left subcontractors and suppliers without a remedy against the Government when the general contractor became insolvent, Congress enacted the Miller Act (and its predecessor the HeardAct) to protect these workers. See United States v. MunseyTrust Co., 332 U. S. 234, 241 (1947); Ansonia Brass & CopperCo., supra, at 471. But the Miller Act by its terms onlygives subcontractors the right to sue on the surety bondposted by the prime contractor, not the right to recover theirlosses directly from the Government.Respondent contends that in several cases examining asurety's right of equitable subrogation, this Court suggested that subcontractors and suppliers can seek compensation directly against the Government. See, e. g., PrairieState Bank v. United States, 164 U. S. 227 (1896); Henningsen v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. of Baltimore,208 U. S. 404, 410 (1908); Pearlman v. Reliance Ins. Co., 371U. S. 132, 141 (1962) (stating that "the laborers and materialmen had a right to be paid out of the fund [retained by theGovernment]" and hence a surety was subrogated to thisright); but see Munsey Trust Co., supra, at 241 ("[N]othingis more clear than that laborers and materialmen do not haveenforceable rights against the United States for their com525US2 Unit: $U16 [10-23-00 13:26:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN265Cite as: 525 U. S. 255 (1999)Opinion of the Courtpensation"). None of the cases relied upon by respondentinvolved a question of sovereign immunity, and, in fact, noneinvolved a subcontractor directly asserting a claim againstthe Government. Instead, these cases dealt with disputesbetween private parties over priority to funds which hadbeen transferred out of the Treasury and as to which theGovernment had disclaimed any ownership. They do notin any way disturb the established rule that, unless waivedby Congress, sovereign immunity bars subcontractors andother creditors from enforcing liens on Government propertyor funds to recoup their losses.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
