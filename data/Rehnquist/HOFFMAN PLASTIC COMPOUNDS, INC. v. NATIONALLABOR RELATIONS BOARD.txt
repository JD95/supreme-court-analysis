The National Labor Relations Board (Board) awardedbackpay to an undocumented alien who has never been legally authorized to work in the United States. We hold thatsuch relief is foreclosed by federal immigration policy, as expressed by Congress in the Immigration Reform and ControlAct of 1986 (IRCA).Petitioner Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. (petitioner orHoffman), custom-formulates chemical compounds for businesses that manufacture pharmaceutical, construction, andhousehold products. In May 1988, petitioner hired JoseCastro to operate various blending machines that "mix andcook" the particular formulas per customer order. Beforebeing hired for this position, Castro presented documentsthat appeared to verify his authorization to work in theUnited States. In December 1988, the United Rubber,Cork, Linoleum, and Plastic Workers of America, AFL-CIO,began a union-organizing campaign at petitioner's productionplant. Castro and several other employees supported theorganizing campaign and distributed authorization cards toco-workers. In January 1989, Hoffman laid off Castro andother employees engaged in these organizing activities.Three years later, in January 1992, respondent Boardfound that Hoffman unlawfully selected four employees, in-cluding Castro, for layoff "in order to rid itself of knownunion supporters" in violation of $ 8(a)(3) of the NationalLabor Relations Act (NLRA).1 306 N. L. R. B. 100. Toremedy this violation, the Board ordered that Hoffman(1) cease and desist from further violations of the NLRA,(2) post a detailed notice to its employees regarding the re-medial order, and (3) offer reinstatement and backpay to the1 Section 8(a)(3) of the NLRA prohibits discrimination "in regard to hireor tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization." 49 Stat.452, as added, 61 Stat. 140, 29 U.

Hoffman enteredinto a stipulation with the Board's General Counsel andagreed to abide by the Board's order.In June 1993, the parties proceeded to a compliance hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to determinethe amount of backpay owed to each discriminatee. On thefinal day of the hearing, Castro testified that he was born inMexico and that he had never been legally admitted to, orauthorized to work in, the United States. 314 N. L. R. B.683, 685 (1994). He admitted gaining employment withHoffman only after tendering a birth certificate belonging toa friend who was born in Texas. Ibid. He also admittedthat he used this birth certificate to fraudulently obtain aCalifornia driver's license and a Social Security card, and tofraudulently obtain employment following his layoff by Hoffman. Ibid. Neither Castro nor the Board's General Counsel offered any evidence that Castro had applied or intendedto apply for legal authorization to work in the United States.Ibid. Based on this testimony, the ALJ found the Boardprecluded from awarding Castro backpay or reinstatementas such relief would be contrary to Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB,467 U. S. 883 (1984), and in conflict with IRCA, which makesit unlawful for employers knowingly to hire undocumentedworkers or for employees to use fraudulent documentsto establish employment eligibility. 314 N. L. R. B., at685-686.In September 1998, four years after the ALJ's decision,and nine years after Castro was fired, the Board reversedwith respect to backpay. 326 N. L. R. B. 1060. Citing itsearlier decision in A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil Buyers Group, Inc.,320 N. L. R. B. 408 (1995), the Board determined that "themost effective way to accommodate and further the immigration policies embodied in [IRCA] is to provide the protections and remedies of the [NLRA] to undocumented workersin the same manner as to other employees." 326 N. L. R. B.,at 1060. The Board thus found that Castro was entitled to535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN142 HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v.

It calculatedthis backpay award from the date of Castro's termination tothe date Hoffman first learned of Castro's undocumented sta-tus, a period of 41/2 years. Id., at 1061. A dissenting Boardmember would have affirmed the ALJ and denied Castro allbackpay. Id., at 1062 (opinion of Hurtgen).Hoffman filed a petition for review of the Board's orderin the Court of Appeals. A panel of the Court of Appealsdenied the petition for review. 208 F. 3d 229 (CADC 2000).After rehearing the case en banc, the court again denied thepetition for review and enforced the Board's order. 237F. 3d 639 (2001). We granted certiorari, 533 U.

Seven-UpBottling Co. of Miami, Inc., 344 U. S. 344, 346-347 (1953), is2 The Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether theBoard may award backpay to undocumented workers. Compare NLRBv.

Bildisco & Bil-disco, 465 U. S. 513, 532-534 (1984); Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB,supra, at 902-904. Since the Board's inception, we haveconsistently set aside awards of reinstatement or backpayto employees found guilty of serious illegal conduct inconnection with their employment. InFansteel, the Boardawarded reinstatement with backpay to employees who engaged in a "sit down strike" that led to confrontation withlocal law enforcement officials. We set aside the award,saying:"We are unable to conclude that Congress intended tocompel employers to retain persons in their employ regardless of their unlawful conduct,--to invest those whogo on strike with an immunity from discharge for actsof trespass or violence against the employer's property,which they would not have enjoyed had they remainedat work." 306 U. S., at 255.Though we found that the employer had committed seriousviolations of the NLRA, the Board had no discretion to remedy those violations by awarding reinstatement with back-pay to employees who themselves had committed seriouscriminal acts. Two years later, in Southern S. S. Co., supra,the Board awarded reinstatement with backpay to five employees whose strike on shipboard had amounted to a mutinyin violation of federal law. We set aside the award, saying:"It is sufficient for this case to observe that the Boardhas not been commissioned to effectuate the policies ofthe Labor Relations Act so single-mindedly that it maywholly ignore other and equally important [c]ongressional objectives." 316 U. S., at 47.Although the Board had argued that the employees' conductdid not in fact violate the federal mutiny statute, we rejectedthis view, finding the Board's interpretation of a statute so535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN144 HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Courtfar removed from its expertise merited no deference fromthis Court.Id., at 40-46. Since Southern S. S. Co., wehave accordingly never deferred to the Board's remedialpreferences where such preferences potentially trench uponfederal statutes and policies unrelated to the NLRA. Thus,we have precluded the Board from enforcing orders found inconflict with the Bankruptcy Code, see Bildisco, supra, at527-534, 529, n. 9 ("While the Board's interpretation of theNLRA should be given some deference, the proposition thatthe Board's interpretation of statutes outside its expertise islikewise to be deferred to is novel"), rejected claims thatfederal antitrust policy should defer to the NLRA, ConnellConstr. Co. v. Plumbers, 421 U. S. 616, 626 (1975), and precluded the Board from selecting remedies pursuant to itsown interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Act, Carpenters v. NLRB, 357 U. S. 93, 108-110 (1958).Our decision in Sure-Tan followed this line of cases andset aside an award closely analogous to the award challengedhere. There we confronted for the first time a potential conflict between the NLRA and federal immigration policy, asthen expressed in the Immigration and Nationality Act(INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, 8 U. S. C. $ 1101 et seq.Two companies had unlawfully reported alien-employees tothe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in retaliation for union activity. Rather than face INS sanction, theemployees voluntarily departed to Mexico. The Board investigated and found the companies acted in violation of$$ 8(a)(1) and (3) of the NLRA. The Board's ensuing orderdirected the companies to reinstate the affected workers andpay them six months' backpay.We affirmed the Board's determination that the NLRA applied to undocumented workers, reasoning that the immigration laws "as presently written" expressed only a " `peripheral concern' " with the employment of illegal aliens. 467U. S., at 892 (quoting De Canas v. Bica, 424 U. S. 351, 360(1976)). "For whatever reason," Congress had not "made it535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN145Cite as: 535 U. S. 137 (2002)Opinion of the Courta separate criminal offense" for employers to hire an il-legal alien, or for an illegal alien "to accept employment afterentering this country illegally." Sure-Tan, 467 U. S., at 892-893. Therefore, we found "no reason to conclude that application of the NLRA to employment practices affecting suchaliens would necessarily conflict with the terms of the INA."Id., at 893.With respect to the Board's selection of remedies, how-ever, we found its authority limited by federal immigration policy. See id., at 903 ("In devising remedies for unfairlabor practices, the Board is obliged to take into account another `equally important Congressional objective' " (quotingSouthern S. S. Co., supra, at 47)). For example, the Boardwas prohibited from effectively rewarding a violation ofthe immigration laws by reinstating workers not authorizedto reenter the United States. Sure-Tan, 467 U. S., at 903.Thus, to avoid "a potential conflict with the INA," theBoard's reinstatement order had to be conditioned uponproof of "the employees' legal reentry." Ibid. "Similarly,"with respect to backpay, we stated: "[T]he employees mustbe deemed `unavailable' for work (and the accrual of backpaytherefore tolled) during any period when they were not lawfully entitled to be present and employed in the UnitedStates." Ibid. "[I]n light of the practical workings of theimmigration laws," such remedial limitations were appropriate even if they led to "[t]he probable unavailability of the[NLRA's] more effective remedies." Id., at 904.The Board cites our decision in ABF Freight System, Inc.v. NLRB, 510 U. S. 317 (1994), as authority for awardingbackpay to employees who violate federal laws. In ABFFreight, we held that an employee's false testimony at acompliance proceeding did not require the Board to denyreinstatement with backpay. The question presented was"a narrow one," id., at 322, limited to whether the Board wasobliged to "adopt a rigid rule" that employees who testifyfalsely under oath automatically forfeit NLRA remedies, id.,535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN146 HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the Courtat 325. There are significant differences between that caseand this. First, we expressly did not address whether theBoard could award backpay to an employee who engaged in"serious misconduct" unrelated to internal Board proceedings, id., at 322, n. 7, such as threatening to kill a supervisor,ibid. (citing Precision Window Mfg. v. NLRB, 963 F. 2d 1105,1110 (CA8 1992)), or stealing from an employer, 510 U. S., at322, n. 7 (citing NLRB v. Commonwealth Foods, Inc., 506F. 2d 1065, 1068 (CA4 1974)). Second, the challenged orderdid not implicate federal statutes or policies administeredby other federal agencies, a "most delicate area" in whichthe Board must be "particularly careful in its choice of remedy." Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371U. S. 156, 172 (1962). Third, the employee misconduct atissue, though serious, was not at all analogous to misconductthat renders an underlying employment relationship illegalunder explicit provisions of federal law. See, e. g., 237 F. 3d,at 657, n. 2 (Sentelle, J., dissenting) ("The perjury statuteprovides for criminal sanctions; it does not forbid a presentor potential perjurer from obtaining a job" (distinguishingABF Freight)). For these reasons, we believe the presentcase is controlled by the Southern S. S. Co. line of cases,rather than by ABF Freight.It is against this decisional background that we turn to thequestion presented here. The parties and the lower courtsfocus much of their attention on Sure-Tan, particularly itsexpress limitation of backpay to aliens "lawfully entitled tobe present and employed in the United States." 467 U. S.,at 903. All agree that as a matter of plain language, thislimitation forecloses the award of backpay to Castro. Castro was never lawfully entitled to be present or employedin the United States, and thus, under the plain language ofSure-Tan, he has no right to claim backpay. The Boardtakes the view, however, that read in context, this limitationapplies only to aliens who left the United States and thuscannot claim backpay without lawful reentry. Brief for Re535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN147Cite as: 535 U. S. 137 (2002)Opinion of the Courtspondent 17-24. The Court of Appeals agreed with thisview. 237 F. 3d, at 642-646. Another Court of Appeals,however, agrees with Hoffman, and concludes that Sure-Tansimply meant what it said, i. e., that any alien who is "notlawfully entitled to be present and employed in the UnitedStates" cannot claim backpay. See Del Rey Tortilleria, Inc.v. NLRB, 976 F. 2d 1115, 1118-1121 (CA7 1992); Brief forPetitioner 7-20. We need not resolve this controversy. Forwhether isolated sentences from Sure-Tan definitively con-trol, or count merely as persuasive dicta in support of petitioner, we think the question presented here better analyzedthrough a wider lens, focused as it must be on a legal landscape now significantly changed.TheSouthern S. S. Co. line of cases established that wherethe Board's chosen remedy trenches upon a federal statuteor policy outside the Board's competence to administer, theBoard's remedy may be required to yield. Whether or notthis was the situation at the time of Sure-Tan, it is preciselythe situation today. In 1986, two years afterSure-Tan,Congress enacted IRCA, a comprehensive scheme prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens in the United States.$ 101(a)(1), 100 Stat. 3360, 8 U. S. C. $ 1324a. As we havepreviously noted, IRCA "forcefully" made combating theemployment of illegal aliens central to "[t]he policy of immigration law." INS v. National Center for Immigrants'Rights, Inc., 502 U. S. 183, 194, and n. 8 (1991). It did so byestablishing an extensive "employment verification system,"$ 1324a(a)(1), designed to deny employment to aliens who(a) are not lawfully present in the United States, or (b) arenot lawfully authorized to work in the United States,$ 1324a(h)(3).3 This verification system is critical to the3 For an alien to be "authorized" to work in the United States, heor she must possess "a valid social security account number card,"$ 1324a(b)(C)(i), or "other documentation evidencing authorization of employment in the United States which the Attorney General finds, by regulation, to be acceptable for purposes of this section," $ 1324a(b)(C)(ii). See535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN148 HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v. NLRBOpinion of the CourtIRCA regime. To enforce it, IRCA mandates that employ-ers verify the identity and eligibility of all new hires byexamining specified documents before they begin work.$ 1324a(b). If an alien applicant is unable to present therequired documentation, the unauthorized alien cannot behired. $ 1324a(a)(1).Similarly, if an employer unknowingly hires an unauthor-ized alien, or if the alien becomes unauthorized while employed, the employer is compelled to discharge the workerupon discovery of the worker's undocumented status.$ 1324a(a)(2). Employers who violate IRCA are punished bycivil fines, $ 1324a(e)(4)(A), and may be subject to criminalprosecution, $ 1324a(f)(1). IRCA also makes it a crime foran unauthorized alien to subvert the employer verificationsystem by tendering fraudulent documents. $ 1324c(a). Itthus prohibits aliens from using or attempting to use "anyforged, counterfeit, altered, or falsely made document" or"any document lawfully issued to or with respect to a personother than the possessor" for purposes of obtaining employ-ment in the United States. $$ 1324c(a)(1)-(3). Aliens whouse or attempt to use such documents are subject to finesand criminal prosecution. 18 U. S. C. $ 1546(b). There is nodispute that Castro's use of false documents to obtain em-ployment with Hoffman violated these provisions.Under the IRCA regime, it is impossible for an undocu-mented alien to obtain employment in the United Stateswithout some party directly contravening explicit congres-sional policies. Either the undocumented alien tendersfraudulent identification, which subverts the cornerstone ofIRCA's enforcement mechanism, or the employer knowinglyhires the undocumented alien in direct contradiction of itsIRCA obligations. The Board asks that we overlook thisalso $ 1324a(h)(3)(B) (defining "unauthorized alien" as any alien "[not] authorized to be so employed by this chapter or by the Attorney General").Regulations implementing these provisions are set forth at 8 CFR $ 274a(2001).535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN149Cite as: 535 U. S. 137 (2002)Opinion of the Courtfact and allow it to award backpay to an illegal alien foryears of work not performed, for wages that could not lawfully have been earned, and for a job obtained in the firstinstance by a criminal fraud. We find, however, that awarding backpay to illegal aliens runs counter to policies underly-ing IRCA, policies the Board has no authority to enforce oradminister. Therefore, as we have consistently held in likecircumstances, the award lies beyond the bounds of theBoard's remedial discretion.The Board contends that awarding limited backpay toCastro "reasonably accommodates" IRCA, because, in theBoard's view, such an award is not "inconsistent" with IRCA.Brief for Respondent 29-42. The Board argues that be-cause the backpay period was closed as of the date Hoffmanlearned of Castro's illegal status, Hoffman could have em-ployed Castro during the backpay period without violatingIRCA. Id., at 37. The Board further argues that whileIRCA criminalized the misuse of documents, "it did not makeviolators ineligible for back pay awards or other compensa-tion flowing from employment secured by the misuse of suchdocuments." Id., at 38. This latter statement, of course,proves little: The mutiny statute in Southern S. S. Co., andthe INA in Sure-Tan, were likewise understandably silentwith respect to such things as backpay awards under theNLRA. What matters here, and what sinks both of theBoard's claims, is that Congress has expressly made it criminally punishable for an alien to obtain employment with falsedocuments. There is no reason to think that Congress nonetheless intended to permit backpay where but for an employ-er's unfair labor practices, an alien-employee would haveremained in the United States illegally, and continued towork illegally, all the while successfully evading apprehension by immigration authorities.4 Far from "accommo4 Justice Breyer contends otherwise, pointing to a single CommitteeReport from one House of a politically divided Congress, post, at 157 (dissenting opinion) (citing H.

NLRBOpinion of the Courtdating" IRCA, the Board's position, recognizing employermisconduct but discounting the misconduct of illegal alienemployees, subverts it.Indeed, awarding backpay in a case like this not only trivializes the immigration laws, it also condones and encouragesfuture violations. The Board admits that had the INS detained Castro, or had Castro obeyed the law and departed toMexico, Castro would have lost his right to backpay. SeeBrief for Respondent 7-8 (citing A. P. R. A. Fuel Oil BuyersGroup, Inc., 320 N. L. R. B., at 416). Cf. INS v. NationalCenter for Immigrants' Rights, Inc., 502 U. S., at 196, n. 11("[U]ndocumented aliens taken into custody are not entitledto work") (construing 8 CFR $ 103.6(a) (1991)). Castro thusqualifies for the Board's award only by remaining inside theUnited States illegally. See, e. g., A. P. R. A. Fuel BuyersGroup, 134 F. 3d, at 62, n. 4 (Jacobs, J., concurring in partand dissenting in part) ("Considering that NLRB proceedings can span a whole decade, this is no small inducement toprolong illegal presence in the country"). Similarly, Castrocannot mitigate damages, a duty our cases require, see Surerather slender reed, e. g., Bank One Chicago, N. A. v. Midwest Bank &Trust Co., 516 U. S. 264, 279 (1996) (Scalia, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment). Even assuming that a Committee Report canshed light on what Congress intended in IRCA, the Report cited by Justice Breyer says nothing about the Board's authority to award backpayto illegal aliens. The Board in fact initially read the Report as statingCongress' view that such awards are foreclosed. Memorandum GC 88-9from Office of General Counsel, NLRB, Reinstatement and BackpayRemedies for Discriminatees Who Are "Undocumented Aliens," 1988WL 236182, *3 (Sept. 1, 1988) ("[T]he relevant committee report pointsout [that] Sure-Tan was the existing law and that decision itself limitedthe remedial powers of the NLRB. Clearly, Congress did not intend tooverrule Sure-Tan"). Other courts have observed that the Report"merely endorses the first holding of Sure-Tan that undocumented aliensare employees within the meaning of the NLRA." Del Rey Tortilleria,Inc., 976 F. 2d, at 1121 (citation omitted). Our first holding in Sure-Tanis not at issue here and does not bear at all on the scope of Board remedieswith respect to undocumented workers.535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN151Cite as: 535 U. S. 137 (2002)Opinion of the CourtTan, 467 U. S., at 901 (citing Seven-Up Bottling, 344 U. S., at346; Phelps Dodge Corp. v. NLRB, 313 U. S. 177, 198 (1941)),without triggering new IRCA violations, either by tenderingfalse documents to employers or by finding employers willingto ignore IRCA and hire illegal workers. The Board herehas failed to even consider this tension. See 326 N. L. R. B.,at 1063, n. 10 (finding that Castro adequately mitigated damages through interim work with no mention of ALJ findingsthat Castro secured interim work with false documents).5We therefore conclude that allowing the Board to awardbackpay to illegal aliens would unduly trench upon explicitstatutory prohibitions critical to federal immigration policy,as expressed in IRCA. It would encourage the successfulevasion of apprehension by immigration authorities, condoneprior violations of the immigration laws, and encouragefuture violations. However broad the Board's discretion to5 When questioned at oral argument about the tension between affirmative mitigation duties under the NLRA and explicit prohibitions againstemployment of illegal aliens in IRCA, the Government candidly stated:"[T]he board has not examined this issue in detail." Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.Justice Breyer says that we should nonetheless defer to the Government's view that the Board's remedy is entirely consistent with IRCA.Post, at 161 (dissenting opinion). But such deference would be contraryto Southern S. S. Co. v. NLRB, 316 U. S. 31, 40-46 (1942), where the Government told us that the Board's remedy was entirely consistent with thefederal maritime laws, and NLRB v. Bildisco & Bildisco, 465 U. S. 513,529-532 (1984), where the Government told us that the Board's remedywas entirely consistent with the Bankruptcy Code, and Sure-Tan, 467U.

S. 93, 108-110 (1958) (rejecting Government position thatwe should defer to the Board's interpretation of the Interstate CommerceAct). We did not defer to the Government's position in any of these cases,and there is even less basis for doing so here since IRCA--unlike themaritime statutes, the Bankruptcy Code, or the INA--not only speaksdirectly to matters of employment but expressly criminalizes the only employment relationship at issue in this case.535US1 Unit: $U33 [09-26-03 12:56:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN152 HOFFMAN PLASTIC COMPOUNDS, INC. v.

The Board here has alreadyimposed other significant sanctions against Hoffman--sanc-tions Hoffman does not challenge. See supra, at 140.These include orders that Hoffman cease and desist its viola-tions of the NLRA, and that it conspicuously post a noticeto employees setting forth their rights under the NLRA anddetailing its prior unfair practices. 306 N.

We have deemed such "traditional remedies" sufficient to effectuate national labor policy regardless ofwhether the "spur and catalyst" of backpay accompaniesthem. Sure-Tan, 467 U. S., at 904. See also id., at 904, n. 13("This threat of contempt sanctions . . . provides a significantdeterrent against future violations of the [NLRA]"). As weconcluded inSure-Tan, "in light of the practical workingsof the immigration laws," any "perceived deficienc[y] in theNLRA's existing remedial arsenal" must be "addressed bycongressional action," not the courts.
