In Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), we heldthat "[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any factthat increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribedstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and provedbeyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 490. In federal prose-cutions, such facts must also be charged in the indictment.Id., at 476 (quoting Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 243,n. 6 (1999)). In this case, we address whether the omissionfrom a federal indictment of a fact that enhances the statu-tory maximum sentence justifies a court of appeals' vacatingthe enhanced sentence, even though the defendant did notobject in the trial court.Respondent Stanley Hall, Jr., led a "vast drug organiza-tion" in Baltimore. 261 F. 3d 397, 401 (CA4 2001). The sixother respondents helped run the operation. In October1997, a federal grand jury returned an indictment chargingrespondents with conspiring to distribute and to possesswith intent to distribute 5 kilograms or more of cocaine and50 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U. S. C.$$ 846 and 841(a)(1). A superseding indictment returned inMarch 1998, which extended the time period of the conspir-acy and added five more defendants, charged a conspiracy to*Clayton A.

COTTONOpinion of the Courtdistribute and to possess with intent to distribute a "detectable amount" of cocaine and cocaine base. The supersedingindictment did not allege any of the threshold levels of drugquantity that lead to enhanced penalties under $ 841(b).In accord with the superseding indictment, the DistrictCourt instructed the jury that "as long as you find that adefendant conspired to distribute or posses[s] with intentto distribute these controlled substances, the amounts involved are not important." App. to Pet. for Cert. 6a (emphasis deleted). The jury found respondents guilty.Congress established "a term of imprisonment of not morethan 20 years" for drug offenses involving a detectable quantity of cocaine or cocaine base. $ 841(b)(1)(C). But the District Court did not sentence respondents under this provision. Consistent with the practice in federal courts atthe time, at sentencing the District Court made a findingof drug quantity that implicated the enhanced penalties of$ 841(b)(1)(A), which prescribes "a term of imprisonmentwhich may not be . . . more than life" for drug offensesinvolving at least 50 grams of cocaine base. The DistrictCourt found, based on the trial testimony, respondentHall responsible for at least 500 grams of cocaine base,and the other respondents responsible for at least 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. The court sentenced respondentsHall and Powell to 30 years' imprisonment and the other respondents to life imprisonment. Respondents did not objectin the District Court to the fact that these sentences werebased on an amount of drug quantity not alleged in theindictment.While respondents' appeal was pending in the UnitedStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, we decidedApprendi v. New Jersey, supra. Respondents then arguedin the Court of Appeals that their sentences were invalidunder Apprendi, because the issue of drug quantity wasneither alleged in the indictment nor submitted to the petit535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN629Cite as: 535 U. S. 625 (2002)Opinion of the Courtjury. The Court of Appeals noted that respondents "failedto raise this argument before the district court" and thusreviewed the argument for plain error. 261 F. 3d, at 403(citing Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b)). A divided court nonetheless vacated respondents' sentences on the ground that"because an indictment setting forth all the essential elements of an offense is both mandatory and jurisdictional, . . .a court is without jurisdiction to . . . impose a sentence foran offense not charged in the indictment." 261 F. 3d, at 404-405 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such an error, theCourt of Appeals concluded, "seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings."Id., at 406. We granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 1074 (2002), andnow reverse.We first address the Court of Appeals' conclusion thatthe omission from the indictment was a "jurisdictional"defect and thus required vacating respondents' sentences.Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1 (1887), is the progenitor of thisview. In Bain, the indictment charged that Bain, the cashier and director of a bank, made false statements "with intent to deceive the Comptroller of the Currency and theagent appointed to examine the affairs" of the bank. Id.,at 4. Before trial, the court struck the words "the Comptroller of the Currency and," on the ground that they weresuperfluous. The jury found Bain guilty. Id., at 4-5. Bainchallenged the amendment to the indictment in a petitionfor a writ of habeas corpus. The Court concluded that theamendment was improper and that therefore "the jurisdiction of the offence [was] gone, and the court [had] no rightto proceed any further in the progress of the case for wantof an indictment." Id., at 13.Bain, however, is a product of an era in which this Court'sauthority to review criminal convictions was greatly circumscribed. At the time it was decided, a defendant could notobtain direct review of his criminal conviction in the Su535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN630 UNITED STATES v. COTTONOpinion of the Courtpreme Court.1 See generally United States v. Sanges, 144U. S. 310, 319-322 (1892); L. Orfield, Criminal Appeals inAmerica 244-246 (1939). The Court's authority to issue awrit of habeas corpus was limited to cases in which theconvicting "court had no jurisdiction to render the judg-ment which it gave." Bain, supra, at 3; see also Preiser v.Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 485 (1973). In 1887, therefore, thisCourt could examine constitutional errors in a criminal trialonly on a writ of habeas corpus, and only then if it deemedthe error "jurisdictional." The Court's desire to correctobvious constitutional violations led to a "somewhat expan-sive notion of `jurisdiction,' "Custis v. United States, 511U. S. 485, 494 (1994), which was "more a fiction than anythingelse," Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 79 (1977).Bain's elastic concept of jurisdiction is not what the term"jurisdiction" means today, i. e., "the courts' statutory orconstitutional power to adjudicate the case." Steel Co. v.Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998).This latter concept of subject-matter jurisdiction, becauseit involves a court's power to hear a case, can never be for-feited or waived. Consequently, defects in subject-matterjurisdiction require correction regardless of whether theerror was raised in district court. See,e. g., Louisville &Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U. S. 149 (1908). In contrast, the grand jury right can be waived. See Fed. RuleCrim. Proc. 7(b); Smith v. United States, 360 U. S. 1, 6 (1959).Post-Bain cases confirm that defects in an indictmentdo not deprive a court of its power to adjudicate a case. InLamar v. United States, 240 U. S. 60 (1916), the Court re-jected the claim that "the court had no jurisdiction becausethe indictment does not charge a crime against the UnitedStates."Id., at 64. Justice Holmes explained that a dis1 In 1889, Congress authorized direct review of capital cases in theSupreme Court. See 25 Stat. 655. In 1891, this right was extended todefendants in all cases involving "infamous crime[s]." 26 Stat. 827; seeIn re Claasen, 140 U. S. 200 (1891).535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN631Cite as: 535 U. S. 625 (2002)Opinion of the Courttrict court "has jurisdiction of all crimes cognizable underthe authority of the United States . . . [and] [t]he objection that the indictment does not charge a crime againstthe United States goes only to the merits of the case." Id.,at 65. Similarly, United States v. Williams, 341 U. S. 58, 66(1951), held that a ruling "that the indictment is defectivedoes not affect the jurisdiction of the trial court to determinethe case presented by the indictment."Thus, this Court some time ago departed from Bain's viewthat indictment defects are "jurisdictional." Bain has beencited in later cases such as Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S.212 (1960), and Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749 (1962),for the proposition that "an indictment may not be amendedexcept by resubmission to the grand jury, unless the changeis merely a matter of form," id., at 770 (citing Bain, supra).But in each of these cases proper objection had been madein the District Court to the sufficiency of the indictment.We need not retreat from this settled proposition of law decided in Bain to say that the analysis of that issue in termsof "jurisdiction" was mistaken in the light of later casessuch as Lamar and Williams. Insofar as it held that a defective indictment deprives a court of jurisdiction, Bain isoverruled.Freed from the view that indictment omissions deprive acourt of jurisdiction, we proceed to apply the plain-error testof Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b) to respondents'forfeited claim. See United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725,731 (1993). "Under that test, before an appellate court cancorrect an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) `error,'(2) that is `plain,' and (3) that `affect[s] substantial rights.' "Johnson v. United States, 520 U. S. 461, 466-467 (1997) (quoting Olano, supra, at 732). "If all three conditions are met,an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to noticea forfeited error, but only if (4) the error "seriously affect[s]the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial pro535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN632 UNITED STATES v. COTTONOpinion of the Courtceedings." 520 U. S., at 467 (internal quotation marks omit-ted) (quotingOlano, supra, at 732).The Government concedes that the indictment's failureto allege a fact, drug quantity, that increased the statutory maximum sentence rendered respondents' enhancedsentences erroneous under the reasoning ofApprendi andJones. The Government also concedes that such error wasplain. See Johnson, supra, at 468 ("[W]here the law atthe time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to thelaw at the time of appeal[,] it is enough that an error be`plain' at the time of appellate consideration").The third inquiry is whether the plain error "affect[ed]substantial rights." This usually means that the error"must have affected the outcome of the district court pro-ceedings."Olano, supra, at 734. Respondents argue thatan indictment error falls within the "limited class" of "struc-tural errors,"Johnson, supra, at 468-469, that "can be corrected regardless of their effect on the outcome," Olano,supra, at 735. Respondents cite Silber v. United States, 370U. S. 717 (1962) (per curiam), and Stirone v. United States,supra, in support of this position.2 The Government counters by noting that Johnson's list of structural errors did notinclude Stirone or Silber, see 520 U. S., at 468-469, and thatthe defendants in both of these cases preserved their claimsat trial.As in Johnson (see id., at 469), we need not resolvewhether respondents satisfy this element of the plain-errorinquiry, because even assuming respondents' substantialrights were affected, the error did not seriously affect the2 Respondents also argue that even if the indictment defect is not structural error, it did affect their substantial rights because they were sentenced to more than the 20-year maximum that $ 841(b) authorizes withoutregard to drug quantity. The Government responds that the defendantshad notice that their sentences could exceed 20 years, and that the grandjury would have found that the conspiracy involved at least 50 grams ofcocaine base had the Government sought such an allegation.535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN633Cite as: 535 U.

The error in Johnson was the District Court's failureto submit an element of the false statement offense, material-ity, to the petit jury. The evidence of materiality, however,was "overwhelming" and "essentially uncontroverted." Id.,at 470. We thus held that there was "no basis for concluding that the error `seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrityor public reputation of judicial proceedings.' "Ibid.The same analysis applies in this case to the omission ofdrug quantity from the indictment. The evidence that theconspiracy involved at least 50 grams of cocaine base was"overwhelming" and "essentially uncontroverted." 3 Muchof the evidence implicating respondents in the drug conspiracy revealed the conspiracy's involvement with far morethan 50 grams of cocaine base. Baltimore police officersmade numerous state arrests and seizures between February1996 and April 1997 that resulted in the seizure of 795 ziplock bags and clear bags containing approximately 380 gramsof cocaine base. 20 Record 179-244. A federal search ofrespondent Jovan Powell's residence resulted in the seizure of 51.3 grams of cocaine base. 32 id., at 18-30. A co-operating co-conspirator testified at trial that he witnessedrespondent Hall cook one-quarter of a kilogram of cocainepowder into cocaine base. 22id., at 208. Another cooperating co-conspirator testified at trial that she was present in ahotel room where the drug operation bagged one kilogramof cocaine base into ziplock bags. 27 id., at 107-108. Surelythe grand jury, having found that the conspiracy existed,would have also found that the conspiracy involved at least50 grams of cocaine base.3 Respondents challenged the presentence reports' assignment of a baseoffense level of 38, which is applicable to 1.5 kilograms or more of cocainebase. But they never argued that the conspiracy involved less than50 grams of cocaine base, which is the relevant quantity for purposes ofApprendi, as that is the threshold quantity for the penalty of life imprisonment in 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(A).535US3 Unit: $U47 [09-22-03 20:50:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN634 UNITED STATES v. COTTONOpinion of the CourtRespondents emphasize that the Fifth Amendment grandjury right serves a vital function in providing for a bodyof citizens that acts as a check on prosecutorial power.No doubt that is true. See, e. g., 3 Story, Commentaries onthe Constitution $ 1779 (1883), reprinted in 5 The Founders'Constitution 295 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987). Butthat is surely no less true of the Sixth Amendment right toa petit jury, which, unlike the grand jury, must find guiltbeyond a reasonable doubt. The important role of the petitjury did not, however, prevent us inJohnson from applyingthe longstanding rule "that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to maketimely assertion of the right . . . ." Yakus v. United States,321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944).In providing for graduated penalties in 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b),Congress intended that defendants, like respondents, in-volved in large-scale drug operations receive more severepunishment than those committing drug offenses involv-ing lesser quantities. Indeed, the fairness and integrity ofthe criminal justice system depends on meting out to thoseinflicting the greatest harm on society the most severe punishments. The real threat then to the "fairness, integrity,and public reputation of judicial proceedings" would be ifrespondents, despite the overwhelming and uncontrovertedevidence that they were involved in a vast drug conspiracy,were to receive a sentence prescribed for those committingless substantial drug offenses because of an error that wasnever objected to at trial. Cf. Johnson, supra, at 470 (quot-ing R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970)).Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN635OCTOBER TERM, 2001SyllabusVERIZON MARYLAND INC. v. PUBLIC SERVICECOMMISSION OF MARYLANDet al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuitNo. 00-1531. Argued December 5, 2001--Decided May 20, 2002*The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act) requires that incumbent localexchange carriers (LECs) "provide . . . interconnection with" their existing networks when a new entrant seeks access to a market, 47 U. S. C.$ 251(c)(2); that the carriers then establish "reciprocal compensationarrangements" for transporting and terminating the calls of eachothers' customers, $ 251(b)(5); and that their interconnection agreementsbe submitted to a state utility commission for approval, $ 252(e)(1).Petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., the incumbent LEC in Maryland, negotiated an interconnection agreement with a competitor later acquiredby respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc. After the Maryland Public ServiceCommission (Commission) approved the agreement, Verizon informedWorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compensation forcalls made by Verizon's customers to the local access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) because ISP traffic was not "local traffic"subject to the reciprocal compensation agreement. WorldCom filed acomplaint with the Commission, which ordered Verizon to make thepayments for past and future ISP-bound calls. Verizon then filed anaction in Federal District Court, citing $ 252(e)(6) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1331as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming as defendants the Commission, its individual members in their official capacities, WorldCom, andother competing LECs. Verizon sought a declaratory judgment thatthe order was unlawful and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement,alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensation for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and a Federal Communications Commission ruling. The District Court dismissed the action.The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Commission had notwaived its Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit; that the doctrineof Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, does not permit suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacities; and that neither$ 252(e)(6) nor $ 1331 provides a basis for jurisdiction over Verizon'sclaims against the private defendants.*Together with No. 00-1711, United States v.

COMM'N OF MD.SyllabusHeld:1. Section 1331 provides a basis for jurisdiction over Verizon's claimthat the Commission's order requiring reciprocal compensation for ISPbound calls is pre-empted by federal law. Federal courts have jurisdiction under $ 1331 where the petitioner's right to recover will besustained if federal law is given one construction and will be defeatedif it is given another, unless the claim clearly appears to be immaterial and made solely to obtain jurisdiction, or is wholly insubstantialand frivolous. Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S.83, 89. Here, resolution of Verizon's claim turns on whether the Act,or an FCC ruling, precludes the Commission from ordering paymentof reciprocal compensation, and there is no suggestion that the claimis immaterial or insubstantial and frivolous. Even if $ 252(e)(6) (whichprovides that a party aggrieved by a state commission's determinationunder $ 252 may bring a federal action to determine whether an interconnection agreement meets the requirements of $$ 251 and 252) doesnot confer jurisdiction, it does not divest the district courts of theirauthority under $ 1331. Cf. Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S.136, 141. Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanismfor the commission actions that it covers, and it does not distinctivelylimit the substantive relief available. Finally, none of the Act's otherprovisions evince any intent to preclude federal review of a commissiondetermination. Pp. 641-644.2. The doctrine of Ex parte Young permits Verizon's suit to go forward against the state commissioners in their official capacities. TheCourt thus need not decide whether the Commission waived its immunity from suit by voluntarily participating in the regulatory regimeestablished by the Act. In determining whether the Ex parte Youngdoctrine avoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court need onlyconduct a "straightforward inquiry" into whether the complaint allegesan ongoing violation of federal law and seeks relief properly characterized as prospective. Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S.261, 296, 298-299. Here, Verizon's prayer for injunctive relief--thatstate officials be restrained from enforcing an order in contravention ofcontrolling federal law--clearly satisfies our "straightforward inquiry."As for Verizon's prayer for declaratory relief, even though Verizon seeksa declaration of the past, as well as the future, ineffectiveness of theCommission's action, so that the private parties' past financial liabilitymay be affected, no past liability of the State, or of any of its commissioners, is at issue, see Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 668. TheFourth Circuit's suggestion that the doctrine of Ex parte Young is inapplicable because the Commission's order was probably not inconsistent with federal law is unavailing: The inquiry into whether suit lies535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN637Cite as: 535 U.

Nor is there any merit to theCommission's argument that $ 252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one held in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.Florida, 517 U.

COMM'N OF MD.Opinion of the CourtJustice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.These cases present the question whether federal districtcourts have jurisdiction over a telecommunication carrier'sclaim that the order of a state utility commission requir-ing reciprocal compensation for telephone calls to InternetService Providers violates federal law.IThe Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act or Act),Pub. L. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, created a new telecommunications regime designed to foster competition in local tele-phone markets. Toward that end, the Act imposed variousobligations on incumbent local-exchange carriers (LECs),including a duty to share their networks with competitors.See 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c) (1994 ed., Supp. V). When a new en-trant seeks access to a market, the incumbent LEC must"provide . . . interconnection with" the incumbent's existingnetwork, $ 251(c)(2), and the carriers must then establish"reciprocal compensation arrangements" for transportingand terminating the calls placed by each others' customers,$ 251(b)(5). As we have previously described, see AT&TCorp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S. 366, 371-373 (1999),an incumbent LEC "may negotiate and enter into a bind-ing agreement" with the new entrant "to fulfill the duties" imposed by $$ 251(b) and (c), but "without regard tothe standards set forth" in those provisions. $$ 252(a)(1),ton; and for the Virginia State Corporation Commission by William H.Chambliss.[Reporter's Note: On January 22, 2002, 534 U.

That agreement must be submitted to the statecommission for approval, $ 252(e)(1), which may reject it if itdiscriminates against a carrier not a party or is not consist-ent with "the public interest, convenience, and necessity,"$ 252(e)(2)(A).As required by the Act, the incumbent LEC in Maryland,petitioner Verizon Maryland Inc., formerly known as BellAtlantic Maryland, Inc., negotiated an interconnection agreement with competitors, including MFS Intelenet of Mary-land, later acquired by respondent MCI WorldCom, Inc.The Maryland Public Service Commission (Commission) ap-proved the agreement. Six months later, Verizon informedWorldCom that it would no longer pay reciprocal compen-sation for telephone calls made by Verizon's customers to thelocal access numbers of Internet Service Providers (ISPs),claiming that ISP traffic was not "local traffic"1 subject tothe reciprocal compensation agreement because ISPs con-nect customers to distant Web sites. WorldCom disputedVerizon's claim and filed a complaint with the Commission.The Commission found in favor of WorldCom, orderingVerizon "to timely forward all future interconnection pay-ments owed [WorldCom] for telephone calls placed to anISP" and to pay WorldCom any reciprocal compensationthat it had withheld pending resolution of the dispute. Verizon appealed to a Maryland state court, which affirmed theorder.1 Section 1.61 of the interconnection agreement provides: " `ReciprocalCompensation' is As Described in the Act, and refers to the paymentarrangements that recover costs incurred for the transport and termination of Local Traffic originating on one Party's network and terminatingon the other Party's network." In turn, $ 1.44 defines " `Local Traffic' "as "traffic that is originated by a Customer of one Party on that Party'snetwork and terminates to a Customer of the other Party on that otherParty's network, within a given local calling area, or expanded area service (`EAS') area, as defined in [Bell Atlantic's] effective Customer tariffs.Local Traffic does not include traffic originated or terminated by a commercial mobile radio service carrier."535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN640 VERIZON MD. INC. v. PUBLIC SERV. COMM'N OF MD.Opinion of the CourtSubsequently, the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) issued a ruling--later vacated by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, see Bell AtlanticTel. Cos. v. FCC, 206 F. 3d 1 (2000)--which categorized ISPbound calls as nonlocal for purposes of reciprocal compen-sation but concluded that, absent a federal compensationmechanism for those calls, state commissions could construeinterconnection agreements as requiring reciprocal compen-sation. Verizon filed a new complaint with the Commission,arguing that the FCC ruling established that Verizon wasno longer required to provide reciprocal compensation forISP traffic. In a 3-to-2 decision, the Commission rejectedthis contention, concluding that, as a matter of state contractlaw, WorldCom and Verizon had agreed to treat ISP-boundcalls as local traffic subject to reciprocal compensation.Verizon filed an action in the United States District Courtfor the District of Maryland, citing 47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) and28 U. S. C. $ 1331 as the basis for jurisdiction, and naming asdefendants the Commission, its individual members in theirofficial capacities, WorldCom, and other competing LECs.In its complaint, Verizon sought declaratory and injunctiverelief from the Commission's order, alleging that the determination that Verizon must pay reciprocal compensationto WorldCom for ISP traffic violated the 1996 Act and theFCC ruling.The District Court dismissed the action, and a dividedpanel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 240 F. 3d 279 (2001). The Fourth Circuit held thatthe Commission had not waived its immunity from suit byvoluntarily participating in the regulatory scheme set upunder the 1996 Act, and that the doctrine of Ex parte Young,209 U. S. 123 (1908), does not permit suit against the individual commissioners in their official capacities. It then heldthat neither 47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) nor 28 U. S.

S. 635 (2002)Opinion of the CourtStates, an intervenor below, petitioned this Court for re-view of the four questions resolved by the Fourth Circuit.Because we had previously granted certiorari in Mathias v.WorldCom Technologies, Inc., 532 U. S. 903 (2001), whichraised all but the question whether $ 1331 provides a basisfor jurisdiction, we granted certiorari only on the $ 1331question and set the case for oral argument in tandem withMathias. 533 U. S. 928 (2001). After oral argument, forreasons explained in our decision in Mathias released today,post, p. 682, we granted certiorari on the remaining threequestions presented in these cases. 534 U. S. 1072 (2001).IIWorldCom, Verizon, and the United States contend that47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) and 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 independentlygrant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction to deter-mine whether the Commission's order requiring that Verizon pay WorldCom reciprocal compensation for ISP-boundcalls violates the 1996 Act. Section 252 sets forth procedures relating to formation and commission approval ofinterconnection agreements, and commission approval andcontinuing review of interconnection terms and conditions(called "[s]tatements of generally available terms," $ 252(f))filed by LECs. Section 252(e)(6) provides, in relevant part:"In any case in which a State commission makes a determination under this section, any party aggrieved by suchdetermination may bring an action in an appropriate Federaldistrict court to determine whether the agreement or state-ment meets the requirements of section 251 of this title andthis section." The determination at issue here is neither theapproval or disapproval of a negotiated agreement nor theapproval or disapproval of a statement of generally availableterms. WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States argue,however, that a state commission's authority under $ 252 im-plicitly encompasses the authority to interpret and enforcean interconnection agreement that the commission has ap535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN642 VERIZON MD. INC. v. PUBLIC SERV. COMM'N OF MD.Opinion of the Courtproved,2 and that an interpretation or enforcement decisionis therefore a "determination under [$ 252]" subject to federal review. Whether the text of $ 252(e)(6) can be so construed is a question we need not decide. For we agree withthe parties' alternative contention, that even if $ 252(e)(6)does not confer jurisdiction, it at least does not divest thedistrict courts of their authority under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 toreview the Commission's order for compliance with federallaw.Verizon alleged in its complaint that the Commission violated the Act and the FCC ruling when it ordered paymentof reciprocal compensation for ISP-bound calls. Verizonsought a declaratory judgment that the Commission's orderwas unlawful, and an injunction prohibiting its enforcement. We have no doubt that federal courts have jurisdiction under $ 1331 to entertain such a suit. Verizon seeksrelief from the Commission's order "on the ground thatsuch regulation is pre-empted by a federal statute which, byvirtue of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, mustprevail," and its claim "thus presents a federal questionwhich the federal courts have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.$ 1331 to resolve." Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S.85, 96, n. 14 (1983).The Commission contends that since the Act does notcreate a private cause of action to challenge the Commission's order, there is no jurisdiction to entertain such a suit.We need express no opinion on the premise of this argument."It is firmly established in our cases that the absence of a2 The Fourth Circuit suggested that both Maryland law and the Federal Communications Act of 1934 grant the Commission authority to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements that it approves under $ 252.240 F. 3d 279, 304 (2001) (citing 47 U. S. C. $ 152(b), and Md. Pub. Util.Cos. Code Ann. $ 2-113 (1998)). The parties dispute whether it is infact federal or state law that confers this authority, but no party contends that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to interpret and enforcethe agreement.535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN643Cite as: 535 U. S. 635 (2002)Opinion of the Courtvalid (as opposed to arguable) cause of action does not im-plicate subject-matter jurisdiction,i. e., the courts' statutoryor constitutional power to adjudicate the case." Steel Co. v.Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U. S. 83, 89 (1998).As we have said, "the district court has jurisdiction if `theright of the petitioners to recover under their complaintwill be sustained if the Constitution and laws of the UnitedStates are given one construction and will be defeated ifthey are given another,' unless the claim `clearly appearsto be immaterial and made solely for the purpose of ob-taining jurisdiction or where such a claim is wholly insubstantial and frivolous. ' " Ib id. (citations omitted).Here, resolution of Verizon's claim turns on whether the Act,or an FCC ruling issued thereunder, precludes the Commission from ordering payment of reciprocal compensation, andthere is no suggestion that Verizon's claim is " `immaterial' "or " `wholly insubstantial and frivolous.' " Ibid.Verizon's claim thus falls within 28 U. S. C. $ 1331'sgeneral grant of jurisdiction, and contrary to the FourthCircuit's conclusion, nothing in 47 U. S. C. $ 252(e)(6) purports to strip this jurisdiction. Section 252(e)(6) providesfor federal review of an agreement when a state commission"makes a determination under [$ 252]." If this does not include (as WorldCom, Verizon, and the United States claim itdoes) the interpretation or enforcement of an interconnectionagreement, then $ 252(e)(6) merely makes some other actionsby state commissions reviewable in federal court. This isnot enough to eliminate jurisdiction under $ 1331. Althoughthe situation is not precisely parallel (in that here the elimination of federal district-court review would not amountto the elimination of all review), we think what we said inAbbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387 U. S. 136, 141 (1967), isnonetheless apt: "The mere fact that some acts are madereviewable should not suffice to support an implication ofexclusion as to others." (Internal quotation marks and citation omitted.) And here there is nothing more than that535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN644 VERIZON MD. INC. v. PUBLIC SERV. COMM'N OF MD.Opinion of the Courtmere fact. Section 252 does not establish a distinctive review mechanism for the commission actions that it covers(the mechanism is the same as $ 1331: district-court review),and it does not distinctively limit the substantive relief available. Cf. United States v. Fausto, 484 U. S. 439, 448-449(1988). Indeed, it does not even mention subject-matterjurisdiction, but reads like the conferral of a private right ofaction ("[A]ny party aggrieved by such determination maybring an action in an appropriate Federal district court,"$ 252(e)(6)). Cf. Steel Co., supra, at 90-91 (even a statutoryprovision that uses the word "jurisdiction" may not relate to"subject-matter jurisdiction"); see also Davis v. Passman,442 U. S. 228, 239, n. 18 (1979).And finally, none of the other provisions of the Act evinceany intent to preclude federal review of a commission determination. If anything, they reinforce the conclusion that$ 252(e)(6)'s silence on the subject leaves the jurisdictionalgrant of $ 1331 untouched. For where otherwise applicablejurisdiction was meant to be excluded, it was excluded expressly. Section 252(e)(4) provides: "No State court shallhave jurisdiction to review the action of a State commissionin approving or rejecting an agreement under this section."In sum, nothing in the Act displays any intent to withdrawfederal jurisdiction under $ 1331; we will not presume thatthe statute means what it neither says nor fairly implies.33 The Commission also suggests that the Rooker-Feldman doctrine precludes a federal district court from exercising jurisdiction over Verizon'sclaim. See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U. S.462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U. S. 413 (1923). TheRooker-Feldman doctrine merely recognizes that 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 is agrant of original jurisdiction, and does not authorize district courts toexercise appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, which Congress has reserved to this Court, see $ 1257(a). The doctrine has no application to judicial review of executive action, including determinationsmade by a state administrative agency.535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN645Cite as: 535 U. S. 635 (2002)Opinion of the CourtIIIThe Commission nonetheless contends that the EleventhAmendment bars Verizon's claim against it and its individualcommissioners. WorldCom, Verizon, and the United Statescounter that the Commission is subject to suit because itvoluntarily participated in the regulatory regime establishedby the Act. Whether the Commission waived its immunityis another question we need not decide, because--as thesame parties also argue--even absent waiver, Verizon mayproceed against the individual commissioners in their officialcapacities, pursuant to the doctrine ofEx parte Young, 209U. S. 123 (1908).In determining whether the doctrine of Ex parte Youngavoids an Eleventh Amendment bar to suit, a court needonly conduct a "straightforward inquiry into whether [the]complaint alleges an ongoing violation of federal law andseeks relief properly characterized as prospective." Idahov.Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U. S. 261, 296 (1997)(O'Connor, J., joined by Scalia and Thomas, JJ., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment); see alsoid., at298-299 (Souter, J., joined by Stevens, Ginsburg, andBreyer, JJ., dissenting). Here Verizon sought injunctiveand declaratory relief, alleging that the Commission's orderrequiring payment of reciprocal compensation was pre-empted by the 1996 Act and an FCC ruling. The prayerfor injunctive relief--that state officials be restrained fromenforcing an order in contravention of controlling federallaw--clearly satisfies our "straightforward inquiry." Wehave approved injunction suits against state regulatory com-missioners in like contexts. See,e. g., Prentis v. AtlanticCoast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210, 230 (1908) ("[W]hen the rate isfixed a bill against the commission to restrain the membersfrom enforcing it will not be bad . . . as a suit against a State,and will be the proper form of remedy");Alabama Pub.Serv.

Indeed, Ex parteYoung itself was a suit against state officials (including stateutility commissioners, though only the state attorney gen-eral appealed) to enjoin enforcement of a railroad commission's order requiring a reduction in rates. 209 U. S., at 129.As for Verizon's prayer for declaratory relief: That, to besure, seeks a declaration of thepast, as well as the future,ineffectiveness of the Commission's action, so that the pastfinancial liability of private parties may be affected. Butno past liability of the State, or of any of its commissioners,is at issue. It does not impose upon the State "a monetaryloss resulting from a past breach of a legal duty on the partof the defendant state officials." Edelman v. Jordan, 415U. S. 651, 668 (1974). Insofar as the exposure of the Stateis concerned, the prayer for declaratory relief adds nothingto the prayer for injunction.The Fourth Circuit suggested that Verizon's claim couldnot be brought under Ex parte Young, because the Commission's order was probably not inconsistent with federallaw after all. 240 F. 3d, at 295-297. The court noted thatthe FCC ruling relied upon by Verizon does not seem torequire compensation for ISP traffic; that the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has vacated theruling; and that the Commission interpreted the interconnection agreement under state contract-law principles. It may(or may not) be true that the FCC's since-vacated ruling doesnot support Verizon's claim; it may (or may not) also be truethat state contract law, and not federal law as Verizon contends, applies to disputes regarding the interpretation ofVerizon's agreement. But the inquiry into whether suit liesunder Ex parte Young does not include an analysis of themerits of the claim. See Coeur d'Alene, supra, at 281 ("Anallegation of an ongoing violation of federal law . . . is ordinarily sufficient" (emphasis added)).535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN647Cite as: 535 U. S. 635 (2002)Opinion of the CourtNor does the 1996 Act display any intent to foreclose juris-diction underEx parte Young--as we concluded the IndianGaming Regulatory Act did in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v.Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996). There an Indian Tribe suedthe State of Florida for violating a duty to negotiate imposedunder that Act, 25 U. S. C. $ 2710(d)(3). Congress had specified the means to enforce that duty in $ 2710(d)(7), a provision "intended . . . not only to define, but also to limit signifi-cantly, the duty imposed by $ 2710(d)(3)." 517 U. S., at 74.The "intricate procedures set forth in that provision" pre-scribed that a court could issue an order directing the Stateto negotiate, that it could require the State to submit tomediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of theInterior be notified. Id., at 74-75. We concluded that"this quite modest set of sanctions" displayed an intent notto provide the "more complete and more immediate relief "that would otherwise be available under Ex parte Young.517 U. S., at 75. Permitting suit under Ex parte Youngwas thus inconsistent with the "detailed remedial scheme,"517 U. S., at 74--and the limited one--that Congress hadprescribed to enforce the State's statutory duty to negotiate.The Commission's argument that $ 252(e)(6) constitutes a detailed and exclusive remedial scheme like the one in Seminole Tribe, implicitly excluding Ex parte Young actions, iswithout merit. That section provides only that when statecommissions make certain "determinations," an aggrievedparty may bring suit in federal court to establish compliance with the requirements of $$ 251 and 252. Even withregard to the "determinations" that it covers, it places norestriction on the relief a court can award. And it does noteven say whom the suit is to be brought against--the statecommission, the individual commissioners, or the carriersbenefiting from the state commission's order. The merefact that Congress has authorized federal courts to reviewwhether the Commission's action complies with $$ 251 and252 does not without more "impose upon the State a liabil535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN648 VERIZON MD.

It is so ordered.Justice O'Connor took no part in the consideration ordecision of these cases.Justice Kennedy, concurring.For the reasons well stated by the Court, I agree VerizonMaryland Inc. may proceed against the state commissioners in their official capacity under the doctrine of Ex parteYoung, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). When the plaintiff seeks toenjoin a state utility commissioner from enforcing an orderalleged to violate federal law, the Eleventh Amendmentposes no bar. See Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe of Idaho,521 U. S. 261, 271 (1997) (principal opinion ofKennedy, J.,joined byRehnquist, C. J.).This is unlike the case inIdaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe ofIdaho, supra, where the plaintiffs tried to use Ex parteYoung to divest a State of sovereignty over territory withinits boundaries. In such a case, a " `straightforward inquiry,' "which the Court endorses here, ante, at 645, proves morecomplex. In Coeur d'Alene seven Members of this Courtdescribed Ex parte Young as requiring nothing more thanan allegation of an ongoing violation of federal law and a535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN649Cite as: 535 U. S. 635 (2002)Souter, J., concurringrequest for prospective relief; they divided four to three,however, over whether that deceptively simple test hadbeen met.In my view, our Ex parte Young jurisprudence requirescareful consideration of the sovereign interests of the Stateas well as the obligations of state officials to respect thesupremacy of federal law. See Coeur d'Alene, supra, at267-280 (principal opinion of Kennedy, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J.). I believe this approach, whether stated inexpress terms or not, is the path followed in Coeur d'Aleneas well as in the many cases preceding it. I also believeit necessary. Were it otherwise, the Eleventh Amendment,and not Ex parte Young, would become the legal fiction.The complaint in this litigation, however, parallels thevery suit permitted by Ex parte Young itself. With thisbrief explanation, I join the opinion of the Court.Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg andJustice Breyer join, concurring.I join the Court's opinion, Part III of which rests on aground all of us can agree upon: 1 on the assumption of anEleventh Amendment 2 bar, relief is available under thedoctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). Althoughthat assumption apparently has been made from the start ofthe litigation, I think it is open to some doubt and so writeseparately to question whether these cases even implicatethe Eleventh Amendment.1 In so doing, I set aside for the moment my continuing convictionthat the interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment that a majority ofthis Court has embraced is fundamentally mistaken.

Verizon Maryland Inc., the privateparty "suing" it, does not seek money damages, or the sortof declaratory or injunctive relief that could be had againsta private litigant.3 Nor does Verizon seek an order enjoin-ing the State from enforcing purely state-law rate orders ofdubious constitutionality, the relief requested in Ex parteYoung itself, id., at 129-131. Instead, Verizon claims thatthe Maryland Public Service Commission has wrongly decided a question of federal law 4 under a decisional powerconferred by the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Act), apower that no person may wield. Verizon accordingly seeksnot a simple order of relief running against the state commission, but a different adjudication of a federal question3 Cf. e. g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U. S. 356,360 (2001) (money damages from the State as employer under Title I ofthe Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990); Kimel v. Florida Bd. ofRegents, 528 U.

S. 1 (1890)(money damages for failure to honor state securities). In Seminole Tribe,a majority of this Court observed "that the relief sought by a plaintiffsuing a State is irrelevant to the question whether the suit is barred bythe Eleventh Amendment," 517 U. S., at 58, but this was said in thecontext of a suit for injunctive relief (to enforce a duty to negotiate) asopposed to money damages. My point is that conventional relief of bothsorts (and declaratory relief) is different in kind from the judicial reviewof agency action sought in these cases.4 Whether the interpretation of a reciprocal-compensation provisionin a privately negotiated interconnection agreement presents a federalissue is a different question which neither the Court nor I address at thepresent.535US3 Unit: $U48 [09-22-03 20:54:31] PAGES PGT: OPIN651Cite as: 535 U.

If the District Court should see thingsVerizon's way and reverse the state commission qua federalregulator, what dishonor would be done to the dignity of theState, which has accepted congressionally conferred powerto decide matters of federal law in the first instance?One answer might be that even naming the state commission as a defendant in a suit for declaratory and injunc-tive relief in federal court is an unconstitutional indignity.But I do not see how this could be right. At least wherethe suit does not seek to bar a state authority from applying and enforcing state law, a request for declaratory or in-junctive relief is simply a formality for obtaining a processof review. Cf. 4 K. Davis, Administrative Law Treatise 206(2d ed. 1983) ("[T]he suit for injunction and declaratory judgment in a district court under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 . . . is nowalways available to reach reviewable [federal] administrativeaction in absence of a specific statute making some otherremedy exclusive"). And as for the nominal position of aState as defendant, "[i]t must be regarded as a settled doc-trine of this court . . . `that the question whether a suitis within the prohibition of the 11th Amendment is notalways determined by reference to the nominal parties onthe record.'

If the applicability of the Eleventh Amend-ment pivots on the formalism that a State is found on thewrong side of the "v." in the case name of a regulatory ap-peal, constitutional immunity becomes nothing more than anaccident of captioning practice in utility cases reviewed bycourts. For that matter, the formal and nominal positionof a governmental body in these circumstances is not even5 Judicial review of Federal Communications Commission determinations under the Act is committed directly to the Courts of Appeal. 28U.

While the regulatory commission isgenerally a nominal defendant when a party appeals in thefederal system,6 this is not the uniform practice amongthe States, several of which caption utility cases on judicialreview in terms of the appealing utility.7The only credible response, which Maryland to its creditadvances, is that the State has a strong interest in any casewhere its adjudication of a federal question is challenged.8See Supplemental Brief for Respondents MCI WorldCom,Inc., et al. 21-24. An adverse ruling in one appeal can nodoubt affect the state commission's ruling in future cases.But this is true any time a state court decides a federal question and a successful appeal is made to this Court, and noone thinks that the Eleventh Amendment applies in that instance.

VI ("This Constitution,and the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the supremeLaw of the Land").9 Whether an issue comes from a stateagency or a state-court decision, the federal court is review-ing the State's determination of a question of federal law,and it is neither prudent nor natural to see such review asimpugning the dignity of the State or implicating the States'sovereign immunity in the federal system.9 A possible ground for distinction is that the Supreme Court reviewsstate-court decisions while a federal district court initially reviews statecommission decisions under the Act. The argument would be that theConstitution requires any controversy in which a State's dignitary interests are implicated to be decided by this Court, and no other federal court,as a sign of respect for the State's sovereignty.

The Alabama Supreme Court reversed Shelton's suspended jailsentence, reasoning that this Court's decisions in Argersinger v. Hamlin, 407 U. S. 25, and Scott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367, require provision ofcounsel in any petty offense, misdemeanor, or felony prosecution, Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37, "that actually leads to imprisonment even for abrief period," id., at 33. The State Supreme Court concluded, interalia, that because a defendant may not be imprisoned absent provisionof counsel, Shelton's suspended sentence could never be activated andwas therefore invalid.Held: A suspended sentence that may "end up in the actual deprivationof a person's liberty" may not be imposed unless the defendant wasaccorded "the guiding hand of counsel" in the prosecution for the crimecharged. Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 40. Pp. 660-674.(a) The controlling rule is that "absent a knowing and intelligentwaiver, no person may be imprisoned for any offense . . . unless he wasrepresented by counsel at his trial." Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37.Pp. 661-662.(b) Applying this "actual imprisonment" rule, the Court rejects theargument of its invited amicus curiae that failure to appoint counsel toan indigent defendant does not bar the imposition of a suspended orprobationary sentence upon conviction of a misdemeanor, even thoughthe defendant might be incarcerated in the event probation is revoked.Pp. 662-672.(1) The Sixth Amendment does not permit activation of a suspended sentence upon an indigent defendant's violation of the terms ofhis probation where the State did not provide him counsel during theprosecution of the offense for which he is imprisoned. A suspendedsentence is a prison term imposed for the offense of conviction. Oncethe prison term is triggered, the defendant is incarcerated not for theprobation violation, but for the underlying offense. The uncounseled535US3 Unit: $U49 [09-22-03 20:59:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN655Cite as: 535 U. S. 654 (2002)Syllabusconviction at that point "result[s] in imprisonment," Nichols v. UnitedStates, 511 U. S. 738, 746; it "end[s] up in the actual deprivation of aperson's liberty," Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 40. This is precisely whatthe Sixth Amendment, as interpreted in Argersinger and Scott, does notallow. P. 662.(2) The Court rejects the first of two grounds on which amicusresists this reasoning, i. e., amicus' attempt to align this case with Nichols and with Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U. S. 778. Those decisions donot stand for the broad proposition that sequential proceedings must beanalyzed separately for Sixth Amendment purposes, with the right tostate-appointed counsel triggered only in proceedings that result inimmediate actual imprisonment. The dispositive factor in Gagnon andNichols was not whether incarceration occurred immediately or onlyafter some delay. Rather, the critical point was that the defendant hada recognized right to counsel when adjudicated guilty of the felony forwhich he was imprisoned. See Nichols, 511 U. S., at 743, n. 9. Here,revocation of probation would trigger a prison term imposed for a misdemeanor of which Shelton was found guilty without the aid of counsel,not for a felony conviction for which the right to counsel is unquestioned.See id., at 747; Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 789. Far from supporting amicus'position, Gagnon and Nichols simply highlight that the Sixth Amendment inquiry trains on the stage of the proceedings corresponding toShelton's Circuit Court trial, where his guilt was adjudicated, eligibilityfor imprisonment established, and prison sentence determined. Nichols is further distinguishable because the Court there applied a lessexacting standard allowing a trial court, once guilt has been established,to increase the defendant's sentence based simply on evidence of theunderlying conduct that gave rise to his previous conviction, 511 U. S.,at 748, even if he had never been charged with that conduct, Williamsv. New York, 337 U. S. 241, and even if he had been acquitted of a misdemeanor with the aid of appointed counsel, United States v. Watts, 519U. S. 148, 157. That relaxed standard has no application here, wherethe question is whether the defendant may be jailed absent a conviction credited as reliable because the defendant had access to counsel.Pp. 662-665.(3) Also unpersuasive is amicus' contention that practical considerations weigh against extension of the Sixth Amendment appointedcounsel right to a defendant in Shelton's situation. Based on figuressuggesting that conditional sentences are commonly imposed but rarelyactivated, amicus argues that the appropriate rule would permit imposition of a suspended sentence on an uncounseled defendant and requireappointment of counsel, if at all, only at the probation revocation stage,when incarceration is imminent. That regime would unduly reduce the535US3 Unit: $U49 [09-22-03 20:59:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN656 ALABAMA v. SHELTONSyllabusSixth Amendment's domain. In Alabama, the probation revocationhearing is an informal proceeding, at which the defendant has no rightto counsel, and the court no obligation to observe customary rules ofevidence. More significant, the defendant may not challenge the validity or reliability of the underlying conviction. A hearing so timed andstructured cannot compensate for the absence of trial counsel andthereby bring Shelton's sentence within constitutional bounds. Nordoes this Court agree with amicus that its holding will substantiallylimit the States' ability to impose probation. Most jurisdictions alreadyprovide a state-law right to appointed counsel more generous than thatafforded by the Federal Constitution, while simultaneously preservingthe option of probationary punishment. See 511 U. S., at 748-749, n. 12.Even if amicus is correct that some States cannot afford the costs of theCourt's rule, those jurisdictions have recourse to the option of pretrialprobation, whereby the prosecutor and defendant agree to the defendant's participation in a pretrial rehabilitation program, which includesconditions typical of post-trial probation, and the adjudication of guiltand imposition of sentence for the underlying offense occur only ifthe defendant breaches those conditions. This system reserves theappointed-counsel requirement for the few cases in which incarcerationproves necessary, see Gagnon, 411 U. S., at 784, while respecting theconstitutional imperative that no person be imprisoned unless he wasrepresented by counsel, Argersinger, 407 U. S., at 37. Pp. 665-672.(c) The Court does not rule on Alabama's argument that, althoughthe Sixth Amendment bars activation of a suspended sentence for anuncounseled conviction, the Constitution does not prohibit, as a methodof effectuating probationary punishment, the imposition of a suspendedsentence that can never be enforced. There is not so much as a hint inthe Alabama Supreme Court's decision that Shelton's probation term isseparable from the prison term to which it was tethered. Absent anyprior presentation of the novel position the State now takes, this Courtresists passing on it in the first instance. It is for the State SupremeCourt to consider before this Court does whether the suspended sentence alone is invalid, leaving Shelton's probation term freestanding andindependently effective.
