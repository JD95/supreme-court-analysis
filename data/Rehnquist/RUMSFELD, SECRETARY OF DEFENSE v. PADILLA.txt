Respondent Jose Padilla is a United States citizen de-tained by the Department of Defense pursuant to the President's determination that he is an "enemy combatant" whoconspired with al Qaeda to carry out terrorist attacks in theUnited States. We confront two questions: First, did Padillaproperly file his habeas petition in the Southern District ofNew York; and second, did the President possess authorityto detain Padilla militarily. We answer the threshold question in the negative and thus do not reach the second ques-tion presented.Because we do not decide the merits, we only briefly recount the relevant facts. On May 8, 2002, Padilla flew fromPakistan to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.

The Presidentalso made several factual findings explaining his decision todesignate Padilla an enemy combatant.2 Based on thesefindings, the President concluded that it is "consistent withU.

Id., at 6a.1 The AUMF provides in relevant part: "[T]he President is authorizedto use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aidedthe terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harboredsuch organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons." 115 Stat. 224.2 In short, the President "[d]etermine[d]" that Padilla (1) "is closely associated with al Qaeda, an international terrorist organization with whichthe United States is at war;" (2) that he "engaged in . . . hostile andwar-like acts, including . . . preparation for acts of international terrorism"against the United States; (3) that he "possesses intelligence" about alQaeda that "would aid U.

S. 1173 (2004).7The question whether the Southern District has jurisdiction over Padilla's habeas petition breaks down into two re-lated subquestions. First, who is the proper respondent tothat petition? And second, does the Southern District havejurisdiction over him or her? We address these questionsin turn. IThe federal habeas statute straightforwardly providesthat the proper respondent to a habeas petition is "theperson who has custody over [the petitioner]." 28 U. S. C.$ 2242; see also $ 2243 ("The writ, or order to show causeshall be directed to the person having custody of the persondetained"). The consistent use of the definite article in reference to the custodian indicates that there is generally onlyone proper respondent to a given prisoner's habeas petition.6 Section 4001(a) provides that "[n]o citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained by the United States except pursuant to an Act ofCongress."7 The word "jurisdiction," of course, is capable of different interpretations. We use it in the sense that it is used in the habeas statute, 28U. S. C. $ 2241(a), and not in the sense of subject-matter jurisdiction of theDistrict Court.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN435Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThis custodian, moreover, is "the person" with the ability toproduce the prisoner's body before the habeas court. Ibid.We summed up the plain language of the habeas statute over100 years ago in this way: "[T]hese provisions contemplate aproceeding against some person who has the immediate cus-tody of the party detained, with the power to produce thebody of such party before the court or judge, that he may beliberated if no sufficient reason is shown to the contrary."Wales v. Whitney, 114 U. S. 564, 574 (1885) (emphasis added);see alsoBraden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410U.

[the] jailer,' "quotingIn re Jackson, 15 Mich. 417, 439-440 (1867)).In accord with the statutory language and Wales' immedi-ate custodian rule, longstanding practice confirms that in habeas challenges to present physical confinement--"core chal-lenges"--the default rule is that the proper respondent is thewarden of the facility where the prisoner is being held, notthe Attorney General or some other remote supervisory of-ficial. See,e. g., Hogan v. Hanks, 97 F. 3d 189, 190 (CA71996); Brittingham v. United States, 982 F. 2d 378, 379 (CA91992);Blango v. Thornburgh, 942 F. 2d 1487, 1491-1492(CA10 1991) (per curiam); Brennan v.

S. 188 (1948), we left open the questionwhether the Attorney General is a proper respondent to a habeas petitionfiled by an alien detained pending deportation. Id., at 189, 193. Thelower courts have divided on this question, with the majority applying theimmediate custodian rule and holding that the Attorney General is not aproper respondent. Compare Robledo-Gonzales v.

See Al-Marri v. Rumsfeld, 360 F. 3d 707, 708-709(CA7 2004) (holding in the case of an alleged enemy combat-ant detained at the Consolidated Naval Brig, the properrespondent is Commander Marr, not Secretary Rumsfeld);Monk v.

S. C. $ 951(c) (providing that the commanding officer of amilitary correctional facility "shall have custody and control"of the prisoners confined therein).

The Second Circuit discussed the question at some length,but ultimately reserved judgment in Henderson v. INS, 157 F. 3d 106(1998). Because the issue is not before us today, we again decline to resolve it.9 We have long implicitly recognized an exception to the immediate custodian rule in the military context where an American citizen is detainedoutside the territorial jurisdiction of any district court.

S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the CourtFirst, Padilla notes that the substantive holding ofWales--that a person released on his own recognizance isnot "in custody" for habeas purposes--was disapproved inHensley v. Municipal Court, San Jose-Milpitas JudicialDist., Santa Clara Cty., 411 U. S. 345, 350, n. 8 (1973), aspart of this Court's expanding definition of "custody" underthe habeas statute.10 Padilla seems to contend, and the dissent agrees, post, at 461-462, that because we no longer require physical detention as a prerequisite to habeas relief,the immediate custodian rule, too, must no longer bind us,even in challenges to physical custody. That argument, asthe Seventh Circuit aptly concluded, is a "non sequitur."Al-Marri, supra, at 711. That our understanding of custodyhas broadened to include restraints short of physical confinement does nothing to undermine the rationale or statutory foundation of Wales' immediate custodian rule wherephysical custody is at issue. Indeed, as the cases citedabove attest, it has consistently been applied in this corehabeas context within the United States.11The Court of Appeals' view that we have relaxed the immediate custodian rule in cases involving prisoners detainedfor "other than federal criminal violations," and that in suchcases the proper respondent is the person exercising the"legal reality of control" over the petitioner, suffers from thesame logical flaw. 352 F. 3d, at 705, 707. Certainly thestatute itself makes no such distinction based on the sourceof the physical detention. Nor does our case law support adeviation from the immediate custodian rule here. Rather,10 For other landmark cases addressing the meaning of "in custody"under the habeas statute, see Garlotte v. Fordice, 515 U. S. 39 (1995); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968);Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963).11 Furthermore, Congress has not substantively amended in more than130 years the relevant portions of the habeas statute on which Walesbased its immediate custodian rule, despite uniform case law embracingthe Wales rule in challenges to physical custody.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN438 RUMSFELD v. PADILLAOpinion of the Courtthe cases cited by Padilla stand for the simple propositionthat the immediate physical custodian rule, by its terms,does not apply when a habeas petitioner challenges some-thing other than his present physical confinement.In Braden, for example, an Alabama prisoner filed a ha-beas petition in the Western District of Kentucky. He didnot contest the validity of the Alabama conviction for whichhe was confined, but instead challenged a detainer lodgedagainst him in Kentucky state court. Noting that petitionersought to challenge a "confinement that would be imposedin the future," we held that petitioner was "in custody" inKentucky by virtue of the detainer. 410 U. S., at 488-489.In these circumstances, the Court held that the proper respondent was not the prisoner's immediate physical custodian (the Alabama warden), but was instead the Kentuckycourt in which the detainer was lodged. This made sensebecause the Alabama warden was not "the person who [held]him in what [was] alleged to be unlawful custody." Id., at494-495 (citing Wales, 114 U. S., at 574); Hensley, supra, at351, n. 9 (observing that the petitioner in Braden "was in thecustody of Kentucky officials for purposes of his habeas corpus action"). Under Braden, then, a habeas petitioner whochallenges a form of "custody" other than present physicalconfinement may name as respondent the entity or personwho exercises legal control with respect to the challenged"custody." But nothing in Braden supports departing fromthe immediate custodian rule in the traditional context ofchallenges to present physical confinement. See Al-Marri,supra, at 711-712; Monk, supra, at 369. To the contrary,Braden cited Wales favorably and reiterated the traditionalrule that a prisoner seeking release from confinement mustsue his "jailer." 410 U. S., at 495 (internal quotation marksomitted).For the same reason, Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341 (1972),does not aid Padilla. Strait involved an inactive reservistdomiciled in California who filed a $ 2241 petition seeking542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN439Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the Courtrelief from his military obligations. We noted that the reservist's "nominal" custodian was a commanding officer inIndiana who had charge of petitioner's Army records. Id.,at 344. As in Braden, the immediate custodian rule had noapplication because petitioner was not challenging any present physical confinement.In Braden and Strait, the immediate custodian rule did notapply because there was no immediate physical custodianwith respect to the "custody" being challenged. That is notthe case here: Commander Marr exercises day-to-day controlover Padilla's physical custody. We have never intimatedthat a habeas petitioner could name someone other than hisimmediate physical custodian as respondent simply becausethe challenged physical custody does not arise out of a criminal conviction. Nor can we do so here just because Padilla'sphysical confinement stems from a military order by thePresident.It follows that neither Braden nor Strait supports theCourt of Appeals' conclusion that Secretary Rumsfeld is theproper respondent because he exercises the "legal reality ofcontrol" over Padilla.12 As we have explained, identificationof the party exercising legal control only comes into playwhen there is no immediate physical custodian with respectto the challenged "custody." In challenges to present physical confinement, we reaffirm that the immediate custodian,not a supervisory official who exercises legal control, isthe proper respondent. If the "legal control" test appliedto physical-custody challenges, a convicted prisoner wouldbe able to name the State or the Attorney General as a respondent to a $ 2241 petition. As the statutory language,12 The Court of Appeals reasoned that "only [the Secretary]--not Commander Marr--could inform the President that further restraint of Padilla as an enemy combatant is no longer necessary." 352 F. 3d 695, 707(CA2 2003). Justice Stevens' dissent echoes this argument. Post, at461-462.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN440 RUMSFELD v. PADILLAOpinion of the Courtestablished practice, and our precedent demonstrate, that isnot the case.13At first blush Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283 (1944), mightseem to lend support to Padilla's "legal control" argument.There, a Japanese-American citizen interned in California bythe War Relocation Authority (WRA) sought relief by filinga $ 2241 petition in the Northern District of California, nam-ing as a respondent her immediate custodian. After shefiled the petition, however, the Government moved her toUtah. Thus, the prisoner's immediate physical custodianwas no longer within the jurisdiction of the District Court.We held, nonetheless, that the Northern District "acquiredjurisdiction in this case and that [Endo's] removal . . . did notcause it to lose jurisdiction where a person in whose custodyshe is remains within the district." Id., at 306. We heldthat, under these circumstances, the assistant director of theWRA, who resided in the Northern District, would be an"appropriate respondent" to whom the District Court coulddirect the writ. Id., at 304-305.WhileEndo did involve a petitioner challenging her present physical confinement, it did not, as Padilla and JusticeStevens contend, hold that such a petitioner may properlyname as respondent someone other than the immediate phys-ical custodian.Post, at 461-462 (citing Endo as supportinga "more functional approach" that allows habeas petitioners13 Even less persuasive is the Court of Appeals' and the dissent's beliefthat Secretary Rumsfeld's "unique" and "pervasive" personal involvementin authorizing Padilla's detention justifies naming him as the respondent.352 F. 3d, at 707-708 (noting that the Secretary "was charged by the President in the June 9 Order with detaining Padilla" and that the Secretary"determined that Padilla would be sent to the brig in South Carolina");post, at 462. If personal involvement were the standard, "then the prosecutor, the trial judge, or the governor would be named as respondents" incriminal habeas cases. Al-Marri v. Rumsfeld, 360 F. 3d 707, 711 (CA72004). As the Seventh Circuit correctly held, the proper respondent isthe person responsible for maintaining--not authorizing--the custody ofthe prisoner. Ibid.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN441Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the Courtto name as respondent an individual with "control" over thepetitioner). Rather, the Court's holding that the writ couldbe directed to a supervisory official came not in our holdingthat the District Court initially acquired jurisdiction--it didso because Endo properly named her immediate custodianand filed in the district of confinement--but in our holdingthat the District Court could effectively grant habeas reliefdespite the Government-procured absence of petitioner fromthe Northern District.14 Thus, Endo stands for the impor-tant but limited proposition that when the Governmentmoves a habeas petitioner after she properly files a petitionnaming her immediate custodian, the District Court retainsjurisdiction and may direct the writ to any respondentwithin its jurisdiction who has legal authority to effectuatethe prisoner's release.Endo's holding does not help respondents here. Padillawas moved from New York to South Carolina before his lawyer filed a habeas petition on his behalf. Unlike the DistrictCourt inEndo, therefore, the Southern District never ac-quired jurisdiction over Padilla's petition.Padilla's argument reduces to a request for a new excep-tion to the immediate custodian rule based upon the "uniquefacts" of this case. While Padilla's detention is undeniablyunique in many respects, it is at bottom a simple challengeto physical custody imposed by the Executive--the tradi-tional core of the Great Writ. There is no indication thatthere was any attempt to manipulate behind Padilla's trans-fer--he was taken to the same facility where other al Qaedamembers were already being held, and the Government didnot attempt to hide from Padilla's lawyer where it had takenhim. Infra, at 449-450, and n. 17; post, at 454 (Kennedy,14 As we explained: "Th[e] objective [of habeas relief] may be in no wayimpaired or defeated by the removal of the prisoner from the territorialjurisdiction of the District Court. That end may be served and the decreeof the court made effective if a respondent who has custody of the [petitioner] is within reach of the court's process." 323 U. S., at 307.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN442 RUMSFELD v. PADILLAOpinion of the CourtJ., concurring). His detention is thus not unique in any waythat would provide arguable basis for a departure from theimmediate custodian rule. Accordingly, we hold that Com-mander Marr, not Secretary Rumsfeld, is Padilla's custodianand the proper respondent to his habeas petition.IIWe turn now to the second subquestion. District courtsare limited to granting habeas relief "within their respectivejurisdictions." 28 U. S. C. $ 2241(a). We have interpretedthis language to require "nothing more than that the courtissuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian." Bra-den, 410 U. S., at 495. Thus, jurisdiction over Padilla's habeas petition lies in the Southern District only if it has ju-risdiction over Commander Marr. We conclude it does not.Congress added the limiting clause--"within their respec-tive jurisdictions"--to the habeas statute in 1867 to avertthe "inconvenient [and] potentially embarrassing" possibilitythat "every judge anywhere [could] issue the Great Writ onbehalf of applicants far distantly removed from the courtswhereon they sat." Carbo v. United States, 364 U. S. 611,617 (1961). Accordingly, with respect to habeas petitions"designed to relieve an individual from oppressive confinement," the traditional rule has always been that the GreatWrit is "issuable only in the district of confinement."Id.,at 618.Other portions of the habeas statute support this common-sense reading of $ 2241(a). For example, if a petitionerseeks habeas relief in the court of appeals, or from this Courtor a Justice thereof, the petition must "state the reasons fornot making application to the district court of the district inwhich the applicant is held." 28 U. S. C. $ 2242 (emphasesadded). Moreover, the court of appeals, this Court, or a Jus-tice thereof "may decline to entertain an application for awrit of habeas corpus and may transfer the application . . .tothe district court having jurisdiction to entertain it."542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN443Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the Court$ 2241(b) (emphasis added). The Federal Rules similarlyprovide that an "application for a writ of habeas corpus mustbe made to the appropriate district court." Fed. Rule App.Proc. 22(a) (emphasis added).Congress has also legislated against the background of the"district of confinement" rule by fashioning explicit exceptions to the rule in certain circumstances. For instance,$ 2241(d) provides that when a petitioner is serving a statecriminal sentence in a State that contains more than one federal district, he may file a habeas petition not only "in thedistrict court for the district wherein [he] is in custody," butalso "in the district court for the district within which theState court was held which convicted and sentenced him";and "each of such district courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain the application." Similarly, until Congress directed federal criminal prisoners to file certain postconviction petitions in the sentencing courts by adding $ 2255to the habeas statute, federal prisoners could litigate suchcollateral attacks only in the district of confinement. SeeUnited States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, 212-219 (1952).Both of these provisions would have been unnecessary if,as the Court of Appeals believed, $ 2241's general habeasprovisions permit a prisoner to file outside the district ofconfinement.The plain language of the habeas statute thus confirms thegeneral rule that for core habeas petitions challenging present physical confinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district:the district of confinement. Despite this ample statutoryand historical pedigree, Padilla contends, and the Court ofAppeals held, that the district of confinement rule no longerapplies to core habeas challenges. Rather, Padilla, as wellas today's dissenters, post, at 462-464, urge that our decisions in Braden and Strait stand for the proposition that jurisdiction will lie in any district in which the respondent isamenable to service of process. We disagree.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN444 RUMSFELD v. PADILLAOpinion of the CourtPrior to Braden, we had held that habeas jurisdiction de-pended on the presence of both the petitioner and his custodian within the territorial confines of the district court. SeeAhrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188, 190-192 (1948). By allowingan Alabama prisoner to challenge a Kentucky detainer in theWestern District of Kentucky,Braden changed course andheld that habeas jurisdiction requires only "that the courtissuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian." 410U. S., at 495.But we fail to see how Braden's requirement of jurisdictionover the respondent alters the district of confinement rulefor challenges to present physical custody. Braden itself didnot involve such a challenge; rather, Braden challenged hisfuture confinement in Kentucky by suing his Kentucky custodian. We reasoned that "[u]nder these circumstances itwould serve no useful purpose to apply the Ahrens rule andrequire that the action be brought in Alabama." Id., at 499.In habeas challenges to present physical confinement, by contrast, the district of confinement is synonymous with thedistrict court that has territorial jurisdiction over the properrespondent. This is because, as we have held, the immediate custodian rule applies to core habeas challenges to present physical custody. By definition, the immediate custodian and the prisoner reside in the same district.Rather than focusing on the holding and historical contextof Braden, Justice Stevens, post, at 462, like the Court ofAppeals, seizes on dicta in which we referred to "service ofprocess" to contend that the Southern District could assertjurisdiction over Secretary Rumsfeld under New York'slong-arm statute. See Braden, 410 U. S., at 495 ("So long asthe custodian can be reached by service of process, the courtcan issue a writ `within its jurisdiction' . . . even if the prisoner himself is confined outside the court's territorial jurisdiction"). But that dicta did not indicate that a custodianmay be served with process outside of the district court'sterritorial jurisdiction. To the contrary, the facts and hold542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN445Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the Courting of Braden dictate the opposite inference. Braden servedhis Kentucky custodian in Kentucky. Accordingly, we concluded that the Western District of Kentucky had jurisdic-tion over the petition "since the respondent was properlyserved in that district." Id., at 500 (emphasis added); seealsoEndo, 323 U. S., at 304-305 (noting that the court couldissue the writ to a WRA official "whose office is at San Francisco, which is in the jurisdiction of the [Northern District ofCalifornia]"). Thus,Braden in no way authorizes districtcourts to employ long-arm statutes to gain jurisdiction overcustodians who are outside of their territorial jurisdiction.See Al-Marri, 360 F. 3d, at 711; Guerra, 786 F. 2d, at417. Indeed, in stating its holding, Braden favorably citesSchlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971), a case squarelyholding that the custodian's absence from the territorial jurisdiction of the district court is fatal to habeas jurisdiction.410 U. S., at 500. Thus, Braden does not derogate from thetraditional district of confinement rule for core habeas petitions challenging present physical custody.The Court of Appeals also thought Strait supported itslong-arm approach to habeas jurisdiction. But Strait offerseven less help than Braden. In Strait, we held that theNorthern District of California had jurisdiction over Strait's"nominal" custodian--the commanding officer of the Armyrecords center--even though he was physically located in Indiana. We reasoned that the custodian was "present" inCalifornia "through the officers in the hierarchy of the command who processed [Strait's] application for discharge."406 U. S., at 345. The Strait Court contrasted its broadview of "presence" in the case of a nominal custodian with a" `commanding officer who is responsible for the day to daycontrol of his subordinates,' " who would be subject to habeasjurisdiction only in the district where he physically resides.Ibid. (quoting Arlen v. Laird, 451 F. 2d 684, 687 (CA2 1971)).The Court of Appeals, much like Justice Stevens' dissent, reasoned that Secretary Rumsfeld, in the same way as542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN446 RUMSFELD v. PADILLAOpinion of the CourtStrait's commanding officer, was "present" in the SouthernDistrict through his subordinates who took Padilla into military custody. 352 F. 3d, at 709-710; post, at 462. Wethink not.Strait simply has no application to the present case.Strait predated Braden, so the then-applicable Ahrens rulerequired that both the petitioner and his custodian be pres-ent in California. Thus, the only question was whetherStrait's commanding officer was present in California not-withstanding his physical absence from the district. Distinguishing Schlanger, supra, we held that it would "exalt fic-tion over reality" to require Strait to sue his "nominalcustodian" in Indiana when Strait had always resided in Cali-fornia and had his only meaningful contacts with the Armythere. 406 U. S., at 344-346. Only under these limited cir-cumstances did we invoke concepts of personal jurisdictionto hold that the custodian was "present" in Californiathrough the actions of his agents.Id., at 345.Here, by contrast, Padilla seeks to challenge his present physical custody in South Carolina. Because the im-mediate custodian rule applies to such habeas challenges,the proper respondent is Commander Marr, who is also pres-ent in South Carolina. There is thus no occasion to designate a "nominal" custodian and determine whether he or sheis "present" in the same district as petitioner.15 Under Braden and the district of confinement rule, as we have ex-plained, Padilla must file his habeas action in South Carolina.Were we to extend Strait's limited exception to the territo-rial nature of habeas jurisdiction to the context of physicalcustody challenges, we would undermine, if not negate, thepurpose of Congress in amending the habeas statute in 1867.The proviso that district courts may issue the writ only"within their respective jurisdictions" forms an important15 In other words, Commander Marr is the equivalent of the "commanding officer [with] day to day control" that we distinguished in Strait. 406U. S., at 345 (internal quotation marks omitted).542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN447Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the Courtcorollary to the immediate custodian rule in challenges topresent physical custody under $ 2241. Together they compose a simple rule that has been consistently applied in thelower courts, including in the context of military detentions:Whenever a $ 2241 habeas petitioner seeks to challenge hispresent physical custody within the United States, he shouldname his warden as respondent and file the petition in thedistrict of confinement. SeeAl-Marri, supra, at 710, 712(alleged enemy combatant detained at Consolidated NavalBrig must file petition in the District of South Carolina; col-lecting cases dismissing $ 2241 petitions filed outside the district of confinement); Monk, 793 F. 2d, at 369 (court-martialconvict must file in district of confinement).16This rule, derived from the terms of the habeas statute,serves the important purpose of preventing forum shoppingby habeas petitioners. Without it, a prisoner could name ahigh-level supervisory official as respondent and then suethat person wherever he is amenable to long-arm jurisdic-tion. The result would be rampant forum shopping, districtcourts with overlapping jurisdiction, and the very inconven-ience, expense, and embarrassment Congress sought to avoidwhen it added the jurisdictional limitation 137 years ago.IIIJustice Stevens' dissent, not unlike the Court of Ap-peals' decision, rests on the mistaken belief that we have16 As a corollary to the previously referenced exception to the immediatecustodian rule, n. 8, supra, we have similarly relaxed the district of confinement rule when "American citizens confined overseas (and thus outsidethe territory of any district court) have sought relief in habeas corpus."Braden, 410 U. S., at 498 (citing cases). In such cases, we have allowedthe petitioner to name as respondent a supervisory official and file thepetition in the district where the respondent resides. Burns v. Wilson,346 U. S. 137 (1953) (courts-martial convicts held in Guam sued Secretaryof Defense in the District of Columbia); United States ex rel. Toth v.Quarles, 350 U. S. 11 (1955) (court-martial convict held in Korea sued Secretary of the Air Force in the District of Columbia).542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN448 RUMSFELD v. PADILLAOpinion of the Courtmade various exceptions to the immediate custodian and dis-trict of confinement rules whenever "exceptional," " `special,' " or "unusual" cases have arisen. Post, at 455, 458, 462,n. 5. We have addressed most of his contentions in the foregoing discussion, but we briefly touch on a few additionalpoints.Apparently drawing a loose analogy to Endo, JusticeStevens asks us to pretend that Padilla and his immediatecustodian were present in the Southern District at the timecounsel filed the instant habeas petition, thus rendering ju-risdiction proper.Post, at 458-459. The dissent assertsthat the Government "depart[ed] from the time-honoredpractice of giving one's adversary fair notice of an intent topresent an important motion to the court," when on June 9it moved ex parte to vacate the material witness warrant andallegedly failed to immediately inform counsel of its intent totransfer Padilla to military custody in South Carolina. Post,at 459; cf. n. 3, supra. Constructing a hypothetical "scenario," the dissent contends that if counsel had been immediately informed, she "would have filed the habeas applicationthen and there," while Padilla remained in the Southern District, "rather than waiting two days." Post, at 458. Therefore, Justice Stevens concludes, the Government's allegedmisconduct "justifies treating the habeas application as thefunctional equivalent of one filed two days earlier." Post,at 459 ("[W]e should not permit the Government to obtain a tactical advantage as a consequence of an ex parteproceeding").The dissent cites no authority whatsoever for its extraordinary proposition that a district court can exercise statutoryjurisdiction based on a series of events that did not occur, orthat jurisdiction might be premised on "punishing" allegedGovernment misconduct. The lower courts--unlike the dissent--did not perceive any hint of Government misconductor bad faith that would warrant extending Endo to a casewhere both the petitioner and his immediate custodian were542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN449Cite as: 542 U. S. 426 (2004)Opinion of the Courtoutside of the district at the time of filing. Not surprisingly,then, neither Padilla nor the lower courts relied on the dissent's counterfactual theory to argue that habeas jurisdictionwas proper. Finding it contrary to our well-establishedprecedent, we are not persuaded either.17The dissent contends that even if we do not indulge itshypothetical scenario, the Court has made "numerous exceptions" to the immediate custodian and district of confinementrules, rendering our bright-line rule "far from bright."Post, at 460. Yet the dissent cannot cite a single case inwhich we have deviated from the longstanding rule we reaffirm today--that is, a case in which we allowed a habeaspetitioner challenging his present physical custody withinthe United States to name as respondent someone other than17 On a related note, the dissent argues that the facts as they actuallyexisted at the time of filing should not matter, because "what matters forpresent purposes are the facts available to [counsel] at the time of filing."Post, at 459, n. 3. According to the dissent, because the Government"shrouded . . . in secrecy" the location of Padilla's military custody, counselwas entitled to file in the district where Padilla's presence was "last officially confirmed." Ibid. As with the argument addressed above, neitherPadilla nor the District Court--which was much closer to the facts ofthe case than we are--or the Court of Appeals ever suggested that theGovernment concealed Padilla's whereabouts from counsel, much less contended that such concealment was the basis for habeas jurisdiction in theSouthern District. And even if this were a valid legal argument, the record simply does not support the dissent's inference of Government secrecy.The dissent relies solely on a letter written by Padilla's counsel. In thatsame letter, however, counsel states that she "was informed [on June 10]"that her client had been taken into custody by the Department of Defenseand "detain[ed] at a naval military prison." App. 66. When counsel filedPadilla's habeas petition on June 11, she averred that "Padilla is being heldin segregation at the high-security Consolidated Naval Brig in Charleston,South Carolina." Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. 02 Civ. 4445(SDNY), p. 2, Record, Doc. 1. The only reasonable inference, particularlyin light of Padilla's failure to argue to the contrary, is that counsel waswell aware of Padilla's presence in South Carolina when she filed the habeas petition, not that the Government "shrouded" Padilla's whereaboutsin secrecy.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN450 RUMSFELD v.

We do not think Congress in-tended such a result.Finally, the dissent urges us to bend the jurisdictionalrules because the merits of this case are indisputably of "profound importance," post, at 455, 460-461. But it is surely18 Instead, Justice Stevens, like the Court of Appeals, relies heavilyon Braden, Strait, and other cases involving challenges to something otherthan present physical custody. Post, at 461-464, and n. 4; post, at 461, n. 4(citing Garlotte v. Fordice, 515 U.

Secretary of the Army, 477 F. 2d 1251 (CADC 1973) (allowing aninactive reservist challenging his military status to name the Secretary ofthe Army as respondent)). Demjanjuk v. Meese, 784 F. 2d 1114 (CADC1986), on which the dissent relies, post, at 458, is similarly unhelpful:When, as in that case, a prisoner is held in an undisclosed location by anunknown custodian, it is impossible to apply the immediate custodian anddistrict of confinement rules. That is not the case here, where the identity of the immediate custodian and the location of the appropriate districtcourt are clear.The dissent also cites two cases in which a state prisoner proceedingunder 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 named as respondent the State's officer in chargeof penal institutions. Post, at 461, n. 4 (citing California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U. S. 499 (1995); Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U. S.284 (1986)). But such cases do not support Padilla's cause. First of all,the respondents did not challenge their designation as inconsistent withthe immediate custodian rule. More to the point, Congress has authorized $ 2254 petitioners challenging present physical custody to name eitherthe warden or the chief state penal officer as a respondent. Rule 2(a) ofthe Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States DistrictCourts; Advisory Committee's Note on Rule 2(a), 28 U. S. C., pp. 469-470(adopted in 1976). Congress has made no such provision for $ 2241 petitioners like Padilla.542US2 Unit: $U73 [11-01-06 18:21:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN451Cite as: 542 U.
