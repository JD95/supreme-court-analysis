Court.We are here presented with the question whether theFourth Amendment requires that a lawfully seized defendantmust be advised that he is "free to go" before his consentto search will be recognized as voluntary. We hold that itdoes not.This case arose on a stretch of Interstate 70 north of Dayton, Ohio, where the posted speed limit was 45 miles perhour because of construction. Respondent Robert D. Robinette was clocked at 69 miles per hour as he drove his caralong this stretch of road, and was stopped by Deputy RogerNewsome of the Montgomery County Sheriff 's Office. Newsome asked for and was handed Robinette's driver's license,and he ran a computer check which indicated that Robinettehad no previous violations. Newsome then asked Robinetteto step out of his car, turned on his mounted video camera,issued a verbal warning to Robinette, and returned hislicense.At this point, Newsome asked, "One question before youget gone: [A]re you carrying any illegal contraband in yourof Nevada, Jeffrey R.

Any weapons of any kind, drugs, anything like that?"App. to Brief for Respondent 2 (internal quotation marksomitted). Robinette answered "no" to these questions, afterwhich Deputy Newsome asked if he could search the car.Robinette consented. In the car, Deputy Newsome discovered a small amount of marijuana and, in a film container, apill which was later determined to be methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Robinette was then arrested andcharged with knowing possession of a controlled substance,MDMA, in violation of Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2925.11(A)(1993).Before trial, Robinette unsuccessfully sought to suppressthis evidence. He then pleaded "no contest," and was foundguilty. On appeal, the Ohio Court of Appeals reversed, ruling that the search resulted from an unlawful detention.The Supreme Court of Ohio, by a divided vote, affirmed. 73Ohio St. 3d 650, 653 N. E. 2d 695 (1995). In its opinion, thatcourt established a bright-line prerequisite for consensualinterrogation under these circumstances:"The right, guaranteed by the federal and Ohio Constitutions, to be secure in one's person and property re-quires that citizens stopped for traffic offenses be clearlyinformed by the detaining officer when they are free togo after a valid detention, before an officer attempts toengage in a consensual interrogation. Any attempt atconsensual interrogation must be preceded by thephrase `At this time you legally are free to go' or bywords of similar import." Id., at 650-651, 653 N. E. 2d,at 696.We granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1157 (1996), to review thisper se rule, and we now reverse.We must first consider whether we have jurisdiction toreview the Ohio Supreme Court's decision. Respondentcontends that we lack such jurisdiction because the Ohiodecision rested upon the Ohio Constitution, in addition to the519US1$$5H 06-02-99 14:40:30 PAGES OPINPGT37Cite as: 519 U. S. 33 (1996)Opinion of the CourtFederal Constitution. Under Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S.1032 (1983), when "a state court decision fairly appears torest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with thefederal law, and when the adequacy and independence of anypossible state law ground is not clear from the face of theopinion, we will accept as the most reasonable explanationthat the state court decided the case the way it did becauseit believed that federal law required it to do so." *Id., at1040-1041. Although the opinion below mentions Art. I,$ 14, of the Ohio Constitution in passing (a section whichreads identically to the Fourth Amendment), the opinionclearly relies on federal law nevertheless. Indeed, the onlycases it discusses or even cites are federal cases, except forone state case which itself applies the Federal Constitution.Our jurisdiction is not defeated by the fact that these citations appear in the body of the opinion, while, under Ohiolaw, "[the] Supreme Court speaks as a court only throughthe syllabi of its cases." See Ohio v. Gallagher, 425 U. S.257, 259 (1976). When the syllabus, as here, speaks only ingeneral terms of "the federal and Ohio Constitutions," it ispermissible for us to turn to the body of the opinion to discern the grounds for decision. Zacchini v. Scripps-HowardBroadcasting Co., 433 U. S. 562, 566 (1977).Respondent Robinette also contends that we may notreach the question presented in the petition because theSupreme Court of Ohio also held, as set out in the syllabusparagraph (1):"When the motivation behind a police officer's continueddetention of a person stopped for a traffic violation isnot related to the purpose of the original, constitutionalstop, and when that continued detention is not based onany articulable facts giving rise to a suspicion of some*Respondent and his amici ask us to take this opportunity to departfrom Michigan v. Long. We are no more persuaded by this argumentnow than we were two Terms ago, see Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1(1995), and we again reaffirm the Long presumption.519US1$$5H 06-02-99 14:40:30 PAGES OPINPGT38 OHIO v. ROBINETTEOpinion of the Courtseparate illegal activity justifying an extension of thedetention, the continued detention constitutes an illegalseizure." 73 Ohio St. 3d, at 650, 653 N. E. 2d, at 696.In reliance on this ground, the Supreme Court of Ohio heldthat when Newsome returned to Robinette's car and askedhim to get out of the car, after he had determined in hisown mind not to give Robinette a ticket, the detention thenbecame unlawful.Respondent failed to make any such argument in his briefin opposition to certiorari. See this Court's Rule 15.2. Webelieve the issue as to the continuing legality of the detentionis a "predicate to an intelligent resolution" of the questionpresented, and therefore "fairly included therein." ThisCourt's Rule 14.1(a); Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U. S. 252, 258-259, n. 5 (1980). The parties have briefed this issue, and weproceed to decide it.We think that under our recent decision inWhren v.United States, 517 U. S. 806 (1996) (decided after theSupreme Court of Ohio decided the present case), the sub-jective intentions of the officer did not make the continueddetention of respondent illegal under the Fourth Amend-ment. As we made clear in Whren, " `the fact that [an] officer does not have the state of mind which is hypothecatedby the reasons which provide the legal justification for theofficer's action does not invalidate the action taken as longas the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify that action.'. . . Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis."Id., at 813 (quotingScott v. United States, 436 U. S. 128, 138 (1978)). And thereis no question that, in light of the admitted probable causeto stop Robinette for speeding, Deputy Newsome was objectively justified in asking Robinette to get out of the car,subjective thoughts notwithstanding. SeePennsylvania v.Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 111, n. 6 (1977) ("We hold . . . thatonce a motor vehicle has been lawfully detained for a trafficviolation, the police officers may order the driver to get out519US1$$5H 06-02-99 14:40:30 PAGES OPINPGT39Cite as: 519 U. S. 33 (1996)Opinion of the Courtof the vehicle without violating the Fourth Amendment'sproscription of unreasonable searches and seizures").We now turn to the merits of the question presented. Wehave long held that the "touchstone of the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness." Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U. S. 248,250 (1991). Reasonableness, in turn, is measured in objec-tive terms by examining the totality of the circumstances.In applying this test we have consistently eschewedbright-line rules, instead emphasizing the fact-specific natureof the reasonableness inquiry. Thus, in Florida v. Royer,460 U. S. 491 (1983), we expressly disavowed any "litmuspaper test" or single "sentence or . . . paragraph . . . rule,"in recognition of the "endless variations in the facts andcircumstances" implicating the Fourth Amendment. Id., at506. Then, in Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U. S. 567 (1988),when both parties urged "bright-line rule[s] applicable to allinvestigatory pursuits," we rejected both proposed rules ascontrary to our "traditional contextual approach." Id., at572-573. And again, in Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429(1991), when the Florida Supreme Court adopted a per serule that questioning aboard a bus always constitutes a seizure, we reversed, reiterating that the proper inquiry necessitates a consideration of "all the circumstances surroundingthe encounter." Id., at 439.We have previously rejected a per se rule very similar tothat adopted by the Supreme Court of Ohio in determiningthe validity of a consent to search. In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218 (1973), it was argued that such a consentcould not be valid unless the defendant knew that he had aright to refuse the request. We rejected this argument:"While knowledge of the right to refuse consent is one factorto be taken into account, the government need not establishsuch knowledge as the sine qua non of an effective consent."Id., at 227. And just as it "would be thoroughly impracticalto impose on the normal consent search the detailed requirements of an effective warning," id., at 231, so too would it be519US1$$5H 06-02-99 14:40:30 PAGES OPINPGT40 OHIO v. ROBINETTEGinsburg, J., concurring in judgmentunrealistic to require police officers to always inform detain-ees that they are free to go before a consent to search maybe deemed voluntary.The Fourth Amendment test for a valid consent to searchis that the consent be voluntary, and "[v]oluntariness is aquestion of fact to be determined from all the circum-stances,"id., at 248-249. The Supreme Court of Ohio having held otherwise, its judgment is reversed, and the caseis remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent withthis opinion.
