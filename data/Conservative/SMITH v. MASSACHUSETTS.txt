Midway through a jury trial, the judge acquitted petitionerof one of the three offenses charged. The question presented in this case is whether the Double Jeopardy Clauseforbade the judge to reconsider that acquittal later in thetrial.IPetitioner Melvin Smith was tried before a jury in theSuperior Court of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, on chargesrelating to the shooting of his girlfriend's cousin. The indictments charged three counts: armed assault with intentto murder; assault and battery by means of a dangerousweapon; and unlawful possession of a firearm. The "firearm" element of the last offense requires proof that theweapon had a barrel "less than 16 inches" in length. SeeMass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 140, $ 121 (West 2002) (definitionof "firearm"); ch. 269, $ 10(a) (West 2000). The indictment inpetitioner's case so charged.

S. 462 (2005)Opinion of the CourtThe victim testified at trial that petitioner had shot himwith "a pistol," specifically "a revolver" that "appeared to bea .32 or a .38." App. 12, 14. The prosecution introduced noother evidence about the firearm.At the conclusion of the prosecution's case, petitionermoved for a required finding of not guilty on the firearmcount, see Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a) (2002), in part because the Commonwealth had not proved that the gun barrelwas less than 16 inches. At sidebar, after hearing argumentfrom the prosecutor, the trial judge granted the motion, reasoning that there was "not a scintilla of evidence" that petitioner had possessed a weapon with a barrel length of lessthan 16 inches. App. 21. The trial court marked petitioner's motion with the handwritten endorsement "Filed andafter hearing, Allowed," and the allowance of the motion wasentered on the docket. Consolidated Brief and RecordAppendix for Defendant in No. 00-P-1215 (Mass. App. Ct.),p. A.21; App. 3. The sidebar conference then concluded, andthe prosecution rested.1 The judge did not notify the juryof petitioner's acquittal on the firearm count.The defense case then proceeded. Petitioner's codefendant presented one witness, and both defendants then rested.During the short recess before closing arguments, the prosecutor brought to the court's attention a Massachusetts precedent under which (he contended) the victim's testimonyabout the kind of gun sufficed to establish that the barrelwas shorter than 16 inches. He requested that the courtdefer ruling on the sufficiency of the evidence until afterthe jury verdict. The judge agreed, announcing orally thatshe was "reversing" her previous ruling and allowing thefirearm-possession count to go to the jury. Id., at 75. Cor1 Although, before the judge ruled, the prosecutor had said that hewould "be requesting to reopen and allow [the victim] to testify to" thebarrel length, App. 22, he made no motion to reopen before resting hiscase.543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN466 SMITH v. MASSACHUSETTSOpinion of the Courtresponding notations were made on the original of petition-er's motion and on the docket.The jury convicted petitioner on all three counts, thoughit acquitted his codefendant of the accessory charge. Petitioner then submitted to a bench trial on an additionalrepeat-offender element of the firearm-possession charge;the judge found him guilty. Petitioner received a sentenceof 10 to 12 years' incarceration on the firearm-possessioncharge, concurrent with his sentence on the other counts.Petitioner sought review in the Appeals Court of Massachusetts. That court affirmed, holding that the DoubleJeopardy Clause was not implicated because the trial judge'scorrection of her ruling had not subjected petitioner to asecond prosecution or proceeding. It also rejected petitioner's argument that the trial judge's initial ruling was finalbecause Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a) required the judge to decide petitioner's motion when it wasmade, without reserving decision;2 the court reasoned thatthe Rule does not preclude the judge from reconsidering.58 Mass. App. 166, 170-171, 788 N. E. 2d 977, 982-983 (2003).The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts denied fur-ther appellate review. 440 Mass. 1104, 797 N. E. 2d 380(2003). We granted certiorari. 542 U. S. 903 (2004).IIAlthough the common-law protection against double jeop-ardy historically applied only to charges on which a jury hadrendered a verdict, see, e. g., 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown2 The Rule provides in pertinent part:"The judge on motion of a defendant or on his own motion shall enter afinding of not guilty of the offense charged in an indictment or complaintor any part thereof after the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a conviction on thecharge. If a defendant's motion for a required finding of not guilty ismade at the close of the Commonwealth's evidence, it shall be ruled uponat that time."

S. 462 (2005)Opinion of the Court*246, we have long held that the Double Jeopardy Clause ofthe Fifth Amendment prohibits reexamination of a courtdecreed acquittal to the same extent it prohibits reexamina-tion of an acquittal by jury verdict. SeeRichardson v.United States, 468 U. S. 317, 325, n. 5 (1984); Sanabria v.United States, 437 U. S. 54, 64, n. 18 (1978); United States v.Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 573 (1977); UnitedStates v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 290 (1970). This is sowhether the judge's ruling of acquittal comes in a bench trialor, as here, in a trial by jury. See Fong Foo v. United States,369 U. S. 141, 143 (1962)(per curiam); Sanabria, supra, at77-78; Martin Linen, supra, at 565-566, 574-575.Our cases have made a single exception to the principlethat acquittal by judge precludes reexamination of guilt noless than acquittal by jury: When a jury returns a verdict ofguilty and a trial judge (or an appellate court) sets asidethat verdict and enters a judgment of acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude a prosecution appealto reinstate the jury verdict of guilty. United States v.Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 352-353 (1975). But if the prosecution has not yet obtained a conviction, further proceedingsto secure one are impermissible: "[S]ubjecting the defendantto postacquittal factfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence violates the Double Jeopardy Clause." Smalis v.Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140, 145 (1986).When the judge in this case first granted petitioner'smotion, there had been no jury verdict. Submission of thefirearm count to the jury plainly subjected petitioner to further "factfinding proceedings going to guilt or innocence,"prohibited by Smalis following an acquittal. The first question, then, is whether the judge's initial ruling on petitioner'smotion was, in fact, a judgment of acquittal.It certainly appeared to be. Massachusetts Rule of Criminal Procedure 25(a) directs the trial judge to enter a findingof not guilty "if the evidence is insufficient as a matter of lawto sustain a conviction." An order entering such a finding543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN468 SMITH v. MASSACHUSETTSOpinion of the Courtthus meets the definiti on of acquittal that our double-jeopardy cases have consistently used: It "actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factualelements of the offense charged."Martin Linen, supra, at571; accord, e. g., Price v. Vincent, 538 U. S. 634, 640 (2003);Burks v. United States, 437 U. S. 1, 10 (1978).The Commonwealth contends that the grant of a motionfor a required finding of not guilty in a jury trial is a purelylegal determination, the factfinding function being reservedto the jury. Brief for Respondent 14 (citing Commonwealthv.Lowder, 432 Mass. 92, 96-97, 731 N. E. 2d 510, 515 (2000)).Thus, the Commonwealth reasons, jeopardy did not terminate midtrial on any of the three counts, since neither judgenor jury had rendered a factual determination that wouldbring jeopardy to an end. We rejected identical reasoningin Martin Linen, supra, holding that jeopardy ends when,following discharge of a hung jury, a judge grants a motionfor judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 29. Rule 29 created the judge-ordered "judgment of acquittal" in place of the directed verdict, which wasat least fictionally returned by the jury at the judge's direction, rather than coming from the judge alone. But, we saidin Martin Linen, change in nomenclature and removal of thejury's theoretical role make no difference; the Rule 29 judgment of acquittal is a substantive determination that theprosecution has failed to carry its burden. Thus, even whenthe jury is the primary factfinder, the trial judge still resolves elements of the offense in granting a Rule 29 motionin the absence of a jury verdict. See Martin Linen, supra,at 571-575.The same is true here. (Indeed, Massachusetts patternedits Rule 25 on Federal Rule 29 and adopted prior directedverdict practice without change. See Lowder, supra, at 95,731 N. E. 2d, at 514.) Massachusetts' characterization of therequired finding of not guilty as a legal rather than factualdetermination is, "as a matter of double jeopardy law, . . .543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN469Cite as: 543 U. S. 462 (2005)Opinion of the Courtnot binding on us," Smalis, supra, at 144, n. 5; what mattersis that, as the Massachusetts Rules authorize, the judge"evaluated the [Commonwealth's] evidence and determinedthat it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction."Martin Linen, supra, at 572.IIIHaving concluded that the judge acquitted petitioner ofthe firearm-possession charge,3 we must turn to the moredifficult question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause per-mitted her to reconsider that acquittal once petitioner andhis codefendant had rested their cases.43 It is of no moment that jeopardy continued on the two assault charges,for which the jury remained empaneled. Double-jeopardy analysis focuses on the individual "offence" charged, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, and ourcases establish that jeopardy may terminate on some counts even as itcontinues on others. See, e. g., Price v. Georgia, 398 U. S. 323, 329 (1970).4 The dissent emphasizes that the acquittal was reconsidered "before thecourt of first instance ha[d] disassociated itself from the case or any issuein it," whereas in Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140 (1986), thegovernment sought reconsideration by appealing. Post, at 477-478 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.). That distinction is not a relevant one. Smalissquarely held, not that further factfinding proceedings were barred because there had been an appeal, but that appeal was barred because further factfinding proceedings before the trial judge (the factfinder who hadpronounced the acquittal) were impermissible. 476 U. S., at 145. Likewise, we recognized in Justices of Boston Municipal Court v. Lydon, 466U. S. 294 (1984), that in a "two-tier" trial system amounting to " `a single,continuous course of judicial proceedings,' " acquittal at the first stage cannot be reconsidered later in the two-tier process. Id., at 309, 312. Thesecases establish that an acquittal, once final, may not be reconsidered onappeal or otherwise.The dissent misses the point of Swisher v. Brady, 438 U. S. 204 (1978),which found no double-jeopardy bar to a judge's review of a master's findings. This was not a "recogni[tion of] the distinction between appealsand continuing proceedings before the initial tribunal," post, at 478, butrather a recognition that the initial jeopardy does not end until there is afinal decision. See 438 U. S., at 216 ("[I]t is for the State, not the parties, to designate and empower the factfinder and adjudicator. And here543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN470 SMITH v. MASSACHUSETTSOpinion of the CourtIt is important to note, at the outset, that the facts of thiscase gave petitioner no reason to doubt the finality of thestate court's ruling. The prosecutor did not make or reserve a motion for reconsideration, or seek a continuancethat would allow him to provide the court with favorableauthority. Rather, the sidebar conference concluded, thecourt asked the prosecutor if he had "any further evidence,"and he replied, "No. At this point, the Commonwealth reststheir case." App. 22. Nor did the court's ruling appear onits face to be tentative. The trial court was not permittedby Massachusetts procedure to defer ruling on petitioner'smotion, Mass. Rule Crim. Proc. 25(a), or to require the defendants to go forward with their cases while the prosecutionreserved the right to present more evidence, Commonwealthv. Cote, 15 Mass. App. 229, 242, 444 N. E. 2d 1282, 1290-1291(1983). And when the prosecutor suggested that he begiven a chance to reopen his case before the defendants proceeded, the court rejected the suggestion because it wastime to rule on petitioner's motion. App. 22; n. 1, supra.Was this apparently final ruling in fact final? We think,and petitioner does not dispute, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 5, thatas a general matter state law may prescribe that a judge'smidtrial determination of the sufficiency of the State's proofcan be reconsidered. Cf. Pennsylvania v. Goldhammer, 474U. S. 28, 30 (1985) (per curiam) (state law regarding appealability may affect defendant's expectation that a sentence isfinal for double-jeopardy purposes). We can find no instancein which a State has done this by statute or rule, but someMaryland has conferred those roles only on the Juvenile Court judge.Thus, regardless of which party is initially favored by the master's proposals, . . . the judge is empowered to accept, modify, or reject those proposals"). The dissent is quite right that the taking of an appeal "necessarilysignals" the finality of the order appealed, post, at 477; that does not establish, however, that the absence of an appeal necessarily connotes thenonfinality that differentiates the master's finding in Swisher from themidtrial acquittal in this case.543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN471Cite as: 543 U. S. 462 (2005)Opinion of the Courtstate courts have held, as a matter of common law or in theexercise of their supervisory power, that a court-directedjudgment of acquittal is not effective until it is signed andentered in the docket, Harden v. State, 160 Ga. App. 514, 515,287 S. E. 2d 329, 331 (1981), until a formal order is issued,State v. Collins, 112 Wash. 2d 303, 308-309, 771 P. 2d 350,353 (1989), or until the motion hearing is concluded, Watsonv.State, 410 So. 2d 207, 209 (Fla. App. 1982).At the time of petitioner's trial, however, Massachusettshad not adopted any such rule of nonfinality. Its Rules ofCriminal Procedure provided that only clerical errors in ajudgment or order, or errors "arising from oversight or omis-sion," were subject to correction at any time. Mass. RuleCrim. Proc. 42 (2002). Massachusetts cites a few common-wealth cases supporting the general proposition that interlocutory rulings (rulings on pretrial motions, evidentiaryrulings, and the like) are subject to reconsideration. But itis far from obvious that this principle extends to entry of arequired finding of not guilty under Rule 25 (or to itscommon-law predecessor, the directed verdict)--which on itsface, at least, purports not to be interlocutory but to end thecase. We think much more was required here.It may suffice for an appellate court to announce thestate-law rule that midtrial acquittals are tentative in a casewhere reconsideration of the acquittal occurred at a stage inthe trial where the defendant's justifiable ignorance of therule could not possibly have caused him prejudice.5 Butwhen, as here, the trial has proceeded to the defendant's5 In Price v. Vincent, 538 U. S. 634 (2003), a habeas case presenting factssimilar to those here, the judge granted a partial acquittal but reconsidered before the trial proceeded, and the Michigan courts concluded thatno double-jeopardy violation had occurred. Id., at 637-638. We held thatconclusion to be not "an unreasonable application of . . . Federal law,"28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1), in part because, as the Michigan Supreme Courtobserved, "no trial proceedings took place with respondent laboring underthe mistaken impression that he was not facing the possibility of conviction for" the purportedly acquitted charge. 538 U. S., at 642-643, and n. 1.543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN472 SMITH v. MASSACHUSETTSOpinion of the Courtpresentation of his case, the possibility of prejudice arises.The seeming dismissal may induce a defendant to present adefense to the undismissed charges when he would be betteradvised to stand silent. Many jurisdictions still follow thetraditional rule that after trial or on appeal, sufficiency-ofthe-evidence challenges are reviewed on the basis of the entire trial record, even if the defendant moved for acquittalwhen the prosecution rested and the court erroneously denied that motion. E. g., Smith v. State, 509 P. 2d 1391, 1397(Okla. Crim. App. 1973); Deal v. State, 657 P. 2d 404, 405(Alaska App. 1983) (per curiam). See generally Comment,The Motion for Acquittal: A Neglected Safeguard, 70 YaleL. J. 1151, 1152-1158 (1961). In these jurisdictions, the defendant who puts on a case runs "the risk that . . . he willbolster the Government case enough for it to support a verdict of guilty." McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183, 215(1971). The defendant's evidence "may lay the foundationfor otherwise inadmissible evidence in the Government'sinitial presentation or provide corroboration for essentialelements of the Government's case. " Uni ted States v.Calderon, 348 U. S. 160, 164, n. 1 (1954) (citation omitted).In all jurisdictions, moreover, false assurance of acquittalon one count may induce the defendant to present defensesto the remaining counts that are inadvisable--for example,a defense that entails admission of guilt on the acquittedcount.66 In multiple-defendant cases like this one, an apparent final dismissal ofone defendant may also cause the others to alter their cases in harmfulways. They would, for example, proceed under the mistaken belief thatthey need no longer fear the acquitted defendant's assertion of a defenseantagonistic to their own, and might assume that the acquitted defendantwould become available as a defense witness. Cf. Washington v. Texas,388 U. S. 14, 22-23 (1967) (discussing reasons to allow testimony of a purported accomplice after accomplice's acquittal). While the potential effectupon codefendants has no bearing upon this petitioner's double-jeopardyclaim, it does confirm the wisdom of the rule we adopt.543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN473Cite as: 543 U. S. 462 (2005)Opinion of the CourtThe Double Jeopardy Clause's guarantee cannot be al-lowed to become a potential snare for those who reasonablyrely upon it. If, after a facially unqualified midtrial dis-missal of one count, the trial has proceeded to the defendant'sintroduction of evidence, the acquittal must be treated asfinal, unless the availability of reconsideration has beenplainly established by pre-existing rule or case authority expressly applicable to midtrial rulings on the sufficiency of theevidence. That requirement was not met here. The Commonwealth has failed to show that under state procedure asit existed at the time of petitioner's trial, the trial court'sruling on the motion for a required finding of not guilty wasautomatically, or even presumptively, nonfinal. At most ithas shown that the ruling was wrong because the Commonwealth's evidence was, as a matter of law, sufficient--a pointthat the dissent emphasizes, echoing the opinion below. Seepost, at 476-477, 479. But any contention that the DoubleJeopardy Clause must itself (even absent provision by theState) leave open a way of correcting legal errors is at oddswith the well-established rule that the bar will attach to apreverdict acquittal that is patently wrong in law. See, e. g.,Smalis, 476 U. S., at 144, n. 7; Sanabria, 437 U. S., at 68-69,75, 78; Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 571; Fong Foo, 369 U. S.,at 143.77 The dissent goes to great lengths to establish that there was no prejudice here, since the acquittal was legally wrong and the defendant wasdeprived of no available defense. See post, at 476-480. But the DoubleJeopardy Clause has never required prejudice beyond the very exposureto a second jeopardy. To put it differently: Requiring someone to defendagainst a charge of which he has already been acquitted is prejudice perse for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause--even when the acquittalwas erroneous because the evidence was sufficient. See, e. g., Sanabriav. United States, 437 U. S. 54, 77-78 (1978). Of course it is not even clearthat the dissent's due-process analysis would acknowledge prejudice whena midtrial acquittal was correct when rendered, so long as evidence sufficient to sustain the charge was eventually introduced (after the acquittaland during the defendant's case, see supra, at 472). Our double-jeopardycases make clear that an acquittal bars the prosecution from seeking "an543US2 Unit: $U21 [03-07-07 14:11:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN474 SMITH v. MASSACHUSETTSOpinion of the CourtMassachusetts argues that if the Double Jeopardy Clausedoes not allow for reconsideration, every erroneous grant ofa directed-verdict motion will be unremediable, even one at-tributable to mistaken expression that is promptly corrected.We think not. Double-jeopardy principles have never beenthought to bar the immediate repair of a genuine error inthe announcement of an acquittal, even one rendered by ajury. See M. Friedland, Double Jeopardy 61 (1969);King v.Parkin, 1 Mood. 45, 46-47, 168 Eng. Rep. 1179, 1180 (1824).And of course States can protect themselves still furtheragainst the "occasional errors" of law that the dissent thinks"inevitabl[e]" in the course of trial, post, at 478, by renderingmidtrial acquittals nonfinal. (Massachusetts, as we haveobserved, has specifically provided for the correction of mis-taken utterances or scrivener's errors, but not for the reconsideration of legal conclusions. See Mass. Rule Crim. Proc.42 (2002).)Prosecutors are not without protection against ill-considered acquittal rulings. States can and do craft procedural rules that allow trial judges "the maximum oppor-tunity to consider with care a pending acquittal motion,"Martin Linen, supra, at 574, including the option of defer-ring consideration until after the verdict. See,e. g., D. C.Super. Ct. Crim. Proc. Rule 29(b) (2003); N. Y. Crim. Proc.Law Ann. $ 290.10(1)(b) (West 2002); W. Va. Rule Crim. Proc.29(b) (2004). (At least one State has altogether precludedmidtrial acquittals by the court. See Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 175.381(1) (2001).) Moreover, a prosecutor can seek to persuade the court to correct its legal error before it rules, orat least before the proceedings move forward. See Price v.Vincent, 538 U. S., at 637-638, 642-643, and n. 1. Indeed,the prosecutor in this case convinced the judge to reconsiderher acquittal ruling on the basis of legal authority he hadobtained during a 15-minute recess before closing arguother opportunity to supply evidence which it failed to muster" beforejeopardy terminated.
