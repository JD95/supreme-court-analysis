Title I of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death PenaltyAct of 1996 (Act) works substantial changes to chapter 153of Title 28 of the United States Code, which authorizes fed-eral courts to grant the writ of habeas corpus. Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1217. We hold that the Act does not precludethis Court from entertaining an application for habeas corpus relief, although it does affect the standards governingthe granting of such relief. We also conclude that the availability of such relief in this Court obviates any claim by peti-tioner under the Exceptions Clause of Article III, $ 2, of theConstitution, and that the operative provisions of the Act donot violate the Suspension Clause of the Constitution, Art.I, $ 9. IOn a night in 1976, petitioner approached Jane W. in hiscar as she got out of hers.

She escapedlater, when petitioner fell asleep. Jane notified the police,and petitioner was eventually convicted of aggravated sodomy and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment.Petitioner was paroled four years later. On November 23,1981, he met Joy Ludlam, a cocktail waitress, at the loungewhere she worked. She was interested in changing jobs,and petitioner used a series of deceptions involving offeringher a job at "The Leather Shoppe," a business he owned, toinduce her to visit him the next day. The last time Joy wasseen alive was the evening of the next day. Her dead bodywas discovered two weeks later in a creek. Forensic analysis established that she had been beaten, raped, and sodomized, and that she had been strangled to death before beingleft in the creek. Investigators discovered hair resemblingpetitioner's on Joy's body and clothes, hair resembling Joy'sin petitioner's bedroom, and clothing fibers like those in Joy'scoat in the hatchback of petitioner's car. One of petitioner'sneighbors reported seeing Joy's car at petitioner's house theday she disappeared.A jury convicted petitioner of murder, rape, aggravatedsodomy, and false imprisonment. Petitioner was sentencedto death on the murder charge. The Georgia SupremeCourt affirmed petitioner's conviction and death sentence,Felker v. State, 252 Ga. 351, 314 S.

The District Court denied thepetition. The United States Court of Appeals for the Elev-enth Circuit affirmed, 52 F. 3d 907, extended on denial ofpetition for rehearing, 62 F. 3d 342 (1995), and we deniedcertiorari, 516 U.

The state trial court de-nied this petition on May 1, and the Georgia Supreme Courtdenied certiorari on May 2.On April 24, 1996, the President signed the Act into law.Title I of this Act contained a series of amendments to ex-isting federal habeas corpus law. The provisions of theAct pertinent to this case concern second or successive ha-beas corpus applications by state prisoners.

Petitionersought to raise two claims in his second petition, the firstbeing that the state trial court violated due process byequating guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt" with "moral cer-tainty" of guilt invoir dire and jury instructions. See Cagev. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam). He alsoalleged that qualified experts, reviewing the forensic evi-dence after his conviction, had established that Joy musthave died during a period when petitioner was under policesurveillance for Joy's disappearance and thus had a valid518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT658 FELKER v.

He claimed that the testimony of the State's forensicexpert at trial was suspect because he is not a licensed physician, and that the new expert testimony so discreditedthe State's testimony at trial that petitioner had a colorableclaim of factual innocence.The Court of Appeals denied both motions the day theywere filed, concluding that petitioner's claims had not beenpresented in his first habeas petition, that they did not meetthe standards of $ 2244(b)(2), and that they would not havesatisfied pre-Act standards for obtaining review on the merits of second or successive claims. 83 F. 3d 1303 (CA111996). Petitioner filed in this Court a pleading styled a "Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, for Appellate or CertiorariReview of the Decision of the United States Circuit Courtfor the Eleventh Circuit, and for Stay of Execution." OnMay 3, we granted petitioner's stay application and petitionfor certiorari. We ordered briefing on the extent to whichthe provisions of Title I of the Act apply to a petition forhabeas corpus filed in this Court, whether application of theAct suspended the writ of habeas corpus in this case, andwhether Title I of the Act, especially the provision to becodified at $ 2244(b)(3)(E), constitutes an unconstitutional restriction on the jurisdiction of this Court. 517 U. S. 1182(1996).IIWe first consider to what extent the provisions of Title I ofthe Act apply to petitions for habeas corpus filed as originalmatters in this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and2254. We conclude that although the Act does impose newconditions on our authority to grant relief, it does not deprive this Court of jurisdiction to entertain original habeaspetitions.ASection 2244(b)(3)(E) prevents this Court from reviewinga court of appeals order denying leave to file a second ha518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT659Cite as: 518 U.

More thana century ago, we considered whether a statute barringreview by appeal of the judgment of a circuit court in ahabeas case also deprived this Court of power to entertainan original habeas petition. Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85(1869). We consider the same question here with respectto $ 2244(b)(3)(E).Yerger's holding is best understood in the light of the availability of habeas corpus review at that time. Section 14 ofthe Judiciary Act of 1789 authorized all federal courts, including this Court, to grant the writ of habeas corpus whenprisoners were "in custody, under or by colour of the authority of the United States, or [were] committed for trial beforesome court of the same." Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 14,1 Stat. 82.1 Congress greatly expanded the scope of federalhabeas corpus in 1867, authorizing federal courts to grantthe writ, "in addition to the authority already conferred bylaw," "in all cases where any person may be restrained of hisor her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treatyor law of the United States." Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, 14Stat. 385.2 Before the Act of 1867, the only instances inwhich a federal court could issue the writ to produce a stateprisoner were if the prisoner was "necessary to be broughtinto court to testify," Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, $ 14, 1 Stat.82, was "committed . . . for any act done . . . in pursuance ofa law of the United States," Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch. 57, $ 7, 4Stat. 634-635, or was a "subjec[t] or citize[n] of a foreign1 Section 14 is the direct ancestor of 28 U. S. C. $ 2241, subsection (a) ofwhich now states in pertinent part: "Writs of habeas corpus may begranted by the Supreme Court, any justice thereof, the district courts andany circuit judge within their respective jurisdictions."2 This language from the 1867 Act is the direct ancestor of $ 2241(c)(3),which states: "The writ of habeas corpus shall not extend to a prisonerunless . . . [h]e is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws ortreaties of the United States."518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT660 FELKER v. TURPINOpinion of the CourtState, and domiciled therein," and held under state law, Actof Aug. 29, 1842, ch. 257, 5 Stat. 539-540.The Act of 1867 also expanded our statutory appellate jurisdiction to authorize appeals to this Court from the finaldecision of any circuit court on a habeas petition. 14 Stat.386. This enactment changed the result of Barry v. Mercein, 5 How. 103 (1847), in which we had held that the Judiciary Act of 1789 did not authorize this Court to conductappellate review of circuit court habeas decisions. However,in 1868, Congress revoked the appellate jurisdiction it hadgiven in 1867, repealing "so much of the [Act of 1867] asauthorizes an appeal from the judgment of the circuit courtto the Supreme Court of the United States." Act of Mar.27, 1868, ch. 34, $ 2, 15 Stat. 44.In Yerger, we considered whether the Act of 1868 deprivedus not only of power to hear an appeal from an inferiorcourt's decision on a habeas petition, but also of power toentertain a habeas petition to this Court under $ 14 of theAct of 1789. We concluded that the 1868 Act did not affectour power to entertain such habeas petitions. We explainedthat the 1868 Act's text addressed only jurisdiction over appeals conferred under the Act of 1867, not habeas jurisdictionconferred under the Acts of 1789 and 1867. We rejected thesuggestion that the Act of 1867 had repealed our habeaspower by implication. Yerger, 8 Wall., at 105. Repeals byimplication are not favored, we said, and the continued exercise of original habeas jurisdiction was not "repugnant" to aprohibition on review by appeal of circuit court habeas judgments. Ibid.Turning to the present case, we conclude that Title I ofthe Act has not repealed our authority to entertain originalhabeas petitions, for reasons similar to those stated inYerger. No provision of Title I mentions our authority toentertain original habeas petitions; in contrast, $ 103 amendsthe Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to bar consider518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT661Cite as: 518 U. S. 651 (1996)Opinion of the Courtation of original habeas petitions in the courts of appeals.3Although $ 2244(b)(3)(E) precludes us from reviewing, byappeal or petition for certiorari, a judgment on an applica-tion for leave to file a second habeas petition in district court,it makes no mention of our authority to hear habeas petitionsfiled as original matters in this Court. As we declined tofind a repeal of $ 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 as applied tothis Court by implication then, we decline to find a similarrepeal of $ 2241 of Title 28--its descendant, n. 1, supra--byimplication now.This conclusion obviates one of the constitutional chal-lenges raised. The critical language of Article III, $ 2, ofthe Constitution provides that, apart from several classesof cases specifically enumerated in this Court's originaljurisdiction, "[i]n all the other Cases . . . the supreme Courtshall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact,with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as theCongress shall make." Previous decisions construing thisclause have said that while our appellate powers "are givenby the constitution," "they are limited and regulated by the[Judiciary Act of 1789], and by such other acts as have beenpassed on the subject."Durousseau v. United States, 6Cranch 307, 314 (1810); see also United States v. More, 3Cranch 159, 172-173 (1805). The Act does remove our au-thority to entertain an appeal or a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a decision of a court of appeals exercisingits "gatekeeping" function over a second petition. But sinceit does not repeal our authority to entertain a petition for3 Section 103 of the Act amends Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure22(a) to read: "An application for a writ of habeas corpus shall be made tothe appropriate district court. If application is made to a circuit judge,the application shall be transferred to the appropriate district court. Ifan application is made to or transferred to the district court and denied,renewal of the application before a circuit judge shall not be permitted.The applicant may, pursuant to section 2253 of title 28, United States Code,appeal to the appropriate court of appeals from the order of the districtcourt denying the writ."518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT662 FELKER v. TURPINOpinion of the Courthabeas corpus, there can be no plausible argument that theAct has deprived this Court of appellate jurisdiction in violation of Article III, $ 2. BWe consider next how Title I affects the requirements astate prisoner must satisfy to show he is entitled to a writof habeas corpus from this Court. Title I of the Act haschanged the standards governing our consideration of habeaspetitions by imposing new requirements for the granting ofrelief to state prisoners. Our authority to grant habeas relief to state prisoners is limited by $ 2254, which specifies theconditions under which such relief may be granted to "a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court." 4$ 2254(a). Several sections of the Act impose new requirements for the granting of relief under this section, and theytherefore inform our authority to grant such relief as well.Section 2244(b) addresses second or successive habeas pe-titions. Section 2244(b)(3)'s "gatekeeping" system for second petitions does not apply to our consideration of habeaspetitions because it applies to applications "filed in the district court." $ 2244(b)(3)(A). There is no such limitation,however, on the restrictions on repetitive and new claimsimposed by $$ 2244(b)(1) and (2). These restrictions applywithout qualification to any "second or successive habeascorpus application under section 2254." $$ 2244(b)(1), (2).4 As originally enacted in 1948, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 specified that "[a]napplication for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custodypursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unlessit appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available inthe courts of the State." 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1946 ed., Supp. III). Thereviser's notes, citing Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114 (1944) (per curiam),indicated that "[t]his new section is declaratory of existing law as affirmedby the Supreme Court." Reviser's Note following 28 U. S. C. $ 2254,p. 1109 (1946 ed., Supp. III). Hawk was one of a series of opinions inwhich we applied the exhaustion requirement first announced in Ex parteRoyall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886), to deny relief to applicants seeking writs ofhabeas corpus from this Court.518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT663Cite as: 518 U. S. 651 (1996)Opinion of the CourtWhether or not we are bound by these restrictions, they cer-tainly inform our consideration of original habeas petitions.IIINext, we consider whether the Act suspends the writ ofhabeas corpus in violation of Article I, $ 9, clause 2, of theConstitution. This Clause provides that "[t]he Privilege ofthe Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unlesswhen in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety mayrequire it."The writ of habeas corpus known to the Framers was quitedifferent from that which exists today. As we explainedpreviously, the first Congress made the writ of habeas corpusavailable only to prisoners confined under the authority ofthe United States, not under state authority. Supra, at 659-660; seeEx parte Dorr, 3 How. 103 (1844). The class of judi-cial actions reviewable by the writ was more restricted aswell. In Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193 (1830), we denied apetition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner "detainedin prison by virtue of the judgment of a court, which courtpossesses general and final jurisdiction in criminal cases."Id., at 202. Reviewing the English common law which in-formed American courts' understanding of the scope of thewrit, we held that "[t]he judgment of the circuit court in acriminal case is of itself evidence of its own legality," andthat we could not "usurp that power by the instrumentalityof the writ of habeas corpus." Id., at 207.It was not until 1867 that Congress made the writ gener-ally available in "all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution,or of any treaty or law of the United States."Supra, at 659.And it was not until well into this century that this Courtinterpreted that provision to allow a final judgment of con-viction in a state court to be collaterally attacked on habeas.See, e. g., Waley v. Johnston, 316 U. S. 101 (1942) (per cu-riam); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953). But we assume,518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT664 FELKER v. TURPINOpinion of the Courtfor purposes of decision here, that the Suspension Clause ofthe Constitution refers to the writ as it exists today, ratherthan as it existed in 1789. See Swain v. Pressley, 430 U. S.372 (1977); id., at 384 (Burger, C. J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment).The Act requires a habeas petitioner to obtain leave fromthe court of appeals before filing a second habeas petition inthe district court. But this requirement simply transfersfrom the district court to the court of appeals a screeningfunction which would previously have been performed by thedistrict court as required by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 9(b).The Act also codifies some of the pre-existing limits on successive petitions, and further restricts the availability of relief to habeas petitioners. But we have long recognized that"the power to award the writ by any of the courts of theUnited States, must be given by written law," Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75, 94 (1807), and we have likewise recognizedthat judgments about the proper scope of the writ are "normally for Congress to make." Lonchar v. Thomas, 517 U. S.314, 323 (1996).The new restrictions on successive petitions constitute amodified res judicata rule, a restraint on what is called inhabeas corpus practice "abuse of the writ." In McCleskeyv. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we said that "the doctrine ofabuse of the writ refers to a complex and evolving body ofequitable principles informed and controlled by historicalusage, statutory developments, and judicial decisions." Id.,at 489. The added restrictions which the Act places on second habeas petitions are well within the compass of this evolutionary process, and we hold that they do not amount to a"suspension" of the writ contrary to Article I, $ 9.IVWe have answered the questions presented by the petitionfor certiorari in this case, and we now dispose of the petition518US3$86H 06-01-99 17:20:41 PAGES OPINPGT665Cite as: 518 U. S. 651 (1996)Stevens, J., concurringfor an original writ of habeas corpus. Our Rule 20.4(a)delineates the standards under which we grant such writs:"A petition seeking the issuance of a writ of habeascorpus shall comply with the requirements of 28 U. S. C.$$ 2241 and 2242, and in particular with the provision inthe last paragraph of $ 2242 requiring a statement of the`reasons for not making application to the district courtof the district in which the applicant is held.' If therelief sought is from the judgment of a state court, thepetition shall set forth specifically how and wherein thepetitioner has exhausted available remedies in the statecourts or otherwise comes within the provisions of 28U. S. C. $ 2254(b). To justify the granting of a writ ofhabeas corpus, the petitioner must show exceptionalcircumstances warranting the exercise of the Court'sdiscretionary powers and must show that adequaterelief cannot be obtained in any other form or from anyother court. These writs are rarely granted."Reviewing petitioner's claims here, they do not materiallydiffer from numerous other claims made by successive habeas petitioners which we have had occasion to review onstay applications to this Court. Neither of them satisfiesthe requirements of the relevant provisions of the Act, letalone the requirement that there be "exceptional circumstances" justifying the issuance of the writ.* * *The petition for writ of certiorari is dismissed for want ofjurisdiction. The petition for an original writ of habeascorpus is denied.
