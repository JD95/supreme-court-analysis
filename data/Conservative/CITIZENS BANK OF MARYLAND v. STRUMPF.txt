We must decide whether the creditor of a debtor in bank-ruptcy may, in order to protect its setoff rights, temporarilywithhold payment of a debt that it owes to the debtor inbankruptcy without violating the automatic stay imposed by11 U. S. C. $ 362(a). IOn January 25, 1991, when respondent filed for relief underChapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, he had a checking account with petitioner, a bank conducting business in theState of Maryland. He also was in default on the remainingbalance of a loan of $5,068.75 from the bank. Under 11U. S. C. $ 362(a), respondent's bankruptcy filing gave rise toan automatic stay of various types of activity by his credi-tors, including "the setoff of any debt owing to the debtorthat arose before the commencement of the [bankruptcycase] against any claim against the debtor." $ 362(a)(7).On October 2, 1991, petitioner placed what it termed an"administrative hold" on so much of respondent's account as*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for BankAmericaCorp. by Harold R.

STRUMPFOpinion of the Courtit claimed was subject to setoff--that is, the bank refusedto pay withdrawals from the account that would reduce thebalance below the sum that it claimed was due on respond-ent's loan. Five days later, petitioner filed in the Bankruptcy Court, under $ 362(d), a "Motion for Relief from Auto-matic Stay and for Setoff." Respondent then filed a motionto hold petitioner in contempt, claiming that petitioner's ad-ministrative hold violated the automatic stay established by$ 362(a).The Bankruptcy Court ruled on respondent's contemptmotion first. It concluded that petitioner's "administrativehold" constituted a "setoff " in violation of $ 362(a)(7) andsanctioned petitioner. Several weeks later, the BankruptcyCourt granted petitioner's motion for relief from the stayand authorized petitioner to set off respondent's remainingchecking account balance against the unpaid loan. By thattime, however, respondent had reduced the checking accountbalance to zero, so there was nothing to set off.The District Court reversed the judgment that petitionerhad violated the automatic stay, concluding that the administrative hold was not a violation of $ 362(a). The Court ofAppeals reversed. "[A]n administrative hold," it said, "istantamount to the exercise of a right of setoff and thus vio-lates the automatic stay of $ 362(a)(7)." 37 F. 3d 155, 158(CA4 1994). We granted certiorari. 514 U. S. 1035 (1995).IIThe right of setoff (also called "offset") allows entities thatowe each other money to apply their mutual debts againsteach other, thereby avoiding "the absurdity of making A payB when B owes A."Studley v. Boylston Nat. Bank, 229U. S. 523, 528 (1913). Although no federal right of setoff iscreated by the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. $ 553(a) providesthat, with certain exceptions, whatever right of setoff otherwise exists is preserved in bankruptcy. Here it is undis-puted that, prior to the bankruptcy filing, petitioner had the516us1$$3k 10-22-98 10:36:00 PAGES OPINPGT19Cite as: 516 U. S. 16 (1995)Opinion of the Courtright under Maryland law to set off the defaulted loanagainst the balance in the checking account. It is also undisputed that under $ 362(a) respondent's bankruptcy filingstayed any exercise of that right by petitioner. The principal question for decision is whether petitioner's refusal topay its debt to respondent upon the latter's demand constituted an exercise of the setoff right and hence violated thestay.In our view, petitioner's action was not a setoff within themeaning of $ 362(a)(7). Petitioner refused to pay its debt,not permanently and absolutely, but only while it sought relief under $ 362(d) from the automatic stay. Whether thattemporary refusal was otherwise wrongful is a separate matter--we do not consider, for example, respondent's contention that the portion of the account subjected to the "administrative hold" exceeded the amount properly subject tosetoff. All that concerns us here is whether the refusal wasa setoff. We think it was not, because--as evidenced bypetitioner's "Motion for Relief from Automatic Stay and forSetoff "--petitioner did not purport permanently to reducerespondent's account balance by the amount of the defaultedloan. A requirement of such an intent is implicit in the rulefollowed by a majority of jurisdictions addressing the question, that a setoff has not occurred until three steps havebeen taken: (i) a decision to effectuate a setoff, (ii) someaction accomplishing the setoff, and (iii) a recording of thesetoff. See, e. g., Baker v. National City Bank of Cleveland, 511 F. 2d 1016, 1018 (CA6 1975) (Ohio law); NormandJosef Enterprises, Inc. v. Connecticut Nat. Bank, 230 Conn.486, 504-505, 646 A. 2d 1289, 1299 (1994). But even if statelaw were different, the question whether a setoff under$ 362(a)(7) has occurred is a matter of federal law, and otherprovisions of the Bankruptcy Code would lead us to embracethe same requirement of an intent permanently to settleaccounts.516us1$$3k 10-22-98 10:36:00 PAGES OPINPGT20 CITIZENS BANK OF MD. v. STRUMPFOpinion of the CourtSection 542(b) of the Code, which concerns turnover ofproperty to the estate, requires a bankrupt's debtors to"pay" to the trustee (or on his order) any "debt that is prop-erty of the estate and that is matured, payable on demand,or payable on order . . . except to the extent that such debtmay be offset under section 553 of this title against a claimagainst the debtor." 11 U. S. C. $ 542(b) (emphasis added).Section 553(a), in turn, sets forth a general rule, with certainexceptions, that any right of setoff that a creditor possessedprior to the debtor's filing for bankruptcy is not affected bythe Bankruptcy Code. It would be an odd construction of$ 362(a)(7) that required a creditor with a right of setoff todo immediately that which $ 542(b) specifically excuses itfrom doing as a general matter: pay a claim to which a defense of setoff applies.Nor is our assessment of these provisions changed by thefact that $ 553(a), in generally providing that nothing in theBankruptcy Code affects creditors' prebankruptcy setoffrights, qualifies this rule with the phrase "[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this section and in sections 362 and 363."This undoubtedly refers to $ 362(a)(7), but we think it is mostnaturally read as merely recognizing that provision's restriction upon when an actual setoff may be effected--which isto say, not during the automatic stay. When this perfectlyreasonable reading is available, it would be foolish to takethe $ 553(a) "except" clause as indicating that $ 362(a)(7) requires immediate payment of a debt subject to setoff. Thatwould render $ 553(a)'s general rule that the BankruptcyCode does not affect the right of setoff meaningless, for byforcing the creditor to pay its debt immediately, it woulddivest the creditor of the very thing that supports the rightof setoff. Furthermore, it would, as we have stated, eviscerate $ 542(b)'s exception to the duty to pay debts. It is anelementary rule of construction that "the act cannot be heldto destroy itself."

S. 16 (1995)Opinion of the CourtFinally, we are unpersuaded by respondent's additionalcontentions that the administrative hold violated $$ 362(a)(3)and 362(a)(6). Under these sections, a bankruptcy filing au-tomatically stays "any act to obtain possession of propertyof the estate or of property from the estate or to exercisecontrol over property of the estate," 11 U. S. C. $ 362(a)(3),and "any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against thedebtor that arose before the commencement of the caseunder this title," $ 362(a)(6). Respondent's reliance on theseprovisions rests on the false premise that petitioner's administrative hold took something from respondent, or exer-cised dominion over property that belonged to respondent.That view of things might be arguable if a bank account con-sisted of money belonging to the depositor and held by thebank. In fact, however, it consists of nothing more or lessthan a promise to pay, from the bank to the depositor, seeBank of Marin v. England, 385 U. S. 99, 101 (1966); Kellerv. Frederickstown Sav. Institution, 193 Md. 292, 296, 66A. 2d 924, 925 (1949); and petitioner's temporary refusalto pay was neither a taking of possession of respondent'sproperty nor an exercising of control over it, but merely arefusal to perform its promise. In any event, we will notgive $ 362(a)(3) or $ 362(a)(6) an interpretation that wouldproscribe what $ 542(b)'s "except[ion]" and $ 553(a)'s generalrule were plainly intended to permit: the temporary refusalof a creditor to pay a debt that is subject to setoff against adebt owed by the bankrupt.*The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the FourthCircuit is reversed. It is so ordered.*We decline to address respondent's contention, not raised below, thatthe confirmation of his Chapter 13 Plan under 11 U. S. C. $ 1327 precludedpetitioner's exercise of its setoff right. See Granfinanciera, S. A. v.Nordberg, 492 U.

Argued October 3, 1995--Decided October 31, 1995Louisiana's bill of complaint in this original action asks the Court, interalia, to define the boundary between that State and Mississippi along a7-mile stretch of the Mississippi River. The case is here on Louisiana'sexceptions to the report of the Special Master appointed by the Court.Held: Louisiana's exceptions are overruled. The case is controlled by theisland exception to the rule of the thalweg. The latter rule specifiesthat the river boundary between States lies along the main downstreamnavigational channel, or thalweg, and moves as the channel changes withthe gradual processes of erosion and accretion. The island exception tothat rule provides that if there is a divided river flow around an island,a boundary once established on one side of the island remains there,even though the main downstream navigation channel shifts to the island's other side. Pursuant to the island exception, the Special Masterplaced the boundary here at issue on the west side of the area here indispute, thereby confirming Mississippi's sovereignty over the area.The Master took that action after finding that the area derived fromStack Island, which had originally been within Mississippi's boundarybefore the river's main navigational channel shifted to the east of theisland, but which, through erosion on its east side and accretion on itswest side, changed from its original location, next to the river's Mississippi bank, to its current location, abutting the Louisiana bank.

With them on the briefwereMike Moore, Attorney General of Mississippi, RobertE. Sanders, Assistant Attorney General, and Charles AlanWright.Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.Like the shifting river channel near the property in dispute, this litigation has traversed from one side of our docketto the other. We must first recount this procedural history.In an earlier action, Mississippi citizens sued in the UnitedStates District Court for the Southern District of Mississippito quiet title to the subject property. Certain Louisiana citi-zens were named as defendants. The parties asserted conflicting ownership claims to an area of about 2,000 acres,stretching seven miles along the Louisiana bank of the Mississippi River, near Lake Providence, Louisiana. The Stateof Louisiana and the Lake Providence Port Commission intervened in that action and filed a third-party complaintagainst the State of Mississippi. Concerned, however, withthe jurisdiction of the District Court to hear its matter, Louisiana took the further step of instituting an original actionin this Court, and it filed a motion here for leave to file a billof complaint. We denied the motion. Louisiana v. Mississippi, 488 U. S. 990 (1988).The District Court heard the case pending before it and,in an order by Judge Barbour, ruled in favor of Mississippi.Louisiana, however, prevailed in the United States Court ofAppeals for the Fifth Circuit, 937 F. 2d 247 (1991), and wegranted Mississippi's petition for certiorari. 503 U. S. 935(1992).After hearing oral argument on both substantive issuesand jurisdiction, we resolved only the latter. We held thatthere was no jurisdiction in the District Court, or in theCourt of Appeals, to grant any relief in the quiet title action516us1$$4z 08-21-97 18:02:27 PAGES OPINPGT24 LOUISIANA v. MISSISSIPPIOpinion of the Courtto one State against the other, that authority being reservedfor jurisdiction exclusive to this Court.Mississippi v. Louisiana, 506 U. S. 73, 77-78 (1992); see also 28 U. S. C. $ 1251(a).We remanded the case so the complaint filed by Louisianacould be dismissed in the District Court and for the Courtof Appeals to determine what further proceedings werenecessary with respect to the claims of the private parties.Upon remand, Louisiana asked the District Court to stayfurther action in the case to allow Louisiana once again toseek permission to file a bill of complaint in this Court. TheDistrict Court agreed, noting that our decision on the boundary issue would solve the District Court's choice-of-law problem and would be the fairest method of resolving the fundamental issue for all parties.Louisiana did file a renewed motion in our Court for leaveto file a bill of complaint. We granted it, allowing leave tofile against Mississippi and persons called the HoustonGroup, who asserted ownership to the disputed area andwho supported Mississippi's position on the boundary issue.Louisiana asked us to define the boundary between the twoStates and cancel the Houston Group's claim of title. Aftergranting leave to file, we appointed Vincent L. McKusick,former Chief Justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court,as Special Master. The case is now before us on Louisiana'sexceptions to his report, and there is no jurisdictional bar toour resolving the questions presented.We deem it necessary to do no more than give a briefsummary of the law and of the Special Master's careful andwell-documented findings and conclusions, for Louisiana'sexceptions have little merit and must be rejected.The controlling legal principles are not in dispute. In allfour of the prior cases that have involved the MississippiRiver boundary between Louisiana and Mississippi, we haveapplied the rule of the thalweg. Louisiana v. Mississippi,466 U. S. 96, 99 (1984); Louisiana v. Mississippi, 384 U. S.24, 25-26, reh'g denied, 384 U. S. 958 (1966); Louisiana v.516us1$$4z 08-21-97 18:02:27 PAGES OPINPGT25Cite as: 516 U. S. 22 (1995)Opinion of the CourtMississippi, 282 U. S. 458, 459 (1931); Louisiana v. Mississippi, 202 U. S. 1, 49 (1906). Though there are exceptions,the rule is that the river boundary between States lies alongthe main downstream navigational channel, or thalweg, andmoves as the channel changes with the gradual processes oferosion and accretion. Louisiana v. Mississippi, 466 U. S.,at 99-101;Arkansas v. Tennessee, 397 U. S. 88, 89-90 (1970).There exists an island exception to the general rule, whichprovides that if there is a divided river flow around an island,a boundary once established on one side of the island remainsthere, even though the main downstream navigation channelshifts to the island's other side. Indiana v. Kentucky, 136U. S. 479, 508-509 (1890); Missouri v. Kentucky, 11 Wall. 395,401 (1871). The island exception serves to avoid disturbinga State's sovereignty over an island if there are changes inthe main navigation channel.The Special Master found that the disputed area derivedfrom an island, known as Stack Island, that had been withinMississippi's boundary before the river's main navigationalchannel shifted to the east of the island. The Special Masterfound that, through erosion on its east bank and accretion onits west bank, Stack Island changed from its original location, next to the Mississippi bank of the river, to its currentlocation, abutting the Louisiana bank. Pursuant to the island exception, then, the Special Master placed the boundaryon the west side of the disputed area, confirming Mississippi'ssovereignty over it. Because the land is located in Mississippi, the Special Master found that Louisiana had no standing to challenge the Houston Group's claim of title.Louisiana advances a different version of events. It concedes that there did exist a Stack Island in 1881 and that itwas formed in Mississippi territory. In that year the landwas surveyed for a federal land patent that was later grantedto the Houston Group's predecessor in interest, StephenBlackwell. Louisiana maintains that two years later, in1883, Stack Island washed away and was replaced by mere516us1$$4z 08-21-97 18:02:27 PAGES OPINPGT26 LOUISIANA v. MISSISSIPPIOpinion of the Courtalluvial deposits, which at various times over the last 100years were not sufficient in size or stability to be deemed anisland. Some of these alluvial deposits may or may not havegravitated to the disputed area; nonetheless, according toLouisiana, the disputed area was not formed from anythingthat can be said to be Stack Island but rather was formedby random accretion to the west bank of the river.The Special Master rejected Louisiana's theory as not sup-ported by the evidence, and we agree. The only evidencethat Louisiana presented to support its theory of Stack Is-land's disappearance is a Mississippi River Commission mapdated April 1883. The map was prepared in 1881, with hydrographic data added in an overlay in 1883. Of particularinterest is a solid green line labeled as the "present steamboat channel" that runs over a portion of Stack Island as itwas drawn in 1881. Louisiana's expert interpreted thatgreen line to mean that Stack Island had disappeared by1883.The Special Master questioned the authenticity of the document because testimony suggested that no such map hadbeen published by the Mississippi River Commission and because a different map published by the Commission the samemonth, April 1883, showed Stack Island in existence. Evenif we assume the document's authenticity, however, it doesnot settle the question, for we agree with the Special Masterthat boats could have passed close enough to the island without the entire island having disappeared. Louisiana's reading of the document was contradicted, moreover, by thesworn testimony of Stephen Blackwell and two other witnesses given on May 5, 1885, stating that Blackwell and hisfamily had lived on Stack Island continuously from April 2,1882, to the date of the testimony and were cultivating 20acres. Furthermore, in November 1883, six months afterStack Island was supposed to have vanished, the MississippiRiver Commission, in reporting on its construction of dikesjust north of Stack Island, stated that " `this work showed516us1$$4z 08-21-97 18:02:27 PAGES OPINPGT27Cite as: 516 U. S. 22 (1995)Opinion of the Courtgood results, forcing the main channel of the river to theright of the island and building a bar to the head of StackIsland, as shown by the high-water survey of April 1883.' "Report of Special Master 20.Like the Special Master, we are unconvinced that StackIsland disappeared in 1883. Louisiana alleges other disap-pearances, including one as recently as 1948. We find nocredible evidence of these disappearances, but instead findcompelling evidence of Stack Island's continued existence.We note first that the north portion of Stack Island has 70-year-old cottonwood trees growing on it and that long-timeresidents of the area report no disappearances of the island.The record, moreover, contains numerous maps of the regionbeginning with the 1881 patent survey and coming into thepresent era, and every one of them shows the existence ofStack Island. With the exception of a single exhibit, dated1970, all of the maps and mosaics show a land mass that themapmaker identifies by name as Stack Island, even for theyears since 1954 when that land mass has no longer beeninsular in form. These maps show Stack Island's progression from the Mississippi side of the river to the Louisianaside. When the maps are superimposed one over the otherin chronological order, the successive maps show a land masscovering a significant portion of Stack Island shown on thepreceding map. The maps satisfy us that Stack Island didnot wash away and is now the disputed area.We need not delve into the proper definition of an island,as Louisiana would have us do, because the Special Masteradopted Louisiana's rigorous test, and found that Stack Island satisfied it.Louisiana raises no exceptions to that portion of the Special Master's report finding that Louisiana lacked standingto challenge the Houston Group's claim of title. Louisianarequests a new trial of the supplemental hearing before theSpecial Master but offers no sound reason in support of thatrequest, so we must deny it.516us1$$4z 08-21-97 18:02:27 PAGES OPINPGT28 LOUISIANA v.
