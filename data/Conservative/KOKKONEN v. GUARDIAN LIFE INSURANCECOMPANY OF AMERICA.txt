After respondent Guardian Life Insurance Company 1 ter-minated petitioner's general agency agreement, petitionerbrought suit in California Superior Court alleging variousstate-law claims. Respondent removed the case to theUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Cali-fornia on the basis of diversity jurisdiction and filed state-lawcounterclaims.

On April 13, the District Judge signed the Stipulation and Order under the nota-tion "It is so ordered." The Stipulation and Order did notreserve jurisdiction in the District Court to enforce the settlement agreement; indeed, it did not so much as refer to thesettlement agreement.Thereafter the parties disagreed on petitioner's obligationto return certain files to respondent under the settlementagreement. On May 21, respondent moved in the DistrictCourt to enforce the agreement, which petitioner opposed onthe ground, inter alia, that the court lacked subject-matterjurisdiction. The District Court entered an enforcementorder, asserting an "inherent power" to do so. Order Enforcing Settlement (ED Cal., Aug. 19, 1992), App. 180. Petitioner appealed, relying solely on his jurisdictional objection.The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitaffirmed, quoting its opinion in Wilkinson v. FBI, 922 F. 2d555, 557 (1991), to the effect that after dismissal of an actionpursuant to a settlement agreement, a " `district court ha[s]jurisdiction to decide the [enforcement] motion[] under itsinherent supervisory power.'

S. 930 (1993).Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Theypossess only that power authorized by Constitution and statute, see Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503 U. S. 131, 136-137 (1992);Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 541(1986), which is not to be expanded by judicial decree, American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U. S. 6 (1951). It isto be presumed that a cause lies outside this limited jurisdiction, Turner v. Bank of North-America, 4 Dall. 8, 11 (1799),and the burden of establishing the contrary rests upon theparty asserting jurisdiction, McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.

OF AMERICAOpinion of the CourtThe dismissal in this case issued pursuant to Federal Ruleof Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(ii), which provides for dismissal"by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties whohave appeared in the action," and causes that dismissal to bewith prejudice if (as here) the stipulation so specifies. Nei-ther the Rule nor any provision of law provides for jurisdiction of the court over disputes arising out of an agreementthat produces the stipulation. It must be emphasized thatwhat respondent seeks in this case is enforcement of the set-tlement agreement, and not merely reopening of the dismissed suit by reason of breach of the agreement that wasthe basis for dismissal. Some Courts of Appeals have heldthat the latter can be obtained under Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 60(b)(6).2 See, e. g., Keeling v. Sheet Metal Workers Int'l Assn., 937 F. 2d 408, 410 (CA9 1991); Fairfax Countywide Citizens Assn. v. Fairfax County, 571 F. 2d 1299,1302-1303 (CA4 1978). But seeSawka v. Healtheast, Inc.,989 F. 2d 138, 140-141 (CA3 1993) (breach of settlementagreement insufficient reason to set dismissal aside on Rule60(b)(6) grounds); Harman v. Pauley, 678 F. 2d 479, 480-481(CA4 1982) (Rule 60(b)(6) does not require vacating dismissalorder whenever a settlement agreement has been breached).Enforcement of the settlement agreement, however, whetherthrough award of damages or decree of specific performance,is more than just a continuation or renewal of the dismissedsuit, and hence requires its own basis for jurisdiction.Respondent relies upon the doctrine of ancillary jurisdic-tion, which recognizes federal courts' jurisdiction over somematters (otherwise beyond their competence) that are inci-dental to other matters properly before them. Respondentappeals to our statement (quoting a then-current treatise on2 The relevant provision of that Rule reads as follows:"On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a partyor a party's legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: . . . (6) any other reason justifying relieffrom the operation of the judgment."511us2$47K 11-03-97 18:48:27 PAGES OPINPGT379Cite as: 511 U. S. 375 (1994)Opinion of the Courtequity) in Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93 (1904): "Abill filed to continue a former litigation in the same court . . .to obtain and secure the fruits, benefits and advantages ofthe proceedings and judgment in a former suit in the samecourt by the same or additional parties . . . or to obtain anyequitable relief in regard to, or connected with, or growingout of, any judgment or proceeding at law rendered in thesame court, . . . is an ancillary suit." Id., at 113-114 (citing1 C. Bates, Federal Equity Procedure $ 97 (1901)).The doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction can hardly be criti-cized for being overly rigid or precise, but we think it doesnot stretch so far as that statement suggests. The expansive language of Julian can be countered by (equally inaccurate) dicta in later cases that provide an excessively limiteddescription of the doctrine. See, e. g., Fulton Nat. Bank ofAtlanta v. Hozier, 267 U. S. 276, 280 (1925) ("[N]o controversy can be regarded as dependent or ancillary unless it hasdirect relation to property or assets actually or constructively drawn into the court's possession or control by theprincipal suit"). The holding of Julian was not remotely aspermissive as its language: Jurisdiction was based upon thefact that the court, in a prior decree of foreclosure, had expressly reserved jurisdiction to adjudicate claims against thejudicially conveyed property, and to retake and resell theproperty if claims it found valid were not paid. 193 U. S.,at 109-112.It is to the holdings of our cases, rather than their dicta,that we must attend, and we find none of them that has, forpurposes of asserting otherwise nonexistent federal jurisdiction, relied upon a relationship so tenuous as the breach ofan agreement that produced the dismissal of an earlier federal suit. Generally speaking, we have asserted ancillaryjurisdiction (in the very broad sense in which that term issometimes used) for two separate, though sometimes related,purposes: (1) to permit disposition by a single court of claimsthat are, in varying respects and degrees, factually interde511us2$47K 11-03-97 18:48:27 PAGES OPINPGT380 KOKKONEN v. GUARDIAN LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICAOpinion of the Courtpendent, see, e. g., Baker v. Gold Seal Liquors, Inc., 417 U. S.467, 469, n. 1 (1974);Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange,270 U. S. 593, 610 (1926); and (2) to enable a court to functionsuccessfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate itsauthority, and effectuate its decrees, see, e. g., Chambers v.NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32 (1991) (power to compel paymentof opposing party's attorney's fees as sanction for misconduct); United States v. Hudson, 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812) (con-tempt power to maintain order during proceedings). Seegenerally 13 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Prac-tice and Procedure $ 3523 (1984); cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 1367 (1988ed., Supp. IV).Neither of these heads supports the present assertion ofjurisdiction. As to the first, the facts underlying respondent's dismissed claim for breach of agency agreement andthose underlying its claim for breach of settlement agreement have nothing to do with each other; it would neitherbe necessary nor even particularly efficient that they be adjudicated together. No case of ours asserts, nor do we thinkthe concept of limited federal jurisdiction permits us to assert, ancillary jurisdiction over any agreement that has aspart of its consideration the dismissal of a case before a federal court.But it is the second head of ancillary jurisdiction, relatingto the court's power to protect its proceedings and vindicateits authority, that both courts in the present case appear tohave relied upon, judging from their references to "inherentpower," see App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2 and A-5; App. 180.We think, however, that the power asked for here is quiteremote from what courts require in order to perform theirfunctions. We have recognized inherent authority to appoint counsel to investigate and prosecute violation of acourt's order. Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et FilsS. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987). But the only order here was thatthe suit be dismissed, a disposition that is in no way floutedor imperiled by the alleged breach of the settlement agree511us2$47K 11-03-97 18:48:27 PAGES OPINPGT381Cite as: 511 U. S. 375 (1994)Opinion of the Courtment. The situation would be quite different if the parties'obligation to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement had been made part of the order of dismissal--eitherby separate provision (such as a provision "retaining jurisdiction" over the settlement agreement) or by incorporatingthe terms of the settlement agreement in the order. In thatevent, a breach of the agreement would be a violation of theorder, and ancillary jurisdiction to enforce the agreementwould therefore exist. That, however, was not the casehere. The judge's mere awareness and approval of theterms of the settlement agreement do not suffice to makethem part of his order.The short of the matter is this: The suit involves a claimfor breach of a contract, part of the consideration for whichwas dismissal of an earlier federal suit. No federal statutemakes that connection (if it constitutionally could) the basisfor federal-court jurisdiction over the contract dispute. Thefacts to be determined with regard to such alleged breachesof contract are quite separate from the facts to be determined in the principal suit, and automatic jurisdiction oversuch contracts is in no way essential to the conduct offederal-court business. If the parties wish to provide forthe court's enforcement of a dismissal-producing settlementagreement, they can seek to do so. When the dismissal ispursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(2), whichspecifies that the action "shall not be dismissed at the plaintiff 's instance save upon order of the court and upon suchterms and conditions as the court deems proper," the parties'compliance with the terms of the settlement contract (or thecourt's "retention of jurisdiction" over the settlement contract) may, in the court's discretion, be one of the terms setforth in the order. Even when, as occurred here, the dismissal is pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(ii) (which does not by itsterms empower a district court to attach conditions to theparties' stipulation of dismissal) we think the court is authorized to embody the settlement contract in its dismissal order511us2$47K 11-03-97 18:48:27 PAGES OPINPGT382 KOKKONEN v. GUARDIAN LIFE INS. CO. OF AMERICAOpinion of the Court(or, what has the same effect, retain jurisdiction over thesettlement contract) if the parties agree. Absent such action, however, enforcement of the settlement agreement isfor state courts, unless there is some independent basis forfederal jurisdiction.We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
