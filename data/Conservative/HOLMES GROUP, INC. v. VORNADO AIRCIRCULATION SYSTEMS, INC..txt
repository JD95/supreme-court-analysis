In this case, we address whether the Court of Appeals forthe Federal Circuit has appellate jurisdiction over a case inwhich the complaint does not allege a claim arising underfederal patent law, but the answer contains a patent-lawcounterclaim. IRespondent, Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., is amanufacturer of patented fans and heaters. In late 1992,*David W. Long filed a brief for the Patent, Trademark, and CopyrightSection of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia as amicuscuriae.535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN828 HOLMES GROUP, INC. v. VORNADO AIRCIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.Opinion of the Courtrespondent sued a competitor, Duracraft Corp., claiming thatDuracraft's use of a "spiral grill design" in its fans infringedrespondent's trade dress. The Court of Appeals for theTenth Circuit found for Duracraft, holding that Vornado hadno protectable trade-dress rights in the grill design. SeeVornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. v. Duracraft Corp.,58 F. 3d 1498 (1995) (Vornado I).Nevertheless, on November 26, 1999, respondent lodged acomplaint with the United States International Trade Commission against petitioner, The Holmes Group, Inc., claimingthat petitioner's sale of fans and heaters with a spiral grilldesign infringed respondent's patent and the same tradedress held unprotectable in Vornado I. Several weeks later,petitioner filed this action against respondent in the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Kansas, seeking,inter alia, a declaratory judgment that its products did notinfringe respondent's trade dress and an injunction restraining respondent from accusing it of trade-dress infringementin promotional materials. Respondent's answer asserted acompulsory counterclaim alleging patent infringement.The District Court granted petitioner the declaratoryjudgment and injunction it sought. 93 F. Supp. 2d 1140(Kan. 2000). The court explained that the collateralestoppel effect of Vornado I precluded respondent from relitigating its claim of trade-dress rights in the spiral grilldesign. It rejected respondent's contention that an intervening Federal Circuit case, Midwest Industries, Inc. v. Karavan Trailers, Inc., 175 F. 3d 1356 (1999), which disagreedwith the Tenth Circuit's reasoning in Vornado I, constituteda change in the law of trade dress that warranted relitigationof respondent's trade-dress claim. The court also stayed allproceedings related to respondent's counterclaim, addingthat the counterclaim would be dismissed if the declaratoryjudgment and injunction entered in favor of petitioner wereaffirmed on appeal.535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN829Cite as: 535 U. S. 826 (2002)Opinion of the CourtRespondent appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fed-eral Circuit. Notwithstanding petitioner's challenge to itsjurisdiction, the Federal Circuit vacated the District Court'sjudgment, 13 Fed. Appx. 961 (2001), and remanded for consideration of whether the "change in the law" exception tocollateral estoppel applied in light of TrafFix Devices, Inc.v. Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U. S. 23 (2001), a case de-cided after the District Court's judgment which resolved aCircuit split involving Vornado I and Midwest Industries.We granted certiorari to consider whether the Federal Circuit properly asserted jurisdiction over the appeal. 534U. S. 1016 (2001).IICongress vested the Federal Circuit with exclusive juris-diction over "an appeal from a final decision of a districtcourt of the United States . . . if the jurisdiction of that courtwas based, in whole or in part, on [28 U. S. C. $ ] 1338 . . . ."28 U. S. C. $ 1295(a)(1) (emphasis added). Section 1338(a), inturn, provides in relevant part that "[t]he district courtsshall have original jurisdiction of any civil action arisingunder any Act of Congress relating to patents . . . ." Thus,the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is fixed with reference tothat of the district court, and turns on whether the actionarises under federal patent law.1Section 1338(a) uses the same operative language as28 U. S. C. $ 1331, the statute conferring general federal-question jurisdiction, which gives the district courts "original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Consti-tution, laws, or treaties of the United States." (Emphasisadded.) We said in Christianson v. Colt Industries Operat1 Like Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., 486 U. S. 800,814-815 (1988), this case does not call upon us to decide whether the Federal Circuit's jurisdiction is fixed with reference to the complaint as initially filed or whether an actual or constructive amendment to the complaint raising a patent-law claim can provide the foundation for theFederal Circuit's jurisdiction.535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN830 HOLMES GROUP, INC. v. VORNADO AIRCIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.Opinion of the Courting Corp., 486 U. S. 800, 808 (1988), that "[l]inguistic consist-ency" requires us to apply the same test to determinewhether a case arises under $ 1338(a) as under $ 1331.The well-pleaded-complaint rule has long governedwhether a case "arises under" federal law for purposes of$ 1331.2 See, e. g., Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Texaco Inc., 415U. S. 125, 127-128 (1974) (per curiam). As "appropriatelyadapted to $ 1338(a)," the well-pleaded-complaint rule provides that whether a case "arises under" patent law "must bedetermined from what necessarily appears in the plaintiff 'sstatement of his own claim in the bill or declaration . . . ."Christianson, 486 U. S., at 809 (internal quotation marksomitted). The plaintiff 's well-pleaded complaint must "establis[h] either that federal patent law creates the causeof action or that the plaintiff 's right to relief necessarilydepends on resolution of a substantial question of federalpatent law . . . ." Ibid. Here, it is undisputed that petitioner's well-pleaded complaint did not assert any claim arisingunder federal patent law. The Federal Circuit thereforeerred in asserting jurisdiction over this appeal.ARespondent argues that the well-pleaded-complaint rule,properly understood, allows a counterclaim to serve as thebasis for a district court's "arising under" jurisdiction. Wedisagree.2 The well-pleaded-complaint rule also governs whether a case is removable from state to federal court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a), whichprovides in relevant part:"Except as otherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civilaction brought in a State court of which the district courts of the UnitedStates have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the defendant or thedefendants, to the district court of the United States for the district anddivision embracing the place where such action is pending."See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trustfor Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1 (1983).535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN831Cite as: 535 U. S. 826 (2002)Opinion of the CourtAdmittedly, our prior cases have only required us to address whether a federal defense, rather than a federal counterclaim, can establish "arising under" jurisdiction. Nevertheless, those cases were decided on the principle thatfederal jurisdiction generally exists "only when a federalquestion is presented on the face of the plaintiff 's properlypleaded complaint." Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U. S.386, 392 (1987) (emphasis added). As we said in The Fair v.Kohler Die & Specialty Co., 228 U. S. 22, 25 (1913), whethera case arises under federal patent law "cannot depend uponthe answer." Moreover, we have declined to adopt proposals that "the answer as well as the complaint . . . be consultedbefore a determination [is] made whether the case `ar[ises]under' federal law . . . ." Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for Southern Cal., 463U. S. 1, 10-11, n. 9 (1983) (citing American Law Institute,Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and Federal Courts $ 1312, pp. 188-194 (1969)). It follows thata counterclaim--which appears as part of the defendant's answer, not as part of the plaintiff 's complaint--cannot serveas the basis for "arising under" jurisdiction. See, e. g.,In re Adams, 809 F. 2d 1187, 1188, n. 1 (CA5 1987); FDICv. Elefant, 790 F. 2d 661, 667 (CA7 1986); Takeda v. Northwestern National Life Ins. Co., 765 F. 2d 815, 822 (CA9 1985);14B C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice andProcedure $ 3722, pp. 402-414 (3d ed. 1998).Allowing a counterclaim to establish "arising under" jurisdiction would also contravene the longstanding policiesunderlying our precedents. First, since the plaintiff is"the master of the complaint," the well-pleaded-complaintrule enables him, "by eschewing claims based on federallaw, . . . to have the cause heard in state court." CaterpillarInc., supra, at 398-399. The rule proposed by respondent,in contrast, would leave acceptance or rejection of a stateforum to the master of the counterclaim. It would allow a535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN832 HOLMES GROUP, INC. v. VORNADO AIRCIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.Opinion of the Courtdefendant to remove a case brought in state court understate law, thereby defeating a plaintiff 's choice of forum,simply by raising a federal counterclaim. Second, confer-ring this power upon the defendant would radically expandthe class of removable cases, contrary to the "[d]ue regardfor the rightful independence of state governments" that ourcases addressing removal require. See Shamrock Oil & GasCorp. v. Sheets, 313 U. S. 100, 109 (1941) (internal quotationmarks omitted). And finally, allowing responsive pleadingsby the defendant to establish "arising under" jurisdictionwould undermine the clarity and ease of administrationof the well-pleaded-complaint doctrine, which serves as a"quick rule of thumb" for resolving jurisdictional conflicts.See Franchise Tax Bd., supra, at 11.For these reasons, we decline to transform the longstanding well-pleaded-complaint rule into the "well-pleaded-complaint-or-counterclaim rule" urged by respondent.BRespondent argues, in the alternative, that even if a coun-terclaim generally cannot establish the original "arisingunder" jurisdiction of a district court, we should interpretthe phrase "arising under" differently in ascertaining theFederal Circuit's jurisdiction. In respondent's view, effectu-ating Congress's goal of "promoting the uniformity of patentlaw," Brief for Respondent 21, requires us to interpret$$ 1295(a)(1) and 1338(a) to confer exclusive appellate jurisdiction on the Federal Circuit whenever a patent-law coun-terclaim is raised.33 Echoing a variant of this argument, Justice Ginsburg contends that"giv[ing] effect" to Congress's intention "to eliminate forum shopping andto advance uniformity in . . . patent law" requires that the Federal Circuithave exclusive jurisdiction whenever a patent claim was "actually adjudicated." Post, at 840 (opinion concurring in judgment). We rejected precisely this argument in Christianson, viz., the suggestion that the Federal535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN833Cite as: 535 U. S. 826 (2002)Opinion of the CourtWe do not think this option is available. Our task hereis not to determine what would further Congress's goal ofensuring patent-law uniformity, but to determine whatthe words of the statute must fairly be understood to mean.It would be difficult enough to give "arising under" themeaning urged by respondent if that phrase appearedin $ 1295(a)(1)--the jurisdiction-conferring statute--itself.Cf. Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, $ 211(b)(2), 85 Stat.749 (providing the Temporary Emergency Court of Appealswith exclusive jurisdiction over appeals "in cases and contro-versies arising under this title"). Even then the phrasewould not be some neologism that might justify our advert-ing to the general purpose of the legislation, but rather aterm familiar to all law students as invoking the well-pleaded-complaint rule. Cf.Coastal States Marketing, Inc.v. New England Petroleum Corp., 604 F. 2d 179, 183 (CA21979) ("The use of the phrase `cases and controversies arisingunder' . . . is strong evidence that Congress intended to bor-row the body of decisional law that has developed under 28U. S. C. $ 1331 and other grants of jurisdiction to the districtcourts over cases `arising under' various regulatory stat-utes"). But the present case is even weaker than that, since$ 1295(a)(1) does not itself use the term, but rather refers tojurisdiction under $ 1338, where it is well established that"arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents"invokes, specifically, the well-pleaded-complaint rule. Itwould be an unprecedented feat of interpretive necromancyto say that $ 1338(a)'s "arising under" language means onething (the well-pleaded-complaint rule) in its own right,Circuit's jurisdiction is "fixed `by reference to the case actually litigated.' "486 U. S., at 813 (quoting Brief for Respondent in Christianson v. ColtIndustries Operating Corp., O. T. 1987, No. 87-499, p. 31). We held thatthe Federal Circuit's jurisdiction, like that of the district court, "is determined by reference to the well-pleaded complaint, not the well-tried case."486 U. S., at 814.535US3 Unit: $U56 [09-23-03 15:45:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN834 HOLMES GROUP, INC. v. VORNADO AIRCIRCULATION SYSTEMS, INC.Opinion of Stevens, J.but something quite different (respondent's complaint-or-counterclaim rule) when referred to by $ 1295(a)(1).4* * *Not all cases involving a patent-law claim fall withinthe Federal Circuit's jurisdiction. By limiting the FederalCircuit's jurisdiction to cases in which district courts wouldhave jurisdiction under $ 1338, Congress referred to a wellestablished body of law that requires courts to considerwhether a patent-law claim appears on the face of the plaintiff 's well-pleaded complaint. Because petitioner's com-plaint did not include any claim based on patent law, wevacate the judgment of the Federal Circuit and remandthe case with instructions to transfer the case to the Courtof Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1631.
