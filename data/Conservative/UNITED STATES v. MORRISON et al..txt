Shortly after the rape Brzon-kala stopped attending classes and withdrew from theuniversity.In early 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against respondents under Virginia Tech's Sexual Assault Policy. Duringthe school-conducted hearing on her complaint, Morrisonadmitted having sexual contact with her despite the factthat she had twice told him "no." After the hearing, Vir-ginia Tech's Judicial Committee found insufficient evidenceto punish Crawford, but found Morrison guilty of sexualassault and sentenced him to immediate suspension for twosemesters.Virginia Tech's dean of students upheld the judicial committee's sentence. However, in July 1995, Virginia Tech informed Brzonkala that Morrison intended to initiate a courtchallenge to his conviction under the Sexual Assault Policy.University officials told her that a second hearing would benecessary to remedy the school's error in prosecuting hercomplaint under that policy, which had not been widely circulated to students. The university therefore conducted asecond hearing under its Abusive Conduct Policy, which wasin force prior to the dissemination of the Sexual AssaultPolicy. Following this second hearing the Judicial Committee again found Morrison guilty and sentenced him to anidentical 2-semester suspension. This time, however, thedescription of Morrison's offense was, without explanation,changed from "sexual assault" to "using abusive language."Morrison appealed his second conviction through theuniversity's administrative system. On August 21, 1995,Virginia Tech's senior vice president and provost set asideMorrison's punishment. She concluded that it was " `excessive when compared with other cases where there hasbeen a finding of violation of the Abusive Conduct Policy,' "Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and StateUniv., 132 F. 3d 950, 955 (CA4 1997). Virginia Tech did notinform Brzonkala of this decision.

MORRISONOpinion of the Courtnewspaper that Morrison would be returning to VirginiaTech for the fall 1995 semester, she dropped out of theuniversity.In December 1995, Brzonkala sued Morrison, Crawford,and Virginia Tech in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Virginia. Her complaint alleged thatMorrison's and Crawford's attack violated $ 13981 and thatVirginia Tech's handling of her complaint violated Title IXof the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373-375,20 U. S. C. $$ 1681-1688. Morrison and Crawford moved todismiss this complaint on the grounds that it failed to statea claim and that $ 13981's civil remedy is unconstitutional.The United States, petitioner in No. 99-5, intervened to de-fend $ 13981's constitutionality.The District Court dismissed Brzonkala's Title IX claimsagainst Virginia Tech for failure to state a claim upon whichrelief can be granted. See Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 935 F. Supp. 772 (WD Va. 1996).It then held that Brzonkala's complaint stated a claim againstMorrison and Crawford under $ 13981, but dismissed thecomplaint because it concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the section under either the Commerce Clause or$ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.Brzonkala v.

And subsection (e)(3) provides a$ 13981 litigant with a choice of forums: Federal and statecourts "shall have concurrent jurisdiction" over complaintsbrought under the section.Although the foregoing language of $ 13981 covers a wideswath of criminal conduct, Congress placed some limitations on the section's federal civil remedy.

It said that a "Federal civil rights cause of action"is established "[p]ursuant to the affirmative power of Con-gress . . . under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment tothe Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I ofthe Constitution." 42 U.

We address Congress' authority to enact this remedy under each of theseconstitutional provisions in turn.IIDue respect for the decisions of a coordinate branch ofGovernment demands that we invalidate a congressionalenactment only upon a plain showing that Congress hasexceeded its constitutional bounds. SeeUnited States v.Lopez, 514 U. S., at 568, 577-578 (Kennedy, J., concurring);United States v. Harris, 106 U. S., at 635. With this pre-sumption of constitutionality in mind, we turn to the question whether $ 13981 falls within Congress' power underArticle I, $ 8, of the Constitution. Brzonkala and the UnitedStates rely upon the third clause of the section, which givesCongress power "[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the IndianTribes."As we discussed at length in Lopez, our interpreta-tion of the Commerce Clause has changed as our Nationhas developed. See 514 U. S., at 552-557; id., at 568-574(Kennedy, J., concurring); id., at 584, 593-599 (Thomas, J.,concurring). We need not repeat that detailed review of529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN608 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the Courtthe Commerce Clause's history here; it suffices to say that,in the years since NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,301 U. S. 1 (1937), Congress has had considerably greaterlatitude in regulating conduct and transactions under theCommerce Clause than our previous case law permitted.See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 555-556; id., at 573-574 (Kennedy,J., concurring).Lopez emphasized, however, that even under our modern,expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Congress' regulatory authority is not without effective bounds.Id., at 557."[E]ven [our] modern-era precedents which haveexpanded congressional power under the CommerceClause confirm that this power is subject to outer limits.In Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court warned that thescope of the interstate commerce power `must be con-sidered in the light of our dual system of governmentand may not be extended so as to embrace effectsupon interstate commerce so indirect and remote thatto embrace them, in view of our complex society, wouldeffectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely central-ized government.' "Id., at 556-557 (quoting Jones &Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).3As we observed in Lopez, modern Commerce Clause juris-prudence has "identified three broad categories of activitythat Congress may regulate under its commerce power."3 Justice Souter's dissent takes us to task for allegedly abandoning Jones & Laughlin Steel in favor of an inadequate "federalism ofsome earlier time." Post, at 641-643, 655. As the foregoing languagefrom Jones & Laughlin Steel makes clear however, this Court has alwaysrecognized a limit on the commerce power inherent in "our dual systemof government." 301 U. S., at 37. It is the dissent's remarkable theorythat the commerce power is without judicially enforceable boundariesthat disregards the Court's caution in Jones & Laughlin Steel againstallowing that power to "effectually obliterate the distinction betweenwhat is national and what is local."

"First,Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstatecommerce." 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Heart of Atlanta Motel,Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 256 (1964); United Statesv. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941)).

"Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulatethose activities having a substantial relation to interstatecommerce, . . . i. e., those activities that substantially affectinterstate commerce." 514 U. S., at 558-559 (citing Jones &Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).Petitioners do not contend that these cases fall withineither of the first two of these categories of CommerceClause regulation. They seek to sustain $ 13981 as a regulation of activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. Given $ 13981's focus on gender-motivated violencewherever it occurs (rather than violence directed at the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, interstate markets,or things or persons in interstate commerce), we agree thatthis is the proper inquiry.Since Lopez most recently canvassed and clarified ourcase law governing this third category of Commerce Clauseregulation, it provides the proper framework for conductingthe required analysis of $ 13981. In Lopez, we held that theGun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U. S. C. $ 922(q)(1)(A),which made it a federal crime to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone, exceeded Congress' authority under theCommerce Clause. See 514 U. S., at 551. Several significant considerations contributed to our decision.529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN610 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the CourtFirst, we observed that $ 922(q) was "a criminal statutethat by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or anysort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might de-fine those terms."Id., at 561. Reviewing our case law, wenoted that "we have upheld a wide variety of congressionalActs regulating intrastate economic activity where we haveconcluded that the activity substantially affected interstatecommerce." Id., at 559. Although we cited only a few ex-amples, includingWickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942);Hodel, supra; Perez, supra; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379U. S. 294 (1964); andHeart of Atlanta Motel, supra, westated that the pattern of analysis is clear. Lopez, 514 U. S.,at 559-560. "Where economic activity substantially affectsinterstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity willbe sustained." Id., at 560.Both petitioners and Justice Souter's dissent downplaythe role that the economic nature of the regulated activityplays in our Commerce Clause analysis. But a fair readingof Lopez shows that the noneconomic, criminal nature of theconduct at issue was central to our decision in that case.See, e. g., id., at 551 ("The Act [does not] regulat[e] a commercial activity"), 560 ("Even Wickard, which is perhapsthe most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity, involved economic activity in away that the possession of a gun in a school zone does not"),561 ("Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity"), 566 ("Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activity is commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result in legal uncertainty.But, so long as Congress' authority is limited to those powersenumerated in the Constitution, and so long as those enumerated powers are interpreted as having judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender `legal uncertainty' "), 567("The possession of a gun in a local school zone is in nosense an economic activity that might, through repetition529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN611Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)Opinion of the Courtelsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate com-merce"); see alsoid., at 573-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring)(stating that Lopez did not alter our "practical conceptionof commercial regulation" and that Congress may "regulatein the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have asingle market and a unified purpose to build a stable nationaleconomy"), 577 ("Were the Federal Government to take overthe regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern,areas having nothing to do with the regulation of commercialactivities, the boundaries between the spheres of federaland state authority would blur"), 580 ("[U]nlike the earliercases to come before the Court here neither the actors northeir conduct has a commercial character, and neither thepurposes nor the design of the statute has an evident com-mercial nexus. The statute makes the simple possessionof a gun within 1,000 feet of the grounds of the schoola criminal offense. In a sense any conduct in this interdependent world of ours has an ultimate commercial originor consequence, but we have not yet said the commercepower may reach so far" (citation omitted)). Lopez's reviewof Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in thosecases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity's substantial effectson interstate commerce, the activity in question has beensome sort of economic endeavor. See id., at 559-560.4The second consideration that we found important inanalyzing $ 922(q) was that the statute contained "no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach toa discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have4 Justice Souter's dissent does not reconcile its analysis with ourholding in Lopez because it apparently would cast that decision aside.See post, at 637-643. However, the dissent cannot persuasively contradictLopez's conclusion that, in every case where we have sustained federalregulation under the aggregation principle in Wickard v. Filburn, 317U. S. 111 (1942), the regulated activity was of an apparent commercialcharacter. See, e. g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 559-560, 580.529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN612 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the Courtan explicit connection with or effect on interstate com-merce."Id., at 562. Such a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of Congress' regu-lation of interstate commerce.Third, we noted that neither $ 922(q) " `nor its legislativehistory contain[s] express congressional findings regardingthe effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in aschool zone.' " Ibid. (quoting Brief for United States, O. T.1994, No. 93-1260, pp. 5-6). While "Congress normally isnot required to make formal findings as to the substantialburdens that an activity has on interstate commerce," 514U. S., at 562 (citing McClung, supra, at 304; Perez, 402 U. S.,at 156), the existence of such findings may "enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in questionsubstantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even though nosuch substantial effect [is] visible to the naked eye." 514U. S., at 563.Finally, our decision in Lopez rested in part on the factthat the link between gun possession and a substantial effecton interstate commerce was attenuated. Id., at 563-567.The United States argued that the possession of guns maylead to violent crime, and that violent crime "can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy intwo ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial,and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs arespread throughout the population. Second, violent crimereduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areaswithin the country that are perceived to be unsafe." Id.,at 563-564 (citation omitted). The Government also arguedthat the presence of guns at schools poses a threat to theeducational process, which in turn threatens to produce aless efficient and productive work force, which will negatively affect national productivity and thus interstate commerce. Ibid.We rejected these "costs of crime" and "national productivity" arguments because they would permit Congress529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN613Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)Opinion of the Courtto "regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities thatmight lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously theyrelate to interstate commerce." Id., at 564. We noted that,under this but-for reasoning:"Congress could regulate any activity that it found wasrelated to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and childcustody), for example. Under the[se] theories . . . , it isdifficult to perceive any limitation on federal power,even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign.Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments,we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individ-ual that Congress is without power to regulate."Ibid.With these principles underlying our Commerce Clausejurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution ofthe present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of vio-lence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity.While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggre-gating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order todecide these cases, thus far in our Nation's history our caseshave upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature. See, e. g.,id., at 559-560, and the cases cited therein.Like the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in Lopez,$ 13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing thatthe federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress' powerto regulate interstate commerce. Although Lopez makesclear that such a jurisdictional element would lend supportto the argument that $ 13981 is sufficiently tied to interstatecommerce, Congress elected to cast $ 13981's remedy over awider, and more purely intrastate, body of violent crime.55 Title 42 U. S. C. $ 13981 is not the sole provision of the Violence AgainstWomen Act of 1994 to provide a federal remedy for gender-motivatedcrime. Section 40221(a) of the Act creates a federal criminal remedy to529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN614 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the CourtIn contrast with the lack of congressional findings that wefaced in Lopez, $ 13981 is supported by numerous findingsregarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violencehas on victims and their families. See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep.No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994); S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 40 (1993);S. Rep. No. 101-545, p. 33 (1990). But the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain theconstitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation. As westated in Lopez, " `[S]imply because Congress may concludethat a particular activity substantially affects interstatecommerce does not necessarily make it so.' " 514 U. S., at557, n. 2 (quoting Hodel, 452 U. S., at 311 (Rehnquist, J.,concurring in judgment)). Rather, " `[w]hether particularoperations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to comeunder the constitutional power of Congress to regulate themis ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question,and can be settled finally only by this Court.' " 514 U. S., at557, n. 2 (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 273(Black, J., concurring)).punish "interstate crimes of abuse including crimes committed againstspouses or intimate partners during interstate travel and crimes committed by spouses or intimate partners who cross State lines to continuethe abuse." S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 43 (1993). That criminal provisionhas been codified at 18 U. S.

S. 598 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIn these cases, Congress' findings are substantially weak-ened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method ofreasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if weare to maintain the Constitution's enumeration of powers.Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects inter-state commerce"by deterring potential victims from traveling inter-state, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in placesinvolved in interstate commerce; . . . by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs,and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products." H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 385.Accord, S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 54. Given these findings andpetitioners' arguments, the concern that we expressed inLopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause tocompletely obliterate the Constitution's distinction betweennational and local authority seems well founded. SeeLopez,supra, at 564. The reasoning that petitioners advance seeksto follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrenceof violent crime (the suppression of which has always beenthe prime object of the States' police power) to every attenu-ated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crimeas long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crimehas substantial effects on employment, production, transit,or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gendermotivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder orany other type of violence since gender-motivated violence,as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.Petitioners' reasoning, moreover, will not limit Congressto regulating violence but may, as we suggested in Lopez,be applied equally as well to family law and other areasof traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN616 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the Courtmarriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economyis undoubtedly significant. Congress may have recognizedthis specter when it expressly precluded $ 13981 from beingused in the family law context.6 See 42 U. S. C. $ 13981(e)(4).Under our written Constitution, however, the limitationof congressional authority is not solely a matter of legislative grace.7 See Lopez, supra, at 575-579 (Kennedy, J.,concurring);Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 176-178.6 We are not the first to recognize that the but-for causal chain musthave its limits in the Commerce Clause area. In Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567,we quoted Justice Cardozo's concurring opinion in A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935):"There is a view of causation that would obliterate the distinction betweenwhat is national and what is local in the activities of commerce. Motion atthe outer rim is communicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recordinginstruments at the center. A society such as ours `is an elastic mediumwhich transmits all tremors throughout its territory; the only question isof their size.' " Id., at 554 (quoting United States v. A. L. A. SchechterPoultry Corp., 76 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA2 1935) (L. Hand, J., concurring)).7 Justice Souter's theory that Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824),Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528(1985), and the Seventeenth Amendment provide the answer to thesecases, see post, at 645-652, is remarkable because it undermines this central principle of our constitutional system. As we have repeatedly noted,the Framers crafted the federal system of Government so that the people'srights would be secured by the division of power. See, e. g., Arizona v.Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 30 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458-459 (1991) (cataloging the benefits of the federaldesign); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985)("The `constitutionally mandated balance of power' between the Statesand the Federal Government was adopted by the Framers to ensure theprotection of `our fundamental liberties' ") (quoting Garcia, supra, at 572(Powell, J., dissenting)). Departing from their parliamentary past, theFramers adopted a written Constitution that further divided authority atthe federal level so that the Constitution's provisions would not be definedsolely by the political branches nor the scope of legislative power limitedonly by public opinion and the Legislature's self-restraint. See, e. g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) ("The powersof the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may notbe mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written"). It is thus a " `per529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN617Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)Opinion of the CourtWe accordingly reject the argument that Congress mayregulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solelyon that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce.The Constitution requires a distinction between what ismanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system' " that " `thefederal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution.' " Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 922-923 (1995) (quoting Cooperv. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18 (1958)).No doubt the political branches have a role in interpreting and applying the Constitution, but ever since Marbury this Court has remainedthe ultimate expositor of the constitutional text. As we emphasized inUnited States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974): "In the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initiallyinterpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by anybranch is due great respect from the others. . . . Many decisions of thisCourt, however, have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marburythat `[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial departmentto say what the law is.' " Id., at 703 (citation omitted).Contrary to Justice Souter's suggestion, see post, at 647-652, andn. 14, Gibbons did not exempt the commerce power from this cardinal ruleof constitutional law. His assertion that, from Gibbons on, public opinionhas been the only restraint on the congressional exercise of the commercepower is true only insofar as it contends that political accountability is andhas been the only limit on Congress' exercise of the commerce powerwithin that power's outer bounds. As the language surrounding that relied upon by Justice Souter makes clear, Gibbons did not remove fromthis Court the authority to define that boundary. See Gibbons, supra, at194-195 ("It is not intended to say that these words comprehend thatcommerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on betweenman and man in a State, or between different parts of the same State,and which does not extend to or affect other States. . . . Comprehensiveas the word `among' is, it may very properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more States than one. The phrase is not one whichwould probably have been selected to indicate the completely interiortraffic of a State, because it is not an apt phrase for that purpose; and theenumeration of the particular classes of commerce to which the power wasto be extended, would not have been made, had the intention been toextend the power to every description. The enumeration presupposessomething not enumerated; and that something, if we regard the languageor the subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal commerceof a State").529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN618 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the Courttruly national and what is truly local. Lopez, 514 U. S., at568 (citing Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 30). In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles thathas been consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involvedin interstate commerce has always been the province of theStates. See, e. g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 426, 428(1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that Congress "has no generalright to punish murder committed within any of the States,"and that it is "clear . . . that congress cannot punish feloniesgenerally"). Indeed, we can think of no better example ofthe police power, which the Founders denied the NationalGovernment and reposed in the States, than the suppressionof violent crime and vindication of its victims.8 See, e. g.,Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566 ("The Constitution . . . withhold[s]from Congress a plenary police power"); id., at 584-585(Thomas, J., concurring) ("[W]e always have rejected read8 Justice Souter disputes our assertion that the Constitution reservesthe general police power to the States, noting that the Founders failedto adopt several proposals for additional guarantees against federal encroachment on state authority. See post, at 645-646, and n. 14. Thisargument is belied by the entire structure of the Constitution. With itscareful enumeration of federal powers and explicit statement that all powers not granted to the Federal Government are reserved, the Constitutioncannot realistically be interpreted as granting the Federal Government anunlimited license to regulate. See, e. g., New York v. United States, 505U. S. 144, 156-157 (1992). And, as discussed above, the Constitution's separation of federal power and the creation of the Judicial Branch indicatethat disputes regarding the extent of congressional power are largely subject to judicial review. See n. 7, supra. Moreover, the principle that" `[t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers,' "while reserving a generalized police power to the States, is deeply ingrained in our constitutional history. New York, supra, at 155 (quotingGregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 457); see also Lopez, 514 U.

IIIBecause we conclude that the Commerce Clause does notprovide Congress with authority to enact $ 13981, we addresspetitioners' alternative argument that the section's civil rem-edy should be upheld as an exercise of Congress' remedialpower under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As notedabove, Congress expressly invoked the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of authority to enact $ 13981.The principles governing an analysis of congressional legislation under $ 5 are well settled. Section 5 states thatCongress may " `enforce' by `appropriate legislation' the constitutional guarantee that no State shall deprive any personof `life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,'nor deny any person `equal protection of the laws.' " Cityof Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517 (1997). Section 5 is"a positive grant of legislative power," Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 651 (1966), that includes authority to"prohibi[t] conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and[to] intrud[e] into `legislative spheres of autonomy previ-ously reserved to the States.' "Flores, supra, at 518 (quot-ing Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976)); see alsoKimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000).However, "[a]s broad as the congressional enforcementpower is, it is not unlimited." Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S.112, 128 (1970); see also Kimel, supra, at 81. In fact, as wediscuss in detail below, several limitations inherent in $ 5'stext and constitutional context have been recognized sincethe Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.Petitioners' $ 5 argument is founded on an assertion thatthere is pervasive bias in various state justice systemsagainst victims of gender-motivated violence. This asser529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN620 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the Courttion is supported by a voluminous congressional record.Specifically, Congress received evidence that many participants in state justice systems are perpetuating an arrayof erroneous stereotypes and assumptions. Congress concluded that these discriminatory stereotypes often resultin insufficient investigation and prosecution of gendermotivated crime, inappropriate focus on the behavior andcredibility of the victims of that crime, and unacceptably le-nient punishments for those who are actually convicted ofgender-motivated violence. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 385-386; S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 38, 41-55; S. Rep.No. 102-197, at 33-35, 41, 43-47. Petitioners contend thatthis bias denies victims of gender-motivated violence theequal protection of the laws and that Congress thereforeacted appropriately in enacting a private civil remedyagainst the perpetrators of gender-motivated violence toboth remedy the States' bias and deter future instancesof discrimination in the state courts.As our cases have established, state-sponsored genderdiscrimination violates equal protection unless it " `serves"important governmental objectives and . . . the discriminatory means employed" are "substantially related to theachievement of those objectives." ' " United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533 (1996) (quoting Mississippi Univ.for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982), in turn quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150(1980)). See also Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198-199(1976). However, the language and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct.These limitations are necessary to prevent the FourteenthAmendment from obliterating the Framers' carefully craftedbalance of power between the States and the NationalGovernment. See Flores, supra, at 520-524 (reviewing thehistory of the Fourteenth Amendment's enactment and discussing the contemporary belief that the Amendment " `does529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN621Cite as: 529 U.

Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 294, n. 1 (2d ed. 1871)).Foremost among these limitations is the time-honored principle that the Fourteenth Amendment, by its very terms, pro-hibits only state action. "[T]he principle has become firmlyembedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibitedby the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is onlysuch action as may fairly be said to be that of the States.That Amendment erects no shield against merely privateconduct, however discriminatory or wrongful."Shelley v.Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 13, and n. 12 (1948).Shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, wedecided two cases interpreting the Amendment's provisions,United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the CivilRights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883). In Harris, the Court considered a challenge to $ 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871.That section sought to punish "private persons" for "conspiring to deprive any one of the equal protection of thelaws enacted by the State." 106 U. S., at 639. We concluded that this law exceeded Congress' $ 5 power becausethe law was "directed exclusively against the action of private persons, without reference to the laws of the State, ortheir administration by her officers." Id., at 640. In sodoing, we reemphasized our statement from Virginia v.Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 318 (1880), that " `these provisions ofthe fourteenth amendment have reference to State actionexclusively, and not to any action of private individuals.' "Harris, supra, at 639 (misquotation in Harris).We reached a similar conclusion in the Civil Rights Cases.In those consolidated cases, we held that the public accommodation provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, whichapplied to purely private conduct, were beyond the scopeof the $ 5 enforcement power. 109 U. S., at 11 ("Individualinvasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter ofthe [Fourteenth] [A]mendment").

S.542, 554 (1876) ("The fourteenth amendment prohibits a statefrom depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; but this adds nothing to the rightsof one citizen as against another. It simply furnishes an additional guaranty against any encroachment by the Statesupon the fundamental rights which belong to every citizenas a member of society").The force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind thesedecisions stems not only from the length of time they havebeen on the books, but also from the insight attributable tothe Members of the Court at that time. Every Member hadbeen appointed by President Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Garfield,or Arthur--and each of their judicial appointees obviouslyhad intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.Petitioners contend that two more recent decisions havein effect overruled this longstanding limitation on Congress'$ 5 authority. They rely on United States v. Guest, 383 U. S.745 (1966), for the proposition that the rule laid down in theCivil Rights Cases is no longer good law. In Guest, theCourt reversed the construction of an indictment under 18U. S. C. $ 241, saying in the course of its opinion that "wedeal here with issues of statutory construction, not withissues of constitutional power." 383 U. S., at 749. ThreeMembers of the Court, in a separate opinion by JusticeBrennan, expressed the view that the Civil Rights Cases529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN623Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)Opinion of the Courtwere wrongly decided, and that Congress could under $ 5prohibit actions by private individuals. 383 U. S., at 774(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Threeother Members of the Court, who joined the opinion of theCourt, joined a separate opinion by Justice Clark which intwo or three sentences stated the conclusion that Congresscould "punis[h] all conspiracies--with or without state action--that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights."Id., at 762 (concurring opinion). Justice Harlan, in anotherseparate opinion, commented with respect to the statementby these Justices:"The action of three of the Justices who joined theCourt's opinion in nonetheless cursorily pronouncingthemselves on the far-reaching constitutional questionsdeliberately not reached in Part II seems to me, to saythe very least, extraordinary." Id., at 762, n. 1 (opinionconcurring in part and dissenting in part).Though these three Justices saw fit to opine on mattersnot before the Court in Guest, the Court had no occasionto revisit the Civil Rights Cases and Harris, having determined "the indictment [charging private individuals withconspiring to deprive blacks of equal access to state facilities]in fact contain[ed] an express allegation of state involvement." 383 U. S., at 756. The Court concluded that theimplicit allegation of "active connivance by agents of theState" eliminated any need to decide "the threshold levelthat state action must attain in order to create rights underthe Equal Protection Clause." Ibid. All of this JusticeClark explicitly acknowledged. See id., at 762 (concurringopinion) ("The Court's interpretation of the indictmentclearly avoids the question whether Congress, by appropriate legislation, has the power to punish private conspiracies that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights,such as the right to utilize public facilities").529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN624 UNITED STATES v. MORRISONOpinion of the CourtTo accept petitioners' argument, moreover, one must addto the three Justices joining Justice Brennan's reasoned explanation for his belief that the Civil Rights Cases werewrongly decided, the three Justices joining Justice Clark'sopinion who gave no explanation whatever for their similarview. This is simply not the way that reasoned constitutional adjudication proceeds. We accordingly have no hesitation in saying that it would take more than the nakeddicta contained in Justice Clark's opinion, when added toJustice Brennan's opinion, to cast any doubt upon the endur-ing vitality of theCivil Rights Cases and Harris.Petitioners also rely on District of Columbia v. Carter,409 U. S. 418 (1973).Carter was a case addressing the question whether the District of Columbia was a "State" withinthe meaning of Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983--a sectionwhich by its terms requires state action before it may beemployed. A footnote in that opinion recites the samelitany respecting Guest that petitioners rely on. This litanyis of course entirely dicta, and in any event cannot rise aboveits source. We believe that the description of the $ 5 powercontained in the Civil Rights Cases is correct:"But where a subject is not submitted to the generallegislative power of Congress, but is only submittedthereto for the purpose of rendering effective some prohibition against particular [s]tate legislation or [s]tateaction in reference to that subject, the power given islimited by its object, and any legislation by Congress inthe matter must necessarily be corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation ofsuch prohibited state laws or proceedings of [s]tate officers." 109 U. S., at 18.Petitioners alternatively argue that, unlike the situationin the Civil Rights Cases, here there has been gender-baseddisparate treatment by state authorities, whereas in thosecases there was no indication of such state action. There is529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN625Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)Opinion of the Courtabundant evidence, however, to show that the Congressesthat enacted the Civil Rights Acts of 1871 and 1875 had apurpose similar to that of Congress in enacting $ 13981:There were state laws on the books bespeaking equality oftreatment, but in the administration of these laws there wasdiscrimination against newly freed slaves. The statementof Representative Garfield in the House and that of SenatorSumner in the Senate are representative:"[T]he chief complaint is not that the laws of the Stateare unequal, but that even where the laws are justand equal on their face, yet, by a systematic mal-administration of them, or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are deniedequal protection under them." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong.,1st Sess., App. 153 (1871) (statement of Rep. Garfield)."The Legislature of South Carolina has passed a lawgiving precisely the rights contained in your `supplementary civil rights bill.' But such a law remains adead letter on her statute-books, because the Statecourts, comprised largely of those whom the Senatorwishes to obtain amnesty for, refuse to enforce it."Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 430 (1872) (statementof Sen. Sumner).See also, e. g., Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at 653 (state-ment of Sen. Osborn);id., at 457 (statement of Rep.

Lynch).But even if that distinction were valid, we do not believeit would save $ 13981's civil remedy. For the remedy is simply not "corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited [s]tatelaws or proceedings of [s]tate officers." Civil Rights Cases,supra, at 18. Or, as we have phrased it in more recent cases,prophylactic legislation under $ 5 must have a " `congru529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN626 UNITED STATES v.

College SavingsBank, 527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999); Flores, 521 U. S., at 526.Section 13981 is not aimed at proscribing discrimination byofficials which the Fourteenth Amendment might not itselfproscribe; it is directed not at any State or state actor, butat individuals who have committed criminal acts motivatedby gender bias.In the present cases, for example, $ 13981 visits no con-sequence whatever on any Virginia public official involved ininvestigating or prosecuting Brzonkala's assault. The section is, therefore, unlike any of the $ 5 remedies that we havepreviously upheld. For example, in Katzenbach v. Morgan,384 U. S. 641 (1966), Congress prohibited New York fromimposing literacy tests as a prerequisite for voting becauseit found that such a requirement disenfranchised thousandsof Puerto Rican immigrants who had been educated in theSpanish language of their home territory. That law, whichwe upheld, was directed at New York officials who administered the State's election law and prohibited them from usinga provision of that law. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach,383 U. S. 301 (1966), Congress imposed voting rights requirements on States that, Congress found, had a historyof discriminating against blacks in voting. The remedy wasalso directed at state officials in those States. Similarly, inEx parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 (1880), Congress criminallypunished state officials who intentionally discriminated injury selection; again, the remedy was directed to the culpable state official.Section 13981 is also different from these previously upheld remedies in that it applies uniformly throughout theNation. Congress' findings indicate that the problem of discrimination against the victims of gender-motivated crimesdoes not exist in all States, or even most States. By contrast, the $ 5 remedy upheld in Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra,529US3 Unit: $U54 [10-04-01 09:35:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN627Cite as: 529 U. S. 598 (2000)concurringwas directed only to the State where the evil found by Con-gress existed, and in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra,the remedy was directed only to those States in which Con-gress found that there had been discrimination.For these reasons, we conclude that Congress' powerunder $ 5 does not extend to the enactment of $ 13981.IVPetitioner Brzonkala's complaint alleges that she was thevictim of a brutal assault. But Congress' effort in $ 13981to provide a federal civil remedy can be sustained neitherunder the Commerce Clause nor under $ 5 of the FourteenthAmendment. If the allegations here are true, no civilizedsystem of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for theconduct of respondent Morrison. But under our federalsystem that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealthof Virginia, and not by the United States. The judgment ofthe Court of Appeals is
