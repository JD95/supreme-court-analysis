Petitioner Ralph Howard Blakely, Jr., pleaded guilty to thekidnaping of his estranged wife. The facts admitted in hisplea, standing alone, supported a maximum sentence of 53months. Pursuant to state law, the court imposed an "exceptional" sentence of 90 months after making a judicial de-termination that he had acted with "deliberate cruelty."App. 40, 49. We consider whether this violated petitioner'sSixth Amendment right to trial by jury.IPetitioner married his wife Yolanda in 1973. He was evi-dently a difficult man to live with, having been diagnosed atvarious times with psychological and personality disordersincluding paranoid schizophrenia. His wife ultimately filedfor divorce. In 1998, he abducted her from their orchardhome in Grant County, Washington, binding her with ducttape and forcing her at knifepoint into a wooden box in thebed of his pickup truck. In the process, he implored her todismiss the divorce suit and related trust proceedings.When the couple's 13-year-old son Ralphy returned homefrom school, petitioner ordered him to follow in another car,threatening to harm Yolanda with a shotgun if he did not doso. Ralphy escaped and sought help when they stopped ata gas station, but petitioner continued on with Yolanda to afriend's house in Montana. He was finally arrested after thefriend called the police.The State charged petitioner with first-degree kidnaping,Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9A.40.020(1) (2000).1 Upon reach-ing a plea agreement, however, it reduced the charge tosecond-degree kidnaping involving domestic violence and use1 Parts of Washington's criminal code have been recodified and amended.We cite throughout the provisions in effect at the time of sentencing.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN299Cite as: 542 U.

Other provisions ofstate law, however, further limit the range of sentences ajudge may impose. Washington's Sentencing Reform Actspecifies, for petitioner's offense of second-degree kidnap-ing with a firearm, a "standard range" of 49 to 53 months.See $ 9.94A.320 (seriousness level V for second-degree kid-naping); App. 27 (offender score 2 based on $ 9.94A.360);$ 9.94A.310(1), box 2-V (standard range of 13-17 months);$ 9.94A.310(3)(b) (36-month firearm enhancement).3 A judgemay impose a sentence above the standard range if he finds"substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptionalsentence." $ 9.94A.120(2).

The 14-month sentence on that count ran concurrently and is not relevant here.3 The domestic-violence stipulation subjected petitioner to such measures as a "no-contact" order, see $ 10.99.040, but did not increase the standard range of his sentence.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN300 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courting court will reverse the sentence if it finds that "undera clearly erroneous standard there is insufficient evidencein the record to support the reasons for imposing an exceptional sentence." Id., at 315, 21 P. 3d, at 277 (citing$ 9.94A.210(4)).Pursuant to the plea agreement, the State recommendeda sentence within the standard range of 49 to 53 months.After hearing Yolanda's description of the kidnaping, however, the judge rejected the State's recommendation andimposed an exceptional sentence of 90 months--37 monthsbeyond the standard maximum. He justified the sentenceon the ground that petitioner had acted with "deliberatecruelty," a statutorily enumerated ground for departure indomestic-violence cases. $ 9.94A.390(2)(h)(iii).4Faced with an unexpected increase of more than threeyears in his sentence, petitioner objected. The judge accordingly conducted a 3-day bench hearing featuring testimony from petitioner, Yolanda, Ralphy, a police officer, andmedical experts. After the hearing, he issued 32 findings offact, concluding:"The defendant's motivation to commit kidnappingwas complex, contributed to by his mental condition andpersonality disorders, the pressures of the divorce litigation, the impending trust litigation trial and anger overhis troubled interpersonal relationships with his spouseand children. While he misguidedly intended to forcefully reunite his family, his attempt to do so was subservient to his desire to terminate lawsuits and modify titleownerships to his benefit.4 The judge found other aggravating factors, but the Court of Appealsquestioned their validity under state law and their independent sufficiencyto support the extent of the departure. See 111 Wash. App. 851, 868-870,and n. 3, 47 P. 3d 149, 158-159, and n. 3 (2002). It affirmed the sentencesolely on the finding of domestic violence with deliberate cruelty.

This rule reflects two longstanding tenetsof common-law criminal jurisprudence: that the "truth ofevery accusation" against a defendant "should afterwards beconfirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equalsand neighbours," 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on theLaws of England 343 (1769), and that "an accusation whichlacks any particular fact which the law makes essential tothe punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN302 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtof the common law, and it is no accusation in reason," 1 J.Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 87, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872).5 Theseprinciples have been acknowledged by courts and treatisessince the earliest days of graduated sentencing; we compiledthe relevant authorities in Apprendi, see 530 U. S., at 476-483, 489-490, n. 15; id., at 501-518 (Thomas, J., concurring),and need not repeat them here.65 Justice Breyer cites Justice O'Connor's Apprendi dissent for thepoint that this Bishop quotation means only that indictments must chargefacts that trigger statutory aggravation of a common-law offense. Post,at 340-341 (dissenting opinion). Of course, as he notes, Justice O'Connor was referring to an entirely different quotation, from Archbold's treatise. See 530 U. S., at 526 (citing J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence inCriminal Cases 51, 188 (15th ed. 1862)). Justice Breyer claims the twoare "similar," post, at 341, but they are as similar as chalk and cheese.Bishop was not "addressing" the "problem" of statutes that aggravatecommon-law offenses. Ibid. Rather, the entire chapter of his treatiseis devoted to the point that "every fact which is legally essential to thepunishment," 1 Criminal Procedure $ 81, at 51, must be charged in theindictment and proved to a jury, id., ch. 6, at 50-56. As one "example" ofthis principle (appearing several pages before the language we quote intext above), he notes a statute aggravating common-law assault. Id., $ 82,at 51-52. But nowhere is there the slightest indication that his generalprinciple was limited to that example. Even Justice Breyer's academicsupporters do not make that claim. See Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding andSentence Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L. J. 1097,1131-1132 (2001) (conceding that Bishop's treatise supports Apprendi,while criticizing its "natural-law theorizing").6 As to Justice O'Connor's criticism of the quantity of historical support for the Apprendi rule, post, at 323 (dissenting opinion): It bears repeating that the issue between us is not whether the Constitution limitsStates' authority to reclassify elements as sentencing factors (we all agreethat it does); it is only which line, ours or hers, the Constitution draws.Criticism of the quantity of evidence favoring our alternative would havesome force if it were accompanied by any evidence favoring hers. Justice O'Connor does not even provide a coherent alternative meaning forthe jury-trial guarantee, unless one considers "whatever the legislaturechooses to leave to the jury, so long as it does not go too far" coherent.See infra, at 305-308.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN303Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Opinion of the CourtApprendi involved a New Jersey hate-crime statute thatauthorized a 20-year sentence, despite the usual 10-yearmaximum, if the judge found the crime to have been committed " `with a purpose to intimidate . . . because of race,color, gender, handicap, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.' " Id., at 468-469 (quoting N. J. Stat. Ann. $ 2C:44-3(e)(West Supp. 1999-2000)). In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584,592-593, and n. 1 (2002), we applied Apprendi to an Arizonalaw that authorized the death penalty if the judge found 1 of10 aggravating factors. In each case, we concluded that thedefendant's constitutional rights had been violated becausethe judge had imposed a sentence greater than the maximumhe could have imposed under state law without the challenged factual finding. Apprendi, supra, at 491-497; Ring,supra, at 603-609.In this case, petitioner was sentenced to more than threeyears above the 53-month statutory maximum of the standard range because he had acted with "deliberate cruelty."The facts supporting that finding were neither admitted bypetitioner nor found by a jury. The State nevertheless contends that there was no Apprendi violation because the relevant "statutory maximum" is not 53 months, but the 10-yearmaximum for class B felonies in $ 9A.20.021(1)(b). It observes that no exceptional sentence may exceed that limit.See $ 9.94A.420. Our precedents make clear, however, thatthe "statutory maximum" for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of thefacts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. See Ring, supra, at 602 (" `the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the juryverdict alone' " (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 483)); Harris v.United States, 536 U. S. 545, 563 (2002) (plurality opinion)(same); cf. Apprendi, supra, at 488 (facts admitted by thedefendant). In other words, the relevant "statutory maximum" is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN304 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtafter finding additional facts, but the maximum he may im-pose without any additional findings. When a judge inflictspunishment that the jury's verdict alone does not allow, thejury has not found all the facts "which the law makes essential to the punishment," Bishop, supra, $ 87, at 55, and thejudge exceeds his proper authority.The judge in this case could not have imposed the excep-tional 90-month sentence solely on the basis of the factsadmitted in the guilty plea. Those facts alone were in-sufficient because, as the Washington Supreme Court hasexplained, "[a] reason offered to justify an exceptional sen-tence can be considered only if it takes into account factorsother than those which are used in computing the standardrange sentence for the offense,"Gore, 143 Wash. 2d, at 315-316, 21 P. 3d, at 277, which in this case included the elementsof second-degree kidnaping and the use of a firearm, see$$ 9.94A.320, 9.94A.310(3)(b).7 Had the judge imposed the90-month sentence solely on the basis of the plea, he wouldhave been reversed. See $ 9.94A.210(4). The "maximumsentence" is no more 10 years here than it was 20 years inApprendi (because that is what the judge could have im-posed upon finding a hate crime) or death in Ring (becausethat is what the judge could have imposed upon finding anaggravator).The State defends the sentence by drawing an analogyto those we upheld in McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S.79 (1986), and Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949).Neither case is on point. McMillan involved a sentencingscheme that imposed a statutory minimum if a judge founda particular fact. 477 U. S., at 81. We specifically notedthat the statute "does not authorize a sentence in excessof that otherwise allowed for [the underlying] offense."Id.,7 The State does not contend that the domestic-violence stipulation alonesupports the departure. That the statute lists domestic violence asgrounds for departure only when combined with some other aggravatingfactor suggests it could not. See $$ 9.94A.390(2)(h)(i)-(iii).542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN305Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Opinion of the Courtat 82; cf. Harris, supra, at 567. Williams involved anindeterminate-sentencing regime that allowed a judge (butdid not compel him) to rely on facts outside the trial recordin determining whether to sentence a defendant to death.337 U. S., at 242-243, and n. 2. The judge could have "sen-tenced [the defendant] to death giving no reason at all." Id.,at 252. Thus, neither case involved a sentence greater thanwhat state law authorized on the basis of the verdict alone.Finally, the State tries to distinguish Apprendi and Ringby pointing out that the enumerated grounds for departurein its regime are illustrative rather than exhaustive. Thisdistinction is immaterial. Whether the judge's authority toimpose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specifiedfact (as inApprendi), one of several specified facts (as inRing), or any aggravating fact (as here), it remains the casethat the jury's verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.The judge acquires that authority only upon finding someadditional fact.8Because the State's sentencing procedure did not complywith the Sixth Amendment, petitioner's sentence is invalid.9IIIOur commitment to Apprendi in this context reflects notjust respect for longstanding precedent, but the need to giveintelligible content to the right of jury trial. That right is8 Nor does it matter that the judge must, after finding aggravating facts,make a judgment that they present a compelling ground for departure.He cannot make that judgment without finding some facts to support itbeyond the bare elements of the offense. Whether the judicially determined facts require a sentence enhancement or merely allow it, the verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.9 The United States, as amicus curiae, urges us to affirm. It notesdifferences between Washington's sentencing regime and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines but questions whether those differences are constitutionally significant. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-30.The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion onthem.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN306 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtno mere procedural formality, but a fundamental reservationof power in our constitutional structure. Just as suffrageensures the people's ultimate control in the legislative andexecutive branches, jury trial is meant to ensure their control in the judiciary. See Letter XV by the Federal Farmer(Jan. 18, 1788), reprinted in 2 The Complete Anti-Federalist315, 320 (H. Storing ed. 1981) (describing the jury as "secur[ing] to the people at large, their just and rightful controulin the judicial department"); John Adams, Diary Entry (Feb.12, 1771), reprinted in 2 Works of John Adams 252, 253 (C.Adams ed. 1850) ("[T]he common people, should have as complete a control . . . in every judgment of a court of judicature"as in the legislature); Letter from Thomas Jefferson to theAbbe' Arnoux (July 19, 1789), reprinted in 15 Papers ofThomas Jefferson 282, 283 (J. Boyd ed. 1958) ("Were I calledupon to decide whether the people had best be omitted inthe Legislative or Judiciary department, I would say it isbetter to leave them out of the Legislative"); Jones v. UnitedStates, 526 U. S. 227, 244-248 (1999). Apprendi carries outthis design by ensuring that the judge's authority to sentence derives wholly from the jury's verdict. Without thatrestriction, the jury would not exercise the control that theFramers intended.Those who would reject Apprendi are resigned to one oftwo alternatives. The first is that the jury need only findwhatever facts the legislature chooses to label elements ofthe crime, and that those it labels sentencing factors--nomatter how much they may increase the punishment--maybe found by the judge. This would mean, for example, thata judge could sentence a man for committing murder even ifthe jury convicted him only of illegally possessing the firearm used to commit it--or of making an illegal lane changewhile fleeing the death scene. Not even Apprendi's criticswould advocate this absurd result. Cf. 530 U. S., at 552-553(O'Connor, J., dissenting). The jury could not function ascircuitbreaker in the State's machinery of justice if it were542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN307Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Opinion of the Courtrelegated to making a determination that the defendant atsome point did something wrong, a mere preliminary to ajudicial inquisition into the facts of the crime the State actu-ally seeks to punish.10The second alternative is that legislatures may establishlegally essential sentencing factors within limits--limitscrossed when, perhaps, the sentencing factor is a "tail whichwags the dog of the substantive offense."McMillan, 477U. S., at 88. What this means in operation is that the lawmust not go too far--it must not exceed the judicial estima-tion of the proper role of the judge.The subjectivity of this standard is obvious. Petitionerargued below that second-degree kidnaping with deliberatecruelty was essentially the same as first-degree kidnaping,the very charge he had avoided by pleading to a lesser offense. The court conceded this might be so but held it irrel-evant. See 111 Wash. App., at 869, 47 P. 3d, at 158.11 Petitioner's 90-month sentence exceeded the 53-month standardmaximum by almost 70%; the Washington Supreme Court inother cases has upheld exceptional sentences 15 times thestandard maximum. SeeState v. Oxborrow, 106 Wash. 2d525, 528, 533, 723 P. 2d 1123, 1125, 1128 (1986) (en banc) (15-year exceptional sentence; 1-year standard maximum sen10 Justice O'Connor believes that a "built-in political check" will prevent lawmakers from manipulating offense elements in this fashion. Post,at 322. But the many immediate practical advantages of judicial factfinding, see post, at 318-320, suggest that political forces would, if anything,pull in the opposite direction. In any case, the Framers' decision to entrench the jury-trial right in the Constitution shows that they did nottrust government to make political decisions in this area.11 Another example of conversion from separate crime to sentence enhancement that Justice O'Connor evidently does not consider going "toofar" is the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, see post, at 319. Why perjury during trial should be grounds for a judicial sentence enhancementon the underlying offense, rather than an entirely separate offense to befound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt (as it has been for centuries, see4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 136-138 (1769)), isunclear.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN308 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courttence); State v. Branch, 129 Wash. 2d 635, 650, 919 P. 2d 1228,1235 (1996) (en banc) (4-year exceptional sentence; 3-monthstandard maximum sentence). Did the court go too far inany of these cases? There is no answer that legal analysiscan provide. With too far as the yardstick, it is always pos-sible to disagree with such judgments and never to refutethem.Whether the Sixth Amendment incorporates this manipulable standard rather than Apprendi's bright-line rule de-pends on the plausibility of the claim that the Framers wouldhave left definition of the scope of jury power up to judges'intuitive sense of how far istoo far. We think that claimnot plausible at all, because the very reason the Framers puta jury-trial guarantee in the Constitution is that they wereunwilling to trust government to mark out the role of thejury. IVBy reversing the judgment below, we are not, as the Statewould have it, "find[ing] determinate sentencing schemes unconstitutional." Brief for Respondent 34. This case is notabout whether determinate sentencing is constitutional, onlyabout how it can be implemented in a way that respectsthe Sixth Amendment. Several policies prompted Washington's adoption of determinate sentencing, including propor-tionality to the gravity of the offense and parity amongdefendants. See Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9.94A.010 (2000).Nothing we have said impugns those salutary objectives.Justice O'Connor argues that, because determinate-sentencing schemes involving judicial factfinding entail lessjudicial discretion than indeterminate schemes, the constitu-tionality of the latter implies the constitutionality of theformer. Post, at 314-323. This argument is flawed on anumber of levels. First, the Sixth Amendment by its termsis not a limitation on judicial power, but a reservation of jurypower. It limits judicial power only to the extent that theclaimed judicial power infringes on the province of the jury.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN309Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Opinion of the CourtIndeterminate sentencing does not do so. It increases judi-cial discretion, to be sure, but not at the expense of the jury'straditional function of finding the facts essential to lawfulimposition of the penalty. Of course indeterminate schemesinvolve judicial factfinding, in that a judge (like a paroleboard) may implicitly rule on those facts he deems importantto the exercise of his sentencing discretion. But the factsdo not pertain to whether the defendant has a legal right toa lesser sentence--and that makes all the difference insofaras judicial impingement upon the traditional role of the juryis concerned. In a system that says the judge may punishburglary with 10 to 40 years, every burglar knows he is risking 40 years in jail. In a system that punishes burglary witha 10-year sentence, with another 30 added for use of a gun,the burglar who enters a home unarmed is entitled to nomore than a 10-year sentence--and by reason of the SixthAmendment the facts bearing upon that entitlement must befound by a jury.But even assuming that restraint of judicial power unrelated to the jury's role is a Sixth Amendment objective, it isfar from clear that Apprendi disserves that goal. Determinate judicial-factfinding schemes entail less judicial powerthan indeterminate schemes, but more judicial power thandeterminate jury-factfinding schemes. Whether Apprendiincreases judicial power overall depends on what States withdeterminate judicial-factfinding schemes would do, given thechoice between the two alternatives. Justice O'Connorsimply assumes that the net effect will favor judges, but shehas no empirical basis for that prediction. Indeed, what evidence we have points exactly the other way: When the Kansas Supreme Court found Apprendi infirmities in that State'sdeterminate-sentencing regime in State v. Gould, 271 Kan.394, 404-414, 23 P. 3d 801, 809-814 (2001), the legislatureresponded not by reestablishing indeterminate sentencingbut by applying Apprendi's requirements to its current regime. See Act of May 29, 2002, ch. 170, 2002 Kan. Sess.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN310 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the CourtLaws pp. 1018-1023 (codified at Kan. Stat. Ann. $ 21-4718(2003 Cum. Supp.)); Brief for Kansas Appellate Defender Office as Amicus Curiae 3-7. The result was less, not more,judicial power.Justice Breyer argues that Apprendi works to the detriment of criminal defendants who plead guilty by deprivingthem of the opportunity to argue sentencing factors to ajudge. Post, at 331. But nothing prevents a defendantfrom waiving his Apprendi rights. When a defendantpleads guilty, the State is free to seek judicial sentence enhancements so long as the defendant either stipulates to therelevant facts or consents to judicial factfinding. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 488; Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145,158 (1968). If appropriate waivers are procured, States maycontinue to offer judicial factfinding as a matter of course toall defendants who plead guilty. Even a defendant whostands trial may consent to judicial factfinding as to sentenceenhancements, which may well be in his interest if relevantevidence would prejudice him at trial. We do not understand how Apprendi can possibly work to the detriment ofthose who are free, if they think its costs outweigh its benefits, to render it inapplicable.1212 Justice Breyer responds that States are not required to give defendants the option of waiving jury trial on some elements but not others.Post, at 335-336. True enough. But why would the States that he asserts we are coercing into hardheartedness--that is, States that wantjudge-pronounced determinate sentencing to be the norm but we won't letthem--want to prevent a defendant from choosing that regime? JusticeBreyer claims this alternative may prove "too expensive and unwieldyfor States to provide," post, at 336, but there is no obvious reason whyforcing defendants to choose between contesting all elements of his hypothetical 17-element robbery crime and contesting none of them is lessexpensive than also giving them the third option of pleading guilty tosome elements and submitting the rest to judicial factfinding. JusticeBreyer's argument rests entirely on a speculative prediction about thenumber of defendants likely to choose the first (rather than the second)option if denied the third.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN311Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Opinion of the CourtNor do we see any merit to Justice Breyer's contentionthat Apprendi is unfair to criminal defendants because, ifStates respond by enacting "17-element robbery crime[s],"prosecutors will have more elements with which to bargain.Post, at 331, 335-336 (citing Bibas, Judicial Fact-Finding andSentence Enhancements in a World of Guilty Pleas, 110 YaleL. J. 1097 (2001)). Bargaining already exists with regard tosentencing factors because defendants can either stipulate orcontest the facts that make them applicable. If there is anydifference between bargaining over sentencing factors andbargaining over elements, the latter probably favors the de-fendant. Every new element that a prosecutor can threatento charge is also an element that a defendant can threatento contest at trial and make the prosecutor prove beyonda reasonable doubt. Moreover, given the sprawling scopeof most criminal codes, and the power to affect sentencesby making (even nonbinding) sentencing recommendations,there is already no shortage ofin terrorem tools at prosecu-tors' disposal.

Rev. 295, 296 (2001) ("Every prosecutorial bargaining chip mentioned by Professor Bibas existedpre-Apprendi exactly as it does post-Apprendi").Any evaluation of Apprendi's "fairness" to criminal de-fendants must compare it with the regime it replaced, inwhich a defendant, with no warning in either his indictmentor plea, would routinely see his maximum potential sentenceballoon from as little as five years to as much as life impris-onment, see 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(b)(1)(A), (D),13 based not on13 To be sure, Justice Breyer and the other dissenters would forbidthose increases of sentence that violate the constitutional principle thattail shall not wag dog. The source of this principle is entirely unclear.Its precise effect, if precise effect it has, is presumably to require that theratio of sentencing-factor add-on to basic criminal sentence be no greaterthan the ratio of caudal vertebrae to body in the breed of canine with thelongest tail. Or perhaps no greater than the average such ratio for allbreeds. Or perhaps the median. Regrettably, Apprendi has preventedfull development of this line of jurisprudence.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN312 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONOpinion of the Courtfacts proved to his peers beyond a reasonable doubt, but onfacts extracted after trial from a report compiled by a probation officer who the judge thinks more likely got it right thangot it wrong. We can conceive of no measure of fairnessthat would find more fault in the utterly speculative bargain-ing effectsJustice Breyer identifies than in the regime hechampions. Suffice it to say that, if such a measure exists,it is not the one the Framers left us with.The implausibility ofJustice Breyer's contention thatApprendi is unfair to criminal defendants is exposed by thelineup ofamici in this case. It is hard to believe that theNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers wassomehow duped into arguing for the wrong side. JusticeBreyer's only authority asking that defendants be protected from Apprendi is an article written not by a criminaldefense lawyer but by a law professor and former prosecutor.See post, at 331 (citing Bibas, supra); Association of American Law Schools Directory of Law Teachers 2003-2004,p. 319.Justice Breyer also claims that Apprendi will attenuatethe connection between "real criminal conduct and real punishment" by encouraging plea bargaining and by restrictingalternatives to adversarial factfinding. Post, at 334, 338-339. The short answer to the former point (even assumingthe questionable premise that Apprendi does encourage pleabargaining, but see supra, at 310, n. 12) is that the SixthAmendment was not written for the benefit of those whochoose to forgo its protection. It guarantees the right tojury trial. It does not guarantee that a particular numberof jury trials will actually take place. That more defendantselect to waive that right (because, for example, governmentat the moment is not particularly oppressive) does not provethat a constitutional provision guaranteeing availability ofthat option is disserved.Justice Breyer's more general argument--that Apprendi undermines alternatives to adversarial factfinding--542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN313Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Opinion of the Courtis not so much a criticism of Apprendi as an assault on jurytrial generally. His esteem for "nonadversarial" truthseeking processes, post, at 339, supports just as well an argument against either. Our Constitution and the common-lawtraditions it entrenches, however, do not admit the contention that facts are better discovered by judicial inquisitionthan by adversarial testing before a jury. See 3 Blackstone,Commentaries, at 373-374, 379-381. Justice Breyer maybe convinced of the equity of the regime he favors, but hisviews are not the ones we are bound to uphold.Ultimately, our decision cannot turn on whether or to whatdegree trial by jury impairs the efficiency or fairness of criminal justice. One can certainly argue that both these valueswould be better served by leaving justice entirely in thehands of professionals; many nations of the world, particularly those following civil-law traditions, take just thatcourse. There is not one shred of doubt, however, about theFramers' paradigm for criminal justice: not the civil-lawideal of administrative perfection, but the common-law idealof limited state power accomplished by strict division of authority between judge and jury. As Apprendi held, everydefendant has the right to insist that the prosecutor proveto a jury all facts legally essential to the punishment.Under the dissenters' alternative, he has no such right.That should be the end of the matter.* * *Petitioner was sentenced to prison for more than threeyears beyond what the law allowed for the crime to whichhe confessed, on the basis of a disputed finding that he hadacted with "deliberate cruelty."

It is so ordered.Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins,and with whomThe Chief Justice and Justice Kennedyjoin as to all but Part IV-B, dissenting.The legacy of today's opinion, whether intended or not,will be the consolidation of sentencing power in the Stateand Federal Judiciaries. The Court says to Congress andstate legislatures: If you want to constrain the sentencingdiscretion of judges and bring some uniformity to sentencing,it will cost you--dearly. Congress and States, faced withthe burdens imposed by the extension of Apprendi v. NewJersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to the present context, willeither trim or eliminate altogether their sentencing guidelines schemes and, with them, 20 years of sentencing reform.It is thus of little moment that the majority does not expressly declare guidelines schemes unconstitutional, ante, at308; for, as residents of "Apprendi-land" are fond of saying,"the relevant inquiry is one not of form, but of effect." Apprendi, supra, at 494; Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584, 613(2002) (Scalia, J., concurring). The "effect" of today's deci-sion will be greater judicial discretion and less uniformity insentencing. Because I find it implausible that the Framerswould have considered such a result to be required by theDue Process Clause or the Sixth Amendment, and becausethe practical consequences of today's decision may be disastrous, I respectfully dissent.IOne need look no further than the history leading up toand following the enactment of Washington's guidelines542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN315Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)O'Connor, J., dissentingscheme to appreciate the damage that today's decision willcause. Prior to 1981, Washington, like most other Statesand the Federal Government, employed an indeterminatesentencing scheme. Washington's criminal code separatedall felonies into three broad categories: "class A," carryinga sentence of 20 years to life; "class B," carrying a sentenceof 0 to 10 years; and "class C," carrying a sentence of 0 to5 years. Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9A.20.020 (2000); seealso Sentencing Reform Act of 1981, 1981 Wash. Lawsch. 137, p. 534. Sentencing judges, in conjunction with pa-role boards, had virtually unfettered discretion to sentencedefendants to prison terms falling anywhere within the statutory range, including probation--i. e., no jail sentence at all.Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $$ 9.95.010-9.95.011; Boerner & Lieb,Sentencing Reform in the Other Washington, 28 Crime andJustice 71, 73 (M. Tonry ed. 2001) (hereinafter Boerner &Lieb) ("Judges were authorized to choose between prison andprobation with few exceptions, subject only to review forabuse of discretion"). See also D. Boerner, Sentencing inWashington $ 2.4, pp. 2-27 to 2-28 (1985).This system of unguided discretion inevitably resulted insevere disparities in sentences received and served by defendants committing the same offense and having similarcriminal histories. Boerner & Lieb 126-127; cf. S. Rep.No. 98-225, p. 38 (1983) (Senate Report on precursor to federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984) ("[E]very day Federaljudges mete out an unjustifiably wide range of sentences tooffenders with similar histories, convicted of similar crimes,committed under similar circumstances. . . . These disparities, whether they occur at the time of the initial sentencingor at the parole stage, can be traced directly to the unfettered discretion the law confers on those judges and paroleauthorities responsible for imposing and implementing thesentence"). Indeed, rather than reflect legally relevant criteria, these disparities too often were correlated with constitutionally suspect variables such as race. Boerner & Lieb542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN316 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONO'Connor, J., dissenting126-128. See also Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guide-lines and the Key Compromises Upon Which They Rest, 17Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 5 (1988) (elimination of racial disparity onereason behind Congress' creation of the Federal SentencingCommission).To counteract these trends, the state legislature passedthe Sentencing Reform Act of 1981. The Act had thelaudable purposes of "mak[ing] the criminal justice systemaccountable to the public," and "[e]nsur[ing] that the punish-ment for a criminal offense is proportionate to the seriousness of the offense . . . [and] commensurate with the pun-ishment imposed on others committing similar offenses."Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9.94A.010 (2000). The Act neitherincreased any of the statutory sentencing ranges for thethree types of felonies (though it did eliminate the statutorymandatory minimum for class A felonies), nor reclassifiedany substantive offenses. 1981 Wash. Laws ch. 137, p. 534.It merely placed meaningful constraints on discretion to sentence offenders within the statutory ranges, and eliminatedparole. There is thus no evidence that the legislature wasattempting to manipulate the statutory elements of criminaloffenses or to circumvent the procedural protections of theBill of Rights. Rather, lawmakers were trying to bringsome much-needed uniformity, transparency, and accountability to an otherwise " `labyrinthine' sentencing and correc-tions system that `lack[ed] any principle except unguided discretion.' " Boerner & Lieb 73 (quoting F. Zimring, Makingthe Punishment Fit the Crime: A Consumers' Guide to Sentencing Reform, Occasional Paper No. 12, p. 6 (1977)).IIFar from disregarding principles of due process and thejury trial right, as the majority today suggests, Washington'sreform has served them. Before passage of the Act, a de-fendant charged with second degree kidnaping, like petitioner, had no idea whether he would receive a 10-year sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN317Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)O'Connor, J., dissentingtence or probation. The ultimate sentencing determinationcould turn as much on the idiosyncracies of a particular judgeas on the specifics of the defendant's crime or background.A defendant did not know what facts, if any, about his offenseor his history would be considered relevant by the sentenc-ing judge or by the parole board. After passage of the Act,a defendant charged with second degree kidnaping knowswhat his presumptive sentence will be; he has a good idea ofthe types of factors that a sentencing judge can and will consider when deciding whether to sentence him outside thatrange; he is guaranteed meaningful appellate review to protect against an arbitrary sentence. Boerner & Lieb 93 ("Byconsulting one sheet, practitioners could identify the applicable scoring rules for criminal history, the sentencing range,and the available sentencing options for each case"). Criminal defendants still face the same statutory maximum sentences, but they now at least know, much more than before,the real consequences of their actions.Washington's move to a system of guided discretion hasserved equal protection principles as well. Over the past 20years, there has been a substantial reduction in racial disparity in sentencing across the State. Id., at 126 (Racial disparities that do exist "are accounted for by differences in legallyrelevant variables--the offense of conviction and priorcriminal record"); id., at 127 ("[J]udicial authority to imposeexceptional sentences under the court's departure authorityshows little evidence of disparity correlated with race").The reduction is directly traceable to the constraining effects of the guidelines--namely, their "presumptive range[s]"and limits on the imposition of "exceptional sentences" outside of those ranges. Id., at 128. For instance, sentencingjudges still retain unreviewable discretion in first-timeoffender cases and in certain sex offender cases to imposealternative sentences that are far more lenient than thosecontemplated by the guidelines. To the extent that unjustifiable racial disparities have persisted in Washington, it542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN318 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONO'Connor, J., dissentinghas been in the imposition of such alternative sentences:"The lesson is powerful: racial disparity is correlated withunstructured and unreviewed discretion." Ibid.; see alsoWashington State Minority and Justice Commission,R. Crutchfield, J. Weis, R. Engen, & R. Gainey, Racial/EthnicDisparities and Exceptional Sentences in Washington State,Final Report 51-53 (Sept. 1993) ("[E]xceptional sentencesare not a major source of racial disparities in sentencing").The majority does not, because it cannot, disagree that determinate sentencing schemes, like Washington's, serve im-portant constitutional values.Ante, at 308. Thus, the majority says: "This case is not about whether determinatesentencing is constitutional, only about how it can be implemented in a way that respects the Sixth Amendment."Ibid. But extension of Apprendi to the present context willimpose significant costs on a legislature's determination thata particular fact, not historically an element, warrants ahigher sentence. While not a constitutional prohibition onguidelines schemes, the majority's decision today exacts asubstantial constitutional tax.The costs are substantial and real. Under the majority'sapproach, any fact that increases the upper bound on ajudge's sentencing discretion is an element of the offense.Thus, facts that historically have been taken into account bysentencing judges to assess a sentence within a broadrange--such as drug quantity, role in the offense, risk ofbodily harm--all must now be charged in an indictment andsubmitted to a jury, In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), simply because it is the legislature, rather than the judge, thatconstrains the extent to which such facts may be used toimpose a sentence within a pre-existing statutory range.While that alone is enough to threaten the continued useof sentencing guidelines schemes, there are additional costs.For example, a legislature might rightly think that some factors bearing on sentencing, such as prior bad acts or criminalhistory, should not be considered in a jury's determination of542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN319Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)O'Connor, J., dissentinga defendant's guilt--such "character evidence" has tradition-ally been off limits during the guilt phase of criminal proceedings because of its tendency to inflame the passions ofthe jury. See,e. g., Fed. Rule Evid. 404; 1 E. Imwinkelried,P. Giannelli, F. Gilligan, & F. Lederer, Courtroom CriminalEvidence 285 (3d ed. 1998). If a legislature desires uniformconsideration of such factors at sentencing, but does not wantthem to impact a jury's initial determination of guilt, theState may have to bear the additional expense of a separate,full-blown jury trial during the penalty phase proceeding.Some facts that bear on sentencing either will not be discovered, or are not discoverable, prior to trial. For instance, a legislature might desire that defendants who act inan obstructive manner during trial or post-trial proceedingsreceive a greater sentence than defendants who do not.See, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission, GuidelinesManual $ 3C1.1 (Nov. 2003) (hereinafter USSG) (2-point increase in offense level for obstruction of justice). In suchcases, the violation arises too late for the State to providenotice to the defendant or to argue the facts to the jury. AState wanting to make such facts relevant at sentencingmust now either vest sufficient discretion in the judge toaccount for them or bring a separate criminal prosecutionfor obstruction of justice or perjury. And, the latter optionis available only to the extent that a defendant's obstructivebehavior is so severe as to constitute an already-existing separate offense, unless the legislature is willing to undertakethe unlikely expense of criminalizing relatively minor obstructive behavior.Likewise, not all facts that historically have been relevantto sentencing always will be known prior to trial. For instance, trial or sentencing proceedings of a drug distributiondefendant might reveal that he sold primarily to children.Under the majority's approach, a State wishing such a revelation to result in a higher sentence within a pre-existingstatutory range either must vest judges with sufficient dis542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN320 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONO'Connor, J., dissentingcretion to account for it (and trust that they exercise thatdiscretion) or bring a separate criminal prosecution. Indeed, the latter choice might not be available--a separateprosecution, if it is for an aggravated offense, likely wouldbe barred altogether by the Double Jeopardy Clause.Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932) (government cannot prosecute for separate offenses unless each of-fense has at least one element that the other does not).The majority may be correct that States and the FederalGovernment will be willing to bear some of these costs.Ante, at 309-310. But simple economics dictate that theywill not, and cannot, bear them all. To the extent that theydo not, there will be an inevitable increase in judicial discre-tion with all of its attendant failings.1IIIWashington's Sentencing Reform Act did not alter thestatutory maximum sentence to which petitioner was exposed. See Wash. Rev. Code Ann. $ 9A.40.030 (2003) (second1 The paucity of empirical evidence regarding the impact of extendingApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), to guidelines schemes shouldcome as no surprise to the majority. Ante, at 309. Prior to today, onlyone court had ever applied Apprendi to invalidate application of a guidelines scheme. Compare State v. Gould, 271 Kan. 394, 23 P. 3d 801 (2001),with, e. g., United States v. Goodine, 326 F. 3d 26 (CA1 2003); United Statesv. Luciano, 311 F. 3d 146 (CA2 2002); United States v.

Thus, there is no map of theuncharted territory blazed by today's unprecedented holding.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN321Cite as: 542 U.

App. 226, 228-229, 597 P. 2d 1367, 1369(1979) (citing second degree kidnaping provision as existedin 1977). Petitioner was informed in the charging document, his plea agreement, and during his plea hearing thathe faced a potential statutory maximum of 10 years in prison.App. 63, 66, 76. As discussed above, the guidelines serveddue process by providing notice to petitioner of the conse-quences of his acts; they vindicated his jury trial right byinforming him of the stakes of risking trial; they servedequal protection by ensuring petitioner that invidious characteristics such as race would not impact his sentence.Given these observations, it is difficult for me to discernwhat principle besides doctrinaire formalism actually motivates today's decision. The majority chides the Apprendidissenters for preferring a nuanced interpretation of the DueProcess Clause and Sixth Amendment jury trial guaranteethat would generally defer to legislative labels while acknowledging the existence of constitutional constraints--what the majority calls "the law must not go too far" approach. Ante, at 307 (emphasis deleted). If indeed thechoice is between adopting a balanced case-by-case approachthat takes into consideration the values underlying the Billof Rights, as well as the history of a particular sentencingreform law, and adopting a rigid rule that destroys everything in its path, I will choose the former. See Apprendi,530 U. S., at 552-554 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("Because Ido not believe that the Court's `increase in the maximumpenalty' rule is required by the Constitution, I would evaluate New Jersey's sentence-enhancement statute by analyzing the factors we have examined in past cases" (citationomitted)).But even were one to accept formalism as a principleworth vindicating for its own sake, it would not explain Apprendi's, or today's, result. A rule of deferring to legislative labels has no less formal pedigree. It would be more542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN322 BLAKELY v.

Apprendi, supra, at 523-554 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). It also would be easier to administer than themajority's rule, inasmuch as courts would not be forced tolook behind statutes and regulations to determine whethera particular fact does or does not increase the penalty towhich a defendant was exposed.The majority is correct that rigid adherence to such anapproach could conceivably produce absurd results, ante, at306; but, as today's decision demonstrates, rigid adherenceto the majority's approach does and will continue to produceresults that disserve the very principles the majority purports to vindicate. The pre-Apprendi rule of deference tothe legislature retains a built-in political check to preventlawmakers from shifting the prosecution for crimes to thepenalty phase proceedings of lesser included and easier-toprove offenses--e. g., the majority's hypothesized prosecution of murder in the guise of a traffic offense sentencingproceeding. Ante, at 306. There is no similar check, however, on application of the majority's "any fact that increases the upper bound of judicial discretion" by courts.542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN323Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)O'Connor, J., dissentingThe majority claims the mantle of history and original intent. But as I have explained elsewhere, a handful of statedecisions in the mid-19th century and a criminal proceduretreatise have little if any persuasive value as evidence ofwhat the Framers of the Federal Constitution intended inthe late 18th century. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 525-528(O'Connor, J., dissenting). Because broad judicial sentencing discretion was foreign to the Framers, id., at 478-479(citing J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases44 (15th ed. 1862)), they were never faced with the constitutional choice between submitting every fact that increases asentence to the jury or vesting the sentencing judge withbroad discretionary authority to account for differences inoffenses and offenders.IVAThe consequences of today's decision will be as far reaching as they are disturbing. Washington's sentencing systemis by no means unique. Numerous other States haveenacted guidelines systems, as has the Federal Government.See, e. g., Alaska Stat. $ 12.55.155 (2002); Ark. Code Ann.$ 16-90-804 (2003 Supp.); Fla. Stat. $ 921.0016 (2003); Kan.Stat. Ann. $ 21-4701 et seq. (2003); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann.$ 769.34 (West Supp. 2004); Minn. Stat. $ 244.10 (2002); N. C.Gen.

C. $ 3553; 28 U. S. C. $ 991 et seq. Today's decision casts constitutional doubt over them all and, inso doing, threatens an untold number of criminal judgments.Every sentence imposed under such guidelines in cases currently pending on direct appeal is in jeopardy. And, despitethe fact that we hold in Schriro v. Summerlin, post, p. 348,that Ring (and a fortiori Apprendi) does not apply retroactively on habeas review, all criminal sentences imposed542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN324 BLAKELY v.

S. 288, 301 (1989) (plurality opin-ion) ("[A] case announces a new rule if the result was notdictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant'sconviction became final").2The practical consequences for trial courts, starting today,will be equally unsettling: How are courts to mete out guidelines sentences? Do courts apply the guidelines as to miti-gating factors, but not as to aggravating factors? Do theyjettison the guidelines altogether? The Court ignores thehavoc it is about to wreak on trial courts across the country.BIt is no answer to say that today's opinion impacts onlyWashington's scheme and not others, such as, for example,the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. See ante, at 305, n. 9("The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we expressno opinion on them"); cf. Apprendi, supra, at 496-497 (claim-ing not to overrule Walton, supra, soon thereafter overruledin Ring); Apprendi, supra, at 497, n. 21 (reserving questionof Federal Sentencing Guidelines). The fact that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines are promulgated by an adminis-trative agency nominally located in the Judicial Branch isirrelevant to the majority's reasoning. The Guidelines havethe force of law, see Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S.36 (1993); and Congress has unfettered control to reject or2 The numbers available from the federal system alone are staggering.On March 31, 2004, there were 8,320 federal criminal appeals pending inwhich the defendant's sentence was at issue.

The provision struckdown here provides for an increase in the upper bound of thepresumptive sentencing range if the sentencing court finds,"considering the purpose of [the Act], that there are substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence."

The Courtflatly rejects respondent's argument that such soft constraints, which still allow Washington judges to exercise asubstantial amount of discretion, survive Apprendi. Ante,at 305. This suggests that the hard constraints foundthroughout chapters 2 and 3 of the Federal SentencingGuidelines, which require an increase in the sentencingrange upon specified factual findings, will meet the same fate.See, e. g., USSG $ 2K2.1 (increases in offense level for firearms offenses based on number of firearms involved,whether possession was in connection with another offense,whether the firearm was stolen); $ 2B1.1 (increase in offenselevel for financial crimes based on amount of money involved,number of victims, possession of weapon); $ 3C1.1 (generalincrease in offense level for obstruction of justice).Indeed, the "extraordinary sentence" provision struckdown today is as inoffensive to the holding of Apprendi as aregime of guided discretion could possibly be. The list offacts that justify an increase in the range is nonexhaustive.The State's "real facts" doctrine precludes reliance by sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN326 BLAKELY v.

Irespectfully dissent.Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Breyer joins,dissenting.The majority opinion does considerable damage to ourlaws and to the administration of the criminal justice systemfor all the reasons well stated in Justice O'Connor's dis-sent, plus one more: The Court, in my respectful submission,disregards the fundamental principle under our constitu-tional system that different branches of government "converse with each other on matters of vital common interest."Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 408 (1989).

" Id., at 381 (quoting YoungstownSheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jack-son, J., concurring)). Constant, constructive discourse between our courts and our legislatures is an integral andadmirable part of the constitutional design. Case-by-casejudicial determinations often yield intelligible patterns thatcan be refined by legislatures and codified into statutes orrules as general standards. As these legislative enactmentsare followed by incremental judicial interpretation, the legis542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN327Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Kennedy, J., dissentinglatures may respond again, and the cycle repeats. This re-curring dialogue, an essential source for the elaboration andthe evolution of the law, is basic constitutional theory inaction.Sentencing guidelines are a prime example of this collabo-rative process. Dissatisfied with the wide disparity in sentencing, participants in the criminal justice system, includingjudges, pressed for legislative reforms. In response, legisla-tors drew from these participants' shared experiences andenacted measures to correct the problems, which, as JusticeO'Connor explains, could sometimes rise to the level of aconstitutional injury. As Mistretta recognized, this interchange among different actors in the constitutional schemeis consistent with the Constitution's structural protections.To be sure, this case concerns the work of a state legislature, and not of Congress. If anything, however, thisdistinction counsels even greater judicial caution. UnlikeMistretta, the case here implicates not just the collectivewisdom of legislators on the other side of the continuing dialogue over fair sentencing, but also the interest of the Statesto serve as laboratories for innovation and experiment. SeeNew State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932)(Brandeis, J., dissenting). With no apparent sense of ironythat the effect of today's decision is the destruction of a sentencing scheme devised by democratically elected legislators,the majority shuts down alternative, nonjudicial, sources ofideas and experience. It does so under a faintly disguiseddistrust of judges and their purported usurpation of thejury's function in criminal trials. It tells not only trialjudges who have spent years studying the problem but alsolegislators who have devoted valuable time and resources"calling upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of theJudicial Branch . . . on a matter uniquely within the kenof judges," Mistretta, supra, at 412, that their efforts andjudgments were all for naught. Numerous States that haveenacted sentencing guidelines similar to the one in Washing542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN328 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentington State are now commanded to scrap everything andstart over.If the Constitution required this result, the majority's de-cision, while unfortunate, would at least be understandableand defensible. As Justice O'Connor's dissent demon-strates, however, this is simply not the case. For that reason, and because the Constitution does not prohibit thedynamic and fruitful dialogue between the judicial and legis-lative branches of government that has marked sentencingreform on both the state and the federal levels for more than20 years, I dissent.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,dissenting.The Court makes clear that it means what it said in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). In its view, theSixth Amendment says that " `any fact that increases thepenalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury.' " Ante, at 301 (quotingApprendi, supra, at 490). " `[P]rescribed statutory maximum' " means the penalty that the relevant statute authorizes "solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the juryverdict." Ante, at 301, 303 (emphasis deleted). Thus, ajury must find, not only the facts that make up the crime ofwhich the offender is charged, but also all (punishmentincreasing) facts about the way in which the offender carriedout that crime.It is not difficult to understand the impulse that producedthis holding. Imagine a classic example--a statute (or mandatory sentencing guideline) that provides a 10-year sentence for ordinary bank robbery, but a 15-year sentence forbank robbery committed with a gun. One might ask why itshould matter for jury trial purposes whether the statute (orguideline) labels the gun's presence (a) a sentencing factabout the way in which the offender carried out the lessercrime of ordinary bank robbery, or (b) a factual element of542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN329Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingthe greater crime of bank robbery with a gun? If the SixthAmendment requires a jury finding about the gun in the latter circumstance, why should it not also require a jury tofind the same fact in the former circumstance? The two setsof circumstances are functionally identical. In both in-stances, identical punishment follows from identical factualfindings (related to, e. g., a bank, a taking, a thing-of-value,force or threat of force, and a gun). The only difference be-tween the two circumstances concerns a legislative (or Sentencing Commission) decision about which label ("sentencingfact" or "element of a greater crime") to affix to one of thefacts, namely, the presence of the gun, that will lead to thegreater sentence. Given the identity of circumstances apartfrom the label, the jury's traditional factfinding role, and thelaw's insistence upon treating like cases alike, why shouldthe legislature's labeling choice make an important SixthAmendment difference?The Court in Apprendi, and now here, concludes that itshould not make a difference. The Sixth Amendment's jurytrial guarantee applies similarly to both. I agree with themajority's analysis, but not with its conclusion. That is tosay, I agree that, classically speaking, the difference betweena traditional sentencing factor and an element of a greateroffense often comes down to a legislative choice about whichlabel to affix. But I cannot jump from there to the conclusion that the Sixth Amendment always requires identicaltreatment of the two scenarios. That jump is fraught withconsequences that threaten the fairness of our traditionalcriminal justice system; it distorts historical sentencing orcriminal trial practices; and it upsets settled law on whichlegislatures have relied in designing punishment systems.The Justices who have dissented from Apprendi have written about many of these matters in other opinions. See 530U. S., at 523-554 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); id., at 555-566(Breyer, J., dissenting); Harris v. United States, 536 U.

California, 524 U. S.721, 728-729 (1998) (O'Connor, J.); McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 86-91 (1986) (Rehnquist, C. J.). At therisk of some repetition, I shall set forth several of the mostimportant considerations here. They lead me to concludethat I must again dissent.IThe majority ignores the adverse consequences inherentin its conclusion. As a result of the majority's rule, sentencing must now take one of three forms, each of which riskseither impracticality, unfairness, or harm to the jury trialright the majority purports to strengthen. This circumstance shows that the majority's Sixth Amendment interpretation cannot be right.AA first option for legislators is to create a simple, pureor nearly pure "charge offense" or "determinate" sentencingsystem. See Breyer, The Federal Sentencing Guidelinesand the Key Compromises upon Which They Rest, 17 Hofstra L. Rev. 1, 8-9 (1988). In such a system, an indictmentwould charge a few facts which, taken together, constitute acrime, such as robbery. Robbery would carry a single sentence, say, five years' imprisonment. And every person convicted of robbery would receive that sentence--just as, centuries ago, everyone convicted of almost any serious crimewas sentenced to death. See, e. g., Lillquist, The PuzzlingReturn of Jury Sentencing: Misgivings About Apprendi, 82N. C. L. Rev. 621, 630 (2004).Such a system assures uniformity, but at intolerable costs.First, simple determinate sentencing systems impose identical punishments on people who committed their crimes invery different ways. When dramatically different conduct542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN331Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingends up being punished the same way, an injustice has takenplace. Simple determinate sentencing has the virtue oftreating like cases alike, but it simultaneously fails to treatdifferent cases differently. Some commentators have leveled this charge at sentencing guidelines systems themselves. See, e. g., Schulhofer, Assessing the Federal Sentencing Process: The Problem Is Uniformity, Not Disparity,29 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 833, 847 (1992) (arguing that the "mostimportant problem under the Guidelines system is not toomuch disparity, but rather excessive uniformity" and arguingfor adjustments, including elimination of mandatory minimums, to make the Guidelines system more responsive torelevant differences). The charge is doubly applicable tosimple "pure charge" systems that permit no departuresfrom the prescribed sentences, even in extraordinary cases.Second, in a world of statutorily fixed mandatory sentences for many crimes, determinate sentencing gives tremendous power to prosecutors to manipulate sentencesthrough their choice of charges. Prosecutors can simplycharge, or threaten to charge, defendants with crimes bearing higher mandatory sentences. Defendants, knowing thatthey will not have a chance to argue for a lower sentence infront of a judge, may plead to charges that they might otherwise contest. Considering that most criminal cases do notgo to trial and resolution by plea bargaining is the norm,the rule of Apprendi, to the extent it results in a return todeterminate sentencing, threatens serious unfairness. SeeBibas, Judicial Fact-Finding and Sentence Enhancements ina World of Guilty Pleas, 110 Yale L. J. 1097, 1100-1101 (2001)(explaining that the rule of Apprendi hurts defendants bydepriving them of sentencing hearings, "the only hearingsthey were likely to have"; forcing defendants to surrendersentencing issues like drug quantity when they agree to theplea; and transferring power to prosecutors).542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN332 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentingBA second option for legislators is to return to a system ofindeterminate sentencing, such as California had before therecent sentencing reform movement. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 820 (1991) ("With the increasing impor-tance of probation, as opposed to imprisonment, as a partof the penological process, some States such as Californiadeveloped the `indeterminate sentence,' where the time ofincarceration was left almost entirely to the penological au-thorities rather than to the courts"); Thompson, Navigatingthe Hidden Obstacles to Ex-Offender Reentry, 45 BostonCollege L. Rev. 255, 267 (2004) ("In the late 1970s, Californiaswitched from an indeterminate criminal sentencing schemeto determinate sentencing"). Under indeterminate systems, the length of the sentence is entirely or almost entirelywithin the discretion of the judge or of the parole board,which typically has broad power to decide when to releasea prisoner.When such systems were in vogue, they were criticized,and rightly so, for producing unfair disparities, includingrace-based disparities, in the punishment of similarly situ-ated defendants. See,e. g., ante, at 315-316 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting) (citing sources). The length of time a personspent in prison appeared to depend on "what the judge atefor breakfast" on the day of sentencing, on which judgeyou got, or on other factors that should not have madea difference to the length of the sentence. See Breyer,supra, at 4-5 (citing congressional and expert studies indi-cating that, before the United States Sentencing CommissionGuidelines were promulgated, punishments for identicalcrimes in the Second Circuit ranged from 3 to 20 years' imprisonment and that sentences varied depending upon re-gion, gender of the defendant, and race of the defendant).And under such a system, the judge could vary the sentencegreatly based upon his findings about how the defendant hadcommitted the crime--findings that might not have been542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN333Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingmade by a "preponderance of the evidence," much less "be-yond a reasonable doubt." See McMillan, 477 U. S., at 91("Sentencing courts have traditionally heard evidence andfound facts without any prescribed burden of proof at all"(citing Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949))).Returning to such a system would diminish the " `reason' "the majority claims it is trying to uphold. Ante, at 302(quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 87, p. 55 (2d ed.1872)). It also would do little to "ensur[e] [the] control" ofwhat the majority calls "the peopl[e,]"i. e., the jury, "in thejudiciary," ante, at 306, since "the peopl[e]" would only decide the defendant's guilt, a finding with no effect on theduration of the sentence. While "the judge's authority tosentence" would formally derive from the jury's verdict, thejury would exercise little or no control over the sentenceitself. Ibid. It is difficult to see how such an outcome pro-tects the structural safeguards the majority claims to bedefending. CA third option is that which the Court seems to believelegislators will in fact take. That is the option of retainingstructured schemes that attempt to punish similar conductsimilarly and different conduct differently, but modifyingthem to conform to Apprendi's dictates. Judges would beable to departdownward from presumptive sentences uponfinding that mitigating factors were present, but would notbe able to depart upward unless the prosecutor charged theaggravating fact to a jury and proved it beyond a reasonabledoubt. The majority argues, based on the single example ofKansas, that most legislatures will enact amendments alongthese lines in the face of the oncoming Apprendi train. Seeante, at 309-310 (citing State v. Gould, 271 Kan. 394, 404-414,23 P. 3d 801, 809-814 (2001); Act of May 29, 2002, ch. 170,2002 Kan. Sess. Laws pp. 1018-1023 (codified at Kan. Stat.Ann. $ 21-4718 (2003 Cum. Supp.)); Brief for Kansas Appel-late Defender Office asAmicus Curiae 3-7). It is therefore542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN334 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentingworth exploring how this option could work in practice, aswell as the assumptions on which it depends.1This option can be implemented in one of two ways. Thefirst way would be for legislatures to subdivide each crimeinto a list of complex crimes, each of which would be definedto include commonly found sentencing factors such as drugquantity, type of victim, presence of violence, degree of in-jury, use of gun, and so on. A legislature, for example,might enact a robbery statute, modeled on robbery sentenc-ing guidelines, that increases punishment depending upon(1) the nature of the institution robbed, (2) the (a) presenceof, (b) brandishing of, (c) other use of, a firearm, (3) makingof a death threat, (4) presence of (a) ordinary, (b) serious,(c) permanent or life threatening, bodily injury, (5) abduction,(6) physical restraint, (7) taking of a firearm, (8) taking ofdrugs, (9) value of property loss, etc. Cf. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 2B3.1 (Nov. 2003)(hereinafter USSG).This possibility is, of course, merely a highly calibratedform of the "pure charge" system discussed in Part I-A,supra. And it suffers from some of the same defects. Theprosecutor, through control of the precise charge, controlsthe punishment, thereby marching the sentencing system di-rectly away from, not toward, one important guideline goal:rough uniformity of punishment for those who engage inroughly the same real criminal conduct. The artificial (andconsequently unfair) nature of the resulting sentence is ag-gravated by the fact that prosecutors must charge all relevant facts about the way the crime was committed beforea presentence investigation examines the criminal conduct,perhaps before the trial itself, i. e., before many of the factsrelevant to punishment are known.This "complex charge offense" system also prejudices de-fendants who seek trial, for it can put them in the untenable542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN335Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingposition of contesting material aggravating facts in the guiltphases of their trials. Consider a defendant who is charged,not with mere possession of cocaine, but with the specificoffense of possession of more than 500 grams of cocaine. Orconsider a defendant charged, not with murder, but with thenew crime of murder using a machete. Or consider a defendant who the prosecution wants to claim was a "supervisor," rather than an ordinary gang member. How can aConstitution that guarantees due process put these defendants, as a matter of course, in the position of arguing, "I didnot sell drugs, and if I did, I did not sell more than 500grams," or "I did not kill him, and if I did, I did not use amachete," or "I did not engage in gang activity, and certainlynot as a supervisor" to a single jury? See Apprendi, 530U. S., at 557-558 (Breyer, J., dissenting); Monge, 524 U. S.,at 729. The system can tolerate this kind of problem upto a point (consider the defendant who wants to argue innocence, and, in the alternative, second-degree, not firstdegree, murder). But a rereading of the many distinctionsmade in a typical robbery guideline, see supra, at 334, suggests that an effort to incorporate any real set of guidelinesin a complex statute would reach well beyond that point.The majority announces that there really is no problemhere because "States may continue to offer judicial factfinding as a matter of course to all defendants who plead guilty"and defendants may "stipulat[e] to the relevant facts or consen[t] to judicial factfinding." Ante, at 310. The problem,of course, concerns defendants who do not want to pleadguilty to those elements that, until recently, were commonlythought of as sentencing factors. As to those defendants,the fairness problem arises because States may very welldecide that they will not permit defendants to carve subsetsof facts out of the new, Apprendi-required 17-element robbery crime, seeking a judicial determination as to some ofthose facts and a jury determination as to others. Instead,States may simply require defendants to plead guilty to all542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN336 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissenting17 elements or proceed with a (likely prejudicial) trial on all17 elements.The majority does not deny that States may make thischoice; it simply fails to understand why any State wouldwant to exercise it. Ante, at 310, n. 12. The answer is, asI shall explain in a moment, that the alternative may provetoo expensive and unwieldy for States to provide. Statesthat offer defendants the option of judicial factfinding as tosome facts (i. e., sentencing facts), say, because of fairnessconcerns, will also have to offer the defendant a second sentencing jury--just as Kansas has done. I therefore turn tothat alternative.2The second way to make sentencing guidelines Apprendicompliant would be to require at least two juries for eachdefendant whenever aggravating facts are present: one juryto determine guilt of the crime charged, and an additionaljury to try the disputed facts that, if found, would aggravatethe sentence. Our experience with bifurcated trials in thecapital punishment context suggests that requiring them forrun-of-the-mill sentences would be costly, both in money andin judicial time and resources. Cf. Kozinski & Gallagher,Death: The Ultimate Run-On Sentence, 46 Case W. Res.L. Rev. 1, 13-15, and n. 64 (1995) (estimating the costs of eachcapital case at around $1 million more than each noncapitalcase); Tabak, How Empirical Studies Can Affect Positivelythe Politics of the Death Penalty, 83 Cornell L. Rev. 1431,1439-1440 (1998) (attributing the greater cost of death penalty cases in part to bifurcated proceedings). In the contextof noncapital crimes, the potential need for a second indictment alleging aggravating facts, the likely need for formalevidentiary rules to prevent prejudice, and the increased difficulty of obtaining relevant sentencing information, all willmean greater complexity, added cost, and further delay. SeePart V, infra. Indeed, cost and delay could lead legislatures542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN337Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingto revert to the complex charge offense system described inPart I-C-1,supra.The majority refers to an amicus curiae brief filed by theKansas Appellate Defender Office, which suggests that atwo-jury system has proved workable in Kansas. Ante, at309-310. And that may be so. But in all likelihood, anysuch workability reflects an uncomfortable fact, a fact atwhich the majority hints, ante, at 310, but whose constitu-tional implications it does not seem to grasp. The uncomfortable fact that could make the system seem workable--even desirable in the minds of some, including defenseattorneys--is called "plea bargaining." See Bibas, 110 YaleL. J., at 1150, and n. 330 (reporting that in 1996, fewer than4% of adjudicated state felony defendants have jury trials,5% have bench trials, and 91% plead guilty). See also ante,at 310 (making clear that plea bargaining applies). TheCourt can announce that the Constitution requires at leasttwo jury trials for each criminal defendant--one for guilt,another for sentencing--but only because it knows full wellthat more than 90% of defendants will not go to trial evenonce, much less insist on two or more trials.What will be the consequences of the Court's holding forthe 90% of defendants who do not go to trial? The truthfulanswer is that we do not know. Some defendants may receive bargaining advantages if the increased cost of the "double jury trial" guarantee makes prosecutors more willing tocede certain sentencing issues to the defense. Other defendants may be hurt if a "single-jury-decides-all" approachmakes them more reluctant to risk a trial--perhaps becausethey want to argue that they did not know what was in thecocaine bag, that it was a small amount regardless, that theywere unaware a confederate had a gun, etc. See Bibas, 110Yale L. J., at 1100 ("Because for many defendants going totrial is not a desirable option, they are left without any realhearings at all"); id., at 1151 ("The trial right does little goodwhen most defendants do not go to trial").542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN338 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentingAt the least, the greater expense attached to trials andtheir greater complexity, taken together in the context of anoverworked criminal justice system, will likely mean, otherthings being equal, fewer trials and a greater reliance uponplea bargaining--a system in which punishment is set not byjudges or juries but by advocates acting under bargainingconstraints. At the same time, the greater power of theprosecutor to control the punishment through the chargewould likely weaken the relation between real conduct andreal punishment as well. See, e. g., Schulhofer, 29 Am. Crim.L. Rev., at 845 (estimating that evasion of the proper sentence under the Federal Guidelines may now occur in 20%-35% of all guilty plea cases). Even if the Court's holdingdoes not further embed plea-bargaining practices (as I fearit will), its success depends upon the existence of presentpractice. I do not understand how the Sixth Amendmentcould require a sentencing system that will work in practiceonly if no more than a handful of defendants exercise theirright to a jury trial.The majority's only response is to state that "bargainingover elements . . . probably favors the defendant," ante,at 311, adding that many criminal defense lawyers favor itsposition, ante, at 312. But the basic problem is not one of"fairness" to defendants or, for that matter, "fairness" toprosecutors. Rather, it concerns the greater fairness of asentencing system that a more uniform correspondence between real criminal conduct and real punishment helps tocreate. At a minimum, a two-jury system, by preventing ajudge from taking account of an aggravating fact withoutthe prosecutor's acquiescence, would undercut, if not nullify,legislative efforts to ensure through guidelines that punishments reflect a convicted offender's real criminal conduct,rather than that portion of the offender's conduct that aprosecutor decides to charge and prove.Efforts to tie real punishment to real conduct are not new.They are embodied in well-established preguidelines sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN339Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingtencing practices--practices under which a judge, looking ata presentence report, would seek to tailor the sentence insignificant part to fit the criminal conduct in which the of-fender actually engaged. For more than a century, questions of punishment (not those of guilt or innocence) havereflected determinations made, not only by juries, but alsoby judges, probation officers, and executive parole boards.Such truthseeking determinations have rested upon bothadversarial and nonadversarial processes. The Court'sholding undermines efforts to reform these processes, for itmeans that legislatures cannot both permit judges to basesentencing upon real conductand seek, through guidelines,to make the results more uniform.In these and other ways, the two-jury system would worka radical change in pre-existing criminal law. It is not surprising that this Court has never previously suggested thatthe Constitution--outside the unique context of the deathpenalty--might require bifurcated jury-based sentencing.And it is the impediment the Court's holding poses to legislative efforts to achieve that greater systematic fairness thatcasts doubt on its constitutional validity.DIs there a fourth option? Perhaps. Congress and statelegislatures might, for example, rewrite their criminal codes,attaching astronomically high sentences to each crime, fol-lowed by long lists of mitigating facts, which, for the mostpart, would consist of the absence of aggravating facts. Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 541-542 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (ex-plaining how legislatures can evade the majority's rule bymaking yet another labeling choice). But political impedi-ments to legislative action make such rewrites difficult toachieve; and it is difficult to see why the Sixth Amendmentwould require legislatures to undertake them.It may also prove possible to find combinations of, or varia-tions upon, my first three options. But I am unaware of any542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN340 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentingvariation that does not involve (a) the shift of power to theprosecutor (weakening the connection between real conductand real punishment) inherent in any charge offense system,(b) the lack of uniformity inherent in any system of purejudicial discretion, or (c) the complexity, expense, and in-creased reliance on plea bargains involved in a "two-jury"system. The simple fact is that the design of any fair sen-tencing system must involve efforts to make practical compromises among competing goals. The majority's reading ofthe Sixth Amendment makes the effort to find those compromises--already difficult--virtually impossible.IIThe majority rests its conclusion in significant part upon aclaimed historical (and therefore constitutional) imperative.According to the majority, the rule it applies in this case isrooted in "longstanding tenets of common-law criminal jurisprudence," ante, at 301: that every accusation against a de-fendant must be proved to a jury and that " `an accusationwhich lacks any particular fact which the law makes essen-tial to the punishment is . . . no accusation within the requirements of the common law, and it is no accusation in reason,' "ante, at 301-302 (quoting Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 87, at55). The historical sources upon which the majority relies,however, do not compel the result it reaches. Seeante, at323 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 525-528 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The quotation from Bishop,to which the majority attributes great weight, stands fornothing more than the "unremarkable proposition" thatwhere a legislature passes a statute setting forth heavierpenalties than were available for committing a common-lawoffense and specifying those facts that triggered the statutory penalty, "a defendant could receive the greater statu-tory punishment only if the indictment expressly chargedand the prosecutor proved the facts that made up the statu-tory offense, as opposed to simply those facts that made up542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN341Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingthe common-law offense." Id., at 526 (O'Connor, J., dissent-ing) (characterizing a similar statement of the law in J. Archbold, Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 51, 188 (15thed. 1862)).This is obvious when one considers the problem thatBishop was addressing. He provides as an example "statutes whereby, when [a common-law crime] is committed witha particular intent, or with a particular weapon, or the like,it is subjected to a particular corresponding punishment,heavier than that for" the simple common-law offense(though, of course, his concerns were not "limited to thatexample," ante, at 302, n. 5). Bishop, supra, $ 82, at 51-52(discussing the example of common assault and enhancedassault statutes, e. g., "assaults committed with the intent torob"). That indictments historically had to charge all of thestatutorily labeled elements of the offense is a propositionon which all can agree. See Apprendi, supra, at 526-527(O'Connor, J., dissenting). See also J. Archbold, Pleadingand Evidence in Criminal Cases 44 (11th ed. 1849) ("[E]veryfact or circumstance which is a necessary ingredient in theoffence must be set forth in the indictment" so that "theremay be no doubt as to the judgment which should be given,if the defendant be convicted"); 1 T. Starkie, Criminal Pleading 68 (2d ed. 1822) (the indictment must state "the criminalnature and degree of the offence, which are conclusions oflaw from the facts; and also the particular facts and circumstances which render the defendant guilty of that offence").Neither Bishop nor any other historical treatise writer,however, disputes the proposition that judges historicallyhad discretion to vary the sentence, within the range provided by the statute, based on facts not proved at the trial.See Bishop, supra, $ 85, at 54 ("[W]ithin the limits of anydiscretion as to the punishment which the law may have allowed, the judge, when he pronounces sentence, may sufferhis discretion to be influenced by matter shown in aggravation or mitigation, not covered by the allegations of the in542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN342 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentingdictment"); K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentenc-ing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9 (1998). The modernhistory of preguidelines sentencing likewise indicates thatjudges had broad discretion to set sentences within a statutory range based on uncharged conduct. Usually, the judgebased his or her sentencing decision on facts gleaned from apresentence report, which the defendant could dispute at asentencing hearing. In the federal system, for example,Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 provided that probation officers, who are employees of the Judicial Branch, pre-pared a presentence report for the judge, a copy of whichwas generally given to the prosecution and defense beforethe sentencing hearing. See Stith & Cabranes, supra, at79-80, 221, n. 5. See also ante, at 315 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (describing the State of Washington's former indeterminate sentencing law).In this case, the statute provides that kidnaping may bepunished by up to 10 years' imprisonment. Wash. Rev. CodeAnn. $$ 9A.40.030(3), 9A.20.021(1)(b) (2000). Modern structured sentencing schemes like Washington's do not changethe statutorily fixed maximum penalty, nor do they purportto establish new elements for the crime. Instead, they undertake to structure the previously unfettered discretion ofthe sentencing judge, channeling and limiting his or her discretion even within the statutory range. (Thus, contrary tothe majority's arguments, ante, at 308-309, kidnapers in theState of Washington know that they risk up to 10 years' imprisonment, but they also have the benefit of additional information about how long--within the 10-year maximum--theirsentences are likely to be, based on how the kidnaping wascommitted.)Historical treatises do not speak to such a practice becauseit was not done in the 19th century. Cf. Jones, 526 U. S., at244 ("[T]he scholarship of which we are aware does not showthat a question exactly like this one was ever raised andresolved in the period before the framing"). This makes542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN343Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingsense when one considers that, prior to the 19th century, theprescribed penalty for felonies was often death, which thejudge had limited, and sometimes no, power to vary. SeeLillquist, 82 N. C. L. Rev., at 628-630. The 19th centurysaw a movement to a rehabilitative mode of punishment inwhich prison terms became a norm, shifting power to thejudge to impose a longer or shorter term within the statutory maximum. See ibid. The ability of legislatures toguide the judge's discretion by designating presumptiveranges, while allowing the judge to impose a more or lesssevere penalty in unusual cases, was therefore never considered. To argue otherwise, the majority must ignore the significant differences between modern structured sentencingschemes and the history on which it relies to strike themdown. And while the majority insists that the historicalsources, particularly Bishop, should not be "limited" to thecontext in which they were written, ante, at 302, n. 5, it hasnever explained why the Court must transplant those discussions to the very different context of sentencing schemesdesigned to structure judges' discretion within a statutorysentencing range.Given history's silence on the question of laws that structure a judge's discretion within the range provided by thelegislatively labeled maximum term, it is not surprising thatour modern, pre-Apprendi cases made clear that legislaturescould, within broad limits, distinguish between "sentencingfacts" and "elements of crimes." See McMillan, 477 U. S.,at 85-88. By their choice of label, legislatures could indicatewhether a judge or a jury must make the relevant factualdetermination. History does not preclude legislatures frommaking this decision. And, as I argued in Part I, supra,allowing legislatures to structure sentencing in this way hasthe dual effect of enhancing and giving meaning to the SixthAmendment's jury trial right as to core crimes, while affording additional due process to defendants in the form of sen542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN344 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentingtencing hearings before judges--hearings the majority's rulewill eliminate for many.Is there a risk of unfairness involved in permitting Con-gress to make this labeling decision? Of course. As wehave recognized, the "tail" of the sentencing fact might"wa[g] the dog of the substantive offense." McMillan,supra, at 88. Congress might permit a judge to sentence anindividual for murder though convicted only of making anillegal lane change. See ante, at 306 (majority opinion).But that is the kind of problem that the Due Process Clauseis well suited to cure. McMillan foresaw the possibilitythat judges would have to use their own judgment in dealingwith such a problem; but that is what judges are there for.And, as Part I,supra, makes clear, the alternatives areworse--not only practically, but, although the majority refuses to admit it, constitutionally as well.Historic practice, then, does not compel the result themajority reaches. And constitutional concerns counsel theopposite.IIIThe majority also overlooks important institutional consid-erations. Congress and the States relied upon what theybelieved was their constitutional power to decide, withinbroad limits, whether to make a particular fact (a) a sentencing factor or (b) an element in a greater crime. They reliedupon McMillan as guaranteeing the constitutional validityof that proposition. They created sentencing reform, an ef-fort to change the criminal justice system so that it reflectssystematically not simply upon guilt or innocence but alsoupon what should be done about this now-guilty offender.Those efforts have spanned a generation. They have led tostate sentencing guidelines and the Federal SentencingGuidelines system. E. g., ante, at 314-318 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting) (describing sentencing reform in the State ofWashington). These systems are imperfect and they yieldfar from perfect results, but I cannot believe the Constitu542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN345Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingtion forbids the state legislatures and Congress to adopt suchsystems and to try to improve them over time. Nor can Ibelieve that the Constitution hamstrings legislatures in theway thatJustice O'Connor and I have discussed.IVNow, let us return to the question I posed at the outset.Why does the Sixth Amendment permit a jury trial right (inrespect to a particular fact) to depend upon a legislative la-beling decision, namely, the legislative decision to label thefact a sentencing fact, instead of an element of the crime?The answer is that the fairness and effectiveness of a sentencing system, and the related fairness and effectiveness ofthe criminal justice system itself, depend upon the legislature's possessing the constitutional authority (within dueprocess limits) to make that labeling decision. To restrictradically the legislature's power in this respect, as the major-ity interprets the Sixth Amendment to do, prevents the legislature from seeking sentencing systems that are consistentwith, and indeed may help to advance, the Constitution'sgreater fairness goals.To say this is not simply to express concerns about fairnessto defendants. It is also to express concerns about the seri-ous practical (or impractical) changes that the Court's decision seems likely to impose upon the criminal process; aboutthe tendency of the Court's decision to embed further pleabargaining processes that lack transparency and too oftenmean nonuniform, sometimes arbitrary, sentencing practices;about the obstacles the Court's decision poses to legislativeefforts to bring about greater uniformity between real criminal conduct and real punishment; and ultimately about thelimitations that the Court imposes upon legislatures' abilityto make democratic legislative decisions. Whatever thefaults of guidelines systems--and there are many--they aremore likely to find their cure in legislation emerging fromthe experience of, and discussion among, all elements of the542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN346 BLAKELY v. WASHINGTONBreyer, J., dissentingcriminal justice community, than in a virtually unchangeableconstitutional decision of this Court.VTaken together these three sets of considerations, concern-ing consequences, concerning history, concerning institutional reliance, leave me where I was in Apprendi, i. e., con-vinced that the Court is wrong. Until now, I would havethought the Court might have limited Apprendi so that itsunderlying principle would not undo sentencing reform efforts. Today's case dispels that illusion. At a minimum,the case sets aside numerous state efforts in that direction.Perhaps the Court will distinguish the Federal SentencingGuidelines, but I am uncertain how. As a result of today'sdecision, federal prosecutors, like state prosecutors, must de-cide what to do next, how to handle tomorrow's case.Consider some of the matters that federal prosecutorsmust know about, or guess about, when they prosecute theirnext case: (1) Does today's decision apply in full force to theFederal Sentencing Guidelines? (2) If so, must the initialindictment contain all sentencing factors, charged as "ele-ments" of the crime? (3) What, then, are the evidentiaryrules? Can the prosecution continue to use, say, presen-tence reports, with their conclusions reflecting layers ofhearsay? Cf. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36, 63, 68(2004) (clarifying the Sixth Amendment's requirement of confrontation with respect to testimonial hearsay). Are the nu-merous cases of this Court holding that a sentencing judgemay consider virtually any reliable information still good lawwhen juries, not judges, are required to determine the matter? See, e. g., United States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 153-157(1997) (per curiam) (evidence of conduct of which the defendant has been acquitted may be considered at sentencing).Cf. Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 399-401 (1995) (evidence of uncharged criminal conduct used in determiningsentence). (4) How are juries to deal with highly complex542US2 Unit: $U69 [11-01-06 18:18:51] PAGES PGT: OPIN347Cite as: 542 U. S. 296 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingor open-ended Sentencing Guidelines obviously written forapplication by an experienced trial judge? See, e. g., USSG$ 3B1.1 (requiring a greater sentence when the defendantwas a leader of a criminal activity that involved four or moreparticipants or was "otherwise extensive" (emphasis added));$$ 3D1.1- 3D1.2 (highly complex "multiple count" rules);$ 1B1.3 (relevant conduct rules).Ordinarily, this Court simply waits for cases to arise inwhich it can answer such questions. But this case affectstens of thousands of criminal prosecutions, including federalprosecutions. Federal prosecutors will proceed with thoseprosecutions subject to the risk that all defendants in thosecases will have to be sentenced, perhaps tried, anew. Giventhis consequence and the need for certainty, I would not proceed further piecemeal; rather, I would call for further argu-ment on the ramifications of the concerns I have raised. Butthat is not the Court's view.For the reasons given, I dissent.542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN348 OCTOBER TERM, 2003SyllabusSCHRIRO, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OFCORRECTIONSv.

The State Supreme Court affirmed on direct review.While respondent's subsequent federal habeas case was pending in theNinth Circuit, this Court decided that Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.

SUMMERLINOpinion of the CourtIIn April 1981, Finance America employee Brenna Baileydisappeared while on a house call to discuss an outstandingdebt with respondent Warren Summerlin's wife. That eve-ning, an anonymous woman (later identified as respondent'smother-in-law) called the police and accused respondent ofmurdering Bailey. Bailey's partially nude body, her skullcrushed, was found the next morning in the trunk of her car,wrapped in a bedspread from respondent's home. Police arrested respondent and later overheard him make incriminat-ing remarks to his wife.Respondent was convicted of first-degree murder and sex-ual assault. Arizona's capital sentencing provisions in effectat the time authorized the death penalty if one of severalenumerated aggravating factors was present. See Ariz.Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 13-703(E), (F) (West 1978), as amended byAct of May 1, 1979 Ariz. Sess. Laws ch. 144. Whether thoseaggravating factors existed, however, was determined by thetrial judge rather than by a jury. $ 13-703(B). In this casethe judge, after a hearing, found two aggravating factors: aprior felony conviction involving use or threatened use ofviolence, $ 13-703(F)(2), and commission of the offense in anespecially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, $ 13-703(F)(6).Finding no mitigating factors, the judge imposed the deathsentence.

Weconcluded that, because Arizona law authorized the deathpenalty only if an aggravating factor was present, Apprendirequired the existence of such a factor to be proved to a juryrather than to a judge. 536 U. S., at 603-609.1 We specifically overruled our earlier decision in Walton v. Arizona,497 U. S. 639 (1990), which had upheld an Arizona death sentence against a similar challenge. 536 U.

Stewart, 341 F. 3d 1082,1121 (2003) (en banc).2 It rejected the argument that Ringdid not apply because respondent's conviction and sentencehad become final on direct review before Ring was decided.We granted certiorari. 540 U. S. 1045 (2003).3IIWhen a decision of this Court results in a "new rule," thatrule applies to all criminal cases still pending on direct review. Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314, 328 (1987). As toconvictions that are already final, however, the rule appliesonly in limited circumstances. New substantive rules gen-erally apply retroactively. This includes decisions that narrow the scope of a criminal statute by interpreting its terms,1 Because Arizona law already required aggravating factors to be provedbeyond a reasonable doubt, see State v. Jordan, 126 Ariz. 283, 286, 614P. 2d 825, 828, cert. denied, 449 U. S. 986 (1980), that aspect of Apprendiwas not at issue.2 Because respondent filed his habeas petition before the effective dateof the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat.1214, the provisions of that Act do not apply. See Lindh v. Murphy, 521U. S. 320, 336-337 (1997).3 The State also sought certiorari on the ground that there was no Apprendi violation because the prior-conviction aggravator, exempt from Apprendi under Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998),was sufficient standing alone to authorize the death penalty. We deniedcertiorari on that issue, 540 U.

S. 484, 494-495(1990); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 311 (1989) (pluralityopinion).4 Such rules apply retroactively because they "necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands con-victed of `an act that the law does not make criminal' " orfaces a punishment that the law cannot impose upon him.Bousley, supra, at 620 (quoting Davis v. United States, 417U. S. 333, 346 (1974)).New rules of procedure, on the other hand, generally donot apply retroactively. They do not produce a class of persons convicted of conduct the law does not make criminal,but merely raise the possibility that someone convicted withuse of the invalidated procedure might have been acquittedotherwise. Because of this more speculative connection toinnocence, we give retroactive effect to only a small set of" `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding."Saffle, supra, at 495 (quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 311 (plural-ity opinion)). That a new procedural rule is "fundamental"in some abstract sense is not enough; the rule must be one"without which the likelihood of an accurate conviction is seriously diminished." Id., at 313 (emphasis added). Thisclass of rules is extremely narrow, and "it is unlikely thatany . . . `ha[s] yet to emerge.' " Tyler v. Cain, 533 U. S. 656,667, n. 7 (2001) (quoting Sawyer v.

S. 266, 271, and n. 5 (2002) (per curiam);they are more accurately characterized as substantive rules not subjectto the bar.542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 542 U. S. 348 (2004)Opinion of the Courtless applied the rule retroactively to respondent's case, relying on two alternative theories: first, that it was substantiverather than procedural; and second, that it was a "watershed" procedural rule entitled to retroactive effect. We consider each theory in turn.AA rule is substantive rather than procedural if it alters therange of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes. See Bousley, supra, at 620-621 (rule "hold[s] thata . . . statute does not reach certain conduct" or "make[s]conduct criminal"); Saffle, supra, at 495 (rule "decriminalize[s] a class of conduct [or] prohibit[s] the imposition of . . .punishment on a particular class of persons"). In contrast,rules that regulate only the manner of determining the defendant's culpability are procedural. See Bousley, supra,at 620.Judged by this standard, Ring's holding is properly classified as procedural. Ring held that "a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, [may not] find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death penalty." 536U. S., at 609. Rather, "the Sixth Amendment requires that[those circumstances] be found by a jury." Ibid. This holding did not alter the range of conduct Arizona law subjectedto the death penalty. It could not have; it rested entirely onthe Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guarantee, a provision thathas nothing to do with the range of conduct a State maycriminalize. Instead, Ring altered the range of permissiblemethods for determining whether a defendant's conduct ispunishable by death, requiring that a jury rather than ajudge find the essential facts bearing on punishment. Rulesthat allocate decisionmaking authority in this fashion areprototypical procedural rules, a conclusion we have reachedin numerous other contexts. See Gasperini v. Center forHumanities, Inc., 518 U. S. 415, 426 (1996) (Erie doctrine);Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 280-281542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN354 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLINOpinion of the Court(1994) (antiretroactivity presumption); Dobbert v. Florida,432 U. S. 282, 293-294 (1977) (Ex Post Facto Clause).Respondent nevertheless argues that Ring is substantivebecause it modified the elements of the offense for which hewas convicted. He relies on our statement in Ring that,"[b]ecause Arizona's enumerated aggravating factors operateas `the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense,' the Sixth Amendment requires that they be found bya jury." 536 U. S., at 609 (citation omitted); see also Sattazahn v. Pennsylvania, 537 U. S. 101, 111 (2003) (pluralityopinion). The Ninth Circuit agreed, concluding that Ring"reposition[ed] Arizona's aggravating factors as elements ofthe separate offense of capital murder and reshap[ed] thestructure of Arizona murder law." 341 F. 3d, at 1105.A decision that modifies the elements of an offense is normally substantive rather than procedural. New elementsalter the range of conduct the statute punishes, renderingsome formerly unlawful conduct lawful or vice versa. SeeBousley, 523 U. S., at 620-621. But that is not what Ringdid; the range of conduct punished by death in Arizona wasthe same before Ring as after. Ring held that, because Arizona's statutory aggravators restricted (as a matter of statelaw) the class of death-eligible defendants, those aggravatorseffectively were elements for federal constitutional purposes,and so were subject to the procedural requirements the Constitution attaches to trial of elements. 536 U. S., at 609.This Court's holding that, because Arizona has made a certain fact essential to the death penalty, that fact must befound by a jury, is not the same as this Court's making acertain fact essential to the death penalty. The former wasa procedural holding; the latter would be substantive. TheNinth Circuit's conclusion that Ring nonetheless "reshap[ed]the structure of Arizona murder law," 341 F. 3d, at 1105, isparticularly remarkable in the face of the Arizona SupremeCourt's previous conclusion to the contrary. See State v.542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN355Cite as: 542 U. S. 348 (2004)Opinion of the CourtTowery, 204 Ariz. 386, 390-391, 64 P. 3d 828, 832-833, cert.dism'd, 539 U.

Saffle, 494 U. S., at 495(quoting Teague, 489 U. S., at 311). He offers several rea-sons why juries are more accurate factfinders, including thetendency of group deliberation to suppress individual eccen-tricities; the jury's protection from exposure to inadmissibleevidence; and its better representation of the common senseof the community. The Ninth Circuit majority added others,including the claim that a judge might be too acclimated tocapital sentencing and that he might be swayed by politicalpressure. 341 F. 3d, at 1109-1116. Respondent furthernotes that common-law authorities praised the jury's factfinding ability. See, e. g., 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries onthe Laws of England 380 (1768);Georgia v. Brailsford, 3Dall. 1, 4 (1794) ( jury charge of Jay, C. J.).The question here is not, however, whether the Framersbelieved that juries are more accurate factfinders thanjudges (perhaps so--they certainly thought juries were moreindependent, seeBlakely v. Washington, ante, at 305-308).Nor is the question whether juries actually are more accurate factfinders than judges (again, perhaps so). Rather, thequestion is whether judicial factfinding so "seriously dimin5 Respondent also argues that Ring was substantive because our understanding of Arizona law changed. Compare Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S.584, 602-603 (2002), with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 496-497(2000). Even if our understanding of state law changed, however, theactual content of state law did not.

SUMMERLINOpinion of the Courtishe[s]" accuracy that there is an " `impermissibly largerisk' " of punishing conduct the law does not reach.Teague,supra, at 312-313 (quoting Desist v. United States, 394 U. S.244, 262 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting)) (emphasis added).The evidence is simply too equivocal to support thatconclusion.First, for every argument why juries are more accuratefactfinders, there is another why they are less accurate.The Ninth Circuit dissent noted several, including juries'tendency to become confused over legal standards and to beinfluenced by emotion or philosophical predisposition. 341F. 3d, at 1129-1131 (opinion of Rawlinson, J.) (citing, interalia, Eisenberg & Wells, Deadly Confusion: Juror Instructions in Capital Cases, 79 Cornell L. Rev. 1 (1993); Garvey,The Emotional Economy of Capital Sentencing, 75 N. Y. U.L. Rev. 26 (2000); and Bowers, Sandys, & Steiner, ForeclosedImpartiality in Capital Sentencing: Jurors' Predispositions,Guilt-Trial Experience, and Premature Decision Making, 83Cornell L. Rev. 1476 (1998)). Members of this Court haveopined that judicial sentencing may yield more consistent results because of judges' greater experience. See Proffitt v.Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 252 (1976) ( joint opinion of Stewart,Powell, and Stevens, JJ.). Finally, the mixed receptionthat the right to jury trial has been given in other countries,see Vidmar, The Jury Elsewhere in the World, in World JurySystems 421-447 (N. Vidmar ed. 2000), though irrelevant tothe meaning and continued existence of that right under ourConstitution, surely makes it implausible that judicial factfinding so "seriously diminishe[s]" accuracy as to producean " `impermissibly large risk' " of injustice. When so manypresumably reasonable minds continue to disagree overwhether juries are better factfinders at all, we cannot confidently say that judicial factfinding seriously diminishesaccuracy.Our decision in DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968)(per curiam), is on point. There we refused to give retroac542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN357Cite as: 542 U. S. 348 (2004)Opinion of the Courttive effect to Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968),which applied the Sixth Amendment's jury-trial guaranteeto the States. While DeStefano was decided under our preTeague retroactivity framework, its reasoning is germane.We noted that, although "the right to jury trial generallytends to prevent arbitrariness and repression[,] . . . `[w]ewould not assert . . . that every criminal trial--or any particular trial--held before a judge alone is unfair or that a de-fendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as hewould be by a jury.' " 392 U. S., at 633-634 (quoting Duncan, supra, at 158). We concluded that "[t]he values implemented by the right to jury trial would not measurably beserved by requiring retrial of all persons convicted in thepast by procedures not consistent with the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial." 392 U. S., at 634. If under DeStefano a trial held entirely without a jury was not impermissibly inaccurate, it is hard to see how a trial in which ajudge finds only aggravating factors could be.The dissent contends that juries are more accurate because they better reflect community standards in decidingwhether, for example, a murder was heinous, cruel, or depraved. Post, at 361-362 (opinion of Breyer, J.). But thestatute here does not condition death eligibility on whetherthe offense is heinous, cruel, or depraved as determinedby community standards. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-703(F)(6) (West 1978). It is easy to find enhanced accuracyin jury determination when one redefines the statute's substantive scope in such manner as to ensure that result. Thedissent also advances several variations on the theme thatdeath is different (or rather, "dramatically different," post,at 363). Much of this analysis is not an application ofTeague, but a rejection of it, in favor of a broader endeavorto "balance competing considerations," post, at 362. Evenwere we inclined to revisit Teague in this fashion, we wouldnot agree with the dissent's conclusions. Finally, the dissentnotes that, in DeStefano, we considered factors other than542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN358 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLINBreyer, J., dissentingenhanced accuracy that are no longer relevant after Teague.See post, at 365. But we held in that case that "[a]ll threefactors favor only prospective application of the rule." 392U. S., at 633 (emphasis added). Thus, the result would havebeen the same even if enhanced accuracy were the sole crite-rion for retroactivity.6* * *The right to jury trial is fundamental to our system ofcriminal procedure, and States are bound to enforce theSixth Amendment's guarantees as we interpret them. Butit does not follow that, when a criminal defendant has had afull trial and one round of appeals in which the State faith-fully applied the Constitution as we understood it at thetime, he may nevertheless continue to litigate his claims in-definitely in hopes that we will one day have a change ofheart. Ring announced a new procedural rule that does notapply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.The contrary judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, JusticeSouter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.In Ring v. Arizona, 536 U. S. 584 (2002), this Court heldthat a jury, not a judge, must make the findings necessary to6 The dissent distinguishes DeStefano on the ground that "this case involves only a small subclass of defendants deprived of jury trial rights,the relevant harm within that subclass is more widespread, the administration of justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interest lessweighty." Post, at 366. But the first, third, and fourth of these pointsare irrelevant under Teague, and the second, insofar as it relates to accuracy, is an unsubstantiated assertion. If jury trial significantly enhancesaccuracy, we would not have been able to hold as we did in DeStefano thatthe first factor--"prevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression," 392 U. S., at633--did not favor retroactivity.542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN359Cite as: 542 U. S. 348 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingqualify a person for punishment by death. In my view, thatholding amounts to a "watershed" procedural ruling that afederal habeas court must apply when considering a constitu-tional challenge to a "final" death sentence--i. e., a sentencethat was already final on direct review when Ring wasdecided.Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (plurality opinion),sets forth the relevant retroactivity criteria. A new proce-dural rule applies retroactively in habeas proceedings if thenew procedure is (1) "implicit in the concept of ordered lib-erty," implicating "fundamental fairness," and (2) "central toan accurate determination of innocence or guilt," such thatits absence "creates an impermissibly large risk that the innocent will be convicted." Id., at 311-313 (plurality opinion)(internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of adeath sentence, where the matter is not one of "innocence orguilt," the second criterion asks whether the new procedureis "central to an accurate determination" that death is alegally appropriate punishment. Id., at 313 (emphasisadded). See Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 244 (1990);O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U. S. 151, 171, n. 3 (1997) (Stevens, J., dissenting).The majority does not deny that Ring meets the first criterion, that its holding is "implicit in the concept of orderedliberty." Cf. Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 499(2000) (Scalia, J., concurring) (absent Apprendi's rule jurytrial right "has no intelligible content"); Ring, supra, at 610(Scalia, J., concurring) (Apprendi involves the fundamentalmeaning of the jury trial guarantee); Blakely v. Washington,ante, at 301-302 (tracing Apprendi's conception of the jurytrial right back to Blackstone); Duncan v. Louisiana, 391U. S. 145, 157-158 (1968) (Sixth Amendment jury trial guarantee is a "fundamental right"). Rather, the majority focuses on whether Ring meets the second criterion: Is its rule"central to an accurate determination" that death is a legallyappropriate punishment? Teague, supra, at 313.542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN360 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLINBreyer, J., dissentingAs I explained in my separate concurrence in Ring, Ibelieve the Eighth Amendment demands the use of a juryin capital sentencing because a death sentence must reflecta community-based judgment that the sentence constitutesproper retribution. See 536 U. S., at 614 (opinion concurringin judgment); see alsoHarris v. Alabama, 513 U. S. 504, 515-526 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Spaziano v. Florida, 468U. S. 447, 467-490 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part anddissenting in part). And a jury is significantly more likelythan a judge to "express the conscience of the communityon the ultimate question of life or death."Witherspoon v.Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, 519 (1968). As Justice Stevens haspointed out:"Juries--comprised as they are of a fair cross sectionof the community--are more representative institutionsthan is the judiciary; they reflect more accurately thecomposition and experiences of the community as awhole, and inevitably make decisions based on commu-nity values more reliably, than can that segment of thecommunity that is selected for service on the bench."Spaziano, supra, at 486-487 (footnote omitted).On this view of the matter, the right to have jury sentencingin the capital context is both a fundamental aspect of constitutional liberty and also significantly more likely to producean accurate assessment of whether death is the appropriatepunishment.But my view is not theRing majority's view. The majority held only that the jury must decide whether the specialaggravating factors that make the offendereligible for deathare present. 536 U. S., at 603-609. And it rested its decision that a jury, not a judge, must make that determinationupon the Court's Sixth Amendment holding in Apprendi that"any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond theprescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury,and proved beyond a reasonable doubt," 530 U. S., at 490.542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN361Cite as: 542 U. S. 348 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingIn this case, the majority says that Ring's Apprendi-related rule cannot satisfyTeague's accuracy-enhancing requirement, for two reasons. First, it points out that for"every argument why juries are more accurate factfinders,there is another why they are less accurate." Ante, at 356.Hence, one cannot say "confidently" that "judicial factfindingseriously diminishes accuracy." Ibid. (emphasis in original).Second, it relies on DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968)(per curiam), the case in which this Court consideredwhether Duncan v. Louisiana, supra, which extended theSixth Amendment jury trial guarantee to the States, shouldapply retroactively. The Court decided that Duncan shouldnot have retroactive effect. "If," the majority concludes,"a trial held entirely without a jury was not impermissiblyinaccurate, it is hard to see how a trial in which a judge findsonly aggravating factors could be." Ante, at 357.The majority, however, overlooks three additional considerations that lead me to the opposite conclusion.First, the factfinder's role in determining the applicabilityof aggravating factors in a death case is a special role thatcan involve, not simply the finding of brute facts, but also themaking of death-related, community-based value judgments.The leading single aggravator charged in Arizona, for example, requires the factfinder to decide whether the crime wascommitted in an "especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner." Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-703(F)(6) (West Supp.2003); see Office of Attorney General, State of Arizona, Capital Case Commission Final Report (2002). Three of theother four Ring-affected States use a similar aggravator.See Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 18-1.3-1201(5)( j) (Lexis 2003); IdahoCode $ 19-2515(9)(e) (Lexis Supp. 2003); Neb. Rev. Stat.$ 29-2523(1)(d) (1995). Words like "especially heinous, ""cruel," or "depraved"--particularly when asked in the context of a death sentence proceeding--require reference tocommunity-based standards, standards that incorporate values. (Indeed, Nebraska's standard explicitly asks the fact542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN362 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLINBreyer, J., dissentingfinder to assess the defendant's conduct in light of "ordinarystandards of morality and intelligence." Ibid.) A jury isbetter equipped than a judge to identify and to apply thosestandards accurately. See supra, at 360.Second, Teague's basic purpose strongly favors retroactiveapplication of Ring 's rule. Teague's retroactivity principlesreflect the Court's effort to balance competing considerations. See 489 U. S., at 309-313; Mackey v. United States,401 U. S. 667, 675 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in two judgments and dissenting in one); Desist v. United States, 394U. S. 244, 256 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting). On the onehand, interests related to certain of the Great Writ's basicobjectives--protecting the innocent against erroneous conviction or punishment and assuring fundamentally fair procedures--favor applying a new procedural rule retroactively.Teague, supra, at 312-313; Mackey, 401 U. S., at 693-694.So too does the legal system's commitment to "equal justice"--i. e., to "assur[ing] a uniformity of ultimate treatmentamong prisoners." Id., at 689.Where death-sentence-related factfinding is at issue, theseconsiderations have unusually strong force. This Court hasmade clear that in a capital case "the Eighth Amendmentrequires a greater degree of accuracy . . . than would betrue in a noncapital case." Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S. 333,342 (1993). Hence, the risk of error that the law can tolerate is correspondingly diminished. At the same time,the "qualitative difference of death from all other punishments"--namely, its severity and irrevocability--"requires acorrespondingly greater degree of scrutiny of the capitalsentencing determination" than of other criminal judgments.California v. Ramos, 463 U. S. 992, 998-999 (1983); see alsoSpaziano, 468 U. S., at 468 (Stevens, J., concurring in partand dissenting in part) (the Eighth Amendment mandatesspecial safeguards to ensure that death is "a justified response to a given offense"); Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68,542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN363Cite as: 542 U. S. 348 (2004)Breyer, J., dissenting87 (1985) (Burger, C. J., concurring in judgment) ("In capitalcases the finality of the sentence imposed warrants protections that may or may not be required in other cases").Consider, too, the law's commitment to uniformity.Mackey, supra, at 689. Is treatment "uniform" when twooffenders each have been sentenced to death through the useof procedures that we now know violate the Constitution--but one is allowed to go to his death while the other receivesa new, constitutionally proper sentencing proceeding? Outside the capital sentencing context, one might understandthe nature of the difference that the word "finality" implies:One prisoner is already serving a final sentence, the other'shas not yet begun. But a death sentence is different in thatit seems to be, and it is, an entirely future event--an eventnot yet undergone by either prisoner. And in respect tothat event, both prisoners are, in every important respect, inthe same position. I understand there is a "finality-based"difference. But given the dramatically different nature ofdeath, that difference diminishes in importance.Certainly the ordinary citizen will not understand the difference. That citizen will simply witness two individuals,both sentenced through the use of unconstitutional procedures, one individual going to his death, the other saved, allthrough an accident of timing. How can the Court squarethis spectacle with what it has called the "vital importanceto the defendant and to the community that any decision toimpose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based onreason"? Beck v. Alabama, 447 U. S. 625, 637-638 (1980)(internal quotation marks omitted).Justice Scalia's observation, in his concurring opinionin Ring, underscores the point. He wrote there that "therepeated spectacle of a man's going to his death becausea judge found that an aggravating factor existed" wouldundermine "our people's traditional . . . veneration for theprotection of the jury in criminal cases." 536 U. S., at 612(emphasis in original). If that is so, it is equally so whether542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN364 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLINBreyer, J., dissentingthe judge found that aggravating factor before or afterRing.On the other hand, Teague recognizes that important in-terests argue against, and indeed generally forbid, retroactive application of new procedural rules. These interests in-clude the "interest in insuring that there will at some pointbe the certainty that comes with an end to litigation"; thedesirability of assuring that "attention will ultimately be fo-cused not on whether a conviction was free from error butrather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a usefulplace in the community"; and the fact that society does nothave endless resources to spend upon retrials, which (wherewitnesses have become unavailable and other evidence stale)may well produce unreliable results. Mackey, supra, at690-691 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Teague,489 U. S., at 308-310. Comity interests and respect forstate autonomy point in the same direction. See id., at 308;Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 128, n. 33 (1982).Certain of these interests are unusually weak where capital sentencing proceedings are at issue. Retroactivity here,for example, would not require inordinate expenditure ofstate resources. A decision making Ring retroactive wouldaffect approximately 110 individuals on death row. CourtHears Arguments in Latest Death Case, N. Y. L. J., Apr. 20,2004, p. 5. This number, however large in absolute terms,is small compared with the approximately 1.2 million individuals presently confined in state prisons. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics Bulletin, Prisoner and JailInmates at Midyear 2003, p. 2 (May 2004). Consequently,the impact on resources is likely to be much less than ifa rule affecting the ordinary criminal process were maderetroactive.Further, where the issue is "life or death," the concernthat "attention . . . ultimately" should be focused "on whetherthe prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community" is barely relevant. Mackey, 401 U. S., at 690 (internal542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN365Cite as: 542 U. S. 348 (2004)Breyer, J., dissentingquotation marks omitted). Finally, I believe we should discount ordinary finality interests in a death case, for thoseinterests are comparative in nature and death-related collateral proceedings, in any event, may stretch on for manyyears regardless. Cf. Teague, supra, at 321, n. 3 (Stevens,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("A majorreason that Justice Harlan espoused limited retroactivity incollateral proceedings was the interest in making convictionsfinal, an interest that is wholly inapplicable to the capitalsentencing context").Third, DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U. S. 631 (1968) (per curiam), fails to give the majority the support for which ithopes. DeStefano did decide that Duncan's holding--thatthe Sixth Amendment jury trial right applies to the States--should not have retroactive effect. But the Court decidedDeStefano before Teague. And it explicitly took into account "(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards,(b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authoritieson the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administrationof justice of a retroactive application of the new standards."392 U. S., at 633 (internal quotation marks omitted).The latter two factors, "reliance" and "effect on the administration of justice," argued strongly against retroactivity.Retroactivity there, unlike here, would have thrown theprison doors open wide--at least in Louisiana and possiblyin other States as well. Id., at 634. The Court believedthat the first factor--"the purpose to be served by the newstandards"--also favored prospective application only. Butthe Court described that purpose broadly, as "prevent[ing] arbitrariness and repression"; it recognized that somejudge-only trials might have been fair; and it concluded thatthe values served by the jury trial guarantee "would notmeasurably be served by requiring retrial of all persons convicted in the past" without a jury. Id., at 633-634 (emphasis added).542US2 Unit: $U70 [10-25-06 15:08:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN366 SCHRIRO v. SUMMERLINBreyer, J., dissentingBy contrast, this case involves only a small subclass of de-fendants deprived of jury trial rights, the relevant harmwithin that subclass is more widespread, the administrationof justice problem is far less serious, and the reliance interestless weighty. For these reasons, I believe the DeStefanoCourt would have come out differently had it been considering Ring 's rule. Insofar as DeStefano has any relevancehere, it highlights the importance, when making retroactivity decisions, of taking account of the considerations that un-derlieTeague's categorical rules. And, as shown above,those considerations argue in favor of retroactivity in thiscase. See supra, at 362-365.As I have pointed out, the majority does not deny thatRing's rule makes some contribution to greater accuracy. Itsimply is unable to say "confidently" that the absence ofRing's rule creates an " ` "impermissibly large risk" ' " thatthe death penalty was improperly imposed. Ante, at 356.For the reasons stated, I believe that the risk is one that thelaw need not and should not tolerate. Judged in light ofTeague's basic purpose, Ring's requirement that a jury, andnot a judge, must apply the death sentence aggravators announces a watershed rule of criminal procedure that shouldbe applied retroactively in habeas proceedings.I respectfully dissent.542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN367OCTOBER TERM, 2003SyllabusCHENEY, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDSTATES,et al. v.

Argued April 27, 2004--Decided June 24, 2004The President established the National Energy Policy Development Group(Group) to give him advice and make recommendations on energy policy,assigning a number of federal agency heads and assistants to serve asGroup members and authorizing the Vice President, as Group chairman,to include other federal officers as appropriate. After the Group issueda final report and, according to the Government, terminated all operations, respondents filed these separate actions, later consolidated in theDistrict Court, alleging that the Group had not complied with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), which, inter alia, imposes a variety of open-meeting and disclosure requirements on entities meeting thedefinition of "advisory committee." As relevant here, such a committeeis an entity or "subgroup . . . , which is . . . established or utilized bythe President, . . . exclud[ing] . . . any committee . . . composed whollyof full-time, or permanent part-time, [federal] officers or employees." 5U. S. C. App. $ 2(B)(i). The complaint alleged that, because nonfederalemployees and private lobbyists regularly attended and fully participated in the Group's nonpublic meetings as de facto Group members,the Group could not benefit from the $ 2(B) exemption and was thereforesubject to FACA's requirements. The suit sought declaratory relief andan injunction requiring the defendants--including the Vice Presidentand the Government officials serving on the Group--to produce all materials allegedly subject to FACA's requirements.Among its rulings, the District Court granted the defendants' motionto dismiss as to some of them, but denied it as to others. The Courtheld that FACA's substantive requirements could be enforced againstthe Vice President and the other Government participants under theMandamus Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1361, and against the agency defendantsunder the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706. It deferredruling on whether the FACA disclosure duty was sufficiently clear andnondiscretionary for mandamus to issue. It also deferred ruling on theGovernment's contention that to disregard the $ 2(B) exemption andapply FACA to the Group would violate separation-of-powers principles542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 CHENEY v.

Instead, the court allowed respondents to conduct a"tightly-reined" discovery to ascertain the Group's structure and membership, and thus to determine whether the de facto membership doctrine applied. While acknowledging that discovery itself might raiseserious constitutional questions, the court explained that the Government could assert executive privilege to protect sensitive materialsfrom disclosure. The court noted that if, after discovery, respondentshad no evidentiary support for their allegations about de facto membersin the Group, the Government could prevail on statutory grounds.Even were it appropriate to address constitutional issues, the court explained, its discovery orders would provide the factual development necessary to determine the extent of the alleged intrusion into the Executive's constitutional authority. The court then ordered respondents tosubmit a discovery plan, approved that plan in due course, enteredorders allowing discovery to proceed, and denied the Government'smotion for certification under 28 U.

C. $ 1292(b) with respect to thediscovery orders.Petitioners sought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals tovacate the discovery orders and for other relief, but the court dismissedthe mandamus petition on the ground that alternative avenues of reliefremained available.

S. 683, thecourt held that petitioners, in order to guard against intrusion into thePresident's prerogatives, must first assert executive privilege with particularity in the District Court. If the lower court sustained the privilege, the appeals court observed, petitioners would be able to obtainall the relief they sought; but if the District Court rejected the claim,mandamus might well be appropriate. So long as the separation-ofpowers conflict remained hypothetical, the court held, it had no authority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus. Although acknowledging that the scope of respondents' discovery requests wasoverly broad, the appeals court nonetheless agreed with the DistrictCourt that petitioners should bear the burden of invoking executiveprivilege and of objecting to the discovery orders with detailedprecision.Held:1. Respondents' preliminary argument that the mandamus petitionwas jurisdictionally out of time is rejected. Respondents assert that,because the Government's basic argument was one of discovery immunity--i. e., it need not invoke executive privilege or make particular objections to the discovery requests--the mandamus petition should havebeen filed within 60 days after the District Court denied the motion to542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN369Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Syllabusdismiss under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(B). On thistheory, the last day for any filing in the appeals court was September 9,2002, whereas the mandamus petition and notice of appeal were not fileduntil November 7. However, Rule 4(a), by its plain terms, applies onlyto the filing of a notice of appeal. It is inapplicable to the mandamuspetition under the All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651. Respondents' alternative argument that the mandamus petition was barred by the equitable doctrine of laches also fails. Laches might be a bar where the petitioner slept on his rights and especially if the delay was prejudicial.Chapman v. County of Douglas, 107 U. S. 348, 355. Here, however, theflurry of motions the Government filed after the District Court deniedthe dismissal motion overcomes respondents' argument. Nor does theCourt accept their argument that laches should apply because thoseGovernment motions amounted to little more than dilatory tactics.Given the drastic nature of mandamus and this Court's holdings that thewrit may not issue while alternative avenues of relief remain available,the Government cannot be faulted for attempting to resolve the disputethrough less drastic means. Pp. 378-380.2. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding it lacked authority toissue mandamus because the Government could protect its rights byasserting executive privilege in the District Court. Pp. 380-392.(a) Mandamus is a "drastic and extraordinary" remedy "reservedfor really extraordinary causes." Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S. 258, 259-260. While the conditions for obtaining it may be demanding, they arenot insuperable. This Court has issued mandamus to, inter alia, restrain a lower court whose actions would threaten the separation ofpowers by embarrassing the Executive Branch. Ex parte Peru, 318U. S. 578, 588. Were the Vice President not a party, the argument thatthe Court of Appeals should have entertained a mandamus action mightpresent different considerations. Here, however, the Vice Presidentand his Group comembers are the subjects of the discovery orders. Themandamus petition alleges that the orders threaten substantial intrusions on the process by which those closest to the President advise him.These facts and allegations remove this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory appellate review is unavailable, through mandamus or otherwise. A President's communicationsand activities encompass a vastly wider range of sensitive material thanwould be true of any ordinary individual. Nixon, 418 U. S., at 715.While the President is not above the law, the Judiciary must affordPresidential confidentiality the greatest possible protection, ibid., recognizing the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch fromvexatious litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties. These separation-of-powers consid542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN370 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Syllabuserations should inform a court of appeals' evaluation of a mandamuspetition involving the President or the Vice President. Accepted mandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court to prevent a lowercourt from interfering with a coequal branch's ability to discharge itsconstitutional responsibilities. See Ex parte Peru, supra, at 587.Pp. 380-382.(b) The Court of Appeals labored under the mistaken assumptionthat the assertion of executive privilege is a necessary precondition tothe Government's separation-of-powers objections. In its view, the requirement that the Vice President and his Group colleagues bear theburden of invoking executive privilege with narrow specificity and objecting to the discovery requests with detailed precision was mandatedby Nixon's rejection of an "absolute, unqualified Presidential privilegeof immunity from judicial process under all circumstances," 418 U. S.,at 706. The appeals court's analysis overlooks fundamental differencesbetween this case and Nixon, which cannot bear the weight the courtput on it. Unlike this case, which concerns requests for informationfor use in a civil suit, Nixon involved the proper balance between theExecutive's interest in the confidentiality of its communications and the"constitutional need for production of relevant evidence in a criminalproceeding." Id., at 713. The distinction between criminal and civilproceedings is not just a matter of formalism in this context. The rightto production of relevant evidence in civil proceedings does not have thesame "constitutional dimensions" as it does in the criminal context. Id.,at 711. Withholding necessary materials in an ongoing criminal caseconstitutes an impermissible impairment of another branch's "essentialfunctions." Ibid. Withholding the information in this case does nothamper such "essential functions" in quite the same way. The DistrictCourt ordered discovery here, not to remedy known statutory violations, but to ascertain whether FACA's disclosure requirements applyto the Group at all. This situation cannot, in fairness, be compared toNixon, where a court's ability to fulfill its constitutional responsibilityto resolve cases and controversies within its jurisdiction hinged on theavailability of certain indispensable information. Another importantfactor here is the burden imposed by the discovery orders. This is nota routine discovery dispute. The discovery requests are directed to theVice President and other senior Government officials who served onthe Group to give advice and make recommendations to the President.Special considerations control when the Executive's interests in maintaining its autonomy and safeguarding its communications' confidentiality are implicated. See, e. g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U. S. 681, 707. Evenwhen compared against Nixon's criminal subpoenas involving the President, the civil discovery here militates against respondents' position.542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN371Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)SyllabusThere are no checks in civil discovery analogous to the constraints imposed in the criminal justice system to filter out insubstantial legalclaims. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 sanctions and private attorneys' obligation of candor to the judicial tribunal have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the ExecutiveBranch. Finally, the narrowly tailored subpoena orders in Nixon,which "precisely identified" and "specific[ally] . . . enumerated" the relevant materials, 418 U. S., at 688, and n. 5, stand in marked contrast tothe overly broad discovery requests approved by the District Court.Given that disparity, this Court's precedents provide no support for theappeals court's requirement that the Executive Branch bear the burdenof invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of makingparticularized objections. Indeed, those precedents suggest just theopposite. See, e. g., Clinton, supra, at 705. Contrary to their conclusions, Nixon did not leave the lower courts the sole option of invitingthe Executive Branch to invoke executive privilege. Rather, they couldhave narrowed the scope of the discovery orders on their own. In deciding whether to issue mandamus, the Court of Appeals must not onlydetermine whether there are exceptional circumstances amounting to ajudicial usurpation of power, Will v. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95, or a"clear abuse of discretion," Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland,346 U. S. 379, 383, but must also ask whether the District Court's actionsconstituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of its constitutional duties. Pp. 383-391.(c) Absent overriding concerns such as the need to avoid piecemeallitigation, see Schlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 111, the Courtdeclines to direct the Court of Appeals to issue mandamus against theDistrict Court. This is not a case where, having considered the issues,the appeals court abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ. Instead, it relied on its mistaken reading of Nixon and prematurely terminated its inquiry without even reaching the weighty separation-ofpowers objections raised in the case or exercising its discretion todetermine whether mandamus is appropriate under the circumstances.Because issuance of the writ is vested in the discretion of the court towhich the petition is made, this Court leaves it to the Court of Appealsto address the parties' arguments and other matters bearing on whethermandamus should issue, bearing in mind the burdens imposed on theExecutive Branch in any future proceedings. Special considerationsapplicable to the President and the Vice President suggest that thelower courts should be sensitive to Government requests for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, e. g., whether the statute embodies the defacto membership doctrine.

TheGroup was directed to "develo[p] . . . a national energy policydesigned to help the private sector, and government at alllevels, promote dependable, affordable, and environmentallysound production and distribution of energy for the future."App. 156-157. The President assigned a number of agencyheads and assistants--all employees of the Federal Govern-ment--to serve as members of the committee. He authorized the Vice President, as chairman of the Group, to invite"other officers of the Federal Government" to participate "asappropriate." Id., at 157. Five months later, the NEPDGissued a final report and, according to the Government, terminated all operations.Following publication of the report, respondents JudicialWatch, Inc., and the Sierra Club filed these separate actions,which were later consolidated in the District Court. Respondents alleged the NEPDG had failed to comply with theprocedural and disclosure requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA or Act), 5 U. S. C. App. $ 2, p. 1.FACA was enacted to monitor the "numerous committees,boards, commissions, councils, and similar groups [that] havebeen established to advise officers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government," $ 2(a), and to pre-vent the "wasteful expenditure of public funds" that mayresult from their proliferation, Public Citizen v. Departmentof Justice, 491 U. S. 440, 453 (1989). Subject to specific exemptions, FACA imposes a variety of open-meeting and dis-closure requirements on groups that meet the definition ofan "advisory committee." As relevant here, an "advisorycommittee" means542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D.

S. C. App. $ 3(2), p. 2.Respondents do not dispute the President appointed onlyFederal Government officials to the NEPDG. They agreethat the NEPDG, as established by the President in hismemorandum, was "composed wholly of full-time, or permanent part-time, officers or employees of the Federal Govern-ment." Ibid. The complaint alleges, however, that "nonfederal employees," including "private lobbyists," "regularlyattended and fully participated in non-public meetings."App. 21 (Judicial Watch Complaint || 25). Relying on Asso-ciation of American Physicians & Surgeons, Inc. v. Clinton, 997 F. 2d 898 (CADC 1993) (AAPS), respondents con-tend that the regular participation of the non-Governmentindividuals made them de facto members of the committee.According to the complaint, their "involvement and role arefunctionally indistinguishable from those of the other [for-mal] members."Id., at 915. As a result, respondentsargue, the NEPDG cannot benefit from the Act's exemptionunder subsection B and is subject to FACA's requirements.Vice President Cheney, the NEPDG, the Government officials who served on the committee, and the alleged de factomembers were named as defendants. The suit seeks declaratory relief and an injunction requiring them to produce allmaterials allegedly subject to FACA's requirements.All defendants moved to dismiss. The District Courtgranted the motion in part and denied it in part. The courtacknowledged FACA does not create a private cause of ac-tion. On this basis, it dismissed respondents' claims against542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN375Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the Courtthe non-Government defendants. Because the NEPDG hadbeen dissolved, it could not be sued as a defendant; and theclaims against it were dismissed as well. The District Courtheld, however, that FACA's substantive requirements couldbe enforced against the Vice President and other Govern-ment participants on the NEPDG under the Mandamus Act,28 U. S. C. $ 1361, and against the agency defendants underthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C. $ 706.The District Court recognized the disclosure duty must beclear and nondiscretionary for mandamus to issue, and theremust be, among other things, "final agency actions" for theAPA to apply. According to the District Court, it was premature to decide these questions. It held only that respondents had alleged sufficient facts to keep the Vice Presidentand the other defendants in the case.The District Court deferred ruling on the Government'scontention that to disregard the exemption and apply FACAto the NEPDG would violate principles of separation of powers and interfere with the constitutional prerogatives of thePresident and the Vice President. Instead, the court allowed respondents to conduct a "tightly-reined" discovery toascertain the NEPDG's structure and membership, and thusto determine whether the de facto membership doctrine applies. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. National Energy Policy Dev.Group, 219 F. Supp. 2d 20, 54 (DC 2002). While acknowledging that discovery itself might raise serious constitutionalquestions, the District Court explained that the Governmentcould assert executive privilege to protect sensitive materials from disclosure. In the District Court's view, these "issues of executive privilege will be much more limited inscope than the broad constitutional challenge raised by thegovernment." Id., at 55. The District Court adopted thisapproach in an attempt to avoid constitutional questions, noting that if, after discovery, respondents have no evidentiarysupport for the allegations about the regular participationby lobbyists and industry executives on the NEPDG, the542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN376 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Opinion of the CourtGovernment can prevail on statutory grounds. Further-more, the District Court explained, even were it appropriateto address constitutional issues, some factual development isnecessary to determine the extent of the alleged intrusioninto the Executive's constitutional authority. The court de-nied in part the motion to dismiss and ordered respondentsto submit a discovery plan.In due course the District Court approved respondents'discovery plan, entered a series of orders allowing discoveryto proceed, see CADC App. 238, 263, 364 (reproducing ordersentered on Sept. 9, Oct. 17, and Nov. 1, 2002), and deniedthe Government's motion for certification under 28 U. S. C.$ 1292(b) with respect to the discovery orders. Petitionerssought a writ of mandamus in the Court of Appeals to vacatethe discovery orders, to direct the District Court to rule onthe basis of the administrative record, and to dismiss theVice President from the suit. The Vice President also fileda notice of appeal from the same orders. See Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949); UnitedStates v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974).A divided panel of the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for a writ of mandamus and the Vice President's attempted interlocutory appeal. In re Cheney, 334 F. 3d 1096(CADC 2003). With respect to mandamus, the majority declined to issue the writ on the ground that alternative avenues of relief remained available. Citing United States v.Nixon, supra, the majority held that petitioners, to guardagainst intrusion into the President's prerogatives, must firstassert privilege. Under its reading of Nixon, moreover,privilege claims must be made " `with particularity.' " 334F. 3d, at 1104. In the majority's view, if the District Courtsustains the privilege, petitioners will be able to obtain allthe relief they seek. If the District Court rejects the claimof executive privilege and creates "an imminent risk of disclosure of allegedly protected presidential communications,""mandamus might well be appropriate to avoid letting `the542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN377Cite as: 542 U.

"But so long asthe separation of powers conflict that petitioners anticipateremains hypothetical," the panel held, "we have no authorityto exercise the extraordinary remedy of mandamus." Id., at1105. The majority acknowledged the scope of respondents'requests is overly broad, because it seeks far more than the"limited items" to which respondents would be entitled if"the district court ultimately determines that the NEPDGis subject to FACA." Id., at 1105-1106; id., at 1106 ("Therequests to produce also go well beyond FACA's requirements"); ibid. ("[Respondents'] discovery also goes well beyond what they need to prove"). It nonetheless agreed withthe District Court that petitioners " `shall bear the burden' "of invoking executive privilege and filing objections to thediscovery orders with " `detailed precision.' " Id., at 1105(quoting Aug. 2, 2002, Order).For similar reasons, the majority rejected the Vice President's interlocutory appeal. In United States v. Nixon, theCourt held that the President could appeal an interlocutorysubpoena order without having "to place himself in the posture of disobeying an order of a court merely to trigger theprocedural mechanism for review." 418 U. S., at 691. Themajority, however, found the case inapplicable because VicePresident Cheney, unlike then-President Nixon, had not yetasserted privilege. In the majority's view, the Vice President was not forced to choose between disclosure and suffering contempt for failure to obey a court order. The majorityheld that to require the Vice President to assert privilegedoes not create the unnecessary confrontation between twobranches of Government described in Nixon.Judge Randolph filed a dissenting opinion. In his viewAAPS ' de facto membership doctrine is mistaken, and theConstitution bars its application to the NEPDG. Allowingdiscovery to determine the applicability of the de facto membership doctrine, he concluded, is inappropriate. He would542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 CHENEY v.

We nowvacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand thecase for further proceedings to reconsider the Government'smandamus petition.IIAs a preliminary matter, we address respondents' argument that the Government's petition for a writ of mandamuswas jurisdictionally out of time or, alternatively, barred bythe equitable doctrine of laches. According to respondents,because the Government's basic argument was one of discovery immunity--that is, it need not invoke executive privilegeor make particular objections to the discovery requests--themandamus petition should have been filed with the Court ofAppeals within 60 days after the District Court denied theGovernment's motion to dismiss. See Fed. Rule App. Proc.4(a)(1)(B) ("When the United States or its officer or agencyis a party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any partywithin 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from isentered"). On this theory, the last day for making any filingto the Court of Appeals was September 9, 2002. The Government, however, did not file the mandamus petition andthe notice of appeal until November 7, four months after theDistrict Court issued the order that, under respondents'view, commenced the time for appeal.As even respondents acknowledge, however, Rule 4(a), byits plain terms, applies only to the filing of a notice of appeal.Brief for Respondent Sierra Club 23. Rule 4(a) is inapplicable to the Government's mandamus petition under the AllWrits Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651. Because we vacate the Courtof Appeals' judgment and remand the case for further proceedings for the court to consider whether a writ of mandamus should have issued, we need not decide whether the VicePresident also could have appealed the District Court's or542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN379Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the Courtders under Nixon and the collateral order doctrine. We ex-press no opinion on whether the Vice President's notice ofappeal was timely filed.Respondents' argument that the mandamus petition wasbarred by laches does not withstand scrutiny. Laches mightbar a petition for a writ of mandamus if the petitioner "sleptupon his rights . . . , and especially if the delay has beenprejudicial to the [other party], or to the rights of other per-sons."Chapman v. County of Douglas, 107 U. S. 348, 355(1883). Here, the flurry of activity following the DistrictCourt's denial of the motion to dismiss overcomes respondents' argument that the Government neglected to assert itsrights. The Government filed, among other papers, a motion for a protective order on September 3; a motion to staypending appeal on October 21; and a motion for leave toappeal pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 1292(b) on October 23. Evenwere we to agree that the baseline for measuring the timeliness of the Government's mandamus petition was theDistrict Court's order denying the motion to dismiss, theGovernment's active litigation posture was far from the neglect or delay that would make the application of lachesappropriate.We do not accept, furthermore, respondents' argumentthat laches should apply because the motions filed by theGovernment following the District Court's denial of its motion to dismiss amounted to little more than dilatory tacticsto "delay and obstruct the proceedings." Brief for Respondent Sierra Club 23. In light of the drastic nature of mandamus and our precedents holding that mandamus may notissue so long as alternative avenues of relief remain available, the Government cannot be faulted for attempting toresolve the dispute through less drastic means. The lawdoes not put litigants in the impossible position of having toexhaust alternative remedies before petitioning for mandamus, on the one hand, and having to file the mandamus petition at the earliest possible moment to avoid laches, on the542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN380 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Opinion of the Courtother. The petition was properly before the Court of Ap-peals for its consideration.IIIWe now come to the central issue in the case--whetherthe Court of Appeals was correct to conclude it "ha[d] noauthority to exercise the extraordinary remedy of manda-mus," 334 F. 3d, at 1105, on the ground that the Governmentcould protect its rights by asserting executive privilege inthe District Court.The common-law writ of mandamus against a lower courtis codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a): "The Supreme Court andall courts established by Act of Congress may issue all writsnecessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law."This is a "drastic and extraordinary" remedy "reserved forreally extraordinary causes." Ex parte Fahey, 332 U. S.258, 259-260 (1947). "The traditional use of the writ in aidof appellate jurisdiction both at common law and in the fed-eral courts has been to confine [the court against which mandamus is sought] to a lawful exercise of its prescribed juris-diction." Roche v. Evaporated Milk Assn., 319 U. S. 21, 26(1943). Although courts have not "confined themselves toan arbitrary and technical definition of `jurisdiction,' " Willv. United States, 389 U. S. 90, 95 (1967), "only exceptionalcircumstances amounting to a judicial `usurpation of power,' "ibid., or a "clear abuse of discretion," Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Holland, 346 U. S. 379, 383 (1953), "will jus-tify the invocation of this extraordinary remedy," Will, 389U. S., at 95.As the writ is one of "the most potent weapons in thejudicial arsenal," id., at 107, three conditions must be satis-fied before it may issue. Kerr v. United States Dist. Courtfor Northern Dist. of Cal., 426 U. S. 394, 403 (1976). First,"the party seeking issuance of the writ [must] have no otheradequate means to attain the relief he desires," ibid.--a con-dition designed to ensure that the writ will not be used as a542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN381Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the Courtsubstitute for the regular appeals process, Fahey, supra, at260. Second, the petitioner must satisfy " `the burden ofshowing that [his] right to issuance of the writ is "clear andindisputable." ' "Kerr, supra, at 403 (quoting BankersLife & Casualty Co., supra, at 384). Third, even if the firsttwo prerequisites have been met, the issuing court, in theexercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ isappropriate under the circumstances. Kerr, supra, at 403(citingSchlagenhauf v. Holder, 379 U. S. 104, 112, n. 8 (1964)).These hurdles, however demanding, are not insuperable.This Court has issued the writ to restrain a lower court whenits actions would threaten the separation of powers by "embarrass[ing] the executive arm of the Government," Ex partePeru, 318 U. S. 578, 588 (1943), or result in the "intrusionby the federal judiciary on a delicate area of federal-staterelations," Will, supra, at 95 (citing Maryland v. Soper(No. 1), 270 U. S. 9 (1926)).Were the Vice President not a party in the case, the argument that the Court of Appeals should have entertained anaction in mandamus, notwithstanding the District Court'sdenial of the motion for certification, might present differentconsiderations. Here, however, the Vice President and hiscomembers on the NEPDG are the subjects of the discoveryorders. The mandamus petition alleges that the ordersthreaten "substantial intrusions on the process by whichthose in closest operational proximity to the President advisethe President." App. 343. These facts and allegations remove this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory appellate review is unavailable,through mandamus or otherwise. It is well established that"a President's communications and activities encompass avastly wider range of sensitive material than would be trueof any `ordinary individual.' " United States v. Nixon, 418U. S., at 715. Chief Justice Marshall, sitting as a trial judge,recognized the unique position of the Executive Branch whenhe stated that "[i]n no case . . . would a court be required to542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN382 CHENEY v.

S.731, 749 (1982))); 520 U. S., at 710-724 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment). As United States v. Nixon explained,these principles do not mean that the "President is above thelaw." 418 U. S., at 715. Rather, they simply acknowledgethat the public interest requires that a coequal branch ofGovernment "afford Presidential confidentiality the greatestprotection consistent with the fair administration of justice,"ibid., and give recognition to the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from vexatious litigation thatmight distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties.These separation-of-powers considerations should inform acourt of appeals' evaluation of a mandamus petition involvingthe President or the Vice President. Accepted mandamusstandards are broad enough to allow a court of appeals toprevent a lower court from interfering with a coequalbranch's ability to discharge its constitutional responsibilities. See Ex parte Peru, supra, at 587 (recognizing jurisdiction to issue the writ because "the action of the politicalarm of the Government taken within its appropriate sphere[must] be promptly recognized, and . . . delay and inconvenience of a prolonged litigation [must] be avoided by prompttermination of the proceedings in the district court"); seealso Clinton v.

S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the CourtIVThe Court of Appeals dismissed these separati on-of-powers concerns. Relying onUnited States v. Nixon, itheld that even though respondents' discovery requests areoverbroad and "go well beyond FACA's requirements," theVice President and his former colleagues on the NEPDG" `shall bear the burden' " of invoking privilege with narrowspecificity and objecting to the discovery requests with " `detailed precision.' " 334 F. 3d, at 1105-1106. In its view, thisresult was required by Nixon's rejection of an "absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicialprocess under all circumstances." 418 U. S., at 706. IfNixon refused to recognize broad claims of confidentialitywhere the President had asserted executive privilege, themajority reasoned, Nixon must have rejected, a fortiori,petitioners' claim of discovery immunity where the privilegehas not even been invoked. According to the majority, be-cause the Executive Branch can invoke executive privilegeto maintain the separation of powers, mandamus relief ispremature.This analysis, however, overlooks fundamental differencesin the two cases.Nixon cannot bear the weight the Courtof Appeals puts upon it. First, unlike this case, which concerns respondents' requests for information for use in a civilsuit,Nixon involves the proper balance between the Execu-tive's interest in the confidentiality of its communications andthe "constitutional need for production of relevant evidencein a criminal proceeding."Id., at 713. The Court's decisionwas explicit that it was "not . . . concerned with the balancebetween the President's generalized interest in confidentiality and the need for relevant evidence in civil litigation . . . .We address only the conflict between the President's assertion of a generalized privilege of confidentiality and the con-stitutional need for relevant evidence in criminal trials."Id., at 712, n. 19.542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN384 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Opinion of the CourtThe distinction Nixon drew between criminal and civilproceedings is not just a matter of formalism. As the Courtexplained, the need for information in the criminal contextis much weightier because "our historic[al] commitment tothe rule of law . . . is nowhere more profoundly manifest thanin our view that `the twofold aim [of criminal justice] is thatguilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.' " Id., at 708-709(quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 88 (1935)). Inlight of the "fundamental" and "comprehensive" need for"every man's evidence" in the criminal justice system, 418U. S., at 709, 710, not only must the Executive Branch firstassert privilege to resist disclosure, but privilege claims thatshield information from a grand jury proceeding or a criminal trial are not to be "expansively construed, for they arein derogation of the search for truth," id., at 710. The needfor information for use in civil cases, while far from negligible, does not share the urgency or significance of the criminalsubpoena requests in Nixon. As Nixon recognized, theright to production of relevant evidence in civil proceedingsdoes not have the same "constitutional dimensions." Id.,at 711.The Court also observed in Nixon that a "primary constitutional duty of the Judicial Branch [is] to do justice in criminal prosecutions." Id., at 707. Withholding materials froma tribunal in an ongoing criminal case when the informationis necessary to the court in carrying out its tasks "conflict[s]with the function of the courts under Art. III." Ibid. Suchan impairment of the "essential functions of [another]branch," ibid., is impermissible. Withholding the information in this case, however, does not hamper another branch'sability to perform its "essential functions" in quite the sameway. Ibid. The District Court ordered discovery here, notto remedy known statutory violations, but to ascertainwhether FACA's disclosure requirements even apply to theNEPDG in the first place. Even if FACA embodies important congressional objectives, the only consequence from re542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN385Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the Courtspondents' inability to obtain the discovery they seek is thatit would be more difficult for private complainants to vindicate Congress' policy objectives under FACA. And even if,for argument's sake, the reasoning in Judge Randolph's dissenting opinion in the end is rejected and FACA's statutoryobjectives would be to some extent frustrated, it does notfollow that a court's Article III authority or Congress' central Article I powers would be impaired. The situation herecannot, in fairness, be compared toNixon, where a court'sability to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to resolvecases and controversies within its jurisdiction hinges on theavailability of certain indispensable information.A party's need for information is only one facet of theproblem. An important factor weighing in the opposite direction is the burden imposed by the discovery orders. Thisis not a routine discovery dispute. The discovery requestsare directed to the Vice President and other senior Government officials who served on the NEPDG to give advice andmake recommendations to the President. The ExecutiveBranch, at its highest level, is seeking the aid of the courts toprotect its constitutional prerogatives. As we have alreadynoted, special considerations control when the ExecutiveBranch's interests in maintaining the autonomy of its officeand safeguarding the confidentiality of its communicationsare implicated. This Court has held, on more than one occasion, that "[t]he high respect that is owed to the office of theChief Executive . . . is a matter that should inform the conduct of the entire proceeding, including the timing and scopeof discovery," Clinton, 520 U. S., at 707, and that the Executive's "constitutional responsibilities and status [are] factorscounseling judicial deference and restraint" in the conduct oflitigation against it, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 753.Respondents' reliance on cases that do not involve seniormembers of the Executive Branch, see, e. g., Kerr v. UnitedStates Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 426 U. S. 394(1976), is altogether misplaced.542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Opinion of the CourtEven when compared against United States v. Nixon'scriminal subpoenas, which did involve the President, the civildiscovery here militates against respondents' position. Theobservation inNixon that production of confidential information would not disrupt the functioning of the ExecutiveBranch cannot be applied in a mechanistic fashion to civillitigation. In the criminal justice system, there are variousconstraints, albeit imperfect, to filter out insubstantial legalclaims. The decision to prosecute a criminal case, for example, is made by a publicly accountable prosecutor subject tobudgetary considerations and under an ethical obligation, notonly to win and zealously to advocate for his client but alsoto serve the cause of justice. The rigors of the penal systemare also mitigated by the responsible exercise of prosecutorial discretion. In contrast, there are no analogous checksin the civil discovery process here. Although under FederalRule of Civil Procedure 11, sanctions are available, and private attorneys also owe an obligation of candor to the judicialtribunal, these safeguards have proved insufficient to discourage the filing of meritless claims against the ExecutiveBranch. "In view of the visibility of " the Offices of thePresident and the Vice President and "the effect of [their]actions on countless people," they are "easily identifiable target[s] for suits for civil damages." Nixon v. Fitzgerald,supra, at 753.Finally, the narrow subpoena orders in United States v.Nixon stand on an altogether different footing from theoverly broad discovery requests approved by the DistrictCourt in this case. The criminal subpoenas in Nixon wererequired to satisfy exacting standards of "(1) relevancy;(2) admissibility; (3) specificity." 418 U. S., at 700 (interpreting Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 17(c)). They were "not intendedto provide a means of discovery." 418 U. S., at 698. Theburden of showing these standards were met, moreover, fellon the party requesting the information. Id., at 699 ("[I]norder to require production prior to trial, the moving party542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the Courtmust show [that the applicable standards are met]"). InNixon, the Court addressed the issue of executive privilegeonly after having satisfied itself that the special prosecutorhad surmounted these demanding requirements. Id., at 698("If we sustained this [Rule 17(c)] challenge, there would beno occasion to reach the claim of privilege asserted with respect to the subpoenaed material"). The very specificity ofthe subpoena requests serves as an important safeguardagainst unnecessary intrusion into the operation of the Officeof the President.In contrast to Nixon's subpoena orders that "preciselyidentified" and "specific[ally] . . . enumerated" the relevantmaterials, id., at 688, and n. 5, the discovery requests here,as the panel majority acknowledged, ask for everythingunder the sky:"1. All documents identifying or referring to any staff,personnel, contractors, consultants or employees of theTask Force."2. All documents establishing or referring to anySub-Group."3. All documents identifying or referring to any staff,personnel, contractors, consultants or employees of anySub-Group."4. All documents identifying or referring to any otherpersons participating in the preparation of the Reportor in the activities of the Task Force or any Sub-Group."5. All documents concerning any communication relat-ing to the activities of the Task Force, the activities ofany Sub-Groups, or the preparation of the Report . . . ."6. All documents concerning any communication relat-ing to the activities of the Task Force, the activities ofSub-Groups, or the preparation of the Report betweenany person . . . and [a list of agencies]."

UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Opinion of the Courtis only the beginning. Respondents' "First Set of Interrog-atories" are similarly unbounded in scope.Id., at 224.Given the breadth of the discovery requests in this case com-pared to the narrow subpoena orders inUnited States v.Nixon, our precedent provides no support for the propositionthat the Executive Branch "shall bear the burden" of invoking executive privilege with sufficient specificity and of making particularized objections. 334 F. 3d, at 1105. To besure,Nixon held that the President cannot, through the assertion of a "broad [and] undifferentiated" need for confiden-tiality and the invocation of an "absolute, unqualified" executive privilege, withhold information in the face of subpoenaorders. 418 U. S., at 706, 707. It did so, however, only afterthe party requesting the information--the special prosecutor--had satisfied his burden of showing the propriety of therequests. Here, as the Court of Appeals acknowledged, thediscovery requests are anything but appropriate. They provide respondents all the disclosure to which they would beentitled in the event they prevail on the merits, and muchmore besides. In these circumstances, Nixon does not require the Executive Branch to bear the onus of critiquingthe unacceptable discovery requests line by line. Our precedents suggest just the opposite. See, e. g., Clinton v. Jones,520 U. S. 681 (1997); id., at 705 (holding that the Judiciarymay direct "appropriate process" to the Executive); Nixonv. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 753.The Government, however, did in fact object to the scopeof discovery and asked the District Court to narrow it insome way. Its arguments were ignored. See App. 167,181-183 (arguing "this case can be resolved far short of thewide-ranging inquiries plaintiffs have proposed" and suggesting alternatives to "limi[t]" discovery); id., at 232 ("Defendants object to the scope of plaintiffs' discovery requestsand to the undue burden imposed by them. The scope ofplaintiffs' requests is broader than that reasonably calculatedto lead to admissible evidence"); id., at 232, n. 10 ("We state542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN389Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the Courtour general objections here for purposes of clarity for therecord and to preclude any later argument that, by not including them here, those general objections have beenwaived"). In addition, the Government objected to the burden that would arise from the District Court's insistence thatthe Vice President winnow the discovery orders by assertingspecific claims of privilege and making more particular objections. Id., at 201 (Tr. of Status Hearing (Aug. 2, 2002)) (not-ing "concerns with disrupting the effective functioning of thepresidency and the vice-presidency"); id., at 274 ("[C]ompli-ance with the order of the court imposes a burden on theOffice of the Vice President. That is a real burden. If wehad completed and done everything that Your Honor hasasked us to do today that burden would be gone, but it wouldhave been realized"). These arguments, too, were rejected.See id., at 327, 329 (Nov. 1, 2002, Order) (noting that thecourt had, "on numerous occasions," rejected the Government's assertion "that court orders requiring [it] to respondin any fashion to [the] discovery requests creates an `unconstitutional burden' on the Executive Branch").Contrary to the District Court's and the Court of Appeals'conclusions, Nixon does not leave them the sole option ofinviting the Executive Branch to invoke executive privilegewhile remaining otherwise powerless to modify a party'soverly broad discovery requests. Executive privilege is anextraordinary assertion of power "not to be lightly invoked."United States v. Reynolds, 345 U. S. 1, 7 (1953). Once executive privilege is asserted, coequal branches of the Government are set on a collision course. The Judiciary is forcedinto the difficult task of balancing the need for informationin a judicial proceeding and the Executive's Article II prerogatives. This inquiry places courts in the awkward position of evaluating the Executive's claims of confidentialityand autonomy, and pushes to the fore difficult questions ofseparation of powers and checks and balances. These "occasion[s] for constitutional confrontation between the two542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN390 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Opinion of the Courtbranches" should be avoided whenever possible. UnitedStates v. Nixon, supra, at 692.In recognition of these concerns, there is sound precedentin the District of Columbia itself for district courts to exploreother avenues, short of forcing the Executive to invoke privi-lege, when they are asked to enforce against the ExecutiveBranch unnecessarily broad subpoenas. In United States v.Poindexter, 727 F. Supp. 1501 (1989), defendant Poindexter,on trial for criminal charges, sought to have the DistrictCourt enforce subpoena orders against President Reagan toobtain allegedly exculpatory materials. The Executive considered the subpoenas "unreasonable and oppressive." Id.,at 1503. Rejecting defendant's argument that the Executive must first assert executive privilege to narrow the subpoenas, the District Court agreed with the President that "itis undesirable as a matter of constitutional and public policyto compel a President to make his decision on privilege withrespect to a large array of documents." Ibid. The courtdecided to narrow, on its own, the scope of the subpoenas toallow the Executive "to consider whether to invoke executive privilege with respect to . . . a possibly smaller numberof documents following the narrowing of the subpoenas."Id., at 1504. This is but one example of the choices availableto the District Court and the Court of Appeals in this case.As we discussed at the outset, under principles of mandamus jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals may exercise itspower to issue the writ only upon a finding of "exceptionalcircumstances amounting to a judicial `usurpation of power,' "Will, 389 U. S., at 95, or a "clear abuse of discretion," Bankers Life, 346 U. S., at 383. As this case implicates the separation of powers, the Court of Appeals must also ask, as partof this inquiry, whether the District Court's actions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in theperformance of its constitutional duties. This is especiallyso here because the District Court's analysis of whethermandamus relief is appropriate should itself be constrained542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 542 U. S. 367 (2004)Opinion of the Courtby principles similar to those we have outlined, supra, at380-382, that limit the Court of Appeals' use of the remedy.The panel majority, however, failed to ask this question. In-stead, it labored under the mistaken assumption that the assertion of executive privilege is a necessary precondition tothe Government's separation-of-powers objections.VIn the absence of overriding concerns of the sort discussedin Schlagenhauf, 379 U. S., at 111 (discussing, among otherthings, the need to avoid "piecemeal litigation" and to settleimportant issues of first impression in areas where thisCourt bears special responsibility), we decline petitioners'invitation to direct the Court of Appeals to issue the writagainst the District Court. Moreover, this is not a casewhere, after having considered the issues, the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by failing to issue the writ. In-stead, the Court of Appeals, relying on its mistaken readingof United States v. Nixon, prematurely terminated its in-quiry after the Government refused to assert privilege anddid so without even reaching the weighty separation-of-powers objections raised in the case, much less exercised itsdiscretion to determine whether "the writ is appropriateunder the circumstances."Supra, at 381. Because the is-suance of the writ is a matter vested in the discretion of thecourt to which the petition is made, and because this Courtis not presented with an original writ of mandamus, see,e. g.,Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S., at 586, we leave to the Court ofAppeals to address the parties' arguments with respect tothe challenge to AAPS and the discovery orders. Othermatters bearing on whether the writ of mandamus shouldissue should also be addressed, in the first instance, by theCourt of Appeals after considering any additional briefs andarguments as it deems appropriate. We note only that allcourts should be mindful of the burdens imposed on the Ex-ecutive Branch in any future proceedings. Special consider542US2 Unit: $U71 [10-25-06 15:09:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN392 CHENEY v. UNITED STATES DIST. COURT FOR D. C.Stevens, J., concurringations applicable to the President and the Vice Presidentsuggest that the courts should be sensitive to requests bythe Government for interlocutory appeals to reexamine, forexample, whether the statute embodies thede facto membership doctrine.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the District ofColumbia is vacated, and the case is remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.
