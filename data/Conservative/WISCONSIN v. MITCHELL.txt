Court.Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim on account of the victim's race. The question presentedin this case is whether this penalty enhancement is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

MITCHELLOpinion of the Courtcomplex in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Several members of thegroup discussed a scene from the motion picture "MississippiBurning," in which a white man beat a young black boy whowas praying. The group moved outside and Mitchell askedthem: " `Do you all feel hyped up to move on some whitepeople?' " Brief for Petitioner 4. Shortly thereafter, ayoung white boy approached the group on the opposite sideof the street where they were standing. As the boy walkedby, Mitchell said: " `You all want to fuck somebody up?There goes a white boy; go get him.' " Id., at 4-5. Mitchellcounted to three and pointed in the boy's direction. Thegroup ran toward the boy, beat him severely, and stole histennis shoes. The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma for four days.After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County,Mitchell was convicted of aggravated battery. Wis. Stat.$$ 939.05 and 940.19(1m) (1989-1990). That offense ordinarily carries a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. $$ 940.19(1m) and 939.50(3)(e). But because the juryfound that Mitchell had intentionally selected his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for Mitchell'soffense was increased to seven years under $ 939.645. Thatprovision enhances the maximum penalty for an offensewhenever the defendant "[i]ntentionally selects the personagainst whom the crime . . . is committed . . . because of therace, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, nationalorigin or ancestry of that person . . . ." $ 939.645(1)(b).11 At the time of Mitchell's trial, the Wisconsin penalty-enhancementstatute provided:"(1) If a person does all of the following, the penalties for the underlyingcrime are increased as provided in sub.

S. 476 (1993)Opinion of the CourtThe Circuit Court sentenced Mitchell to four years' imprison-ment for the aggravated battery.Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief inthe Circuit Court. Then he appealed his conviction andsentence, challenging the constitutionality of Wiscon-sin's penalty-enhancement provision on First Amendmentgrounds.2 The Wisconsin Court of Appeals rejected Mitch-ell's challenge, 163 Wis. 2d 652, 473 N. W. 2d 1 (1991), but theWisconsin Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Courtdisability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry of that person orthe owner or occupant of that property."(2)(a) If the crime committed under sub.

Stat. $ 939.645 (1989-1990).The statute was amended in 1992, but the amendments are not at issue inthis case.2 Mitchell also challenged the statute on Fourteenth Amendment equalprotection and vagueness grounds. The Wisconsin Court of Appeals heldthat Mitchell waived his equal protection claim and rejected his vaguenesschallenge outright. 163 Wis. 2d 652, 473 N. W. 2d 1 (1991). The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to address both claims. 169 Wis. 2d 153, 158,n. 2, 485 N. W. 2d 807, 809, n. 2 (1992). Mitchell renews his FourteenthAmendment claims in this Court. But since they were not developedbelow and plainly fall outside of the question on which we granted certiorari, we do not reach them either.508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT482 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELLOpinion of the Courtheld that the statute "violates the First Amendment directlyby punishing what the legislature has deemed to be offensivethought." 169 Wis. 2d 153, 163, 485 N. W. 2d 807, 811 (1992).It rejected the State's contention "that the statute punishesonly the `conduct' of intentional selection of a victim." Id.,at 164, 485 N. W. 2d, at 812. According to the court, "[t]hestatute punishes the `because of ' aspect of the defendant'sselection, thereason the defendant selected the victim, themotive behind the selection." Ibid. (emphasis in original).And under R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377 (1992), "theWisconsin legislature cannot criminalize bigoted thoughtwith which it disagrees." 169 Wis. 2d, at 171, 485 N. W. 2d,at 815.The Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute was unconstitutionally overbroad. Itreasoned that, in order to prove that a defendant intention-ally selected his victim because of the victim's protected status, the State would often have to introduce evidence of thedefendant's prior speech, such as racial epithets he may haveuttered before the commission of the offense. This eviden-tiary use of protected speech, the court thought, would havea "chilling effect" on those who feared the possibility ofprosecution for offenses subject to penalty enhancement.See id., at 174, 485 N. W. 2d, at 816. Finally, the court dis-tinguished antidiscrimination laws, which have long beenheld constitutional, on the ground that the Wisconsin statutepunishes the "subjective mental process" of selecting a victim because of his protected status, whereas antidiscrimina-tion laws prohibit "objective acts of discrimination."Id., at176, 485 N. W. 2d, at 817.3We granted certiorari because of the importance of thequestion presented and the existence of a conflict of author3 Two justices dissented. They concluded that the statute punished discriminatory acts, and not beliefs, and therefore would have upheld it. See169 Wis. 2d, at 181, 485 N.

We reverse.Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's conclusion that the statute punishes bigotedthought and not conduct. There is no doubt that we arebound by a state court's construction of a state statute.R. A. V., supra, at 381; New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747,769, n. 24 (1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 4 (1949).In Terminiello, for example, the Illinois courts had definedthe term " `breach of the peace,' " in a city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, to include " `stirs the public to anger. . . or creates a disturbance.' " Id., at 4. We held this con4 Several States have enacted penalty-enhancement provisions similarto the Wisconsin statute at issue in this case. See, e. g., Cal. Penal CodeAnn. $ 422.7 (West 1988 and Supp. 1993); Fla. Stat. $ 775.085 (1991); Mont.Code Ann. $ 45-5-222 (1992); Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13, $ 1455 (Supp. 1992).Proposed federal legislation to the same effect passed the House of Representatives in 1992, H. R. 4797, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992), but failed topass the Senate, S. 2522, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The state highcourts are divided over the constitutionality of penalty-enhancement statutes and analogous statutes covering bias-motivated offenses. Compare,e. g., State v. Plowman, 314 Ore. 157, 838 P. 2d 558 (1992) (upholding Oregon statute), with State v. Wyant, 64 Ohio St. 3d 566, 597 N. E. 2d450 (1992) (striking down Ohio statute); 169 Wis. 2d 153, 485 N. W. 2d 807(1992) (case below) (striking down Wisconsin statute). According to amici,bias-motivated violence is on the rise throughout the United States. See,e. g., Brief for the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium et al.as Amici Curiae 5-11; Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al. as AmiciCuriae 4-7; Brief for the City of Atlanta et al. as Amici Curiae 3-12. In1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, Pub. L. 101-275,$ 1(b)(1), 104 Stat. 140, codified at 28 U. S. C. $ 534 (note) (1988 ed., Supp.III), directing the Attorney General to compile data "about crimes thatmanifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation,or ethnicity." Pursuant to the Act, the Federal Bureau of Investigationreported in January 1993, that 4,558 bias-motivated offenses were committed in 1991, including 1,614 incidents of intimidation, 1,301 incidents ofvandalism, 796 simple assaults, 773 aggravated assaults, and 12 murders.See Brief for the Crown Heights Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 1A-7A.508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT484 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELLOpinion of the Courtstruction to be binding on us. But here the Wisconsin Su-preme Court did not, strictly speaking, construe the Wisconsin statute in the sense of defining the meaning of aparticular statutory word or phrase. Rather, it merelycharacterized the "practical effect" of the statute for FirstAmendment purposes. See 169 Wis. 2d, at 166-167, 485N. W. 2d, at 813 ("Merely because the statute refers in aliteral sense to the intentional `conduct' of selecting, does notmean the court must turn a blind eye to the intent and practical effect of the law--punishment of motive or thought").This assessment does not bind us. Once any ambiguities asto the meaning of the statute are resolved, we may form ourown judgment as to its operative effect.The State argues that the statute does not punish bigotedthought, as the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, but insteadpunishes only conduct. While this argument is literallycorrect, it does not dispose of Mitchell's First Amendmentchallenge. To be sure, our cases reject the "view that anapparently limitless variety of conduct can be labeled`speech' whenever the person engaging in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea." United States v.O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 376 (1968); accord, R. A. V., supra,at 385-386; Spence v. Washington, 418 U. S. 405, 409 (1974)(per curiam); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 536, 555 (1965).Thus, a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive conduct protected by the First Amendment.See Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S. 609, 628(1984) ("[V]iolence or other types of potentially expressiveactivities that produce special harms distinct from theircommunicative impact . . . are entitled to no constitutionalprotection"); NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U. S.886, 916 (1982) ("The First Amendment does not protectviolence").But the fact remains that under the Wisconsin statute thesame criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if thevictim is selected because of his race or other protected sta508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT485Cite as: 508 U. S. 476 (1993)Opinion of the Courttus than if no such motive obtained. Thus, although thestatute punishes criminal conduct, it enhances the maximumpenalty for conduct motivated by a discriminatory point ofview more severely than the same conduct engaged in forsome other reason or for no reason at all. Because the onlyreason for the enhancement is the defendant's discriminatorymotive for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates theFirst Amendment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a widevariety of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt indetermining what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant. See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 820-821 (1991);United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972); Williamsv. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949). The defendant's motive for committing the offense is one important factor. See1 W. LeFave & A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law $ 3.6(b),p. 324 (1986) ("Motives are most relevant when the trialjudge sets the defendant's sentence, and it is not uncommonfor a defendant to receive a minimum sentence because hewas acting with good motives, or a rather high sentence because of his bad motives"); cf. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U. S.137, 156 (1987) ("Deeply ingrained in our legal tradition isthe idea that the more purposeful is the criminal conduct,the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the more severely it ought to be punished"). Thus, in many States thecommission of a murder, or other capital offense, for pecuniary gain is a separate aggravating circumstance under thecapital sentencing statute. See, e. g., Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.$ 13-703(F)(5) (1989); Fla. Stat. $ 921.1415(f) (Supp. 1992);Miss. Code Ann. $ 99-19-101(5)(f) (Supp. 1992); N. C. Gen.Stat. $ 15A-2000(e)(6) (1992); Wyo. Stat. $ 6-2-102(h)(vi)(Supp. 1992).But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs,however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken intoconsideration by a sentencing judge. Dawson v. Delaware,508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT486 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELLOpinion of the Court503 U. S. 159 (1992). In Dawson, the State introduced evidence at a capital sentencing hearing that the defendant wasa member of a white supremacist prison gang. Because "theevidence proved nothing more than [the defendant's] abstractbeliefs," we held that its admission violated the defendant'sFirst Amendment rights. Id., at 167. In so holding, however, we emphasized that "the Constitution does not erect aper se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one'sbeliefs and associations at sentencing simply because thosebeliefs and associations are protected by the First Amendment." Id., at 165. Thus, in Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S.939 (1983) (plurality opinion), we allowed the sentencingjudge to take into account the defendant's racial animus towards his victim. The evidence in that case showed thatthe defendant's membership in the Black Liberation Armyand desire to provoke a "race war" were related to the murder of a white man for which he was convicted. See id.,at 942-944. Because "the elements of racial hatred in [the]murder" were relevant to several aggravating factors, weheld that the trial judge permissibly took this evidence intoaccount in sentencing the defendant to death. Id., at 949,and n. 7.Mitchell suggests that Dawson and Barclay are inappositebecause they did not involve application of a penaltyenhancement provision. But in Barclay we held that it waspermissible for the sentencing court to consider the defendant's racial animus in determining whether he should be sentenced to death, surely the most severe "enhancement" of all.And the fact that the Wisconsin Legislature has decided, as ageneral matter, that bias-motivated offenses warrant greatermaximum penalties across the board does not alter the resulthere. For the primary responsibility for fixing criminal penalties lies with the legislature. Rummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S.263, 274 (1980); Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393(1958).508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT487Cite as: 508 U. S. 476 (1993)Opinion of the CourtMitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancementstatute is invalid because it punishes the defendant's discriminatory motive, or reason, for acting. But motive plays thesame role under the Wisconsin statute as it does underfederal and state antidiscrimination laws, which we havepreviously upheld against constitutional challenge. SeeRoberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S., at 628; Hishonv. King & Spalding, 467 U. S. 69, 78 (1984); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 176 (1976). Title VII of the CivilRights Act of 1964, for example, makes it unlawful for anemployer to discriminate against an employee "because ofsuch individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In Hishon, werejected the argument that Title VII infringed employers'First Amendment rights. And more recently, in R. A. V. v.St. Paul, 505 U. S., at 389-390, we cited Title VII (as well as18 U. S. C. $ 242 and 42 U. S. C. $$ 1981 and 1982) as an example of a permissible content-neutral regulation of conduct.Nothing in our decision last Term in R. A. V. compels adifferent result here. That case involved a First Amendment challenge to a municipal ordinance prohibiting the useof " `fighting words' that insult, or provoke violence, `on thebasis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.' " 505 U. S., at391 (quoting St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, St.Paul, Minn., Legis. Code $ 292.02 (1990)). Because the ordinance only proscribed a class of "fighting words" deemedparticularly offensive by the city--i. e., those "that contain. . . messages of `bias-motivated' hatred," 505 U. S., at 392--we held that it violated the rule against content-baseddiscrimination. See id., at 392-394. But whereas theordinance struck down in R. A. V. was explicitly directedat expression (i. e., "speech" or "messages"), id., at 392,the statute in this case is aimed at conduct unprotected bythe First Amendment.Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired conduct because this conduct is thought508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT488 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELLOpinion of the Courtto inflict greater individual and societal harm. For example,according to the State and itsamici, bias-motivated crimesare more likely to provoke retaliatory crimes, inflict distinctemotional harms on their victims, and incite community unrest. See, e. g., Brief for Petitioner 24-27; Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 13-15; Brief for Lawyers' Commit-tee for Civil Rights Under Law asAmicus Curiae 18-22;Brief for the American Civil Liberties Union as AmicusCuriae 17-19; Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al.as Amici Curiae 9-10; Brief for Congressman Charles E.Schumer et al. asAmici Curiae 8-9. The State's desire toredress these perceived harms provides an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision over and abovemere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases. AsBlackstone said long ago, "it is but reasonable that amongcrimes of different natures those should be most severelypunished, which are the most destructive of the public safetyand happiness." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *16.Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because of its "chilling effect" on free speech. Mitchell argues (and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) thatthe statute is "overbroad" because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations may be used to prove thatthe defendant intentionally selected his victim on account ofthe victim's protected status. Consequently, the argumentgoes, the statute impermissibly chills free expression withrespect to such matters by those concerned about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should in the future commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We find nomerit in this contention.The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuatedand unlikely than that contemplated in traditional "overbreadth" cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsincitizen suppressing his unpopular bigoted opinions for fearthat if he later commits an offense covered by the statute,508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT489Cite as: 508 U. S. 476 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthese opinions will be offered at trial to establish that heselected his victim on account of the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty enhancement. To staywithin the realm of rationality, we must surely put to oneside minor misdemeanor offenses covered by the statute,such as negligent operation of a motor vehicle (Wis. Stat.$ 941.01 (1989-1990)); for it is difficult, if not impossible, toconceive of a situation where such offenses would be raciallymotivated. We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizensuppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of suchbeliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he commitsa more serious offense against person or property. This issimply too speculative a hypothesis to support Mitchell'soverbreadth claim.The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary use of speech to establish the elements of a crimeor to prove motive or intent. Evidence of a defendant's previous declarations or statements is commonly admitted incriminal trials subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and the like. Nearly half a century ago, inHaupt v. United States, 330 U. S. 631 (1947), we rejected acontention similar to that advanced by Mitchell here. Hauptwas tried for the offense of treason, which, as defined by theConstitution (Art. III, $ 3), may depend very much on proofof motive. To prove that the acts in question were committed out of "adherence to the enemy" rather than "parentalsolicitude," id., at 641, the Government introduced evidenceof conversations that had taken place long prior to the indictment, some of which consisted of statements showingHaupt's sympathy with Germany and Hitler and hostility towards the United States. We rejected Haupt's argumentthat this evidence was improperly admitted. While "[s]uchtestimony is to be scrutinized with care to be certain thestatements are not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion with our own government or quiteproper appreciation of the land of birth," we held that "these508us2$91H 02-13-97 21:01:15 PAGES OPINPGT490 WISCONSIN v. MITCHELLOpinion of the Courtstatements . . . clearly were admissible on the question ofintent and adherence to the enemy." Id., at 642. See alsoPrice Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U. S. 228, 251-252 (1989)(plurality opinion) (allowing evidentiary use of defendant'sspeech in evaluating Title VII discrimination claim); Streetv.New York, 394 U. S. 576, 594 (1969).For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mitchell's FirstAmendment rights were not violated by the application ofthe Wisconsin penalty-enhancement provision in sentencinghim. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Wisconsinis therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for furtherproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
