In this case, we return to the issue that splintered theCourt in Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222 (1980): Whetherthe Constitution prohibits a sentencing court from consider-ing a defendant's previous uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in sentencing him for a subsequent offense.In 1990, petitioner Nichols pleaded guilty to conspiracy topossess cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21U. S. C. $ 846. Pursuant to the United States SentencingCommission's Guidelines (Sentencing Guidelines), petitionerwas assessed three criminal history points for a 1983 federalfelony drug conviction. An additional criminal history pointwas assessed for petitioner's 1983 state misdemeanor conviction for driving under the influence (DUI), for which peti-tioner was fined $250 but was not incarcerated.1 This additional criminal history point increased petitioner's CriminalHistory Category from Category II to Category III.2 As aresult, petitioner's sentencing range under the SentencingGuidelines increased from 168-210 months (under CriminalHistory Category II) to 188-235 months (under CategoryIII).31 At the time of his conviction, petitioner faced a maximum punishmentof one year imprisonment and a $1,000 fine. Georgia law provided that aperson convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol "shall be guiltyof a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than ten days nor more than one year, or by a fineof not less than $100.00 nor more than $1,000.00, or by both such fine andimprisonment." Ga. Code Ann. $ 40.6-391(c) (1982).2 There are six criminal history categories under the Sentencing Guidelines. United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (USSG)ch. 5, pt. A (Nov. 1993) (Sentencing Table). A defendant's criminal historycategory is determined by the number of his criminal history points, whichin turn is based on his prior criminal record. Id., ch. 4, p. A.3 The Sentencing Table provides a matrix of sentencing ranges. On thevertical axis of the matrix is the defendant's offense level representing theseriousness of the crime; on the horizontal axis is the defendant's criminalhistory category. The sentencing range is determined by identifying the511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT741Cite as: 511 U. S. 738 (1994)Opinion of the CourtPetitioner objected to the inclusion of his DUI misde-meanor conviction in his criminal history score because hewas not represented by counsel at that proceeding. Hemaintained that consideration of that uncounseled misdemeanor conviction in establishing his sentence would violatethe Sixth Amendment as construed in Baldasar, supra.The United States District Court for the Eastern District ofTennessee found that petitioner's misdemeanor convictionwas uncounseled and that, based on the record before it, petitioner had not waived his right to counsel.4 763 F. Supp.277 (1991). But the District Court rejected petitioner'sBaldasar argument, explaining that in the absence of a majorityopinion,Baldasar "stands only for the proposition that aprior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction may not be usedto create a felony with a prison term." 763 F. Supp., at 279.Because petitioner's offense was already defined as a felony,the District Court ruled that Baldasar was inapplicable tothe facts of this case; thus, petitioner's constitutional rightswere not violated by using his 1983 DUI conviction to enhance his sentence.5 It sentenced petitioner to the maximum term allowed by the Sentencing Guidelines under itsinterpretation of Baldasar, a term 25 months longer thanif the misdemeanor conviction had not been considered incalculating petitioner's criminal history score.intersection of the defendant's offense level and his criminal history category. Id., ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table).4 The Government contends that, even if Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S.222 (1980), prohibits using the prior uncounseled misdemeanor convictionto enhance petitioner's sentence, the District Court applied the wrong legalstandard in finding no valid waiver of the right to counsel. Based on Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458, 467-469 (1938), and Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S.20, 28-29 (1992), the Government argues that petitioner failed to carryhis burden to establish the absence of a valid waiver of counsel. We neednot address this contention due to our resolution of the Baldasar issue.5 Petitioner's instant felony conviction was punishable under statute bynot less than 10 years' imprisonment and not more than life imprisonment.See 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(B); 979 F. 2d 402, 413-414, 417-418 (CA6 1992).511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT742 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtA divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir-cuit affirmed. 979 F. 2d 402 (1992). After reviewing thefractured decision in Baldasar and the opinions from otherCourts of Appeals that had considered the issue, the courtheld that Baldasar limits the collateral use at sentencing ofa prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction only when theeffect of such consideration is to convert a misdemeanor intoa felony.6 The dissent, while recognizing that "numerouscourts have questioned whether [Baldasar] expresses anysingle holding, and, accordingly, have largely limitedBal-dasar to its facts," nevertheless concluded that Baldasarproscribed the use of petitioner's prior uncounseled DUIconviction to enhance his sentence under the SentencingGuidelines. 979 F. 2d, at 407-408 (citations omitted).We granted certiorari, 509 U.

Scott, supra, at 373.One year later, in Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222 (1980),a majority of the Court held that a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction, constitutional under Scott, could nevertheless not be collaterally used to convert a second misdemeanor conviction into a felony under the applicable Illinoissentencing enhancement statute.

Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963). We have held that convictions gained inviolation of Gideon cannot be used "either to support guilt or enhancepunishment for another offense," Burgett v. Texas, 389 U. S. 109, 115(1967), and that a subsequent sentence that was based in part on a priorinvalid conviction must be set aside, United States v. Tucker, 404 U.

Justice Stewart, who was joined byJustices Brennan and Stevens, stated simply that the defend-ant "was sentenced to an increased term of imprisonmentonly because he had been convicted in a previous prosecutionin which he had not had the assistance of appointed counselin his defense," and that "this prison sentence violated theconstitutional rule of Scott . . . ." Ibid. Justice Marshall,who was also joined byJustices Brennan and Stevens,rested his opinion on the proposition that an uncounseledmisdemeanor conviction is "not sufficiently reliable" to support imprisonment under Argersinger, and that it "does notbecome more reliable merely because the accused has beenvalidly convicted of a subsequent offense." 446 U. S., at227-228. Justice Blackmun, who provided the fifth vote,advanced the same rationale expressed in his dissent inScott--that the Constitution requires appointment of counselfor an indigent defendant whenever he is charged with a"nonpetty" offense (an offense punishable by more than sixmonths' imprisonment) or when the defendant is actuallysentenced to imprisonment. 446 U. S., at 229-230. Underthis rationale, Baldasar's prior misdemeanor conviction wasinvalid and could not be used for enhancement purposes because the initial misdemeanor was punishable by a prisonterm of more than six months.Justice Powell authored the dissent, in which the remaining three Members of the Court joined. The dissent criticized the majority's holding as one that "undermines therationale of Scott and Argersinger and leaves no coherentrationale in its place." Id., at 231. The dissent opined thatthe majority's result misapprehended the nature of enhancement statutes that "do not alter or enlarge a prior sentence,"ignored the significance of the constitutional validity of thefirst conviction under Scott, and created a "hybrid" conviction, good for the punishment actually imposed but notavailable for sentence enhancement in a later prosecution.511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT745Cite as: 511 U. S. 738 (1994)Opinion of the Court446 U. S., at 232-233. Finally--and quite presciently--thedissent predicted that the Court's decision would createconfusion in the lower courts. Id., at 234.In Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188 (1977), we statedthat "[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no singlerationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, `the holding of the Court may be viewed as that posi-tion taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds . . . .' " Id., at 193, quotingGregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 169, n. 15 (1976). This testis more easily stated than applied to the various opinionssupporting the result in Baldasar. A number of Courts ofAppeals have decided that there is no lowest common denominator or "narrowest grounds" that represents the Court'sholding. See,e. g., United States v. Castro-Vega, 945 F. 2d496, 499-500 (CA2 1991); United States v. Eckford, 910 F. 2d216, 219, n. 8 (CA5 1990); Schindler v. Clerk of Circuit Court,715 F. 2d 341, 345 (CA7 1983), cert. denied, 465 U. S. 1068(1984). Another Court of Appeals has concluded that theholding inBaldasar is Justice Blackmun's rationale, San-tillanes v. United States Parole Comm'n, 754 F. 2d 887, 889(CA10 1985); yet another has concluded that the "consensus"of the Baldasar concurrences is roughly that expressed byJustice Marshall's concurring opinion. United States v. Wil-liams, 891 F. 2d 212, 214 (CA9 1989). State courts have similarly divided.10 The Sentencing Guidelines have also re-flected uncertainty over Baldasar.11 We think it not useful10 See n. 7, supra.11 The 1989 version of the Sentencing Guidelines stated that, in determining a defendant's criminal history score, an uncounseled misdemeanorconviction should be excluded only if it "would result in the imposition ofa sentence of imprisonment under circumstances that would violate theUnited States Constitution." USSG $ 4A1.2, Application Note 6 (Nov.1989). Effective November 1, 1990, the Sentencing Commission amended$ 4A1.2 by deleting the above quoted phrase and adding the followingstatement as background commentary: "Prior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score, including uncoun511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT746 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtto pursue the Marks inquiry to the utmost logical possibilitywhen it has so obviously baffled and divided the lower courtsthat have considered it. This degree of confusion followinga splintered decision such asBaldasar is itself a reason forreexamining that decision. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.808, 829-830 (1991); Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 24-25 (1973).Five Members of the Court in Baldasar--the four dissenters and Justice Stewart--expressed continued adherence toScott v. Illinois, 440 U. S. 367 (1979). There the defendantwas convicted of shoplifting under a criminal statute whichprovided that the penalty for the offense should be a fine ofnot more than $500, a term of not more than one year injail, or both. The defendant was in fact fined $50, but hecontended that since imprisonment for the offense was authorized by statute, the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendmentsto the United States Constitution required Illinois to providetrial counsel. We rejected that contention, holding that solong as no imprisonment was actually imposed, the SixthAmendment right to counsel did not obtain. Id., at 373-374.We reasoned that the Court, in a number of decisions, hadalready expanded the language of the Sixth Amendment wellbeyond its obvious meaning, and that the line should bedrawn between criminal proceedings that resulted in imprisonment, and those that did not. Id., at 372.We adhere to that holding today, but agree with the dissent in Baldasar that a logical consequence of the holding isthat an uncounseled conviction valid under Scott may be reseled misdemeanor sentences where imprisonment was not imposed."USSG App. C, amdt. 353 (Nov. 1993). When the Sentencing Commissioninitially published the amendment for notice and comment, it included thefollowing explanation: "The Commission does not believe the inclusion ofsentences resulting from constitutionally valid, uncounseled misdemeanorconvictions in the criminal history score is foreclosed by Baldasar v. Illinois, 446 U. S. 222 (1980)." 55 Fed. Reg. 5741 (1990).511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT747Cite as: 511 U. S. 738 (1994)Opinion of the Courtlied upon to enhance the sentence for a subsequent offense,even though that sentence entails imprisonment. Enhancement statutes, whether in the nature of criminal history provisions such as those contained in the Sentencing Guidelines,or recidivist statutes that are commonplace in state criminallaws, do not change the penalty imposed for the earlier conviction. As pointed out in the dissenting opinion in Baldasar, "[t]his Court consistently has sustained repeat-offenderlaws as penalizing only the last offense committed by thedefendant. E. g., Moore v. Missouri, 159 U. S. 673, 677(1895); Oyler v. Boles, 368 U. S. 448, 451 (1962)." 446 U. S.,at 232.Reliance on such a conviction is also consistent with thetraditional understanding of the sentencing process, whichwe have often recognized as less exacting than the processof establishing guilt. As a general proposition, a sentencingjudge "may appropriately conduct an inquiry broad in scope,largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he mayconsider, or the source from which it may come." UnitedStates v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443, 446 (1972). "Traditionally,sentencing judges have considered a wide variety of factorsin addition to evidence bearing on guilt in determining whatsentence to impose on a convicted defendant." Wisconsinv. Mitchell, 508 U. S. 476, 485 (1993). One such importantfactor, as recognized by state recidivism statutes and thecriminal history component of the Sentencing Guidelines, isa defendant's prior convictions. Sentencing courts have notonly taken into consideration a defendant's prior convictions,but have also considered a defendant's past criminal behavior, even if no conviction resulted from that behavior. Wehave upheld the constitutionality of considering such previous conduct in Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241 (1949).We have also upheld the consideration of such conduct, inconnection with the offense presently charged, in McMillanv. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986). There we held that511us3$61H 11-04-97 20:25:22 PAGES OPINPGT748 NICHOLS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe state could consider, as a sentence enhancement factor,visible possession of a firearm during the felonies of whichdefendant was found guilty.Thus, consistently with due process, petitioner in the present case could have been sentenced more severely based sim-ply on evidence of the underlying conduct that gave rise tothe previous DUI offense. And the state need prove suchconduct only by a preponderance of the evidence.Id., at91. Surely, then, it must be constitutionally permissible toconsider a prior uncounseled misdemeanor conviction basedon the same conduct where that conduct must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.Petitioner contends that, at a minimum, due process requires a misdemeanor defendant to be warned that his con-viction might be used for enhancement purposes should thedefendant later be convicted of another crime. No such re-quirement was suggested inScott, and we believe with goodreason. In the first place, a large number of misdemeanorconvictions take place in police or justice courts which arenot courts of record. Without a drastic change in the procedures of these courts, there would be no way to memorializeany such warning. Nor is it at all clear exactly how expansive the warning would have to be; would a Georgia courthave to warn the defendant about permutations and commutations of recidivist statutes in 49 other States, as well asthe criminal history provision of the Sentencing Guidelinesapplicable in federal courts? And a warning at the com-pletely general level--that if he is brought back into courton another criminal charge, a defendant such as Nichols willbe treated more harshly--would merely tell him what hemust surely already know.Today we adhere to Scott v. Illinois, supra, and overruleBaldasar.12 Accordingly we hold, consistent with the Sixth12 Of course States may decide, based on their own constitutions or public policy, that counsel should be available for all indigent defendantscharged with misdemeanors.
