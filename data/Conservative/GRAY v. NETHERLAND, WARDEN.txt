Petitioner, convicted of capital murder, complains that hisright to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment was violated because he was not given adequate noticeof some of the evidence the Commonwealth intended to useagainst him at the penalty hearing of his trial. We hold thatthis claim would necessitate a "new rule," and that thereforeit does not provide a basis on which he may seek federalhabeas relief. IARichard McClelland was the manager of a departmentstore, Murphy's Mart, in Portsmouth, Virginia. On May 2,1985, at approximately 9:30 p.m., petitioner and MelvinTucker, a friend, both under the influence of cocaine, parkedin the parking lot of the Murphy's Mart and watched McClelland and a store security guard inside. Shortly before midnight, McClelland and the guard came out of the store andleft in separate automobiles. With Tucker in the passengerseat, petitioner followed McClelland, pulled in front of hiscar at a stop sign, threatened him with a .32-caliber revolver,ordered him into petitioner's car, and struck him. Petitioner and Tucker took McClelland's wallet and threatenedto harm his family if he did not cooperate. Gray v. Commonwealth, 233 Va. 313, 340-341, 356 S. E. 2d 157, 172, cert.denied, 484 U. S. 873 (1987).Petitioner drove the car back to the Murphy's Mart, wherehe forced McClelland at gunpoint to reopen the store. Theyfilled three gym bags with money, totaling between $12,000and $13,000. Petitioner drove McClelland and Tucker to aservice station, bought gasoline for his car and for a gas canin the car's trunk, and proceeded to a remote side road. Hetook McClelland 15 to 20 feet behind the car and ordered himto lie down. While McClelland begged petitioner not to518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT156 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the Courthurt or shoot him, petitioner assured him he would not beharmed. Having thus assured McClelland, petitioner firedsix pistol shots into the back of his head in rapid succession.233 Va., at 341-342, 356 S. E. 2d, at 172-173.Leaving McClelland's dead body on the side road, peti-tioner and Tucker returned to the intersection where theyhad seized him. Petitioner, telling Tucker he wanted to de-stroy McClelland's car as evidence, doused its interior withgasoline and lit it with a match. Id., at 341-342, 356 S. E.2d, at 173.Petitioner and Tucker were later arrested and indicted inthe Circuit Court of the city of Suffolk on several counts,including capital murder. Having evidence that petitionerhad announced before the killing that "he was going to get"McClelland for having fired his wife from her job as a sales-woman at the Murphy's Mart, and that petitioner had toldother witnesses after the killing that he had performed it,the prosecutor entered into a plea bargain with Tucker. Inreturn for being tried for first-degree murder instead of capi-tal murder, Tucker would testify at petitioner's trial aboutevents leading up to the killing and would identify petitioneras the actual "trigger man."Id., at 331, 356 S. E. 2d, at 167.BOn Monday, December 2, 1985, petitioner's trial began.Petitioner's counsel moved that the trial court order theprosecution to disclose the evidence it planned to introducein the penalty phase. The prosecutor acknowledged that "inthe event [petitioner] is found guilty we do intend to intro-duce evidence of statements he has made to other peopleabout other crimes he has committed of which he has notbeen convicted." 14 Record 8. In particular, the prosecution intended to show that petitioner had admitted to a noto-rious double murder in Chesapeake, a city adjacent to Suffolk. Lisa Sorrell and her 3-year-old daughter, Shanta, hadbeen murdered five months before McClelland was killed.518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT157Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Opinion of the CourtThe prosecutor told petitioner's counsel in court that the onlyevidence he would introduce would be statements by petitioner to Tucker or fellow inmates that he committed thesemurders.Id., at 11.On Thursday, December 5, 1985, the jury convicted petitioner on all counts. That evening, the prosecution in-formed petitioner's counsel that the Commonwealth wouldintroduce evidence, beyond petitioner's own admissions,linking petitioner to the Sorrell murders. The additionalevidence included photographs of the crime scene and testi-mony by the police detective who investigated the murdersand by the state medical examiner who performed autopsieson the Sorrells' bodies. The testimony was meant to showthat the manner in which Lisa and Shanta Sorrell had beenkilled resembled the manner in which McClelland was killed.The next morning, petitioner's counsel made two motions"to have excluded from evidence during [the] penalty trialany evidence pertaining to any . . . felony for which thedefendant has not yet been charged." 18 id., at 776. Counsel argued that the additional evidence exceeded the scopeof unadjudicated-crime evidence admissible for sentencingunder Virginia law, because "[i]n essence, what [the prosecutor is] doing is trying [the Sorrell] case in the minds of thejurors." Id., at 724 (citing Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d 422 (1985), cert. denied, 475 U. S. 1099(1986)). Although counsel also complained that he was not"prepared for any of this [additional evidence], other than[that petitioner] may have made some incriminating statements," 18 Record 725, and that the "[d]efense was taken bysurprise," id., at 777, he never requested a continuance.The trial court denied the motions to exclude.During the sentencing phase, Tucker testified that, shortlyafter the McClelland murder, petitioner pointed to a pictureof Lisa Sorrell in a newspaper and told Tucker that he had"knocked off " Sorrell. Petitioner's counsel did not crossexamine Tucker. Officer Michael Slezak, who had investi518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT158 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the Courtgated the Sorrell murders, testified that he found Lisa's bodyin the front seat of a partially burned automobile and Shanta's body in the trunk. Dr. Faruk Presswalla, the medicalexaminer who had performed autopsies on the bodies, testified that Lisa was killed by six bullets to the head, shot froma .32-caliber gun.Gray, supra, at 345, 356 S. E. 2d, at 175.Petitioner's counsel did not cross-examine Dr. Presswalla,and only cross-examined Officer Slezak to suggest thatMcClelland's murder may have been a "copycat" murder,committed by a different perpetrator. 18 Record 793, 802.1The jury fixed petitioner's sentence for McClelland'smurder at death. The trial court entered judgment on theverdicts for all the charges against petitioner and sentencedhim to death. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed, 233Va. 313, 356 S. E. 2d 157, and we denied certiorari, Gray v.Virginia, 484 U. S. 873 (1987). The Suffolk Circuit Courtdismissed petitioner's state petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Virginia Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal,and we denied certiorari. Gray v. Thompson, 500 U. S. 949(1991).CPetitioner then sought a writ of habeas corpus from theUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Vir-ginia. With respect to the Sorrell murders, he argued,interalia, that he had "never been convicted of any of thesecrimes nor was he awaiting trial for these crimes," that theCommonwealth "did not disclose its intentions to use the1 The prosecutor introduced this testimony as evidence of petitioner'sfuture dangerousness. The prosecutor also introduced into evidence petitioner's criminal record, which included 13 felony convictions, at least 9 ofwhich were for crimes of violence, including armed robbery and maliciouswounding. Petitioner's record revealed that he had locked a restaurant'semployees in a food freezer while robbing the restaurant, and threatenedthe lives of two persons other than McClelland. Gray v. Commonwealth,233 Va. 313, 353, 356 S. E. 2d 157, 179, cert. denied, 484 U. S. 873 (1987).518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT159Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Opinion of the CourtSorrell murders as evidence against [him] until such a latedate that it was impossible for [his] defense counsel reasonably to prepare or defend against such evidence at trial,"and that Tucker " `sold' his testimony to the Commonwealthfor . . . less than a life sentence." 1 Joint Appendix inNo. 94-4009 (CA4), pp. 32-33 (hereinafter J. A.).The Commonwealth moved to dismiss the petition. Toclarify its arguments against petitioner's Sorrell murderclaim, it characterized petitioner's allegations as seven separate subclaims. The first subclaim asserted that petitionerwas given "inadequate notice of the evidence which the Commonwealth intended to introduce to permit him to defendagainst it," and the third, relying on Brady v. Maryland, 373U. S. 83 (1963), asserted that "[t]he Commonwealth failed todisclose evidence tending to prove that someone else hadcommitted the Sorrell murders." 2 Respondent's Brief inSupport of Motion to Dismiss in No. 3:91CV693 (ED Va.),p. 2. According to the Commonwealth, the notice-ofevidence subclaim was meritless and could not be the basisfor relief in federal habeas corpus proceedings because itsought the retroactive application of a new rule of constitutional law. Id., at 18-19, 19-20. The Commonwealthalleged that the Brady subclaim had not been presented tothe state courts on direct appeal or in state habeas corpusproceedings, and was thus procedurally barred under Va.Code Ann. $ 8.01-654(B)(2) (1992). Respondent's Brief inSupport of Motion to Dismiss, supra, at 19.Initially, the District Court dismissed the habeas petition.The court adopted the Commonwealth's characterization ofpetitioner's Sorrell claim. See 1 J. A. 193. The court heldthat petitioner was not entitled to relief on the notice-ofevidence subclaim, because he "has no constitutional rightto notice of individual items of testimony which the Com2 The other five subclaims are not relevant to our review.518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT160 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the Courtmonwealth intends to introduce at the penalty phase." Id.,at 194. The court declined to review theBrady subclaimbecause it was procedurally barred. 1 J. A. 194.Later, on petitioner's motion, the District Court amendedits judgment to find within petitioner's Sorrell claim a specific due process claim about the admissibility of the Sorrellmurder evidence.Id., at 252. (In amending this judgment,the court announced that it remained unchanged as to theremaining claims, which it had dismissed.Id., at 251.)After holding an evidentiary hearing on the Sorrell claim,the District Court ordered that petitioner be granted a writof habeas corpus. The court characterized the claim as anallegation that petitioner "was denied due process of lawunder the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution because the Commonwealth failed to provide fairnotice that evidence concerning the Sorrell murders wouldbe introduced at his penalty phase." App. 348. CitingGardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357-359 (1977), the courtdetermined that there was a constitutional defect in petitioner's penalty phase hearing: "Petitioner was confronted andsurprised by the testimony of officer Slezak and Dr. Presswalla." App. 349. This defect "violated [petitioner's] rightto fair notice and rendered the hearing clearly unreliable,"because petitioner's attorneys had less than one day's noticeof the additional evidence to be used against their client.Id., at 349-350.The Commonwealth appealed, arguing to the Fourth Circuit that to grant petitioner habeas relief would give him thebenefit of a new rule of federal constitutional law, in violationof Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). The Fourth Circuitreversed the judgment granting the writ, rejected petitioner's cross-appeals from the dismissal of several other claims,and remanded with directions that the habeas corpus petition be dismissed. Gray v. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59, 67 (1995).The court distinguished Gardner, on which the DistrictCourt had relied, because petitioner, unlike Gardner, "was518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT161Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Opinion of the Courtnot sentenced on the basis of any secret information." 58F. 3d, at 64. The court thus concluded that petitioner'snotice-of-evidence claim "was not compelled by existing prec-edent at the time his conviction became final," and thus couldnot be considered in federal habeas proceedings underTeague. 58 F. 3d, at 64.The Commonwealth scheduled petitioner's execution forDecember 14, 1995. Petitioner applied for a stay of execu-tion and petitioned for a writ of certiorari from this Court.We granted his stay application on December 13, 1995. 516U. S. 1034. On January 5, 1996, we granted certiorari, limited to the questions whether petitioner's notice-of-evidenceclaim stated a new rule and whether the Commonwealthviolated petitioner's due process rights under Brady bywithholding evidence exculpating him from responsibilityfor the Sorrell murders. 516 U. S. 1037; see Pet. for Cert. i.IIWe first address petitioner's Brady claim. The DistrictCourt determined that "[t]his claim was not presented to theSupreme Court of Virginia on direct appeal nor in state ha-beas corpus proceedings," and that "the factual basis of theclaim was available to [petitioner] at the time he litigated hisstate habeas corpus petition," and dismissed the claim onthis basis. 1 J. A. 194. Petitioner does not contest thesedeterminations in this Court.Petitioner's failure to raise his Brady claim in state courtimplicates the requirements in habeas of exhaustion and procedural default. Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) bars the grantingof habeas corpus relief "unless it appears that the applicanthas exhausted the remedies available in the courts of theState." Because "[t]his requirement . . . refers only to remedies still available at the time of the federal petition," Englev. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126, n. 28 (1982), it is satisfied "if it isclear that [the habeas petitioner's] claims are now procedur-ally barred under [state] law," Castille v. Peoples, 489 U. S.518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT162 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the Court346, 351 (1989). However, the procedural bar that givesrise to exhaustion provides an independent and adequatestate-law ground for the conviction and sentence, and thusprevents federal habeas corpus review of the defaulted claim,unless the petitioner can demonstrate cause and prejudicefor the default.Teague v. Lane, supra, at 298; Isaac, supra,at 126, n. 28, 129; Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 90-91(1977).In Virginia, "[n]o writ [of habeas corpus ad subjiciendum]shall be granted on the basis of any allegation the facts ofwhich petitioner had knowledge at the time of filing any previous petition." Va. Code Ann. $ 8.01-654(B)(2) (1992). Be-cause petitioner knew of the grounds of hisBrady claimwhen he filed his first petition, $ 8.01-654(B)(2) precludes review of petitioner's claim in any future state habeas proceed-ing. Because petitioner makes no attempt to demonstratecause or prejudice for his default in state habeas proceed-ings, his claim is not cognizable in a federal suit for the writ.IIIAPetitioner makes a separate due process challenge to themanner in which the prosecution introduced evidence aboutthe Sorrell murders. We perceive two separate claims inthis challenge. As we will explain in greater detail below,petitioner raises a "notice-of-evidence" claim, which allegesthat the Commonwealth deprived petitioner of due processby failing to give him adequate notice of the evidence theCommonwealth would introduce in the sentencing phase ofhis trial. He raises a separate "misrepresentation" claim,which alleges that the Commonwealth violated due processby misleading petitioner about the evidence it intended touse at sentencing.In Picard v. Connor, 404 U. S. 270 (1971), we held that,for purposes of exhausting state remedies, a claim for reliefin habeas corpus must include reference to a specific federal518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT163Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Opinion of the Courtconstitutional guarantee, as well as a statement of the factsthat entitle the petitioner to relief. We considered whethera habeas petitioner was entitled to relief on the basis of aclaim, which was not raised in the state courts or in his federal habeas petition, that the indictment procedure by whichhe was brought to trial violated equal protection. Id., at271. In announcing that "the substance of a federal habeascorpus claim must first be presented to the state courts," id.,at 278, we rejected the contention that the petitioner satisfied the exhaustion requirement of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) bypresenting the state courts only with the facts necessary tostate a claim for relief. "The [state court] dealt with thearguments [the habeas petitioner] offered; we cannot faultthat court for failing also to consider sua sponte whether theindictment procedure denied [the petitioner] equal protectionof the laws." Id., at 277.We have also indicated that it is not enough to make ageneral appeal to a constitutional guarantee as broad asdue process to present the "substance" of such a claim to astate court. In Anderson v. Harless, 459 U. S. 4 (1982), thehabeas petitioner was granted relief on the ground that itviolated due process for a jury instruction to obviate therequirement that the prosecutor prove all the elements ofthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 7 (citing Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979)). The only mannerin which the habeas petitioner had cited federal authoritywas by referring to a state-court decision in which "the defendant . . . asserted a broad federal due process right to juryinstructions that properly explain state law." 459 U. S., at7 (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of therecord satisfied us that the Sandstrom claim "was never presented to, or considered by, the [state] courts," but we foundit especially significant that the "broad federal due processright" that the habeas petition might have been read toincorporate did not include "the more particular analysisdeveloped in cases such as Sandstrom." 459 U. S., at 7.518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT164 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the CourtThe due process challenge in petitioner's brief relies ontwo "particular analys[es]" of due process.Ibid. Relyingon cases like Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), andSkipper v. South Carolina, 476 U. S. 1 (1986), petitioner argues that he should have been given " `such notice of theissues involved in the [sentencing] hearing as [would have]reasonably enable[d] him to prepare his case,' " Brief forPetitioner 32 (quoting B. Schwartz, Administrative Law 283(2d ed. 1984)), and that he was denied "a fair opportunityto be heard on determinative sentencing issues," Brief forPetitioner 33. This right stems from the defendant's "legitimate interest in the character of the procedure which leadsto the imposition of sentence" of death, Gardner, 430 U. S.,at 358, which justifies giving him an "opportunity to deny"potentially determinative sentencing information, id., at 362."Yet another way in which the state may unconstitutionally . . . deprive [a defendant] of a meaningful opportunity toaddress the issues, is simply by misinforming him." Brieffor Petitioner 34. Petitioner cites In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S.544 (1968), Raley v. Ohio, 360 U. S. 423 (1959), and Mooneyv. Holohan, 294 U. S. 103 (1935), for this proposition. Ruffalo was a disbarment proceeding in which this Court heldthat the disbarred attorney had not been given notice of thecharges against him by the Ohio committee which administered bar discipline. 390 U. S., at 550. In Raley, the chairman and members of a state investigating commission assured witnesses that the privilege against self-incriminationwas available to them, but when the witnesses were convicted for contempt the Supreme Court of Ohio held that astate immunity statute rendered the Fifth Amendment privilege unavailable. 360 U. S., at 430-434. And in Mooney v.Holohan, the defendant alleged that the prosecution knowingly used perjured testimony at his trial. 294 U. S., at 110.Gardner, Ruffalo, Raley, and Mooney arise in widely differing contexts. Gardner forbids the use of secret testimony in the penalty proceeding of a capital case which the518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT165Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Opinion of the Courtdefendant has had no opportunity to consider or rebut. Ruf-falo deals with a defendant's right to notice of the chargesagainst him. Whether or not Ruffalo might have supportedpetitioner's notice-of-evidence claim, see infra, at 169-170,it does not support the misrepresentation claim for whichpetitioner cites it.Mooney forbade the prosecution to en-gage in "a deliberate deception of court and jury." 294 U. S.,at 112. Raley, though involving no deliberate deception,held that defendants who detrimentally relied on the assurance of a committee chairman could not be punished forhaving done so. Mooney, of course, would lend support topetitioner's claim if it could be shown that the prosecutordeliberately misled him, not just that he changed his mindover the course of the trial. The two claims are separate.BThe Commonwealth argues that the misrepresentationclaim "was never argued before in any court." Brief forRespondent 39. If petitioner never presented this claimon direct appeal or in state habeas proceedings, federalhabeas review of the claim would be barred unless petitionercould demonstrate cause and prejudice for his failure to raisethe claim in state proceedings. Supra, at 161-162. If theclaim was not raised or addressed in federal proceedings,below, our usual practice would be to decline to review it.Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519, 533 (1992).There is some ambiguity as to whether the misrepresentation claim was raised or addressed in the District Court orthe Court of Appeals. On the one hand, the District Courtordered relief primarily on the basis of Gardner, i. e., lack ofnotice.Supra, at 160. On the other hand, some of the Dis-trict Court findings advert to a deliberate decision by theprosecutor to mislead petitioner's counsel for tactical advan-tage. See, e. g., App. 348, 350. The ambiguity in the federalrecord complicates the state-court procedural default issue,because procedural default is an affirmative defense for the518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT166 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the CourtCommonwealth. If the misrepresentation claim was ad-dressed at some stage of federal proceedings, the Commonwealth would have been obligated to raise procedural defaultas a defense, or lose the right to assert the defense thereafter. See Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 234, n. 1 (1980);see alsoSchiro v. Farley, 510 U. S. 222, 227-228 (1994).We remand for the Court of Appeals to determine whetherpetitioner in fact raised what in his briefs on the merits tothis Court he asserts has been his "fundamental complaintthroughout this litigation . . . : the Commonwealth's affirm-ative misrepresentation regarding its presentation of theSorrell murders . . . deprived Petitioner of a fair sentencingproceeding." Reply Brief for Petitioner 4-5. If the misrepresentation claim was raised, the Court of Appeals shouldconsider whether the Commonwealth has preserved any defenses to it and proceed to consider the claim and preserveddefenses as appropriate.CWe turn to the notice-of-evidence claim, and considerwhether the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that thisclaim sought the retroactive application of a new rule of fed-eral constitutional law. We have concluded that the writ'spurpose may be fulfilled with the least intrusion necessaryon States' interest of the finality of criminal proceedings byapplying constitutional standards contemporaneous with thehabeas petitioner's conviction to review his petition. SeeTeague, 489 U. S., at 309-310 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).Thus, habeas relief is appropriate only if "a state courtconsidering [the petitioner's] claim at the time his convictionbecame final would have felt compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule [he] seeks was required by theConstitution." Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990).At the latest, petitioner knew at the start of trial thatthe prosecutor intended to introduce evidence tending toshow that he committed the Sorrell murders. He knew thenthat the Commonwealth would call Tucker to the stand to518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT167Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Opinion of the Courtrepeat his statement that petitioner had admitted to commit-ting the murders.3 See App. 340; 14 Record 8-9. He nonetheless contends that he was deprived of adequate noticeof theother witnesses, the police officer and the medical examiner who had investigated the Sorrell murders, whom hewas advised that the prosecutor would call only on the eve-ning before the sentencing hearing. App. 342; 18 Record777. But petitioner did not attempt to cure this inadequacyof notice by requesting more time to respond to this evidence. He instead moved "to have excluded from evidenceduring this penalty trial any evidence pertaining to anyother--any felony for which the defendant has not yet beencharged."4 Id., at 776.On these facts, for petitioner to prevail on his notice-of-evidence claim, he must establish that due process requiresthat he receive more than a day's notice of the Common-wealth's evidence. He must also establish that due processrequired a continuance whether or not he sought one, or that,if he chose not to seek a continuance, exclusion was the onlyappropriate remedy for the inadequate notice. We concludethat only the adoption of a new constitutional rule couldestablish these propositions.A defendant's right to notice of the charges against whichhe must defend is well established. In re Ruffalo, 390 U. S.3 When petitioner did object later, at the start of the penalty phase, tothe admission of all the Sorrell murder evidence, counsel conceded that hewould have been prepared to refute such evidence if it had consisted onlyof testimony by Tucker or petitioner's fellow inmates that petitioner hadadmitted to killing the Sorrells. See 18 Record 722, 780.4 The District Court described petitioner's counsel as having made a"plea for additional time to prepare." App. 343. The Court of Appealsfound this plea insufficient to have legal effect in court: "If the defense feltunprepared to undertake effective cross-examination, one would think aformal motion for continuance would have been forthcoming, but none wasever made; counsel moved only that the evidence be excluded." Grayv. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59, 64 (CA4 1995). We agree with the Court ofAppeals.518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT168 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the Court544 (1968); Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U. S. 196 (1948). But adefendant's claim that he has a right to notice of the evidencethat the state plans to use to prove the charges stands onquite a different footing. We have said that "the Due Process Clause has little to say regarding the amount of discoverywhich the parties must be afforded." Wardius v. Oregon,412 U. S. 470, 474 (1973). In Weatherford v. Bursey, 429U. S. 545 (1977), we considered the due process claim of adefendant who had been convicted with the aid of surprisetestimony of an accomplice who was an undercover agent.Although the prosecutor had not intended to introduce theagent's testimony, he changed his mind the day of trial. Id.,at 549. To keep his cover, the agent had told the defendantand his counsel that he would not testify against the defendant. Id., at 560. We rejected the defendant's claim, explaining that "[t]here is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal case, and Brady," which addressed onlyexculpatory evidence, "did not create one," id., at 559. Toput it mildly, these cases do not compel a court to order theprosecutor to disclose his evidence; their import, in fact, isstrongly against the validity of petitioner's claim.Petitioner relies principally on Gardner v. Florida, 430U. S. 349 (1977), for the proposition that a defendant may notbe sentenced to death "on the basis of information which hehad no opportunity to deny or explain." Id., at 362 (opinionof Stevens, J.). In Gardner, the trial court sentenced thedefendant to death relying in part on evidence assembled ina presentence investigation by the state parole commission;the "investigation report contained a confidential portionwhich was not disclosed to defense counsel." Id., at 353.Gardner literally had no opportunity to even see the confidential information, let alone contest it. Petitioner in thepresent case, on the other hand, had the opportunity to hearthe testimony of Officer Slezak and Dr. Presswalla in opencourt, and to cross-examine them. His claim to notice is518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT169Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Opinion of the Courtmuch more akin to the one rejected in Weatherford, supra,than to the one upheld inGardner.Even were our cases otherwise on the notice issue, wehave acknowledged that exclusion of evidence is not the soleremedy for a violation of a conceded right to notice of analibi witness. In Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U. S. 400 (1988), wesaid that in this situation "a less drastic sanction is alwaysavailable. Prejudice . . . could be minimized by granting acontinuance."Id., at 413. Here, counsel did not request acontinuance; he argued only for exclusion. Counsel arguedthat the evidence should be excluded not only because hewas not prepared to contest the evidence, but also becauseit exceeded the standard in Virginia, Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d 422 (1985), for relevance ofunsolved-crime evidence to sentencing. See 18 Record 723.In view of petitioner's insistence on exclusion of the evidence, the trial court might well have felt that it would havebeen interfering with a tactical decision of counsel to ordera continuance on its own motion.The dissent argues that petitioner seeks the benefit ofa well-established rule, that "a capital defendant must beafforded a meaningful opportunity to explain or deny theevidence introduced against him at sentencing." Post, at180. Because we disagree with the dissent's assertion thatpetitioner moved for a continuance, we disagree with itscharacterization of the constitutional rule underlying hisclaim for relief. Compare supra, at 166-167, and n. 4, withpost, at 184-185, n. 11. The dissent glosses over the similarities between this case and Weatherford, which " `dictate[s],' " post, at 180, the disposition of petitioner's claim--adversely to petitioner--more clearly than any precedentcited by the dissent. But even without Weatherford andpetitioner's failure to move for a continuance, we would stillthink the new-rule doctrine "would be meaningless if appliedat this level of generality." Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227,236 (1990). We therefore hold that petitioner's notice-of518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT170 GRAY v. NETHERLANDOpinion of the Courtevidence claim would require the adoption of a new constitutional rule.DPetitioner argues that relief should be granted nonetheless, because the new rule he proposes falls within one ofTeague's two exceptions. "The first exception permits theretroactive application of a new rule if the rule places a classof private conduct beyond the power of the State to proscribe." Parks, 494 U. S., at 494 (citing Teague, 489 U. S.,at 311). This exception is not at issue here. "The secondexception is for `watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Parks, supra, at 495 (citing Teague, supra,at 311; Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 416 (1990)). Petitioner argues that his notice-of-evidence new rule is "mandated by long-recognized principles of fundamental fairnesscritical to accuracy in capital sentencing determinations."Brief for Petitioner 47.We observed in Saffle v. Parks that the paradigmatic example of a watershed rule of criminal procedure is the requirement that counsel be provided in all criminal trials forserious offenses. 494 U. S., at 495 (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963)). "Whatever one may think ofthe importance of [petitioner's] proposed rule, it has none ofthe primacy and centrality of the rule adopted in Gideon orother rules which may be thought to be within the exception." Parks, supra, at 495. The rule in Teague thereforeapplies, and petitioner may not obtain habeas relief on hisnotice-of-evidence claim.IVWe hold that petitioner's Brady claim is procedurallydefaulted and that his notice-of-evidence claim seeks retroactive application of a new rule. Neither claim states aground upon which relief may be granted in federal habeascorpus proceedings. However, we vacate the judgment of518US1$75H 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT171Cite as: 518 U.

It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, dissenting.Justice Ginsburg has cogently explained why well-settled law requires the reversal of the judgment of theCourt of Appeals. I join her opinion with this additionalobservation. The evidence tending to support the proposition that petitioner committed the Sorrell murders was noteven sufficient to support the filing of charges against him.Whatever limits due process places upon the introduction ofevidence of unadjudicated conduct in capital cases, theysurely were exceeded here. Given the "vital importance"that "any decision to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or emotion,"the sentencing proceeding would have been fundamentallyunfair even if the prosecutors had given defense counsel fairnotice of their intent to offer this evidence. SeeGardner v.Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 357-358 (1977) (opinion ofStevens,J.).Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.Basic to due process in criminal proceedings is the rightto a full, fair, potentially effective opportunity to defendagainst the State's charges. Petitioner Gray was not ac-corded that fundamental right at the penalty phase of histrial for capital murder. I therefore conclude that no "newrule" is implicated in his petition for habeas corpus, anddissent from the Court's decision, which denies Gray theresentencing proceeding he seeks.IPetitioner Coleman Gray's murder trial began on Monday,December 2, 1985, in the city of Suffolk, Virginia. He was518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT172 GRAY v. NETHERLANDGinsburg, J., dissentingcharged with killing Richard McClelland during the commission of a robbery, a capital offense. Va. Code Ann. $ 18.2-31(4) (Supp. 1995). Under Virginia law, the trial would proceed in two stages: During the guilt phase, the jury woulddetermine whether Gray was guilty of capital murder; andduring the penalty phase, the jury would decide whetherGray should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.See Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-264.4(A) (1995).At an in-chambers conference before the guilt phasebegan, Gray's lawyers requested a court order directingthe prosecutor to disclose the evidence he would introduceduring the penalty phase if Gray were convicted.1 Defensecounsel wanted to know, in particular, whether the prosecutor planned to introduce evidence relating to the murdersof Lisa Sorrell and her 3-year-old daughter, Shanta. Defense counsel informed the trial court of the basis for therequest:". . . Your Honor, this is my concern. We will probably at the very best stop in the middle of the day orlate in the afternoon and start the penalty trial the nextday. . . . [W]e have good reason to believe that [the prosecutor] is going to call people to introduce a statementthat our client supposedly made to another inmate thathe murdered [the Sorrells] which were very violent andwell-known crimes throughout this entire area."If that comes in we are going to want to know it inadvance so we can be prepared on our argument. . . . It'sabsolute dynamite." 3 Joint Appendix in No. 94-4009(CA4), pp. 1328-1329 (hereinafter J. A.).1 This request was made pursuant to Peterson v. Commonwealth, 225Va. 289, 302 S. E. 2d 520 (1983), which instructed that, under Virginia law,the "preferred practice" in capital trials "is to make known to [the defendant] before trial the evidence that is to be adduced at the penalty stage ifhe is found guilty." Id., at 298, 302 S. E. 2d, at 526.518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT173Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Ginsburg, J., dissentingThe Sorrell murders "were one of the most highly publicized crimes in the history of the Tidewater, Virginia area."App. 341. In December 1984, five days after they were reported missing, Lisa and Shanta Sorrell were found dead ina partially burned car in Chesapeake, Virginia, a city thatshares borders with Suffolk. Lisa's body was slumped inthe front passenger seat of the car; she had been shot in thehead six times. Shanta had been removed from her car seatand locked in the trunk, where she died after inhaling smokeproduced by the fire in the car's passenger compartment.Neither Gray nor anyone else has ever been charged withcommission of the Sorrell murders.2In response to defense counsel's disclosure request, theprosecutor told Gray's lawyers and the court that he wouldintroduce "statements" Gray had made to other inmates inwhich Gray allegedly admitted killing the Sorrells. The following exchange then took place between defense counselMoore and prosecutor Ferguson:"MR. MOORE: Is it going to be evidence or just hisstatement?"MR. FERGUSON: Statements that your client made."MR. MOORE: Nothing other than statements?"MR. FERGUSON: To other people, that's correct.Statements made by your client that he did thesethings." 3 J. A. 1331 (emphasis added).2 That Gray had not been convicted of killing the Sorrells would not,under Virginia law, bar admission of evidence relating to those crimesduring the penalty phase of his trial. One of Virginia's two aggravatingcircumstances requires the jury to determine whether "there is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that wouldconstitute a continuing serious threat to society." Va. Code Ann. $ 19.2-264.2 (1995). The Virginia Supreme Court has held that "evidence ofprior unadjudicated criminal conduct . . . may be used in the penalty phaseto prove the defendant's propensity to commit criminal acts of violence inthe future." Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 488, 331 S. E. 2d422, 436 (1985).518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT174 GRAY v. NETHERLANDGinsburg, J., dissentingAfter the in-chambers conference ended, the guilt phase ofthe trial began. Three days later, at 4 o'clock on Thursdayafternoon, December 5, the jury returned a verdict findingGray guilty of the capital murder of McClelland. Proceedings were adjourned for the day, with the penalty phase tobegin at 9:30 the next morning.That evening, the prosecutor informed defense counselthat, in addition to Gray's statements, he planned to intro-duce further evidence relating to the Sorrell murders. Thatfurther evidence included: (1) the testimony of DetectiveSlezak, the police officer who investigated the Sorrell murders, regarding his observations at the crime scene shortlyafter the bodies of Lisa and Shanta were discovered; (2)graphic photographs of the crime scene, depicting the interior of the partially burned car, Lisa's body in the front seat,and Shanta's body in the trunk; (3) the testimony of DoctorPresswalla, the state medical examiner who conducted theautopsies of the victims, regarding the causes of their deaths;(4) graphic photographs of the victims at the time of theautopsies, including a photograph depicting the back of Lisa'shead, shaved to reveal six gunshot wounds; and (5) DoctorPresswalla's autopsy reports. See App. 29-37, 40-47.This additional evidence, advanced by the prosecutor onthe eve of the penalty phase, suggested that the Sorrell murders were carried out in a manner "strikingly similar" to themurder of McClelland. Gray v. Commonwealth, 233 Va.313, 347, 356 S. E. 2d 157, 176 (1987). Like Lisa Sorrell,McClelland had been shot six times in the head; his car, too,had been partially burned. As defense counsel later explained, "the similarities between the McClelland murderand the Sorrell murder would be obvious to anyone sittingin a jury box." App. 141.On Friday morning, December 6, before trial proceedingsresumed, defense counsel informed the court of Thursdayevening's developments. Gray's lawyers told the court theyhad learned for the first time the previous evening that the518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT175Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Ginsburg, J., dissentingprosecutor planned to introduce evidence relating to the Sor-rell murders other than Gray's alleged statements. Counselstated that while they were prepared to rebut the state-ments, they were "not prepared to rebut [the additional evidence] . . . because of the shortness of notice." 4 J. A. 2065."We are not prepared to try the Sorrell murder today," coun-sel told the court. "We have not been given sufficient notice." Ibid.Gray's lawyers argued that the case relied on by the prosecutor, Watkins v. Commonwealth, 229 Va. 469, 331 S. E. 2d422 (1985), was distinguishable. There, counsel explained,separate murder charges were outstanding against the defendant, and "[t]he lawyers who were representing [Watkins]in the first murder trial were already representing him withrespect to the second murders. They were aware of all thecharges, were aware of the evidence that was available tothe Commonwealth in the second murder charge and werein a position to confront the evidence . . . that would comein [during] the penalty trial." 4 J. A. 2065-2066. In contrast to the situation in Watkins, counsel pointed out, "[w]eare not prepared for any of this, other than [Gray] may havemade some incriminating statements." 4 J. A. 2067. Thetrial court nonetheless ruled that the Sorrell murders evidence was "admissible at this stage of the trial." Id., at2068.The penalty phase of the trial then commenced. Theprosecutor, in keeping with his representations before theguilt phase began, called Melvin Tucker to the stand.Tucker was Gray's accomplice in the McClelland murder;he, along with Gray, had initially been charged with capitalmurder. After plea negotiations, however, the prosecutoragreed to reduce the charge against Tucker to first-degreemurder, a noncapital offense, in exchange for Tucker's testimony against Gray. App. 339, and n. 3. Tucker testifiedduring the guilt phase that Gray had been the "trigger man"in McClelland's murder.518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT176 GRAY v. NETHERLANDGinsburg, J., dissentingTucker testified at the penalty phase that, shortly afterthe McClelland robbery, he and Gray "were searchingthrough the newspaper for some information" on the crime.Id., at 22. According to Tucker, Gray stated that he had"knocked off " Lisa Sorrell, and pointed to a picture of LisaSorrell in the newspaper.Id., at 22-23.3 Gray's lawyersdeclined to cross-examine Tucker after his penalty phase testimony; in their view, Tucker's motive to lie had already beenadequately exposed during the guilt phase. See id., at 157(testimony of defense counsel Moore) ("Melvin Tucker hadbeen . . . extensively . . . cross-examined during the guiltphase . . . . The same jurors who were sitting there duringthe guilt trial were there during the penalty phase and theyhad been told and drawn a pretty accurate picture as to whyMelvin Tucker would strike a deal and tell anybody anythingthey wanted to hear. To save his life. That didn't need tobe brought up again.").The prosecutor then called Detective Slezak. Defensecounsel renewed their objection, outside the presence of thejury, to admission of any evidence relating to the Sorrellmurders other than Gray's statements. Counsel reiteratedthat they had "had no notice of this," and had been "takenby surprise." Id., at 25. What the prosecutor "is goingto do today," they emphasized, "is not what he said hewas going to do at the beginning of trial." Id., at 27. Thecourt adhered to its earlier ruling that the evidence wasadmissible.With nothing more than Tucker's testimony linking Grayto the Sorrell murders, the trial court then allowed theprosecutor to introduce the testimony of Detective Slezakand Doctor Presswalla, as well as crime scene and autopsy3 As the District Court suggested, in one respect this version of eventsis implausible. The McClelland murder occurred in May 1985, some sixmonths after the Sorrells had been killed. No newspaper from May 1985containing a photograph of Lisa Sorrell was ever introduced into evidence.See App. 343.518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT177Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Ginsburg, J., dissentingphotographs and the victims' autopsy reports. See ante, at157-158. During the defense case, Gray took the stand, admitted complicity in the McClelland murder but denied beingthe "triggerman," and denied any involvement in the Sorrell murders. App. 346-347. After closing arguments, inwhich the prosecutor highlighted the similarities betweenthe Sorrell and McClelland murders, and urged that Gray'scommission of the Sorrell murders demonstrated his "futuredangerous[ness]," seeid., at 51-53, the jury fixed Gray's punishment at death.Gray unsuccessfully argued on direct appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court and in state habeas proceedings thatadmission of the additional Sorrell murders evidence violatedhis right to a fair trial under the Fourteenth Amendment.Gray then filed a federal habeas petition in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. Grayargued, among other things, that admission of the Sorrellmurders evidence violated his Fourteenth Amendmentrights. 1 J. A. 35. Specifically, he asserted:"The Commonwealth did not disclose its intentions touse the Sorrell murders as evidence against Gray untilsuch a late date that it was impossible for Gray's defensecounsel reasonably to prepare or defend against suchevidence at trial. Because of the late notice, . . . Graycould not adequately prepare to defend his innocenceregarding the Sorrell murders."Id., at 33.The District Court concluded that other claims pressed byGray in his federal habeas petition were either procedurallybarred or meritless. The court found, however, that theSorrell evidence claim "was consistently raised in the Statecourts and is not procedurally defaulted." Id., at 253.After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the DistrictCourt granted Gray a writ of habeas corpus. Relying primarily on Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), the courtheld that Gray's due process rights were violated "because518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT178 GRAY v. NETHERLANDGinsburg, J., dissentingthe Commonwealth failed to provide fair notice that evidenceconcerning the Sorrell murders would be introduced at hispenalty phase," App. 348; consequently, Gray became vulner-able to a death sentence on the basis of information he hadscant opportunity to deny or explain, see id., at 349-351.Recalling the prosecutor's Monday morning affirmations thathe would introduce only Gray's "statements," the DistrictCourt noted that Gray's lawyers were "clearly and justifiably. . . shocked" when the prosecutor reported, Thursday eve-ning, his intention to introduce, the next day, further evidence on the Sorrell murders. Id., at 350. "The only Sor-rell murder evidence which [Gray's lawyers] were preparedto challenge," the District Court recounted, "was the evi-dence [the prosecutor] indicated he would introduce at theoutset of the trial: Melvin Tucker's statement that Grayallegedly had confessed to the murders." Id., at 346. Theprosecutor's surprise move had disarmed Gray's counsel, theDistrict Court recognized, leaving them without capacity tocross-examine Detective Slezak and Doctor Presswalla effec-tively, with the result that the Sorrell murders evidence"carrie[d] no assurance of reliability." Id., at 351."The consequences of this surprise," the District Courtfound, "could not have been more devastating." Id., at 350.Most critically, the prosecutor's "statements only" assuranceled defense counsel to forgo investigation of the details ofthe Sorrell murders, including a review of the evidence collected by the Chesapeake police department during its in-vestigation of the crimes. See ibid. Had Gray's lawyersconducted such a review, they could have shown that noneof the forensic evidence collected by the Chesapeake policedirectly linked Gray to the Sorrell murders.4 Moreover, theevidence the Chesapeake police did obtain "strongly sug4 The District Court noted, in this regard, that an investigator engagedby Gray's federal habeas counsel had run a driving test indicating that"Coleman Gray could not have performed the Sorrell murders on his wife'sdinner hour, as the prosecutor speculated."

S. 152 (1996)Ginsburg, J., dissentinggested that Timothy Sorrell"--Lisa's husband and Shanta'sfather--"actually committed the notorious murders." Id.,at 350-351.Indeed, for a substantial period of time following the Sorrell murders, Timothy Sorrell was the prime suspect in thecase.5 Police suspicion focused on Mr. Sorrell the night Lisaand Shanta were found dead. When Detective Slezak andanother officer informed Mr. Sorrell of the grim discovery,his statements and demeanor made the officers "highly sus-picious."Id., at 186.6Police subsequently learned that Timothy Sorrell had anapparent motive for the murders. Two weeks before Lisaand Shanta were killed, the Sorrells obtained a life insurancepolicy, which designated Timothy and Shanta as beneficiariesin the event of Lisa's death. Id., at 344.7 Lisa's parentslater filed a lawsuit to stop Mr. Sorrell from obtaining theproceeds of the insurance policy, alleging that he was responsible for Lisa's death. Ibid. In addition, police uncoveredevidence suggesting that Mr. Sorrell was involved in a stolenmerchandise ring at his place of employment, the Naval Sup-ply Center, and that Lisa "was very angry and unhappyabout her husband's apparent criminal activities." Id., at345.8 Based on this information, Detective Slezak asked the5 Police designated Mr. Sorrell as the sole suspect on evidence they sentto crime labs for analysis. Id., at 344.6 Asked to describe what about Mr. Sorrell's demeanor made him suspicious, Slezak testified: "I don't know how to describe it other than to saythat it was not what you would expect to find in a situation like that. Hejust seemed defensive." Id., at 186.7 By contrast, police never established Gray's supposed motive for killingthe Sorrells. Lisa was found with her jewelry (a necklace and gold earrings) undisturbed, as well as cash and a postal money order for $280,id., at 316, suggesting that robbery was not the perpetrator's motive, id.,at 317.8 Despite defense counsel's pretrial request for all exculpatory evidencepursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963), the prosecutor neverdisclosed the evidence incriminating Timothy Sorrell. Gray presented aBrady claim in his federal habeas petition, but the District Court noted518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT180 GRAY v. NETHERLANDGinsburg, J., dissentinglocal Commonwealth's Attorney "to determine whether itwas appropriate to prosecute Timothy Sorrell." Ibid.9Assessing the prejudicial potency of the Sorrell murdersevidence admitted at the penalty phase of Gray's trial, theDistrict Court concluded that the due process violation wasnot harmless.Id., at 353. The District Court therefore va-cated Gray's death sentence, and remanded the case to thestate trial court for resentencing.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.Gray v. Thompson, 58 F. 3d 59 (1995). It held that federalhabeas relief was barred because Gray's due process claimdepended on a "new rule" of constitutional law which, underTeague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), could not be applied oncollateral review. The Court of Appeals accordingly remanded the case, directing the District Court to dismissGray's habeas petition.IIA case announces a "new rule" under Teague "if the resultwas notdictated by precedent existing at the time the de-fendant's conviction became final." Id., at 301 (pluralityopinion). Gray's conviction became final in 1987, when wedenied certiorari to review the Virginia Supreme Court's decision on direct appeal. See Gray v. Virginia, 484 U. S. 873(1987). As explained below, precedent decided well before1987 "dictates" the conclusion that Gray was not accordeddue process at the penalty phase of his trial.Gray's claim is encompassing, but it is fundamental.Under the Due Process Clause, he contends, a capital defendant must be afforded a meaningful opportunity to explain ordeny the evidence introduced against him at sentencing.See Brief for Petitioner 45; Reply Brief for Petitioner 5.that the claim had not been raised in state court, and therefore held itprocedurally barred. 1 J. A. 194.9 After Gray's trial, the local prosecutor reportedly stated in an affidavitthat Mr. Sorrell was no longer a suspect. See 2 id., at 927 (news reportin The Virginian-Pilot, Jan. 7, 1986, p. D1).518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT181Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Ginsburg, J., dissentingThe District Court concluded that Gray was stripped of anymeaningful opportunity to explain or deny the Sorrell murders evidence, for his lawyers were unfairly "ambushed"--clearly surprised and devastatingly disarmed by the prosecutor's decision, announced on the eve of the penalty trial, tointroduce extensive evidence other than Gray's statements.App. 349-351. Gray's counsel reasonably relied on theprosecutor's unequivocal "statements only" pledge, see id.,at 342, made at the outset of trial; based on the prosecutor'sassurances, defense counsel spent no resources trackingdown information in police records on the Sorrell murders.The prosecutor's switch, altogether unanticipated by defensecounsel, left them with no chance to uncover, through theirown investigation, information that could have defused theprosecutor's case, in short, without time to prepare an effective defense. Id., at 351.The Fourth Circuit recast Gray's claim, transforming itinto an assertion of a broad constitutional right to discoveryin capital cases. See 58 F. 3d, at 64-65. This Court alsorestates and reshapes Gray's claim. The Court first slicesGray's whole claim into pieces; it then deals discretely witheach segment it "perceive[s]," ante, at 162: a "misrepresentation" claim, ante, at 166; and a supposed "notice-ofevidence" claim, ante, at 166-170. Gray, himself, however,has "never claimed a constitutional right to advance discovery of the Commonwealth's evidence." Brief for Petitioner46, n. 37, and accompanying text. His own claim is morebasic and should not succumb to artificial endeavors to divideand conquer it.There is nothing "new" in a rule that capital defendantsmust be afforded a meaningful opportunity to defend againstthe State's penalty phase evidence. As this Court affirmedmore than a century ago: "Common justice requires that noman shall be condemned in his person or property without. . . an opportunity to make his defence." Baldwin v. Hale,1 Wall. 223, 233 (1864). See also Windsor v. McVeigh, 93518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT182 GRAY v. NETHERLANDGinsburg, J., dissentingU. S. 274, 277 (1876). A pro forma opportunity will not do.10Due process demands an opportunity to be heard "at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner." Armstrong v.Manzo, 380 U. S. 545, 552 (1965); see In re Oliver, 333 U. S.257, 275 (1948) (defendant must be afforded "a reasonableopportunity to meet [the charges against him] by way ofdefense or explanation"); Morgan v. United States, 304 U. S.1, 18 (1938) ("The right to a hearing embraces not onlythe right to present evidence but also a reasonable opportu-nity to know the claims of the opposing party and to meetthem."). Absent a full, fair, potentially effective opportu-nity to defend against the State's charges, the right to ahearing would be "but a barren one." Ibid.; see Mullane v.Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U. S. 306, 315 (1950)("process which is a mere gesture is not due process").In Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349 (1977), the principaldecision relied on by the District Court, we confirmed thatthe sentencing phase of a capital trial "must satisfy therequirements of the Due Process Clause." Id., at 358 (plu-rality opinion).Gardner presented the question whether adefendant was denied due process when the trial judge sentenced him to death relying in part on a presentence report,including a confidential portion not disclosed to defense counsel. Counsel's deprivation of an "opportunity . . . to chal-lenge the accuracy or materiality" of the undisclosed information, id., at 356, the Gardner plurality reasoned, left amanifest risk that "some of the information accepted in confidence may [have been] erroneous, or . . . misinterpreted,"10 Cf. In re Gault, 387 U. S. 1, 33 (1967) (notice to parents the nightbefore a juvenile delinquency hearing was constitutionally inadequate; dueprocess requires that notice "be given sufficiently in advance of scheduledcourt proceedings so that reasonable opportunity to prepare will be afforded"); Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 58 (1932) (defense counselappointed the morning of trial could not satisfy the constitutional requirement because counsel lacked opportunity to investigate the case;Court observed that "[t]o decide otherwise, would simply be to ignoreactualities").518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT183Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Ginsburg, J., dissentingid., at 359. As a basis for a death sentence, Gardnerteaches, information unexposed to adversary testing doesnot qualify as reliable. See ibid. The Gardner Courtvacated the defendant's sentence, concluding that he "wasdenied due process of law when the death [penalty] wasimposed, at least in part, on the basis of information whichhe had no opportunity to deny or explain."Id., at 362.Urging that Gardner fails to "dictate" a decision for Grayhere, the Commonwealth relies on the Fourth Circuit's reasoning to this effect: Gardner was a case about "secrecy";Gray's case is about "surprise." See 58 F. 3d, at 65. Therefore, Gray seeks an extension, not an application, of Gardner,see Brief for Respondent 30, in Teague parlance, a "newrule," Brief for Respondent 31. It would be an impermissible "leap," the Fourth Circuit maintained, to equate to afailure to disclose, a disclosure in fact made, "but allegedlyso late as to be unfair." 58 F. 3d, at 65.Teague is not the straitjacket the Commonwealth misunderstands it to be. Teague requires federal courts to decidea habeas petitioner's constitutional claims according to the"law prevailing at the time [his] conviction became final."489 U. S., at 306 (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marksomitted). But Teague does not bar federal habeas courtsfrom applying, in "a myriad of factual contexts," law that issettled--here, the right to a meaningful chance to defendagainst or explain charges pressed by the State. SeeWright v. West, 505 U.

Ordinarily, it is incumbent upon defense counsel,518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT184 GRAY v. NETHERLANDGinsburg, J., dissentingafter receiving adequate notice of the triable issues, to pur-sue whatever investigation is needed to rebut relevant evidence the State may introduce. Here, however, in keepingwith the practice approved by Virginia's highest court, seesupra, at 172, and n. 1, the prosecutor expressly delineatedthe scope and character of the evidence he would introducewith respect to the Sorrell murders: nothing other thanstatements Gray himself allegedly made, seesupra, at 173.Gray's lawyers reasonably relied on the prosecutor's "statements only" assurance by forgoing inquiry into the details ofthe Sorrell crimes. Resource-consuming investigation, theyresponsibly determined, was unnecessary to cast doubt onthe veracity of inmate "snitch" testimony, the only evidencethe prosecutor initially said he would offer.Gray's lawyers were undeniably caught short by the prose-cutor's startling announcement, the night before the penaltyphase was to begin, that he would in effect put on a "mini-trial" of the Sorrell murders. At that point, Gray's lawyerscould not possibly conduct the investigation and preparationnecessary to counter the prosecutor's newly announced evidence. Thus, at the penalty trial, defense counsel were reduced nearly to the role of spectators. Lacking proof, lateruncovered, that "strongly suggested" Timothy Sorrell, notGray, was the actual killer, App. 350-351, Gray's lawyerscould mount only a feeble cross-examination of DetectiveSlezak; counsel simply inquired of the detective whetherhighly publicized crimes could prompt "copycat" crimes,see id., at 37-40. Gray's lawyers had no questions at all forDoctor Presswalla, the medical examiner who testified aboutthe Sorrell autopsies. Id., at 47.1111 The Court attaches weight to the failure of Gray's lawyers to ask explicitly for deferral of the penalty phase. See ante, at 167, 169. It isuncontested that defense counsel made no formal motion for a continuance.But as the District Court described the morning-of-trial episode, counsel"plea[ded] for additional time to prepare." App. 343. And as earliernoted, see supra, at 174-175, counsel was explicit about the dilemma con518US1$75P 05-18-99 20:35:35 PAGES OPINPGT185Cite as: 518 U. S. 152 (1996)Ginsburg, J., dissentingIn sum, the record shows, beyond genuine debate, thatGray was not afforded a "meaningful" opportunity to defendagainst the additional Sorrell murders evidence. The fatalinfection present in Gardner infects this case as well: Defense counsel were effectively deprived of an opportunity tochallenge the "accuracy or materiality" of information reliedon in imposing the death sentence. Gardner, 430 U. S., at356. Unexposed to adversary testing, the Sorrell murdersevidence "carrie[d] no assurance of reliability." App. 351.The "debate between adversaries," valued in our system ofjustice for its contribution "to the truth-seeking function oftrials," Gardner, 430 U. S., at 360, was precluded here bythe prosecutor's eve-of-sentencing shift, and the trial court'stolerance of it. To hold otherwise "would simply be toignore actualities." Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 58(1932).12fronting the defense: "We are not prepared to try the Sorrell murdertoday." 4 J. A. 2065. The Court's suggestion that "this plea [was] insufficient to have legal effect in court," ante, at 167, n. 4, is puzzling. Neitherthe Court, the Fourth Circuit, nor the Commonwealth has cited any Virginia authority for this proposition. Cf. Smith v. Estelle, 602 F. 2d 694,701, n. 8 (CA5 1979) ("the state points us to no rule of Texas law sayingthat moving for a continuance is the only way to object to surprise"), aff 'don other grounds, 451 U. S. 454 (1981). Given the potency of the evidencein question, it is difficult to comprehend the Court's speculation that defense counsel, for "tactical" reasons, may have wanted only exclusion andnot more time. Compare ante, at 169, with Tr. of Oral Arg. 11 (counselfor petitioner urged that if a trial judge is asked, "please stop this fromhappening . . . , it violates my [client's] right to a fair trial," the existenceof that right should not turn on whether counsel next says, "please excludethis evidence, as opposed to please give me more time").12 Weatherford v. Bursey, 429 U. S. 545 (1977), featured by the Court,see ante, at 168, 169-170, hardly controls this case. There, the State'switness, and not the prosecutor, misled defense counsel. 429 U. S., at 560.Furthermore, Weatherford did not involve the penalty phase of a capitaltrial, a stage at which reliability concerns are most vital. Finally, thedefendant in Weatherford did not object at trial to the surprise witness,and did not later show how he was prejudiced by the surprise.

PENA, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION,et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuitNo. 95-365. Argued April 15, 1996--Decided June 20, 1996Respondents terminated petitioner Lane's enrollment at the United StatesMerchant Marine Academy on the ground that his recently diagnoseddiabetes mellitus rendered him ineligible to be commissioned for servicein the Navy/Merchant Marine Reserve Program or as a Naval ReserveOfficer. Alleging that his separation from the Academy violated$ 504(a) of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973--which prohibits, among otherthings, discrimination on the basis of disability "under any program oractivity conducted by any Executive agency"--Lane brought this suitseeking reinstatement to the Academy, compensatory damages, andother remedies. The District Court ordered him reinstated, but ultimately ruled that he must be denied compensatory damages becauseCongress has not waived the Federal Government's sovereign immunityagainst monetary damages awards for $ 504(a) violations. The Court ofAppeals summarily affirmed.Held: Congress has not waived the Government's sovereign immunityagainst monetary damages awards for $ 504(a) violations. Pp. 191-200.(a) The requisite "unequivocal expression" of congressional intent togrant such a waiver, see, e. g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs,498 U. S. 89, 95, is lacking in the text of $ 505(a)(2), which decrees thatthe remedies available for violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Actof 1964--including monetary damages awards, see, e. g., Franklin v.Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 70--apply also to $ 504(a)violations "by any . . . Federal provider of [financial] assistance." Thisprovision makes no mention whatsoever of "program[s] or activit[ies]conducted by any Executive agency," the plainly more far-reaching language Congress employed in $ 504(a) itself. The lack of the necessaryclarity of expression in $ 505(a)(2) is underscored by the precision withwhich Congress has waived the Government's sovereign immunity in$$ 501 and 505(a)(1) of the Act and in the Civil Rights Act of 1991.Lane's contention that the larger statutory scheme indicates congressional intent to "level the playing field" by subjecting the Governmentto the same remedies as any and all other $ 504(a) defendants is rejected.Franklin, supra, at 69-71, distinguished.

PENASyllabus(b) The "equalization" provision of $ 1003 of the Rehabilitation ActAmendments of 1986--which, after waiving the States' EleventhAmendment immunity from federal-court suit for violations of $ 504 andother civil rights statutes, specifies that legal and equitable remediesare available in such a suit "to the same extent as . . . in the suit againstany public or private entity other than a State"--does not reveal congressional intent to equalize the remedies available against all defendants for $ 504(a) violations, such that federal agencies, like private entities, must be subject to monetary damages. Although Lane's argumentto this effect is not without force, it is ultimately defeated by the existence of at least two other conceivable, if not entirely satisfactory, interpretations of the equalization provision: (1) that "public . . . entit[ies]"refers to the nonfederal public entities receiving federal financial assistance that are covered by each of the referenced federal statutes; and (2)that "public or private entit[ies]" is meant only to subject the States tothe scope of remedies available against either public or private $ 504defendants, whatever the lesser (or perhaps the greater) of those remedies might be.
