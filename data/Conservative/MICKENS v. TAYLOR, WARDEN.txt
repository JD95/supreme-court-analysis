The question presented in this case is what a defendantmust show in order to demonstrate a Sixth Amendment violation where the trial court fails to inquire into a potentialconflict of interest about which it knew or reasonably shouldhave known. IIn 1993, a Virginia jury convicted petitioner Mickens ofthe premeditated murder of Timothy Hall during or following the commission of an attempted forcible sodomy. Find-ing the murder outrageously and wantonly vile, it sentencedpetitioner to death. In June 1998, Mickens filed a petitionfor writ of habeas corpus, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 (1994 ed. andSupp. V), in the United States District Court for the EasternDistrict of Virginia, alleging, inter alia, that he was deniedeffective assistance of counsel because one of his court-appointed attorneys had a conflict of interest at trial. Federal habeas counsel had discovered that petitioner's lead trialattorney, Bryan Saunders, was representing Hall (the victim) on assault and concealed-weapons charges at the timeof the murder. Saunders had been appointed to representHall, a juvenile, on March 20, 1992, and had met with himonce for 15 to 30 minutes some time the following week.Hall's body was discovered on March 30, 1992, and four days*Kent S.

On April 6, 1992, the same judge appointed Saunders to represent petitioner. Saunders did not disclose tothe court, his co-counsel, or petitioner that he had previouslyrepresented Hall. Under Virginia law, juvenile case files areconfidential and may not generally be disclosed without acourt order, see Va. Code Ann. $ 16.1-305 (1999), but petitioner learned about Saunders' prior representation whena clerk mistakenly produced Hall's file to federal habeascounsel.The District Court held an evidentiary hearing and deniedpetitioner's habeas petition. A divided panel of the Courtof Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, 227 F. 3d 203(2000), and the Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc,240 F. 3d 348 (2001). As an initial matter, the 7-to-3 en bancmajority determined that petitioner's failure to raise hisconflict-of-interest claim in state court did not preclude review, concluding that petitioner had established cause andthat the "inquiry as to prejudice for purposes of excusing[petitioner's] default . . . incorporates the test for evaluatinghis underlying conflict of interest claim." Id., at 356-357.On the merits, the Court of Appeals assumed that the juvenile court judge had neglected a duty to inquire into a potential conflict, but rejected petitioner's argument that thisfailure either mandated automatic reversal of his convictionor relieved him of the burden of showing that a conflict ofinterest adversely affected his representation. Relying onCuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), the court held thata defendant must show "both an actual conflict of interestand an adverse effect even if the trial court failed to inquireinto a potential conflict about which it reasonably shouldhave known," 240 F. 3d, at 355-356. Concluding that petitioner had not demonstrated adverse effect, id., at 360, itaffirmed the District Court's denial of habeas relief. We535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN166 MICKENS v. TAYLOROpinion of the Courtgranted a stay of execution of petitioner's sentence andgranted certiorari. 532 U. S. 970 (2001).IIThe Sixth Amendment provides that a criminal defendantshall have the right to "the Assistance of Counsel for hisdefence." This right has been accorded, we have said, "notfor its own sake, but because of the effect it has on the abilityof the accused to receive a fair trial." United States v.Cronic, 466 U. S. 648, 658 (1984). It follows from this thatassistance which is ineffective in preserving fairness doesnot meet the constitutional mandate, seeStrickland v. Wash-ington, 466 U. S. 668, 685-686 (1984); and it also follows thatdefects in assistance that have no probable effect upon thetrial's outcome do not establish a constitutional violation.As a general matter, a defendant alleging a Sixth Amend-ment violation must demonstrate "a reasonable probabilitythat, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of theproceeding would have been different." Id., at 694.There is an exception to this general rule. We havespared the defendant the need of showing probable effectupon the outcome, and have simply presumed such effect,where assistance of counsel has been denied entirely or during a critical stage of the proceeding. When that has oc-curred, the likelihood that the verdict is unreliable is so highthat a case-by-case inquiry is unnecessary. See Cronic,supra, at 658-659; see also Geders v. United States, 425 U. S.80, 91 (1976); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 344-345(1963). But only in "circumstances of that magnitude" dowe forgo individual inquiry into whether counsel's inadequate performance undermined the reliability of the verdict.Cronic, supra, at 659, n. 26.We have held in several cases that "circumstances of thatmagnitude" may also arise when the defendant's attorneyactively represented conflicting interests. The nub of thequestion before us is whether the principle established bythese cases provides an exception to the general rule of535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN167Cite as: 535 U. S. 162 (2002)Opinion of the CourtStrickland under the circumstances of the present case. Toanswer that question, we must examine those cases in somedetail.1In Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475 (1978), defensecounsel had objected that he could not adequately representthe divergent interests of three codefendants. Id., at 478-480. Without inquiry, the trial court had denied counsel'smotions for the appointment of separate counsel and hadrefused to allow counsel to cross-examine any of the defend-ants on behalf of the other two. TheHolloway Court de-ferred to the judgment of counsel regarding the existence ofa disabling conflict, recognizing that a defense attorney is inthe best position to determine when a conflict exists, that hehas an ethical obligation to advise the court of any problem,and that his declarations to the court are "virtually made1 Justice Breyer rejects Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U. S. 475 (1978),Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), and Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S.261 (1981), as "a sensible [and] coherent framework for dealing with" thiscase, post, at 209 (dissenting opinion), and proposes instead the "categorical rule," post, at 211, that when a "breakdown in the criminal justicesystem creates . . . the appearance that the proceeding will not reliablyserve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt and innocence,and the resulting criminal punishment will not be regarded as fundamentally fair," ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), reversal must be decreed without proof of prejudice. This seems to us less a categorical ruleof decision than a restatement of the issue to be decided. Holloway, Sullivan, and Wood establish the framework that they do precisely becausethat framework is thought to identify the situations in which the conviction will reasonably not be regarded as fundamentally fair. We believe iteminently performs that function in the case at hand, and that JusticeBreyer is mistaken to think otherwise. But if he does think otherwise,a proper regard for the judicial function--and especially for the functionof this Court, which must lay down rules that can be followed in the innumerable cases we are unable to review--would counsel that he proposesome other "sensible [and] coherent framework," rather than merely saying that prior representation of the victim, plus the capital nature of thecase, plus judicial appointment of the counsel, see post, at 210, strikes himas producing a result that will not be regarded as fundamentally fair.This is not a rule of law but expression of an ad hoc "fairness" judgment(with which we disagree).535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN168 MICKENS v. TAYLOROpinion of the Courtunder oath." Id., at 485-486 (internal quotation marksomitted). Holloway presumed, moreover, that the conflict,"which [the defendant] and his counsel tried to avoid bytimely objections to the joint representation," id., at 490, undermined the adversarial process. The presumption wasjustified because joint representation of conflicting interestsis inherently suspect, and because counsel's conflicting obli-gations to multiple defendants "effectively sea[l] his lips oncrucial matters" and make it difficult to measure the preciseharm arising from counsel's errors.Id., at 489-490. Hol-loway thus creates an automatic reversal rule only wheredefense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over histimely objection, unless the trial court has determined thatthere is no conflict. Id., at 488 ("[W]henever a trial courtimproperly requires joint representation over timely objection reversal is automatic").In Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S. 335 (1980), the respondentwas one of three defendants accused of murder who weretried separately, represented by the same counsel. Neithercounsel nor anyone else objected to the multiple representa-tion, and counsel's opening argument at Sullivan's trial suggested that the interests of the defendants were aligned.Id., at 347-348. We declined to extend Holloway's auto-matic reversal rule to this situation and held that, absentobjection, a defendant must demonstrate that "a conflict ofinterest actually affected the adequacy of his representation." 446 U. S., at 348-349. In addition to describing thedefendant's burden of proof, Sullivan addressed separatelya trial court's duty to inquire into the propriety of a multiplerepresentation, construing Holloway to require inquiry onlywhen "the trial court knows or reasonably should know thata particular conflict exists," 446 U. S., at 3472--which is not2 In order to circumvent Sullivan's clear language, Justice Stevenssuggests that a trial court must scrutinize representation by appointedcounsel more closely than representation by retained counsel.

S. 162 (2002)Opinion of the Courtto be confused with when the trial court is aware of a vague,unspecified possibility of conflict, such as that which "inheresin almost every instance of multiple representation," id., at348. In Sullivan, no "special circumstances" triggered thetrial court's duty to inquire. Id., at 346.Finally, in Wood v. Georgia, 450 U. S. 261 (1981), threeindigent defendants convicted of distributing obscene materials had their probation revoked for failure to make the requisite $500 monthly payments on their $5,000 fines. Wegranted certiorari to consider whether this violated theEqual Protection Clause, but during the course of our consideration certain disturbing circumstances came to our attention: At the probation-revocation hearing (as at all timessince their arrest) the defendants had been represented bythe lawyer for their employer (the owner of the business thatpurveyed the obscenity), and their employer paid the attorney's fees. The employer had promised his employees hewould pay their fines, and had generally kept that promisebut had not done so in these defendants' case. This recordsuggested that the employer's interest in establishing a favorable equal-protection precedent (reducing the fines hewould have to pay for his indigent employees in the future)diverged from the defendants' interest in obtaining leniencyor paying lesser fines to avoid imprisonment. Moreover, thepossibility that counsel was actively representing the conflicting interests of employer and defendants "was sufficiently apparent at the time of the revocation hearing to impose upon the court a duty to inquire further." Id., at 272.the Sixth Amendment draws such a distinction. "A proper respect forthe Sixth Amendment disarms [the] contention that defendants who retaintheir own lawyers are entitled to less protection than defendants for whomthe State appoints counsel . . . . The vital guarantee of the Sixth Amendment would stand for little if the often uninformed decision to retain aparticular lawyer could reduce or forfeit the defendant's entitlement toconstitutional protection." Sullivan, supra, at 344.535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN170 MICKENS v. TAYLOROpinion of the CourtBecause "[o]n the record before us, we [could not] be surewhether counsel was influenced in his basic strategic decisions by the interests of the employer who hired him," ibid.,we remanded for the trial court "to determine whether theconflict of interest that this record strongly suggests actuallyexisted," id., at 273.Petitioner argues that the remand instruction in Wood established an "unambiguous rule" that where the trial judgeneglects a duty to inquire into a potential conflict, the defendant, to obtain reversal of the judgment, need only showthat his lawyer was subject to a conflict of interest, and neednot show that the conflict adversely affected counsel's performance. Brief for Petitioner 21.3 He relies upon the lan3 Petitioner no longer argues, as he did below and as Justice Souterdoes now, post, at 202 (dissenting opinion), that the Sixth Amendmentrequires reversal of his conviction without further inquiry into whetherthe potential conflict that the judge should have investigated was real.Compare 240 F. 3d 348, 357 (CA4 2001) (en banc), with Tr. of Oral Arg.23-25. Some Courts of Appeals have read a footnote in Wood v. Georgia,450 U. S., at 272, n. 18, as establishing that outright reversal is mandatedwhen the trial court neglects a duty to inquire into a potential conflict ofinterest. See, e. g., Campbell v. Rice, 265 F. 3d 878, 884-885, 888 (CA92001); Ciak v. United States, 59 F. 3d 296, 302 (CA2 1995). But see Brienv. United States, 695 F. 2d 10, 15, n. 10 (CA1 1982). The Wood footnotesays that Sullivan does not preclude "raising . . . a conflict-of-interestproblem that is apparent in the record" and that "Sullivan mandates areversal when the trial court has failed to make [the requisite] inquiry."Wood, supra, at 272, n. 18. These statements were made in response tothe dissent's contention that the majority opinion had "gone beyond"Cuyler v. Sullivan, see 450 U. S., at 272, n. 18, in reaching a conflict-ofinterest due process claim that had been raised neither in the petition forcertiorari nor before the state courts, see id., at 280 (White, J., dissenting).To the extent the "mandates a reversal" statement goes beyond the assertion of mere jurisdiction to reverse, it is dictum--and dictum inconsistentwith the disposition in Wood, which was not to reverse but to vacate andremand for the trial court to conduct the inquiry it had omitted.Justice Souter labors to suggest that the Wood remand order is partof "a coherent scheme," post, at 194, in which automatic reversal is re535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN171Cite as: 535 U. S. 162 (2002)Opinion of the Courtguage in the remand instruction directing the trial court togrant a new revocation hearing if it determines that "anactual conflict of interest existed," Wood, supra, at 273,without requiring a further determination that the conflictadversely affected counsel's performance. As used in theremand instruction, however, we think "an actual conflict ofinterest" meant precisely a conflict that affected counsel'sperformance--as opposed to a mere theoretical division ofloyalties. It was shorthand for the statement in Sullivanthat "a defendant who shows that a conflict of interest actually affected the adequacy of his representation need notdemonstrate prejudice in order to obtain relief." 446 U. S.,at 349-350 (emphasis added).4 This is the only interpretaquired when the trial judge fails to inquire into a potential conflict thatwas apparent before the proceeding was "held or completed," but a defendant must demonstrate adverse effect when the judge fails to inquireinto a conflict that was not apparent before the end of the proceeding, post,at 202. The problem with this carefully concealed "coherent scheme" (nocase has ever mentioned it) is that in Wood itself the court did not decreeautomatic reversal, even though it found that "the possibility of a conflictof interest was sufficiently apparent at the time of the revocation hearingto impose upon the court a duty to inquire further." 450 U. S., at 272(second emphasis added). Indeed, the State had actually notified thejudge of a potential conflict of interest " `[d]uring the probation revocationhearing.' " Id., at 272, and n. 20. Justice Souter's statement that "thesigns that a conflict may have occurred were clear to the judge at the closeof the probation revocation proceeding," post, at 201--when it became apparent that counsel had neglected the "strategy more obviously in thedefendants' interest, of requesting the court to reduce the fines or defertheir collection," post, at 198--would more accurately be phrased "the effect of the conflict upon counsel's performance was clear to the judge atthe close of the probation revocation proceeding."4 Justice Stevens asserts that this reading (and presumably JusticeSouter's reading as well, post, at 201), is wrong, post, at 186-187; thatWood only requires petitioner to show that a real conflict existed, notthat it affected counsel's performance, post, at 187. This is so because we"unambiguously stated" that a conviction must be reversed whenever thetrial court fails to investigate a potential conflict, post, at 186-187 (citing535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN172 MICKENS v. TAYLOROpinion of the Courttion consistent with the Wood Court's earlier description ofwhy it could not decide the case without a remand: "On therecord before us, we cannot be sure whether counsel wasinfluenced in his basic strategic decisions by the interestsof the employer who hired him. If this was the case, thedue process rights of petitioners were not respected . . . ."450 U. S., at 272 (emphasis added). The notion that Woodcreated a new rulesub silentio--and in a case where certio-rari had been granted on an entirely different question, andthe parties had neither briefed nor argued the conflict-of-interest issue--is implausible.5Petitioner's proposed rule of automatic reversal whenthere existed a conflict that did not affect counsel's performance, but the trial judge failed to make the Sullivan-mandated inquiry, makes little policy sense. As discussed,the rule applied when the trial judge is not aware of theWood footnote). As we have explained earlier, n. 3, supra, this dictumsimply contradicts the remand order in Wood.5 We have used "actual conflict of interest" elsewhere to mean what wasrequired to be shown in Sullivan. See United States v. Cronic, 466 U. S.648, 662, n. 31 (1984) ("[W]e have presumed prejudice when counsel laborsunder an actual conflict of interest . . . . See Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U. S.335 (1980)"). And we have used "conflict of interest" to mean a divisionof loyalties that affected counsel's performance. In Holloway, 435 U. S.,at 482, we described our earlier opinion in Glasser v. United States, 315U. S. 60 (1942), as follows:"The record disclosed that Stewart failed to cross-examine a Government witness whose testimony linked Glasser with the conspiracy andfailed to object to the admission of arguably inadmissible evidence. Thisfailure was viewed by the Court as a result of Stewart's desire to protectKretske's interests, and was thus `indicative of Stewart's struggle to servetwo masters . . . .' [315 U. S.], at 75. After identifying this conflict ofinterests, the Court declined to inquire whether the prejudice flowing fromit was harmless and instead ordered Glasser's conviction reversed." (Emphasis added.)Thus, the Sullivan standard is not properly read as requiring inquiry intoactual conflict as something separate and apart from adverse effect. An"actual conflict," for Sixth Amendment purposes, is a conflict of interestthat adversely affects counsel's performance.535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN173Cite as: 535 U. S. 162 (2002)Opinion of the Courtconflict (and thus not obligated to inquire) is that prejudicewill be presumed only if the conflict has significantly affectedcounsel's performance--thereby rendering the verdict unre-liable, even thoughStrickland prejudice cannot be shown.See Sullivan, supra, at 348-349. The trial court's aware-ness of a potential conflict neither renders it more likely thatcounsel's performance was significantly affected nor in anyother way renders the verdict unreliable. Cf. United Statesv.Cronic, 466 U. S., at 662, n. 31. Nor does the trial judge'sfailure to make the Sullivan-mandated inquiry often make itharder for reviewing courts to determine conflict and effect,particularly since those courts may rely on evidence and testimony whose importance only becomes established at thetrial.Nor, finally, is automatic reversal simply an appropriatemeans of enforcing Sullivan's mandate of inquiry. DespiteJustice Souter's belief that there must be a threat of sanction (to wit, the risk of conferring a windfall upon the defendant) in order to induce "resolutely obdurate" trial judges tofollow the law, post, at 208, we do not presume that judgesare as careless or as partial as those police officers who needthe incentive of the exclusionary rule, see United States v.Leon, 468 U. S. 897, 916-917 (1984). And in any event, theSullivan standard, which requires proof of effect upon representation but (once such effect is shown) presumes prejudice,already creates an "incentive" to inquire into a potential conflict. In those cases where the potential conflict is in fact anactual one, only inquiry will enable the judge to avoid allpossibility of reversal by either seeking waiver or replacinga conflicted attorney. We doubt that the deterrence of "judicial dereliction" that would be achieved by an automatic reversal rule is significantly greater.Since this was not a case in which (as in Holloway) counselprotested his inability simultaneously to represent multipledefendants; and since the trial court's failure to make theSullivan-mandated inquiry does not reduce the petitioner's535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN174 MICKENS v. TAYLOROpinion of the Courtburden of proof; it was at least necessary, to void the convic-tion, for petitioner to establish that the conflict of interestadversely affected his counsel's performance. The Court ofAppeals having found no such effect, see 240 F. 3d, at 360,the denial of habeas relief must be affirmed.IIILest today's holding be misconstrued, we note that theonly question presented was the effect of a trial court's failure to inquire into a potential conflict upon the Sullivan rulethat deficient performance of counsel must be shown. Thecase was presented and argued on the assumption that (ab-sent some exception for failure to inquire) Sullivan wouldbe applicable--requiring a showing of defective perform-ance, but not requiring in addition (as Strickland does inother ineffectiveness-of-counsel cases), a showing of probableeffect upon the outcome of trial. That assumption was notunreasonable in light of the holdings of Courts of Appeals,which have applied Sullivan "unblinkingly" to "all kinds ofalleged attorney ethical conflicts," Beets v. Scott, 65 F. 3d1258, 1266 (CA5 1995) (en banc). They have invoked theSullivan standard not only when (as here) there is a conflictrooted in counsel's obligations to former clients, see, e. g.,Perillo v. Johnson, 205 F. 3d 775, 797-799 (CA5 2000);Freund v. Butterworth, 165 F. 3d 839, 858-860 (CA11 1999);Mannhalt v. Reed, 847 F. 2d 576, 580 (CA9 1988); UnitedStates v. Young, 644 F. 2d 1008, 1013 (CA4 1981), but evenwhen representation of the defendant somehow implicatescounsel's personal or financial interests, including a bookdeal, United States v. Hearst, 638 F. 2d 1190, 1193 (CA91980), a job with the prosecutor's office, Garcia v. Bunnell,33 F. 3d 1193, 1194-1195, 1198, n. 4 (CA9 1994), the teachingof classes to Internal Revenue Service agents, United Statesv. Michaud, 925 F. 2d 37, 40-42 (CA1 1991), a romantic "entanglement" with the prosecutor, Summerlin v. Stewart, 267F. 3d 926, 935-941 (CA9 2001), or fear of antagonizing the535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN175Cite as: 535 U. S. 162 (2002)Opinion of the Courttrial judge, United States v. Sayan, 968 F. 2d 55, 64-65(CADC 1992).It must be said, however, that the language of Sullivanitself does not clearly establish, or indeed even support, suchexpansive application. "[U]ntil," it said, "a defendant showsthat his counsel actively represented conflicting interests,he has not established the constitutional predicate for hisclaim of ineffective assistance." 446 U. S., at 350 (emphasisadded). Both Sullivan itself, see id., at 348-349, and Holloway, see 435 U. S., at 490-491, stressed the high probabil-ity of prejudice arising from multiple concurrent representation, and the difficulty of proving that prejudice. See alsoGeer, Representation of Multiple Criminal Defendants: Conflicts of Interest and the Professional Responsibilities of theDefense Attorney, 62 Minn. L. Rev. 119, 125-140 (1978); Lowenthal, Joint Representation in Criminal Cases: A CriticalAppraisal, 64 Va. L. Rev. 939, 941-950 (1978). Not all attorney conflicts present comparable difficulties. Thus, the Fed-eral Rules of Criminal Procedure treat concurrent representation and prior representation differently, requiring a trialcourt to inquire into the likelihood of conflict wheneverjointly charged defendants are represented by a single attor-ney (Rule 44(c)), but not when counsel previously represented another defendant in a substantially related matter,even where the trial court is aware of the prior representation.6 See Sullivan, supra, at 346, n. 10 (citing the Rule).6 Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 44(c) provides:"Whenever two or more defendants have been jointly charged pursuantto Rule 8(b) or have been joined for trial pursuant to Rule 13, and arerepresented by the same retained or assigned counsel or by retained orassigned counsel who are associated in the practice of law, the court shallpromptly inquire with respect to such joint representation and shall personally advise each defendant of the right to the effective assistance ofcounsel, including separate representation. Unless it appears that thereis good cause to believe no conflict of interest is likely to arise, the courtshall take such measures as may be appropriate to protect each defendant's right to counsel."535US1 Unit: $U34 [09-18-03 15:56:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN176 MICKENS v. TAYLORKennedy, J., concurringThis is not to suggest that one ethical duty is more or lessimportant than another. The purpose of our Holloway andSullivan exceptions from the ordinary requirements ofStrickland, however, is not to enforce the Canons of LegalEthics, but to apply needed prophylaxis in situations whereStrickland itself is evidently inadequate to assure vindication of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel.See Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S. 157, 165 (1986) ("[B]reach ofan ethical standard does not necessarily make out a denial ofthe Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel").In resolving this case on the grounds on which it was presented to us, we do not rule upon the need for the Sullivanprophylaxis in cases of successive representation. WhetherSullivan should be extended to such cases remains, as faras the jurisprudence of this Court is concerned, an openquestion.* * *For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is
