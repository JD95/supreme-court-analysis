Court.California Govt. Code Ann. $ 6254(f )(3) (West Supp. 1999)places two conditions on public access to arrestees' addresses--that the person requesting an address declare thatthe request is being made for one of five prescribed purposes,and that the requester also declare that the address will notbe used directly or indirectly to sell a product or service.The District Court permanently enjoined enforcement ofthe statute, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding thatthe statute was facially invalid because it unduly burdenscommercial speech. We hold that the statutory section inquestion was not subject to a "facial" challenge.Petitioner, the Los Angeles Police Department, maintainsrecords relating to arrestees. Respondent, United Reporting Publishing Corporation, is a private publishing servicethat provides the names and addresses of recently arrestedindividuals to its customers, who include attorneys, insurance companies, drug and alcohol counselors, and drivingschools.Before July 1, 1996, respondent received arrestees' namesand addresses under the old version of $ 6254, which generally required state and local law enforcement agencies tomake public the name, address, and occupation of every individual arrested by the agency. Cal. Govt. Code Ann.$ 6254(f) (West 1995). Effective July 1, 1996, the state legislature amended $ 6254(f) to limit the public's access to arrestees' and victims' current addresses. The amended statuteprovides that state and local law enforcement agencies shallmake public:Brian Smallman; for the Newsletter Publishers Association by James E.Grossberg and Jay Ward Brown; for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press et al. by Jane E.

Cal. Govt. Code Ann.$ 6254(f )(3) (West Supp. 1999).Sections 6254(f)(1) and (2) require that state and local lawenforcement agencies make public,inter alia, the name, oc-cupation, and physical description, including date of birth,of every individual arrested by the agency, as well as thecircumstances of the arrest.1 Thus, amended $ 6254(f) limitsaccess only to the arrestees' addresses.1 Section 6254(f) provides, in pertinent part:"Other provisions of this subdivision notwithstanding, state and locallaw enforcement agencies shall make public the following information, except to the extent that disclosure of a particular item of information wouldendanger the safety of a person involved in an investigation or wouldendanger the successful completion of the investigation or a relatedinvestigation:"(1) The full name and occupation of every individual arrested by theagency, the individual's physical description including date of birth, colorof eyes and hair, sex, height and weight, the time and date of arrest, thetime and date of booking, the location of the arrest, the factual circumstances surrounding the arrest, the amount of bail set, the time and manner of release or the location where the individual is currently being held,and all charges the individual is being held upon, including any outstanding warrants from other jurisdictions and parole or probation holds."(2) Subject to the restrictions imposed by Section 841.5 of the PenalCode, the time, substance, and location of all complaints or requests forassistance received by the agency and the time and nature of the response528US1 Unit: $U10 [06-15-01 20:27:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN36 LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPT. v.

C. $ 1983, to hold the amendment uncon-stitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments tothe United States Constitution. On the effective date of thestatute, petitioner and other law enforcement agencies denied respondent access to the address information because,according to respondent, "[respondent's] employees couldnot sign section 6254(f)(3) declarations." Brief for Respond-ent 5. Respondent did not allege, and nothing in the recordbefore this Court indicates, that it ever "declar[ed] underpenalty of perjury" that it was requesting informationfor one of the prescribed purposes and that it would not usethe address information to "directly or indirectly . . . sell aproduct or service," as would have been required by thestatute. See $ 6254(f)(3).Respondent then amended its complaint and sought a tem-porary restraining order. The District Court issued a temporary restraining order, and, a few days later, issued a pre-liminary injunction. Respondent then filed a motion forsummary judgment, which was granted. In granting themotion, the District Court construed respondent's claim asthereto, including, to the extent the information regarding crimes allegedor committed or any other incident investigated is recorded, the time, date,and location of occurrence, the time and date of the report, the name andage of the victim, the factual circumstances surrounding the crime or incident, and a general description of any injuries, property, or weapons involved. The name of a victim of any crime defined by Section 220, 261,262, 264, 264.1, 273a, 273d, 273.5, 286, 288, 288a, 289, 422.6, 422.7, 422.75,or 646.9 of the Penal Code may be withheld at the victim's request, or atthe request of the victim's parent or guardian if the victim is a minor.When a person is the victim of more than one crime, information disclosingthat the person is a victim of a crime defined by Section 220, 261, 262, 264,264.1, 273a, 273d, 286, 288, 288a, 289, 422.6, 422.7, 422.75, or 646.9 of thePenal Code may be deleted at the request of the victim, or the victim'sparent or guardian if the victim is a minor, in making the report of thecrime, or of any crime or incident accompanying the crime, available tothe public in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph."528US1 Unit: $U10 [06-15-01 20:27:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN37Cite as: 528 U.

The court held that the statute wasfacially invalid under the First Amendment.The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's facialinvalidation. United Reporting Publishing Corp. v. California Highway Patrol, 146 F. 3d 1133 (CA9 1998). Thecourt concluded that the statute restricted commercialspeech, and, as such, was entitled to " `a limited measure ofprotection, commensurate with its subordinate position inthe scale of First Amendment values.' " Ibid. (quotingOhralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U. S. 447, 456 (1978)).The court applied the test set out in Central Hudson Gas &Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557,566 (1980), and found that the asserted governmental interest in protecting arrestees' privacy was substantial. But,the court held that "the numerous exceptions to $ 6254(f)(3)for journalistic, scholarly, political, governmental, and investigative purposes render the statute unconstitutional underthe First Amendment." 146 F. 3d, at 1140. The courtnoted that "[h]aving one's name, crime, and address printedin the local paper is a far greater affront to privacy thanreceiving a letter from an attorney, substance abuse counselor, or driving school eager to help one overcome hispresent difficulties (for a fee, naturally)," and thus that theexceptions "undermine and counteract" the asserted governmental interest in preserving arrestees' privacy. Ibid.Thus, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court'sgrant of summary judgment in favor of respondent and upheld the injunction against enforcement of $ 6254(f )(3). Wegranted certiorari. 525 U. S. 1121 (1999).We hold that respondent was not, under our cases, entitledto prevail on a "facial attack" on $ 6254(f )(3).Respondent's primary argument in the District Court andthe Court of Appeals was that $ 6254(f)(3) was invalid on its528US1 Unit: $U10 [06-15-01 20:27:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN38 LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPT. v. UNITED REPORTINGPUBLISHING CORP.Opinion of the Courtface, and respondent maintains that position here. But webelieve that our cases hold otherwise.The traditional rule is that "a person to whom a statutemay constitutionally be applied may not challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court."New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 767 (1982) (citing Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 610 (1973)).Prototypical exceptions to this traditional rule are FirstAmendment challenges to statutes based on First Amendment overbreadth. "At least when statutes regulate or proscribe speech . . . the transcendent value to all society ofconstitutionally protected expression is deemed to justifyallowing `attacks on overly broad statutes with no requirement that the person making the attack demonstrate thathis own conduct could not be regulated by a statute drawnwith the requisite narrow specificity.' " Gooding v. Wilson,405 U. S. 518, 520-521 (1972) (quoting Dombrowski v. Pfister,380 U. S. 479, 486 (1965)). "This is deemed necessary because persons whose expression is constitutionally protectedmay well refrain from exercising their right for fear of criminal sanctions provided by a statute susceptible of application to protected expression." Gooding v. Wilson, supra,at 520-521. See also Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88(1940).In Gooding, for example, the defendant was one of a groupthat picketed an Army headquarters building carrying signsopposing the Vietnam war. A confrontation with the policeoccurred, as a result of which Gooding was charged with" `using opprobrious words and abusive language . . . tendingto cause a breach of the peace.' " 405 U. S., at 518-519. InThornhill, the defendant was prosecuted for violation of astatute forbidding any person to " `picket the works or placeof business of such other persons, firms, corporations, orassociations of persons, for the purpose of hindering, delay528US1 Unit: $U10 [06-15-01 20:27:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN39Cite as: 528 U. S. 32 (1999)Opinion of the Courting, or interfering with or injuring any lawful business orenterprise . . . .' " 310 U. S., at 91.This is not to say that the threat of criminal prosecutionis a necessary condition for the entertainment of a facial challenge. We have permitted such attacks on statutes in ap-propriate circumstances where no such threat was present.See, e. g., National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U. S.569 (1998) (entertaining a facial challenge to a public fundingscheme);Suitum v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 520U. S. 725 (1997) (entertaining a landowner's facial challengeto a local redevelopment plan);Anderson v. Edwards, 514U. S. 143 (1995) (entertaining a facial challenge to a stateregulation restructuring the disbursal of welfare benefits).But the allowance of a facial overbreadth challenge to astatute is an exception to the traditional rule that "a personto whom a statute may constitutionally be applied may notchallenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivablybe applied unconstitutionally to others in situations not before the Court." Ferber, supra, at 767 (citing Broadrick,supra, at 610). This general rule reflects two "cardinalprinciples" of our constitutional order: the personal nature ofconstitutional rights and the prudential limitations on constitutional adjudication. 458 U. S., at 767. "By focusing onthe factual situation before us, and similar cases necessaryfor development of a constitutional rule, we face `flesh andblood' legal problems with data `relevant and adequate to aninformed judgment.' " Id., at 768 (footnotes omitted).Even though the challenge be based on the First Amendment, the overbreadth doctrine is not casually employed."Because of the wide-reaching effects of striking down astatute on its face at the request of one whose own conductmay be punished despite the First Amendment, we have recognized that the overbreadth doctrine is `strong medicine'and have employed it with hesitation, and then `only as alast resort.' " Id., at 769 (citing Broadrick, supra, at 613)." `[F]acial overbreadth adjudication is an exception to our528US1 Unit: $U10 [06-15-01 20:27:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN40 LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPT. v. UNITED REPORTINGPUBLISHING CORP.Opinion of the Courttraditional rules of practice and . . . its function, a limitedone at the outset, attenuates as the otherwise unprotectedbehavior that it forbids the State to sanction moves from"pure speech" toward conduct and that conduct--even if expressive--falls within the scope of otherwise valid criminallaws . . . .' " 458 U. S., at 770 (quoting Broadrick, supra, at615). See also Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v.Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569 (1987).The Court of Appeals held that $ 6254(f )(3) was faciallyinvalid under the First Amendment. Petitioner contendsthat the section in question is not an abridgment of anyone'sright to engage in speech, be it commercial or otherwise, butsimply a law regulating access to information in the handsof the police department.We believe that, at least for purposes of facial invalidation,petitioner's view is correct. This is not a case in which thegovernment is prohibiting a speaker from conveying information that the speaker already possesses. See Rubin v.Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476 (1995). The Californiastatute in question merely requires that if respondent wishesto obtain the addresses of arrestees it must qualify underthe statute to do so. Respondent did not attempt to qualifyand was therefore denied access to the addresses. For pur-poses of assessing the propriety of a facial invalidation, whatwe have before us is nothing more than a governmental de-nial of access to information in its possession. Californiacould decide not to give out arrestee information at all with-out violating the First Amendment.2 Cf. Houchins v.KQED, Inc., 438 U. S. 1, 14 (1978).To the extent that respondent's "facial challenge" seeks torely on the effect of the statute on parties not before theCourt--its potential customers, for example--its claim doesnot fit within the case law allowing courts to entertain facial2 Respondent challenged the statute as a violation of equal protectionunder the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Court of Appeals did not passon that challenge, nor do we.528US1 Unit: $U10 [06-15-01 20:27:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN41Cite as: 528 U. S. 32 (1999)Scalia, J., concurringchallenges. No threat of prosecution, for example, seeGooding, or cutoff of funds, see NEA, hangs over their heads.They may seek access under the statute on their own just asrespondent did, without incurring any burden other than theprospect that their request will be denied. Resort to a fa-cial challenge here is not warranted because there is "[no]possibility that protected speech will be muted." Bates v.State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350, 380 (1977).The Court of Appeals was therefore wrong to facially invalidate $ 6254(f)(3). Respondent urges several grounds asalternative bases for affirmance, but none of them werepassed on by the Court of Appeals and they will remain openon remand if properly presented and preserved there.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly
