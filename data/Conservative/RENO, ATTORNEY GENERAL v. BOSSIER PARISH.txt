These cases present the question whether $ 5 of the VotingRights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN323Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the Court$ 1973c, prohibits preclearance of a redistricting plan enactedwith a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose.IThis is the second time the present cases are before us,and we thus recite the facts and procedural history only inbrief. Like every other political subdivision of the State ofLouisiana, Bossier Parish, because of its history of discriminatory voting practices, is a jurisdiction covered by $ 5 of theVoting Rights Act. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1973c, 1973b(a), (b); 30Fed. Reg. 9897 (1965). It is therefore prohibited from en-acting any change in a "voting qualification or prerequisiteto voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect tovoting," without first obtaining either administrative preclearance from the Attorney General or judicial preclearancefrom the United States District Court for the District ofColumbia. 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c.Bossier Parish is governed by a 12-member Police Juryelected from single-member districts for 4-year terms. Inthe early 1990's, the Police Jury set out to redraw its electoral districts in order to account for demographic changesreflected in the decennial census. In 1991, it adopted a redistricting plan which, like the plan then in effect, con-tained no majority-black districts, although blacks made upapproximately 20% of the parish's population. On May 28,1991, the Police Jury submitted its new districting plan tothe Attorney General; two months later, the Attorney Gen-eral granted preclearance.The Bossier Parish School Board (Board) is constitutedin the same fashion as the Police Jury, and it too undertookto redraw its districts after the 1990 census. During thecourse of that redistricting, appellant-intervenor GeorgePrice, president of the local chapter of the National As-sociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP),proposed that the Board adopt a plan with majority-blackdistricts. In the fall of 1992, amid some controversy, the528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN324 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the CourtBoard rejected Price's suggestion and adopted the PoliceJury's 1991 redistricting plan as its own.On January 4, 1993, the Board submitted its redistrictingplan to the Attorney General for preclearance. Althoughthe Attorney General had precleared the identical plan whensubmitted by the Police Jury, she interposed a formal objection to the Board's plan, asserting that "new information"--specifically, the NAACP plan proposed by appellantintervenor Price--demonstrated that "black residents aresufficiently numerous and geographically compact so as toconstitute a majority in two single-member districts." App.to Juris. Statement in No. 98-405, p. 235a. The AttorneyGeneral disclaimed any attempt to compel the Board to"adopt any particular plan," but maintained that the Boardwas "not free to adopt a plan that unnecessarily limits theopportunity for minority voters to elect their candidates ofchoice." Ibid.After the Attorney General denied the Board's request forreconsideration, the Board filed the present action for judicial preclearance of the 1992 plan in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Section 5 of theVoting Rights Act authorizes preclearance of a proposedvoting change that "does not have the purpose and will nothave the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote onaccount of race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. Before theDistrict Court, appellants conceded that the Board's plandid not have a prohibited "effect" under $ 5, since it did notworsen the position of minority voters. (In Beer v. UnitedStates, 425 U. S. 130 (1976), we held that a plan has a prohibited "effect" only if it is retrogressive.) Instead, appellants made two distinct claims. First, they argued that preclearance should be denied because the Board's plan, bynot creating as many majority-black districts as it shouldcreate, violated $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which bars discriminatory voting practices. Second, they contended that,528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN325Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the Courtalthough the Board's plan would have no retrogressive effect,it nonetheless violated $ 5 because it was enacted for a discriminatory "purpose."The District Court granted preclearance. Bossier ParishSchool Bd. v. Reno, 907 F. Supp. 434 (DC 1995). As to thefirst of appellants' two claims, the District Court held that itcould not deny preclearance of a proposed voting changeunder $ 5 simply because the change violated $ 2. Moreover,in order to prevent the Government "[from doing] indirectlywhat it cannot do directly," the District Court stated thatit would "not permit section 2 evidence to prove discriminatory purpose under section 5." Id., at 445. As to the second of appellants' claims, the District Court concluded thatthe Board had borne its burden of proving that the 1992 planwas adopted for two legitimate, nondiscriminatory purposes:to assure prompt preclearance (since the identical plan hadbeen precleared for the Police Jury), and to enable easy implementation (since the adopted plan, unlike the NAACP'sproposed plan, required no redrawing of precinct lines).Id., at 447. Appellants filed jurisdictional statements in thisCourt, and we noted probable jurisdiction. Reno v. BossierParish School Bd., 517 U. S. 1232 (1996).On appeal, we agreed with the District Court that a proposed voting change cannot be denied preclearance simplybecause it violates $ 2, but disagreed with the propositionthat all evidence of a dilutive (but nonretrogressive) effectforbidden by $ 2 was irrelevant to whether the Board enacted the plan with a retrogressive purpose forbidden by $ 5.Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 486-487(1997) (Bossier Parish I). Since some language in the District Court's opinion left us uncertain whether the court hadin fact applied that proposition in its decision, we vacatedand remanded for further proceedings as to the Board's purpose in adopting the 1992 plan. Id., at 486. In light of ourdisposition, we left open the additional question "whether528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN326 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtthe $ 5 purpose inquiry ever extends beyond the search forretrogressive intent."Ibid. "The existence of such a purpose," we said, "and its relevance to $ 5, are issues to bedecided on remand."Ibid.On remand, the District Court, in a comparatively briefopinion relying on, but clarifying, its extensive earlier opinion, again granted preclearance. 7 F. Supp. 2d 29 (DC 1998).First, in response to our invitation to address the existenceof a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose, the District Court summarily concluded that "the record will notsupport a conclusion that extends beyond the presence orabsence of retrogressive intent." Id., at 31. It noted thatone could "imagine a set of facts that would establish a `nonretrogressive, but nevertheless discriminatory, purpose,' butthose imagined facts are not present here." Ibid. The District Court therefore left open the question that we had ourselves left open on remand: namely, whether the $ 5 purposeinquiry extends beyond the search for retrogressive intent.Second, the District Court considered, at greater length,how any dilutive impact of the Board's plan bore on the question whether the Board enacted the plan with a retrogressiveintent. It concluded, applying the multifactor test we articulated in Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977), that allegations of dilutive effect and of discriminatory animus were insufficient toestablish retrogressive intent. 7 F. Supp. 2d, at 31-32.In their jurisdictional statements in this Court, appellants contended, first, that the District Court's conclusionthat there was no evidence of discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose was clearly erroneous, and second, that $ 5of the Voting Rights Act prohibits preclearance of a redistricting plan enacted with a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose. Appellants did not challenge the DistrictCourt's determination that there was no evidence of retrogressive intent. We again noted probable jurisdiction. 525U. S. 1118 (1999).528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN327Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIIBefore proceeding to the merits, we must dispose of a chal-lenge to our jurisdiction. The Board contends that thesecases are now moot, since its 1992 plan "will never againbe used for any purpose." Motion to Dismiss or Affirm 9.Under Louisiana law, school board members are electedto serve 4-year terms. La. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 17:52(A) (West1995). One month after appellants filed the jurisdictionalstatements for this appeal, the scheduled 1998 election forthe Board took place. The next scheduled election will notoccur until 2002, by which time, as appellants concede, thedata from the upcoming decennial census will be availableand the Board will be required by our "one-man-one-vote"precedents to have a new apportionment plan in place. Ac-cordingly, appellee argues, the District Court's declaratoryjudgment with respect to the 1992 plan is no longer of anymoment and the dispute no longer presents a live "case orcontroversy" for purposes of Article III of the Constitution.Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401 (1975); Mills v. Green,159 U. S. 651, 653 (1895).Appellants posit several contingencies in which theBoard's 1992 plan would be put to use--including resigna-tion or death of one of the 12 Board members before 2002,and failure to agree upon a replacement plan for the 2002election. They also assert that, if we were to hold preclearance improper, they "could seek" an injunction voiding theelections held under the 1992 plan and ordering a specialelection, Brief for Appellants Price et al. Opposing Motionto Dismiss or Affirm 3, and "might be entitled" to such aninjunction, Brief for Appellant Reno in Opposition to Motionto Dismiss or Affirm 2. We need not pause to considerwhether the possibility of these somewhat speculative anduncertain events suffices to keep these cases alive, since in atleast one respect the 1992 plan will have probable continuingeffect: Absent a successful subsequent challenge under $ 2, it,rather than the 1980 predecessor plan--which contains quite528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN328 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtdifferent voting districts--will serve as the baseline againstwhich appellee's next voting plan will be evaluated for thepurposes of preclearance. Whether (and precisely how) thatfuture plan represents a change from the baseline, and, if so,whether it is retrogressive in effect, will depend on whetherpreclearance of the 1992 plan was proper.We turn, then, to the merits.IIIAppellants press the two claims initially raised in theirjurisdictional statements: first, that the District Court's factual conclusion that there was no evidence of discrimina-tory but nonretrogressive intent was clearly erroneous, andsecond, that $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits pre-clearance of a redistricting plan enacted with a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose. Our resolution ofthe second claim renders it unnecessary to address the first.When considered in light of our longstanding interpretationof the "effect" prong of $ 5 in its application to vote-dilutionclaims, the language of $ 5 leads to the conclusion that the"purpose" prong of $ 5 covers only retrogressive dilution.As noted earlier, in order to obtain preclearance under $ 5,a covered jurisdiction must demonstrate that the proposedchange "does not have the purpose and will not have theeffect of denying or abridging the right to vote on accountof race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. A covered jurisdic-tion, therefore, must make two distinct showings: first, thatthe proposed change "does not have the purpose . . . of deny-ing or abridging the right to vote on account of race orcolor," and second, that the proposed change "will not havethe effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color." The covered jurisdiction bears theburden of persuasion on both points. See Bossier Parish I,520 U. S., at 478 ( judicial preclearance); 28 CFR $ 51.52(a)(1999) (administrative preclearance).528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN329Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIn Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130 (1976), this Courtaddressed the meaning of the no-effect requirement in thecontext of an allegation of vote dilution. The case presented the question whether a reapportionment plan thatwould have a discriminatory but nonretrogressive effect onthe rights of black voters should be denied preclearance.Reasoning that $ 5 must be read in light of its purpose of"insur[ing] that no voting-procedure changes would be madethat would lead to a retrogression in the position of racialminorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise," we held that "a legislative reapportionmentthat enhances the position of racial minorities with respectto their effective exercise of the electoral franchise canhardly have the `effect' of diluting or abridging the rightto vote on account of race within the meaning of $ 5." Id.,at 141. In other words, we concluded that, in the contextof a $ 5 challenge, the phrase "denying or abridging the rightto vote on account of race or color"--or more specifically, inthe context of a vote-dilution claim, the phrase "abridgingthe right to vote on account of race or color"--limited theterm it qualified, "effect," to retrogressive effects.Appellants contend that in qualifying the term "purpose,"the very same phrase does not impose a limitation to retrogression--i. e., that the phrase "abridging the right to voteon account of race or color" means retrogression when itmodifies "effect," but means discrimination more generallywhen it modifies "purpose." We think this is simply an untenable construction of the text, in effect recasting thephrase "does not have the purpose and will not have theeffect of x" to read "does not have the purpose of y and willnot have the effect of x." As we have in the past, we refuseto adopt a construction that would attribute different meanings to the same phrase in the same sentence, dependingon which object it is modifying. See BankAmerica Corp. v.United States, 462 U. S. 122, 129 (1983) (declining to give528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN330 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtdifferent meanings to the phrase "other than" when it modi-fied "banks" and "common carriers" in the same clause).Appellants point out that we did give the purpose prongof $ 5 a broader meaning than the effect prong inRichmondv. United States, 422 U. S. 358 (1975). That case involvedrequested preclearance for a proposed annexation that wouldhave reduced the black population of the city of Richmond,Virginia, from 52% to 42%. We concluded that, althoughthe annexation may have had the effect of creating a politicalunit with a lower percentage of blacks, so long as it "fairlyreflect[ed] the strength of the Negro community as it exist[ed] after the annexation" it did not violate $ 5. Id., at371. We reasoned that this interpretation of the effectprong of $ 5 was justified by the peculiar circumstances pre-sented in annexation cases:"To hold otherwise would be either to forbid all suchannexations or to require, as the price for approval ofthe annexation, that the black community be assignedthe same proportion of council seats as before, henceperhaps permanently overrepresenting them and under-representing other elements in the community, includingthe nonblack citizens in the annexed area. We are un-willing to hold that Congress intended either consequence in enacting $ 5." Ibid.We refused, however, to impose a similar limitation on $ 5'spurpose prong, stating that preclearance could be deniedwhen the jurisdiction was acting with the purpose of effecting a percentage reduction in the black population, eventhough it could not be denied when the jurisdiction's actionmerely had that effect. Id., at 378-379.It must be acknowledged that Richmond created a discontinuity between the effect and purpose prongs of $ 5. Weregard that, however, as nothing more than an ex necessitatelimitation upon the effect prong in the particular context ofannexation--to avoid the invalidation of all annexations of528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN331Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the Courtareas with a lower proportion of minority voters than theannexing unit. The case certainly does not stand for theproposition that the purpose and effect prongs have fun-damentally different meanings--the latter requiring retrogression, and the former not--which is what is urged here.The approvedeffect of the redistricting in Richmond, andthe hypothetically disapproved purpose, were both retrogressive. We found it necessary to make an exception tonormal retrogressiveeffect principles, but not to normalretrogressive-purpose principles, in order to permit routineannexation. That sheds little light upon the issue beforeus here.Appellants' only textual justification for giving the purpose and effect prongs different meanings is that to dootherwise "would reduce the purpose prong of Section 5 toa trivial matter," Brief for Federal Appellant on Reargument 13; would "effectively delet[e] the `purpose' prong,"Reply Brief for Appellants Price et al. on Reargument 3;and would give the purpose prong "a trivial reach, limitedto the case of the incompetent retrogressor," Reply Brieffor Federal Appellant 9. If this were true--and if it wereadequate to justify giving the very same words a differentmeaning when qualifying "purpose" than when qualifying"effect"--one would expect appellants to cite at least someinstances in which this Court applied such muscular construction to the innumerable statutes barring conduct witha particular "purpose or effect." See, e. g., 7 U. S. C. $ 192(d)(prohibiting sale of any article "for the purpose or withthe effect of manipulating or controlling prices" in themeatpacking industry); 12 U. S. C. $ 1467a(c)(1)(A) (barringsavings and loan holding companies from engaging in anyactivity on behalf of a savings association subsidiary "forthe purpose or with the effect of evading any law or regulation applicable to such savings association"); 47 U. S. C.$ 541(b)(3)(B) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (prohibiting cable franchising authorities from imposing any requirement that "has528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN332 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtthe purpose or effect of prohibiting, limiting, restricting, orconditioning the provision of a telecommunications serviceby a cable operator or an affiliate thereof "). They cite nota single one, and we are aware of none.It is true enough that, whenever Congress enacts a statutethat bars conduct having "the purpose or effect of x," thepurpose prong has application entirely separate from that ofthe effect prong only with regard to unlikely conduct thathas "the purpose of x" but fails to have "the effect of x"--in the present context, the conduct of a so-called "incompetent retrogressor." The purpose prong has value and effect,however, even when it does not cover additional conduct.With regard to conduct that has both "the purpose of x" and"the effect ofx," the Government need only prove that theconduct at issue has "the purpose of x" in order to prevail.In the specific context of $ 5, where the covered jurisdictionhas the burden of persuasion, the Government need only refute the covered jurisdiction's prima facie showing that aproposed voting change does not have a retrogressive purpose in order for preclearance to be denied. When it cando so, it is spared the necessity of countering the jurisdiction's evidence regarding actual retrogressive effect--which,in vote-dilution cases, is often a complex undertaking. Thisadvantage, plus the ability to reach malevolent incompe-tence, may not represent a massive addition to the effectprong, but it is enough to justify the separate existence ofthe purpose prong in this statute, and is no less than whatjustifies the separate existence of such a provision in manyother laws.11 Justice Souter criticizes us for "assum[ing] that purpose is easier toprove than effect . . . in voting rights cases." Post, at 358, n. 10 (opinionconcurring in part and dissenting in part). As is obvious from our discussion in text, we do not suggest that purpose is always easier to prove, butsimply that it may sometimes be (which suffices to give force to the "purpose" prong without the necessity of doing violence to the English language). Indeed, Justice Souter acknowledges that "intent to dilute isconceptually simple, whereas a dilutive abridgment-in-fact is not readilydefined and identified independently of dilutive intent." Post, at 367.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN333Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the CourtAt bottom, appellants' disagreement with our reading of$ 5 rests not upon textual analysis, but upon their opposition to our holding in Beer. Although they do not explicitlycontend that Beer should be overruled, they all but do soby arguing that it would be "untenable" to conclude (as wedid in Beer) that the phrase "abridging the right to vote onaccount of race or color" refers only to retrogression in $ 5,Reply Brief for Federal Appellant on Reargument 1, in lightof the fact that virtually identical language elsewhere in theVoting Rights Act--and indeed, in the Fifteenth Amendment--has never been read to refer only to retrogression.See $ 2(a) of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(a) ("Novoting [practice] shall be imposed or applied by any Stateor political subdivision in a manner which results in a de-nial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the UnitedStates to vote on account of race or color . . ."); U. S. Const.,Amdt. 15, $ 1 ("The right of citizens of the United States tovote shall not be denied or abridged by the United Statesor by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude").2 The term "abridge," however--whose2 Appellants also cite $ 3(c) of the Voting Rights Act, which provides,with regard to a court that has found a violation of the right to voteguaranteed by the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment, that "thecourt . . . shall retain jurisdiction for such period as it may deem appropriate and during such period no voting [practice] different from thatin force or effect at the time the proceeding was commenced shall be enforced unless and until the court finds that such [practice] does not havethe purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the rightto vote on account of race or color . . . ." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973a(c). Thisprovision does not assist appellants' case because it is not at all clear thatit confers the power to deny approval to nonretrogressive redistricting.That is to say, it may well contemplate that, once a court has struck downan unconstitutional practice and granted relief with regard to that practice, it may assume for that jurisdiction a function identical to that of theDistrict Court for the District of Columbia in $ 5 preclearance proceedings.This is suggested by the fact that the State may avoid the court's jurisdiction in this regard by obtaining preclearance from the Attorney General;and that $ 3(c), like $ 5, explicitly leaves open the possibility that a proposed change approved by the court can be challenged as unconstitutional528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN334 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtcore meaning is "shorten," see Webster's New InternationalDictionary 7 (2d ed. 1950); American Heritage Dictionary 6(3d ed. 1992)--necessarily entails a comparison. It makesno sense to suggest that a voting practice "abridges" theright to vote without some baseline with which to com-pare the practice. In $ 5 preclearance proceedings--whichuniquely deal only and specifically with changes in votingprocedures--the baseline is the status quo that is proposedto be changed: If the change "abridges the right to vote"relative to the status quo, preclearance is denied, and thestatus quo (however discriminatory it may be) remains ineffect. In $ 2 or Fifteenth Amendment proceedings, by contrast, which involve not only changes but (much more com-monly) the status quo itself, the comparison must be madewith a hypothetical alternative: If the status quo "re-sults in [an] abridgement of the right to vote" or "abridge[s][the right to vote]" relative to what the right to vote oughtto be, the status quo itself must be changed. Our readingof "abridging" as referring only to retrogression in $ 5, butto discrimination more generally in $ 2 and the FifteenthAmendment, is faithful to the differing contexts in which theterm is used.3in a "subsequent action." Ibid. We of course intimate no holding on thispoint, but limit our conclusion to the nonprobative character of $ 3(c) withregard to the issue in the present cases.3 Even if $ 5 did not have a different baseline than the Fifteenth Amendment, appellants' argument that $ 5 should be read in parallel with theFifteenth Amendment would fail for the simple reason that we havenever held that vote dilution violates the Fifteenth Amendment. SeeVoinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 159 (1993) (citing Beer v. United States,425 U. S. 130, 142-143, n. 14 (1976)). Indeed, contrary to Justice Sou-ter's assertion, post, at 360, n. 11 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), we have never even "suggested" as much. Gomillion v.Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), involved a proposal to redraw the boundaries of Tuskegee, Alabama, so as to exclude all but 4 or 5 of its 400black voters without excluding a single white voter. See id., at 341. Ourconclusion that the proposal would deny black voters the right to vote inmunicipal elections, and therefore violated the Fifteenth Amendment, hadnothing to do with racial vote dilution, a concept that does not appear in528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN335Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIn another argument that applies equally to our holdingin Beer, appellants object that our reading of $ 5 would require the District Court or Attorney General to preclearproposed voting changes with a discriminatory effect orpurpose, or even with both. That strikes appellants as aninconceivable prospect only because they refuse to acceptthe limited meaning that we have said preclearance has inthe vote-dilution context. It doesnot represent approvalof the voting change; it is nothing more than a determination that the voting change is no more dilutive than whatit replaces, and therefore cannot be stopped in advanceunder the extraordinary burden-shifting procedures of $ 5,but must be attacked through the normal means of a $ 2action. As we have repeatedly noted, in vote-dilution cases$ 5 prevents nothing but backsliding, and preclearance under$ 5 affirms nothing but the absence of backsliding. BossierParish I, 520 U. S., at 478; Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900,926 (1995); Beer, 425 U. S., at 141.4 This explains why theour voting-rights opinions until nine years later. See Allen v. State Bd.of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 569 (1969). As for the other case relied uponby Justice Souter, the plurality opinion in Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S.55 (1980), not only does that not suggest that the Fifteenth Amendmentcovers vote dilution, it suggests the opposite, rejecting the appellees'vote-dilution claim in the following terms: "The answer to the appellees'argument is that . . . their freedom to vote has not been denied or abridgedby anyone. The Fifteenth Amendment does not entail the right to haveNegro candidates elected . . . . Having found that Negroes in Mobile`register and vote without hindrance,' the District Court and Court ofAppeals were in error in believing that the appellants invaded the protection of that Amendment in the present case." Id., at 65; see alsoid., at 84, n. 3 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (characterizing plurality opinion as concluding that "the Fifteenth Amendment applies onlyto practices that directly affect access to the ballot").4 In search of support for the argument that $ 5 prevents not just backsliding on vote dilution but all forms of vote dilution, Justice Souterembarks upon a lengthy expedition into legislative history. Post, at 362-367 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). He returns emptyhanded, since he can point to nothing suggesting that the Congressthought $ 5 covered both retrogressive and nonretrogressive dilution.Indeed, it is doubtful whether the Congress that passed the 1965 Voting528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN336 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtsole consequence of failing to obtain preclearance is con-tinuation of the status quo. To deny preclearance to a planthat is not retrogressive--no matter how unconstitutionalit may be--would risk leaving in effect a status quo that iseven worse. For example, in the case of a voting changewith a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose and adiscriminatory but ameliorative effect, the result of denyingpreclearance would be to preserve a status quo with morediscriminatory effect than the proposed change.In sum, by suggesting that $ 5 extends to discriminatorybut nonretrogressive vote-dilutive purposes, appellants askus to do what we declined to do inBossier Parish I: toblur the distinction between $ 2 and $ 5 by "shift[ing] thefocus of $ 5 from nonretrogression to vote dilution, and . . .chang[ing] the $ 5 benchmark from a jurisdiction's existingplan to a hypothetical, undiluted plan." 520 U. S., at 480.Such a reading would also exacerbate the "substantial"federalism costs that the preclearance procedure alreadyexacts,Lopez v. Monterey County, 525 U. S. 266, 282 (1999),perhaps to the extent of raising concerns about $ 5's constitutionality, see Miller, supra, at 926-927. Most impor-tantly, however, in light of our holding in Beer, appellants'reading finds no support in the language of $ 5.5Rights Act even had the practice of racial vote dilution in mind. As Jus-tice Souter acknowledges, this Court did not address the concept until1969, see post, at 364, n. 13, and the legislative history of the 1969 extension of the Act, quoted by Justice Souter, see post, at 364-365, refersto at-large elections and consolidation of counties as "new, unlawful waysto diminish the Negroes' franchise" developed since passage of the Act.H. R. Rep. No. 91-397, pp. 6-7 (1969).5 Justice Souter asserts that "[t]he Justice Department's longstandingpractice of refusing to preclear changes that it determined to have anunconstitutionally discriminatory purpose, both before and after Beer," isentitled to deference. Post, at 368 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part); accord, post, at 373 (Stevens, J., dissenting). But ofcourse before Beer the Justice Department took the position that eventhe effects prong was not limited, in redistricting cases, to retrogression.Indeed, that position had been the basis for its denial of preclearance in528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN337Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIVNotwithstanding the fact that Bossier Parish I explicitly"le[ft] open for another day" the question whether $ 5 extends to discriminatory but nonretrogressive intent, see520 U. S., at 486, appellants contend that two of this Court'sprior decisions have already reached the conclusion that itdoes. First, appellants note that, inBeer, this Court statedthat "an ameliorative new legislative apportionment cannotviolate $ 5 unless the new apportionment itself so discrimi-nates on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution." 425 U. S., at 141. Appellants contend that this sug-gests that, at least in some cases in which the coveredjurisdiction acts with a discriminatory but nonretrogressivedilutive purpose, the covered jurisdiction should be deniedpreclearance because it is acting unconstitutionally.We think that a most implausible interpretation. At thetime Beer was decided, it had not been established thatdiscriminatory purpose as well as discriminatory effect wasnecessary for a constitutional violation, compare White v.Regester, 412 U. S. 755, 765-766 (1973), with Washington v.Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 238-245 (1976). If the statement inBeer had meant what appellants suggest, it would eitherhave been anticipating (without argument) that later holding, or else would have been gutting Beer's holding (sincea showing of discriminatory but nonretrogressive effectwould have been a constitutional violation and would, de-spite the holding ofBeer, have sufficed to deny preclearance).A much more plausible explanation of the statement is thatit referred to a constitutional violation other than vote diluBeer, see 425 U. S., at 136, and was argued in its brief before us as thebasis for sustaining the District Court's denial, see Brief for United Statesin Beer v. United States, O. T. 1975, No. 73-1869, pp. 17-18. We rejectedthat position as to the effects prong, and there is even more reason toreject it in the present cases, whose outcomes depend as much upon theimplication of one of our prior cases (as to which we owe the Departmentno deference) as upon a raw interpretation of the statute.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN338 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courttion--and, more specifically, a violation consisting of a "de-nial" of the right to vote, rather than an "abridgement." Although in the context of denial claims, no less than in thecontext of abridgment claims, the antibacksliding rationalefor $ 5 (and its effect of avoiding preservation of an evenworse status quo) suggests that retrogression should againbe the criterion, arguably in that context the word "deny"(unlike the word "abridge") does not import a comparisonwith the status quo.6In any event, it is entirely clear that the statement inBeer was pure dictum: The Government had made no con-tention that the proposed reapportionment at issue wasunconstitutional. 425 U. S., at 142, n. 14. And though wehave quoted the dictum in subsequent cases, we have neveractually applied it to deny preclearance. See BossierParish I, supra, at 481; Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 912(1996) (Shaw II); Miller, 515 U. S., at 924. We have madeclear, on the other hand, what we reaffirm today: that pro-ceedings to preclear apportionment schemes and proceedingsto consider the constitutionality of apportionment schemesare entirely distinct."Although the Court concluded that the redistrict-ing scheme at issue inBeer was nonretrogressive, it6 Justice Breyer suggests that "[i]t seems obvious . . . that if Mississippi had enacted its `moral character' requirement in 1966 (after enactment of the Voting Rights Act), a court applying $ 5 would have found `thepurpose . . . of denying or abridging the right to vote on account ofrace,' even if Mississippi had intended to permit, say, 0.4%, rather than0.3%, of the black voting age population of Forrest County to register."Post, at 376 (dissenting opinion). As we note above, however, our holding today does not extend to violations consisting of an outright "denial"of an individual's right to vote, as opposed to an "abridgement" as indilution cases. In any event, if Mississippi had attempted to enact a"moral character" requirement in 1966, it would have been precludedfrom doing so under $ 4, which bars certain types of voting tests and devices altogether, and the issue of $ 5 preclearance would therefore neverhave arisen. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 1973b(a)(1), (c).528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN339Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of the Courtdid not hold that the plan, for that reason, was immunefrom constitutional challenge. . . . Indeed, the VotingRights Act and our case law make clear that a reappor-tionment plan that satisfies $ 5 still may be enjoinedas unconstitutional." Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 654(1993) (Shaw I) (emphasis added).See also City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S. 125,134 (1983) (describing the holding of Beer as follows: "Although the new plan may have remained discriminatory, itnevertheless was not a regressive change. . . . Since the newplan did not increase the degree of discrimination againstblacks, it was entitled to $ 5 preclearance");Allen v. StateBd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 549-550 (1969) ("Once theState has successfully complied with the $ 5 approvalrequirements, private parties may enjoin the enforcementof the new enactment only in traditional suits attacking itsconstitutionality . . ."). As we noted in Shaw I, $ 5 explicitlystates that neither administrative nor judicial preclearance" `shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement' of[a change in voting practice]." 509 U. S., at 654 (quoting 42U. S. C. $ 1973c). That fully available remedy leaves us untroubled by the possibility that $ 5 could produce preclear-ance of an unconstitutionally dilutive redistricting plan.Second, appellants contend that we denied preclearanceon the basis of a discriminatory but nonretrogressive purpose in Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987).That case involved an unusual fact pattern. The city ofPleasant Grove, Alabama--which, at the time of the Dis-trict Court's decision, had 32 black inhabitants, none ofwhom was registered to vote and of whose existence cityofficials appear to have been unaware,id., at 465, n. 2--sought to annex two parcels of land, one inhabited by afew whites, and the other vacant but likely to be inhabited bywhites in the near future. We upheld the District Court'sconclusion that the city acted with a discriminatory pur-pose in annexing the land, rejecting the city's contention528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN340 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of the Courtthat it could not have done so because it was unaware of theexistence of any black voters against whom it could haveintended to discriminate:"[The city's] argument is based on the incorrect assumption that an impermissible purpose under $ 5 canrelate only to present circumstances. Section 5 looksnot only to the present effects of changes, but to theirfuture effects as well . . . . Likewise, an impermissiblepurpose under $ 5 may relate to anticipated as well aspresent circumstances."It is quite plausible to see [the annexation] as mo-tivated, in part, by the impermissible purpose of minimizing future black voting strength. . . . This is justas impermissible a purpose as the dilution of presentblack voting strength."Id., at 471-472 (citations andfootnotes omitted).Appellants assert that we must have viewed the city'spurpose as discriminatory but nonretrogressive because, asthe city noted in contending that it lacked even a dis-criminatory purpose, the city could not have been acting toworsen the voting strength of any present black residents,since there were no black voters at the time. However, asthe above quoted passage suggests, we did not hold that thepurpose prong of $ 5 extends beyond retrogression, butrather held that a jurisdiction with no minority voters canhave a retrogressive purpose, at the present time, by in-tending to worsen the voting strength offuture minorityvoters. Put another way, our holding in Pleasant Grove hadnothing to do with the question whether, to justify the denial of preclearance on the basis of the purpose prong, thepurpose must be retrogressive; instead, it involved thequestion whether the purpose must be to achieve retrogression at once or could include, in the case of a jurisdiction with no present minority voters, retrogression with regard to operation of the proposed plan (as compared with528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN341Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.operation of the status quo) against new minority voters inthe future. Like the dictum from Beer, therefore, PleasantGrove is simply inapposite here.* * *In light of the language of $ 5 and our prior holding inBeer, we hold that $ 5 does not prohibit preclearance of aredistricting plan enacted with a discriminatory but non-retrogressive purpose. Accordingly, the judgment of theDistrict Court is affirmed. It is so ordered.Justice Thomas, concurring.The Bossier Parish School Board first sought preclearanceof the redistricting plan at issue in this litigation almostseven years ago. The Justice Department and private ap-pellants opposed that effort, arguing throughout this litigation that a "safe" majority-minority district is necessary toensure the election of a black school board member. Ironically, while this litigation was pending, three blacks wereelected from majority-white districts to serve on the BossierParish School Board. Although these election results arenot part of the record, they vividly illustrate the fact thatthe federal intervention that spawned this litigation wasunnecessary.Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, JusticeGinsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in partand dissenting in part.Under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C.$ 1973c, a jurisdiction required to obtain preclearance ofchanges to its voting laws must show that a proposed amend-ment will not have the effect, and does not reflect a purpose,to deny or abridge the vote on account of race. I respect-fully dissent1 from the Court's holding that $ 5 is indifferent1 I agree with the Court's conclusion on the matter of mootness.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN342 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.to a racially discriminatory purpose so long as a change invoting law is not meant to diminish minority voting strengthbelow its existing level. It is true that today's decision hasa precursor of sorts inBeer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130(1976), which holds that the only anticipated redistrictingeffect sufficient to bar preclearance is retrogression in minority voting strength, however dilutive of minority votingpower a redistricting plan may otherwise be. But if today'sdecision achieves a symmetry withBeer, the achievement ismerely one of well-matched error. The Court was mistakeninBeer when it restricted the effect prong of $ 5 to retrogression, and the Court is even more wrong today when it limitsthe clear text of $ 5 to the corresponding retrogressive purpose. Although I adhere to the strong policy of respectingprecedent in statutory interpretation and so would not reexamine Beer, that policy does not demand that recognizederror be compounded indefinitely, and the Court's prior mistake about the meaning of the effects requirement of $ 5should not be expanded by an even more erroneous interpretation of the scope of the section's purpose prong.The Court's determination that Congress intended preclearance of a plan not shown to be free of dilutive intent(let alone a plan shown to be intentionally discriminatory)is not, however, merely erroneous. It is also highly unconvincing. The evidence in these very cases shows that theBossier Parish School Board (School Board or Board) actedwith intent to dilute the black vote, just as it acted withthat same intent through decades of resistance to a judicialdesegregation order. The record illustrates exactly the sortof relentless bad faith on the part of majority-white voters incovered jurisdictions that led to the enactment of $ 5. Theevidence all but poses the question why Congress would everhave meant to permit preclearance of such a plan, and it allbut invites the answer that Congress could hardly have intended any such thing. While the evidence goes substantially unnoticed on the Court's narrow reading of the purpose528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN343Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.prong of $ 5, it is not only crucial to my resolution of thesecases, but insistent in the way it points up the implausibilityof the Court's reading of purpose under $ 5.IIn Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977), this Court set out a check-list of considerations for assessing evidence going to discriminatory intent: the historical background of a challengeddecision, its relative impact on minorities, specific antecedentevents, departures from normal procedures, and contempo-rary statements of decisionmakers.Id., at 266-268. Wedirected the District Court to follow that checklist in enquiring into discriminatory intent following remand in thesecases, Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 488(1997) (Bossier Parish I). The Arlington Heights enquiryreveals the following account of the School Board's redistricting activity and of the character of the parish in whichit occurred.The parish's institution of general governance is knownas the Police Jury, a board of representatives chosen fromdistricts within the parish. After the 1990 census showeda numerical malapportionment among those districts, thePolice Jurors prepared a revised districting plan, which theysubmitted to the Attorney General of the United States witha request for the preclearance necessary under $ 5 of theVoting Rights Act before the parish, a covered jurisdiction,could modify its voting district lines. Based on informationthen available to the Department of Justice, the AttorneyGeneral understood the parish to have shown that the newplan would not have the effect and did not have the purpose of abridging the voting rights of the parish's 20% blackpopulation, and the revised Police Jury plan received preclearance in the summer of 1991. In fact, as the parish'sSchool Board has now admitted, the Police Jury plan thusapproved dilutes the voting strength of the minority popula528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN344 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.tion, Plaintiff 's Brief on Remand 12; that is, the plan discriminates by abridging the rights of minority voters to participate in the political process and elect candidates of theirchoice. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 46-47 (1986).The same population shifts that required the Police Juryto reapportion required the elected School Board to do thesame. Although the Board had approached the Police Juryabout the possibility of devising a joint plan of districts common to both Board and jury, the jury rebuffed the Board,see App. to Juris. Statement 172a (Stipulations 83-84), andthe Board was forced to go it alone. History provides agood indication of what might have been expected from thisendeavor.As the parties have stipulated, the School Board had applied its energies for decades in an effort to "limit or evade"its obligation to desegregate the parish schools. Id., at 216a(Stipulation 237). When the Board first received a courtorder to desegregate the parish's schools in the mid-1960's,it responded with the flagrantly defiant tactics of that era,see id., at 216a-217a (Stipulations 236-237), and the recorddiscloses the Board's continuing obstructiveness down to thetime covered by these cases. During the 1980's, the degreeof racial polarization in the makeup of the parish's schoolsrose, id., at 218a (Stipulations 241-243), and the disproportionate assignment of black faculty to predominantly blackschools increased, id., at 217a-218a (Stipulation 240). Whilethe parish's superintendent testified that the assignmentof black faculty to predominantly black schools came inresponse to black parents' requests for positive black examples for their children, see App. 289, the black leaders whotestified in these cases uniformly rejected that claim and insisted that, in accord with the parish's desegregation decree,black faculty were to be distributed throughout the parish'sschools, to serve as models for white, as well as black, students, see id., at 326-327; 2 Tr. 126-128.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN345Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.Other evidence of the Board's intransigence on race cen-ters on the particular terms of the integration decree thatsince 1970 has required the Board to maintain a "Bi-RacialAdvisory Review Committee" made up of an equal numberof black and white members in order to " `recommend tothe . . . Board ways to attain and maintain a unitary systemand to improve education in the parish.' " App. to Juris.Statement in No. 98-405, p. 182a (Stipulation 111) (herein-after App. to Juris. Statement). Although the Board represented to the District Court overseeing desegregationthat the committee was in place, see 2 Tr. 16 (testimony ofSuperintendent William T. Lewis), the committee actuallymet only two or three times in the mid-1970's and then withonly its black members in attendance, see App. to Juris.Statement 183a (Stipulation 112). In 1993, the Board setup a short-lived "Community Affairs Committee" to replacethe "Bi-Racial Committee." Despite the Board's resolutioncharging the committee " `with the responsibility of investigating, consulting and advising the court and schoolboard periodically with respect to all matters pertinent tothe retention [sic] of a unitary school system,' " ibid. (Stipulation 114), the Board disbanded the committee after onlythree months because, as a leading Board member put it," `the tone of the committee made up of the minority members of the committee quickly turned toward becoming involved in policy,' " id., at 184a (Stipulation 116). "Policy,"however, was inevitably implicated by the committee's purpose, and the subjects of its recommendations (such as methods for more effective recruitment of black teachers andtheir placement throughout the school system in accord withthe terms of the desegregation decree, see id., at 183a-184a(Stipulation 115)) fell squarely within its mandate. It isthus unsurprising that the Board has not achieved a unitaryschool system and remains under court order to this day.See id., at 217a (Stipulation 239); App. 139 (testimony ofS. P. Davis).528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN346 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.About the time the Board appointed its "Community Affairs Committee," it sought preclearance under $ 5 from theAttorney General for the redistricting plan before us now.The course of the Board's redistricting efforts tell us muchabout what it had in mind when it proposed its plan. Following the rebuff from the Police Jury, the Board was ableto follow a relaxed redistricting timetable, there being noBoard elections scheduled before 1994. While the Boardcould simply have adopted the Police Jury plan once the Attorney General had precleared it, the Board did not do so,App. to Juris. Statement 147a (Stipulation 11), despite justsuch a proposal from one Board member at the Board's September 5, 1991, meeting. No action was then taken on theproposal, id., at 174a (Stipulations 89-90), and although theBoard issued no explanation for its inaction, it is noteworthythat the jury plan ignored some of the Board's customarydistricting concerns. Whereas one of those concerns was incumbency protection, see App. 251; cf. App. to Juris. Statement 152a (Stipulation 26), the jury plan would have pittedtwo pairs of incumbents against each other and created twodistricts in which no incumbent resided, id., at 181a-182a(Stipulation 109).2 The jury plan disregarded school attendance zones, and even included two districts containing noschools. Id., at 174a, 151a, 191a (Stipulations 88, 24, 141).The jury plan, moreover, called for a total variation in district populations exceeding the standard normally used togauge satisfaction of the "one person, one vote" principle, seeid., at 162a-163a (Stipulation 58); App. 231-232; 1 Tr. 147,four of its districts failed the standard measure of compactness used by the Board's own cartographer, id., at 174-176,2 While two of the incumbents were considering stepping down by thetime the Board subsequently adopted the plan, at least one of those decisions was anything but firm. See App. 103; 4 Record, Doc. No. 72, inCiv. Action No. 94-1495 (D. D. C.), pp. 60-61 (joint designations of portionsof deposition of David Harvey); 1 Tr. 85.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN347Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.and one of its districts contained noncontiguous elements,App. 234-235.In addressing the need to devise a plan of its own, theBoard hired the same redistricting consultant who hadadvised the Police Jury, Gary Joiner. Joiner and the Boardmembers (according to Joiner's testimony) were perfectlyaware of their responsibility to avoid vote dilution in accordance with the Voting Rights Act, see Record, Doc. No. 38(direct testimony of Joiner 5), and he estimated that it wouldtake him between 200 to 250 hours to devise a plan for theBoard. The Board then spent nearly a year doing little inpublic about redistricting, while its members met in private with Joiner to consider alternatives. In March 1992,George Price, president of the parish's branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People(NAACP), wrote to the superintendent of parish schoolsasking for a chance to play some role in the redistrictingprocess. App. 184. Although the superintendent passedthe letter on to the Board, the Board took no action, andneither the superintendent nor the Board even respondedto Price's request. App. to Juris. Statement 175a (Stipulation 93). In August, Price wrote again, this time in concertwith a number of leaders of black community organizations,again seeking an opportunity to express views about theredistricting process, as well as about a number of Boardpolicies bearing on school desegregation. App. 187-189; seealso App. to Juris. Statement 175a (Stipulation 94). Onceagain the Board made no response.Being frustrated by the Board's lack of responsiveness,Price then asked for help from the national NAACP's Redistricting Project, which sent him a map showing how twocompact majority-black districts might be drawn in theparish. Id., at 177a (Stipulation 98). When Price showedthe map to a school district official, he was told it was unacceptable because it failed to show all 12 districts. AtPrice's request, the Redistricting Project then provided a528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN348 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.plan showing all 12 districts, which Price presented to theBoard at its September 3, 1992, meeting, explaining that itshowed the possibility of drawing majority-black districts.Id., at 177a-178a (Stipulations 99-100). Several Boardmembers said they could not consider the NAACP planunless it was presented on a larger map, id., at 178a (Stipulation 100), and both the Board's cartographer and its legaladvisor, the parish district attorney, dismissed the plan outof hand because it required precinct splits, id., at 179a (Stipu-lation 102).There is evidence that other implications of the NAACPproposal were objectionable to the Board. According to oneblack leader, Board member Henry Burns told him thatwhile he personally favored black representation on theBoard, a number of other Board members opposed the idea.3App. 142. According to George Price, Board member BarryMusgrove told him that the Board was hostile to the creationof a majority-black district. Id., at 182.4Although the NAACP plan received no further public con-sideration, the pace of public redistricting activity suddenlyspeeded up. At the Board's September 17, 1992, meeting,without asking Joiner to address the possibility of creatingany majority-black district, the Board abruptly passed astatement of intent to adopt the Police Jury plan. App. toJuris. Statement 179a-180a (Stipulation 106). At a public3 One other Board member, Marguerite Hudson, when asked to explain why two of the schools in Plain Dealing, one of the parish's towns,were predominantly black, stated: "[T]hose people love to live in PlainDealing. . . . And most of them don't want to get a big job, they would justrather stay out there in the country, and stay on Welfare, and stay in PlainDealing." App. 118.4 Musgrove denied making the statement. See 1 Tr. 56. If, as theDistrict Court majority suggested, the significance of the latter statementis uncertain, see Bossier Parish School Bd. v. Reno, 907 F. Supp. 434,448 (DC 1995) (Bossier Parish I), it was tantamount to opposition to themost obvious cure for the admitted dilution; there was in any event nothing ambiguous about the Burns statement.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN349Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.hearing on the plan one week later, attended by an over-flow crowd, a number of black voters spoke against the plan,and Price presented the Board with a petition bearing over500 signatures urging consideration of minority concerns.No one spoke in favor of the plan, Bossier Parish I, 907F. Supp. 434, 439 (DC 1995), and Price explained to the Boardthat preclearance of the jury plan for use by the Police Jurywas no guarantee of preclearance of the same plan for theBoard. App. to Juris. Statement 180a-181a (Stipulation108). Nonetheless, at its October 1 meeting, the votingmembers of the Board unanimously adopted the Police Juryplan, with one member absent and the Board's only blackmember (who had been appointed just two weeks earlier tofill a vacancy) abstaining.Id., at 181a-182a (Stipulation109). The Board did not submit the plan for preclearanceby the Attorney General until January 4, 1993. Id., at 182a(Stipulation 110).IIThe significance of the record under $ 5 is enhanced byexamining in more detail several matters already mentionedas free from dispute, by testing some of the Board's statedreasons for refusing to consider any NAACP plan, and bylooking critically at the District Court's reasons for resolvingdisputed issues in the School Board's favor.AThe parties stipulate that for decades before this redis-tricting the Board had sought to "limit or evade" its obligation to end segregation in its schools, an obligationspecifically imposed by Court order nearly 35 years ago andnot yet fulfilled. The Board has also conceded the discrimi-natory impact of the Police Jury plan in falling "more heavilyon blacks than on whites," Plaintiff 's Brief on Remand in Civ.Action No. 94-1495 (D. D. C.), p. 12, and in diluting "blackvoting strength," id., at 21. Even without the stipulatedhistory, the conceded dilution would be evidence of a corre528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN350 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.spondingly discriminatory intent. With the history, the implication of intent speaks louder, and it grows more forcefulstill after a closer look at two aspects of the dilutive impactof the Police Jury plan.First, the plan includes no majority-black districts eventhough residential and voting patterns in Bossier Parishmeet the three conditions we identified in Thornburg v.Gingles, 478 U. S., at 50-51, as opening the door to drawingmajority-minority districts to put minority voters on anequal footing with others. The first Gingles condition isthat "the minority group must be able to demonstrate thatit is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district." Id., at 50.The Board does not dispute that black voters in Bossier Parish satisfy this criterion. The Board joined in a stipulationof the parties that in 1991, "it was obvious that a reasonablycompact black-majority district could be drawn within Bossier City," App. to Juris. Statement 154a-155a (Stipulation36); see also 1 Tr. 60 (statement of Board member BarryMusgrove), and that the NAACP plan demonstrated that twosuch districts could have been drawn in the parish, see App.to Juris. Statement 192a (Stipulation 143).5 As to the second and third Gingles conditions, that the minority population be politically cohesive and that the majority-white blockvoting be enough to defeat the minority's preferred candidate, see Gingles, supra, at 51, the Government introducedexpert testimony showing such polarization in Bossier Parish's voting patterns. See App. to Juris.

Statement 160a-161a (Stipulations 52, 53), and not only the original NAACP plans butalso the Cooper Plans, two alternative plans developed by an expert forthe defendant-intervenors, demonstrated as much, see App. 238 (CooperPlans); App. to Juris.

While acknowledging the somewhat limited data available for analysis, the expert concludedthat "African American voters are likely to have a realisticopportunity to elect candidates of their choice to the . . .Board only in districts in which they constitute a majorityof the voting age population." Id., at 174.6Second, the Police Jury plan diluted black votes by dividing neighboring black communities with common interestsin and around at least two of the Parish's municipalities,thereby avoiding the creation of a majority-black district.7See id., at 154-156 (declaration of George J. Castille III); id.,at 141 (testimony of S. P. Davis). Even the Board's owncartographer conceded that one of these instances " `appear[ed]' " to constitute " `fracturing,' " App. to Juris. Statement 191a (Stipulation 138), which he defined as "divid[ing]a `population that has a traditional cohesiveness, lives in thesame general area, [and] has a lot of commonalties' . . . with`[the] intent to . . . fracture that population into adjoiningwhite districts,' " id., at 189a-190a (Stipulation 133).6 The parties agreed that black candidates for other offices have beenable to win from majority-white districts in the parish, see id., at 201a(Stipulation 180), but those instances all involved districts in which thepresence of an Air Force base, see id., at 206a-207a (Stipulation 196),meant both that the effective percentage of black voters was considerablyhigher than the raw figures suggested and, in the view of all the successfulblack candidates, that the degree of hostility to black candidates amongwhite voters was lower than in the rest of the parish, see App. 131-132(statement of Jeff Darby), 133-134 (statement of Jerome Darby), 143-144(statement of Johnny Gipson).7 Counsel for the Board suggested in cross-examining one of the Government's experts that one of the instances of dividing black communities arose from a state-law prohibition on the Board's "split[ting] existingcorporate lines." 2 Tr. 189. He offered no authority for that proposition.But in any case, the example the expert gave did not involve dividing amunicipality, but including in a single district areas both within the municipality and outside it.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN352 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.BThe Board's cartographer and lawyer objected that theNAACP plan was unacceptable because it split precincts inviolation of state law. And yet the Board concedes thatschool boards were free to seek precinct changes from thepolice juries of their parishes, as they often successfully did.See id., at 150a-151a (Stipulations 22-23). One of the Government's experts, see App. 214, 217, 354, and the Board'sown cartographic consultant, see App. to Juris. Statement151a (Stipulation 23), acknowledged this practice. Indeed,the parties agree that Joiner advised the Board about theoption of going to the Police Jury for precinct changes, seeid., at 174a (Stipulation 89); see also id., at 179a (Stipulation102), but that the Board never asked him to pursue that possibility, see id., at 188a (Stipulation 128).8 Judge Kessler inthe District Court was therefore surely correct that theBoard's claimed inability to divide precincts was no genuineobstacle to a plan with a majority-black district. See Bossier Parish I, 907 F. Supp., at 460-461 (opinion concurring inpart and dissenting in part).8 The District Court majority stated that it was not merely the factthat the NAACP plan required precinct splits, but that it required a largenumber of splits that made it unappealing. This claim is untenable forseveral reasons. First, again it assumes that the act to be explained isthe rejection of the NAACP plan rather than the adoption of the PoliceJury plan. While the NAACP plan required 46 precinct splits, see App.to Juris. Statement 194a-195a (Stipulation 151), the Cooper II plan,which also included two majority-black districts meeting traditional districting criteria, required only 27, ibid., and the establishment of a singlemajority-black district would have required just 14, see App. 269-270, 277.Second, and more importantly, the Board's cartographer and lawyer statedthat they told the Board the NAACP plan was unacceptable because itsplit any precincts at all, not because it split lots of them, see App. toJuris. Statement 179a (Stipulation 102), and a leading supporter of thePolice Jury plan on the Board, see 1 Tr. 129, and the Board's interim blackmember at the time of redistricting, see App. 130, agree on that score.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN353Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.It becomes all the clearer that the prospect of splittingprecincts was no genuine reason to reject the NAACP plan(or otherwise to refuse to consider creating any majority-black districts) when one realizes that from early on in theBoard's redistricting process it gave serious thought toadopting a plan that would have required just such precinct splits. When the Board hired Joiner as its cartogra-pher in May 1991, his estimate of 200 to 250 hours to prepare a plan for the Board, see App. to Juris. Statement 173a(Stipulation 86), indicated that there was no intent simply toborrow the recently devised Police Jury plan or to build onthe precincts established by the Police Jury, a possibility thatJoiner thought could be explored in "[s]everal hours at least,"App. 271. It seems obvious that from the start the Boardexpected its plan to require precinct splitting, and Joineracknowledged in his testimony that any plan "as strong as"the Police Jury plan in terms of traditional districting cri-teria would require precinct splits.Ibid. Splitting pre-cincts only became an insuperable obstacle once the NAACPmade its proposal to create majority-black districts.C1Despite its stated view that the record would not sup-port a conclusion of nonretrogressive discriminatory intent,the District Court majority listed a series of "allegedly dilu-tive impacts" said to point to discriminatory intent: "[t]hatsome of the new districts have no schools, that the planignores attendance boundaries, that it does not respect communities of interest, that there is one outlandishly largedistrict, that several of them are not compact, that there isa lack of contiguity, and that the population deviations re-sulting from the jury plan are greater than the limits (+- 5%)imposed by Louisiana law." 7 F. Supp. 2d 29, 32 (DC 1998)(Bossier Parish II). The District Court found this evidence528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN354 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J."too theoretical, and too attenuated," to be probative ofretrogressive intent in the absence of corroborating evidence of a "deliberate attempt." Ibid. But whatever theforce of such evidence may be on the issue of intent to causeretrogression, there is nothing "theoretical" or "attenuated"in its significance as showing intent to dilute generally.2If we take the District Court opinions in Bossier ParishI and Bossier Parish II together and treat the court's $ 5discussions as covering nonretrogressive discriminatory in-tent, it is clear that the court rested on two reasons forfinding that the plan's dilutive effect could not support aninference of nonretrogressive discriminatory intent. First,the court thought any such inference inconsistent with theview expressed inMiller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 924(1995), that a refusal to adopt a plan to maximize the numberof majority-minority districts is insufficient alone to supportan inference of intentional discrimination. Miller is not onpoint, however. In Miller, Georgia had already adopted aplan that clearly improved the position of minority votersby establishing two majority-black districts. The questionwas simply whether the State's refusal to create a thirdbetrayed discriminatory intent. Id., at 906-908, 923-924.In these cases, the issue of inferred intent did not ariseupon rejection of a plan maximizing the number of majority-black districts after a concededly ameliorative plan hadalready been adopted; the issue arose on the Board's refusalto consider a plan with any majority-black districts whenmore than one such district was possible under Gingles.The issue here is not whether Bossier Parish betrayed adiscriminatory purpose in refusing to create the maximumnumber of majority-black districts, seeBossier Parish II,supra, at 33 (Silberman, J., concurring), but simply whetherit was significant that the parish refused to consider creatinga majority-black district at all. The refusal points to a dis528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN355Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.criminatory intent that the refusal to maximize in Miller v.Johnson did not show.The District Court's second ground for discounting theevidence of intent inherent in the Police Jury plan's dilutiveeffect was its finding that the Board had legitimate, nondis-criminatory reasons for approving the plan. The evidence,however, is powerful in showing that the Board had nosuch reasons. As I have already noted, the Board's respectfor existing precinct lines was apparently pretextual. Theother supposedly legitimate reason for the Board's choice,that the Police Jury was a safe harbor under $ 5, is equallyunlikely. If the Police Jury plan was a safe harbor, it hadbeen safe from the day the Attorney General precleared itfor the Police Jury, whereas the Board ignored it for morethan a year after that preclearance. Interest in the PoliceJury plan developed only after pressure from Price and theNAACP had intensified to the point that the redistrictingprocess would have to be concluded promptly if the minorityproposals were not to be considered. The Police Jury, there-fore, became an attractive harbor only when it seemed tooffer safety from demands for a fair reflection of minorityvoting strength. It was chosen by a Board, described bythe District Court majority as possessing a "tenacious deter-mination to maintain the status quo," Bossier Parish II,supra, at 32, and the only fair inference is that when theBoard suddenly embraced the Police Jury plan it was running true to form.99 My conclusion indicates my disagreement with Justice Thomas's concurring opinion. The factual predicate for raising and resolving the issueof the scope of discriminatory intent relevant under $ 5 is a subject of theBoard's obligation to produce evidence and the District Court's obligationto make findings, and nothing in the conduct of the Justice Departmenthas impeded either the Board or the court from addressing this evidentiary issue. The fact that black members have been elected to the Boardis outside the record and is no more before us than evidence showing theextent to which the particular members were the choices of the minorityvoters who have suffered the conceded dilution.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN356 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.DIn sum, for decades the School Board manifested sedulousresistance to the constitutional obligation to desegregateparish schools, which have never attained unitary status andare still subject to court order. When faced with the needto act alone in redrawing its voting districts, the Boardshowed no interest in the Police Jury plan, which made nosense for school purposes and was at odds with normal dis-tricting principles applied by the Board. The Board hireda cartographer in anticipation of drawing district lines sig-nificantly different from the Police Jury lines, and the Attorney General's preclearance of the Police Jury plan for thejury's use produced no apparent Board interest in adopting that same plan. When minority leaders sought a role inproposing a plan, the Board ignored them and when theyproduced concrete proposals prepared by the NAACP, theBoard sidestepped with successive technical reasons culminating in a patently pretextual objection. It was onlythen, as its pretexts for resisting the NAACP were wearing thin, that the Board evidently scrapped its intention toobtain an original plan tailored to school district concernsand acted with unwonted haste on the year-old proposal toadopt the manifestly unsuitable Police Jury plan. The proposal received no public hearing support and nothing butobjection from minority voters, who pointed out what theBoard now agrees, that the Police Jury plan dilutes minorityvoting strength. The objections were unavailing and theBoard adopted the dilutive plan.There is no reasonable doubt on this record that the Boardchose the Police Jury plan for no other reason than to squelchrequests to adopt the NAACP plan or any other plan reflecting minority voting strength, and it would be incredible tosuggest that the resulting submergence of the minority voters was unintended by the Board whose own expert testifiedthat it understood the illegality of dilution. If, as I concludebelow, see Part III, infra, dilutive but nonretrogressive in528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN357Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.tent behind a redistricting plan disqualifies it from $ 5 pre-clearance, then preclearance is impossible on this record.Since the burden to negate such intent (like the burden tonegate retrogressive intent and effect) rests on the votingdistrict asking for preclearance, nothing more is required toshow the impossibility of preclearance. See, e. g., PleasantGrove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462, 469 (1987). It is worthnoting, however, that the parish should likewise lose evenif we assume, as the District Court majority seems to havedone at one point, that the burden to show disqualifying intent is on the Government and the intervenors. BossierParish II, 7 F. Supp. 2d, at 31 ("We can imagine a set of factsthat would establish a `non-retrogressive, but neverthelessdiscriminatory purpose,' but those imagined facts are notpresent here"). It is not only that Judge Kessler was correct in her conclusion that dilutive but nonretrogressive in-tent was shown; the contrary view of the District Court majority raises " `the definite and firm conviction that a mistake[has] been committed,' "Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal.,Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for SouthernCal., 508 U. S. 602, 622 (1993) (quoting United States v.United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S. 364, 395 (1948)). Regardless of the burden of persuasion, therefore, the parishshould lose under the intent prong of $ 5, if the purpose thatdisqualifies under $ 5 includes an intent to dilute minorityvoting strength regardless of retrogression.IIIAThe legal issue here is the meaning of "abridging" inthe provision of $ 5 that preclearance of a districting changein a covered jurisdiction requires a showing that the newplan does not "have the purpose . . . of denying or abridgingthe right to vote on account of race or color . . . ." Thelanguage tracks that of the Fifteenth Amendment's guarantee that "[t]he right of citizens . . . to vote shall not be528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN358 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.denied or abridged . . . on account of race [or] color . . . ."Since the Act is an exercise of congressional power under $ 2of that Amendment, South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S.301, 325-327 (1966), the choice to follow the Amendment'sterminology is most naturally read as carrying the meaningof the constitutional terms into the statute. United Statesv. Kozminski, 487 U. S. 931, 945 (1988) ("By employing theconstitutional language, Congress apparently was focusingon the prohibition of comparable conditions"); cf. Morissettev.United States, 342 U. S. 246, 263 (1952) ("[W]here Con-gress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated thelegal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it pre-sumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that wereattached to each borrowed word in the body of learning fromwhich it was taken and the meaning its use will convey tothe judicial mind unless otherwise instructed"). Any con-struction of the statute, therefore, carries an implicationabout the meaning of the Amendment, absent some good rea-son to treat the parallel texts differently on some particularpoint, and a reading of the statute that would not fit theConstitution is presumptively wrong.1010 The majority argues that we should construe purpose and effect uniformly, as we would in laws regulating price discrimination, savings andloans, and cable franchises. See ante, at 331-332. I find the FifteenthAmendment more relevant in interpreting $ 5; the constitutional languageprovides a reason to give purpose its full breadth. The majority alsoclaims that its reading leaves the purpose prong with some meaning because the Government need only refute a jurisdiction's claim that a changelacks retrogressive purpose in order to deny preclearance, without countering the jurisdiction's evidence regarding actual retrogressive effect.Ante, at 332. This assumes that purpose is easier to prove than effect.While that may be true in price-fixing cases, it is not true in voting rightscases (even though purpose is conceptually simpler than effect under $ 5,see infra, at 367-368). Here, as in many other race discrimination cases,the parties agreed about the effects of the proposed changes while hotlydisputing the reasons for them. The majority limits the purpose prongto the few cases in which attempted retrogression fails of its goal, a rather528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN359Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.In each context, it is clear that abridgment necessarilymeans something more subtle and less drastic than the complete denial of the right to cast a ballot, denial being separately forbidden. Abridgment therefore must be a conditionin between complete denial, on the one hand, and completeenjoyment of voting power, on the other. The principal concept of diminished voting strength recognized as actionableunder our cases is vote dilution, defined as a regime thatdenies to minority voters the same opportunity to participatein the political process and to elect representatives of theirchoice that majority voters enjoy. See, e. g., Thornburg v.Gingles, 478 U. S., at 46-47; 42 U. S. C. $ 1973. The benchmark of dilution pure and simple is thus a system in whichevery minority voter has as good a chance at political participation and voting effectiveness as any other voter. Ourcases have also recognized retrogression as a subspecies ofdilution, the consequence of a scheme that not only gives aminority voter a lesser practical chance to participate andelect than a majority voter enjoys, but even reduces the minority voter's practical power from what a preceding schemeof electoral law provided. See Beer v. United States, 425U. S., at 141. Although our cases have dealt with vote dilution only under the Fourteenth Amendment, see, e. g., Shawv. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 645 (1993), I know of no reason intext or history that dilution is not equally violative of theFifteenth Amendment guarantee against abridgment. Andwhile there has been serious dispute in the past over theFourteenth Amendment's coverage of voting rights, see, e. g.,Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112, 154 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), I know of no reasonto doubt that "abridg[e]" in the Fifteenth Amendment includes dilutive discrimination. See Bossier Parish I, 520paltry coverage given that it is discriminatory purpose, not discriminatoryeffect, that is at the heart of the Fifteenth Amendment.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN360 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.U. S., at 494-495 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment).11The Court has never held (save in Beer) that the conceptof voting abridgment covers only retrogressive dilution, andany such reading of the Fifteenth Amendment would be out-landish. The Amendment contains no textual limitation onabridgment, and when it was adopted, the newly emanci-pated citizens would have obtained practically nothing froma mere guarantee that their electoral power would not befurther reduced. Since $ 5 of the Act is likewise free of any11 We have suggested, but have never explicitly decided, that the Fifteenth Amendment applies to dilution claims. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446U. S. 55, 62-63 (1980) (plurality opinion); Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364U. S. 339, 346 (1960) (singling out racial minority for discriminatory treatment in voting violates Fifteenth Amendment, which prohibits municipalboundaries drawn to exclude blacks). But see Mobile, supra, at 84, n. 3(Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (suggesting that Mobile pluralitysaid that Fifteenth Amendment does not reach vote dilution); Voinovichv. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 159 (1993) (reserving the question); Shaw v. Reno,509 U. S. 630, 645 (1993) (endorsing the practice of considering dilutionclaims under the Fourteenth Amendment); Beer v. United States, 425 U. S.130, 142, n. 14 (1976).The majority claims that Gomillion was not about dilution because itinvolved the exclusion of black voters from municipal elections. Ante, at334-335, n. 3. The voters excluded from the gerrymandered Tuskegeewere left in unincorporated areas, where they could, at most, vote forcounty and state officials. Changing political boundaries to affect minority voting power would be called dilution today. Gomillion shows thatthe physical image evoked by the term "dilution" does not encompass allthe ways in which participation in the political process can be made unequal. That the Court did not use the word "dilution" in its modern sensein Gomillion does not diminish the force of its Fifteenth Amendmentanalysis.The majority also suggests, ante, at 334-335, n. 3, that the Mobile plurality explicitly rejected reliance on the Fifteenth Amendment. But thesame plurality recognized that " `deny or abridge' " in $ 2 of the VotingRights Act mirrored the cognate language of the Fifteenth Amendment,Mobile, supra, at 60-61, and we have since held that the language of $ 2includes nonretrogressive dilution claims. See, e. g., Voinovich v. Quilter,supra, at 157.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN361Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.language qualifying or limiting the terms of abridgmentwhich it shares with the Amendment, abridgment under$ 5 presumably covers any vote dilution, not retrogressionalone, and no redistricting scheme should receive preclearance without a showing that it is nondilutive. See BossierParish I, supra, at 493 (Breyer, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment) (use in $ 5 of Fifteenth Amendmentlanguage indicates that $ 5 prohibits new plans with dilutivepurposes). Such, in fact, was apparently just what Congresshad in mind when it addressed $ 5 to the agility of coveredjurisdictions in keeping one step ahead of dilution challengesunder the Constitution (and previous versions of the VotingRights Act) by adopting successive voting schemes, eachwith a distinctive feature that perpetuated the abridgmentof the minority vote:"Congress had found that case-by-case litigation wasinadequate to combat widespread and persistent discrimination in voting, because of the inordinate amountof time and energy required to overcome the obstructionist tactics invariably encountered in these lawsuits.After enduring nearly a century of systematic resistanceto the Fifteenth Amendment, Congress might well de-cide to shift the advantage of time and inertia from theperpetrators of the evil to its victims." South Carolinav. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 328 (footnote omitted).This evil in Congress's sights was discrimination, abridg-ment of the right to vote, not merely discrimination thathappens to cause retrogression, and Congress's intent tofrustrate the unconstitutional evil by barring a replacement scheme of discrimination from being put into effect wasnot confined to any one subset of discriminatory schemes.The School Board's purpose thus seems to lie at the verycenter of what Congress meant to counter by requiring preclearance, and the Court's holding that any nonretrogressivepurpose survives $ 5 is an exceedingly odd conclusion.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN362 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.BThe majority purports to shoulder its burden to justifya limited reading of "abridging" by offering an argumentfrom the "context" of $ 5. Since $ 5 covers only changes invoting practices, this fact is said to be a reason to thinkthat "abridging" as used in the statute is narrower than itscognate in the Fifteenth Amendment, which covers bothchanges and continuing systems. Ante, at 329-330, 333-334.In other words, on the majority's reading, the baseline in a$ 5 challenge is the status quo that is to be changed, whilethe baseline in a Fifteenth Amendment challenge (or oneunder $ 2 of the Voting Rights Act) is a nondiscriminatoryregime, whether extant or not. From the fact that $ 5applies only when a voting change is proposed, however, itdoes not follow that the baseline of abridgment is the statusquo; Congress could perfectly well have decided that when ajurisdiction is forced to change its voting scheme (because ofmalapportionment shown by a new census, say), it ought toshow that the replacement is constitutional. This, of course,is just what the unqualified language and its FifteenthAmendment parallel would suggest.In fact, the majority's principal reason for reading intentto abridge as covering only intent to cause retrogression isnot the peculiar context of changes in the law, but Beer v.United States, 425 U. S. 130 (1976), which limited the sortof "effect" that would be an abridgment to retrogressiveeffect. The strength of the majority's position, then, depends on the need for parallel limitations on the purposeand effect prongs of $ 5. The need, however, is very muchto the contrary.1Insofar as Beer is authority for defining the "effect" of aredistricting plan that would bar preclearance under $ 5,I will of course respect it as precedent. The policy of staredecisis is at its most powerful in statutory interpretation528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN363Cite as: 528 U.

S. 197, 202 (1991), and $ 5 presents no ex-ception to the rule that when statutory language is construed it should stay construed. But it is another thingentirely to ignore error in extending discredited reasoningto previously unspoiled statutory provisions. That, however, is just what the Court does in extending Beer from $ 5effects to $ 5 purpose.Beer was wrongly decided, and its error should not be com-pounded in derogation of clear text and equally clear congressional purpose. The provision in $ 5 barring preclear-ance of a districting plan portending an abridging effect isunconditional (and just as uncompromising as the bar toplans resting on a purpose to abridge). TheBeer Courtnonetheless sought to justify the imposition of a nontextuallimitation on the forbidden abridging effect to retrogressionby relying on a single fragment of legislative history, a statement from a House Report that $ 5 would prevent coveredjurisdictions from " `undo[ing] or defeat[ing] the rights recently won' " by blacks. Beer, supra, at 140 (quoting H. R.Rep. No. 91-397, p. 8 (1969)).12 Relying on this one statement, however, was an act of distorting selectivity, for thelegislative history is replete with references to the need toblock changes in voting practices that would perpetuate existing discrimination and stand in the way of truly nondiscriminatory alternatives. In the House of Representatives,the Judiciary Committee noted that "even after apparent defeat[s] resisters seek new ways and means of discriminating.12 Section 5 was promulgated by the 89th Congress, but Congress'sattention has repeatedly returned to it as the duration of the VotingRights Act has been extended and the Act has been amended.

By making trifling changes in registration re-quirements, for example, Dallas County, Alabama, was ableto terminate litigation against it without registering morethan a handful of minority voters, seeid., at 10-11, and newpractices were similarly effective devices for perpetuatingdiscrimination in other jurisdictions as well, see S.

As registration and voting of minority citizensincreases, other measures may be resorted to whichwould dilute increasing minority voting strength.

Rep.No. 94-295, pp. 15-17 (citation omitted).Congress thus referred to $ 5 as a way to make the situationbetter ("promoting"), not merely as a stopgap to keep it fromgetting worse ("preserving").It is all the more difficult to understand how the majorityin Beer could have been so oblivious to this clear congres-sional objective, when a decade beforeBeer the Court hadrealized that modifying legal requirements was the way discriminatory jurisdictions stayed one jump ahead of the Con-stitution. In United States v. Mississippi, 380 U. S. 128(1965), the Court described a series of ingenious devicespreventing minority registration, and inSouth Carolina v.Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301 (1966), the Court said that"Congress knew that some of the States . . . had resortedto the extraordinary stratagem of contriving new rulesof various kinds for the sole purpose of perpetuatingvoting discrimination in the face of adverse federalcourt decrees. Congress had reason to suppose thatthese States might try similar maneuvers in the futurein order to evade the remedies for voting discrimina-tion contained in the Act itself." Id., at 335 (footnoteomitted); see also id., at 314-315.Likewise, well before Beer, our nascent dilution jurispru-dence addressed practices mentioned in the congressionallists of tactics targeted by $ 5. See, e. g., White v. Regester,412 U. S. 755, 765-766, 768-769 (1973).In fine, the full legislative history shows beyond any doubtjust what the unqualified text of $ 5 provides. The statutecontains no reservation in favor of customary abridgmentgrown familiar after years of relentless discrimination, andthe preclearance requirement was not enacted to authorizecovered jurisdictions to pour old poison into new bottles.See post, at 374-376 (Breyer, J., dissenting).

A purposeto dilute simply means to subordinate minority voting power;exact calibration is unnecessary to identify what is intended.Any purpose to give less weight to minority participation inthe electoral process than to majority participation is a purpose to discriminate and thus to "abridge" the right to vote.No further baseline is needed because the enquiry goes tothe direction of the majority's aim, without reference todetails of the existing system.Dilutive effect, for the reason the majority points out, isdifferent. Dilutive effect requires a baseline against whichto compare a proposed change. While the baseline is intheory the electoral effectiveness of majority voters, dilutionis not merely a lack of proportional representation, see Davisv.Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 131 (1986) (opinion of White, J.),and we have held that the maximum number of possiblemajority-minority districts cannot be the standard, see, e. g.,Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 925-926. Thus we haveheld that an enquiry into dilutive effect must rest on some14 The Court says this "lengthy expedition into legislative history"leaves me "emptyhanded" for the reason that nothing shows that today'snotions of vote dilution were particularly in the congressional mind.Ante, at 335, n. 4. But the whole point of the legislative history is thatCongress meant to guard against just those discriminatory devices thatwere as yet untried. Congress did not know what the covered jurisdictions would think up next.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN368 RENO v.

See Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 880 (1994) (opinion of Kennedy, J.); id., at 887-888 (O'Connor, J., concur-ring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Johnsonv. De Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1018 (1994). Looking only toretrogression in effect, while looking to any dilutive or otherabridgment in purpose, avoids the difficulty of baseline deri-vation. The distinction was not intended by Congress, butsuch a distinction is not irrational.Indeed, the Justice Department has always taken theposition that Beer is limited to the effect prong and putsno limitation on discriminatory purpose in $ 5. See Brieffor Federal Appellant 32-33. The Justice Department'slongstanding practice of refusing to preclear changes thatit determined to have an unconstitutionally discriminatorypurpose, both before and afterBeer, is entitled to "particu-lar deference" in light of the Department's "central role" inadministering $ 5.

Most significanthere, the fact that the Justice Department has for decadesunderstood Beer to be limited to effect demonstrates thatsuch a position is entirely consistent and coherent with thelaw as declared in Beer, even though it may not have beenwhat Congress intended.3Giving wider scope to purpose than to effect under $ 5would not only preserve the capacity of $ 5 to bar preclearance to all intended violations of the Fifteenth Amend-ment,15 it would also enjoy the virtue of consistency with15 Justice Breyer developed this justification for giving full effect tothe "purpose" prong in his opinion in Bossier Parish I, 520 U.

S. 358 (1975), the Court held that a city's territorial annexation reducing the percentage of black voterscould not be recognized as a legal wrong under the effectprong of $ 5, but remanded for further consideration of dis-criminatory purpose. The majority distinguishes Richmondas "nothing more than an ex necessitate limitation upon theeffect prong in the particular context of annexation."Ante,at 330. But in fact, Richmond laid down no eccentric effectrule and is squarely at odds with the majority's position thatonly an act taken with intent to produce a forbidden effectis forbidden under the intent prong.As to forbidden effect, the Richmond Court said this:"As long as the ward system fairly reflects the strengthof the Negro community as it exists after the annexation, we cannot hold, without more specific legislativedirection, that such an annexation is nevertheless barredby $ 5. It is true that the black community, if there isracial bloc voting, will command fewer seats on the citycouncil; and the annexation will have effected a declineas amended, now invalidates facially neutral practices with discriminatory effects even in the absence of purposeful discrimination, and is thusno longer coextensive with our understanding of the Constitution. Theeffects-only standard was added after the Court made clear, after yearsof uncertainty, that the Constitution prohibited only purposeful discrimination, not neutral action with a disparate impact on minorities.The Court has divided on the effect of this change on $ 5. Compareid., at 484, with id., at 505-506 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part). As Justice Breyer explained, that the effects prongnow goes beyond the Constitution has no bearing on whether we shouldlimit the meaning of the purpose prong, which does no more than repeat what the Constitution requires. Id., at 493-494. Both retrogressive and nonretrogressive discriminatory purposes violate the Constitution. As I have said already, I agree with Justice Breyer that there isno evidence that Congress intended to include in $ 5 only part of whatthe Constitution prohibits. See id., at 494. The tides of constitutionalinterpretation have buffeted both $ 2 and $ 5, but have never ebbed so lowas to approve of discriminatory, dilutive purpose.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN370 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.in the Negroes' relative influence in the city. But a different city council and an enlarged city are involvedafter the annexation. Furthermore, Negro power inthe new city is not undervalued, and Negroes will notbe underrepresented on the council."As long as this is true, we cannot hold that the effectof the annexation is to deny or abridge the right tovote." 422 U. S., at 371.As Richmond's references to "undervaluation" and "underrepresentation" make clear, the case involves applicationof standard Fifteenth Amendment principles to the annexation context, not an annexation exception. As long as thepostannexation city allowed black voters to participate onequal terms with white voters, the annexation did not"abridge" their voting rights even if they thereafter madeup a smaller proportion of the voting population. The Courtalso held, however, that in adopting the very plan whoseeffect had been held to be outside the scope of legal wrong,the city could have acted with an unlawful, discriminatoryintent that would have rendered the annexation unlawful andbarred approval under $ 5:"[I]t may be asked how it could be forbidden by $ 5 tohave the purpose and intent of achieving only what is aperfectly legal result under that section and why weneed remand for further proceedings with respect topurpose alone. The answer is plain, and we need notlabor it. An official action, whether an annexation orotherwise, taken for the purpose of discriminatingagainst Negroes on account of their race has no legitimacy at all under our Constitution or under the statute.Section 5 forbids voting changes taken with the purposeof denying the vote on the grounds of race or color."Id., at 378.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN371Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Opinion of Souter, J.It follows from Richmond that a plan lacking any underlyingpurpose to cause disqualifying retrogression may be barredby a discriminatory intent.The majority's attempt to distinguish Pleasant Grove v.United States, 479 U. S. 462 (1987), is equally vain. WhereasRichmond dealt with the argument that law and logic barredfinding a disqualifying intent when effect was lawful, Pleasant Grove dealt with the argument that finding a disqualifying intent was impossible in fact. The Court in PleasantGrove denied preclearance to an annexation that added whitevoters to the city's electorate, despite the fact that at thetime of the annexation minority voting strength was nonexistent and officials of the city seeking the annexation wereunaware of any black voters whose votes could be diluted.One thing is clear beyond peradventure: the annexation inthat case could not have been intended to cause retrogression. No one could have intended to cause retrogression because no one knew of any minority voting strength fromwhich retrogression was possible. 479 U. S., at 465, n. 2.The fact that the annexation was nonetheless barred underthe purpose prong of $ 5, 11 years after Beer, means thattoday's majority cannot hold as they do without overrulingPleasant Grove.The majority seeks to avoid Pleasant Grove by describingit as barring "future retrogression" by nipping any suchfuture contingency even before the bud had formed. Thisgymnastic, however, not only overlooks the contradictionbetween Pleasant Grove's holding that a voting change without possible retrogressive intent could fail under the purposeprong and the majority's reasoning today that the baselinefor the purpose prong is the status quo; it even ignores whatthe Court actually said. While the Pleasant Grove Courtsaid that impermissible purpose could relate to anticipatedcircumstances, 479 U. S., at 471-472, it said nothing aboutanticipated retrogression (a concept familiar to the Court528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN372 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Opinion of Souter, J.since the time of Beer). The Court found it "plausible" thatthe city had simply acted with "the impermissible purposeof minimizing future black voting strength." 479 U. S., at471-472 (footnote omitted). The Court spoke of "minimizing," not "causing retrogression to." But there is more:"One means of thwarting [integration] is to provide forthe growth of a monolithic white voting block, therebyeffectively diluting the black vote in advance. This isjust as impermissible a purpose as the dilution of present black voting strength. Cf. City of Richmond, [422U. S.,] at 378." Id., at 472.That is, a nonretrogressive dilutive purpose is just as impermissible under $ 5 as a retrogressive one. Today's holdingcontradicts that. The majority is overruling Pleasant Grove.The majority proffers no justification for denying the precedential value of Pleasant Grove. Instead it observes thatreading the purpose prong of $ 5 as covering more than retrogression (as Richmond and Pleasant Grove read it) would"exacerbate the `substantial' federalism costs that the preclearance procedure already exacts." Ante, at 336. Butmy reading, like the Court's own prior reading, would notraise the cost of federalism one penny above what the Congress meant it to be. The behavior of Bossier Parish is aplain effort to deny the voting equality that the Constitutionjust as plainly guarantees. The point of $ 5 is to thwart theingenuity of the School Board's effort to stay ahead of challenges under $ 2. Its object is to bring the country closerto transcending a history of intransigence to enforcementof the Fifteenth Amendment. Now, however, the promiseof $ 5 is substantially diminished. Now executive and judicial officers of the United States will be forced to preclearillegal and unconstitutional voting schemes patently intended to perpetuate discrimination. The appeal to federalism is no excuse. I respectfully dissent.528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN373Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Stevens, J., dissentingJustice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,dissenting.In its administration of the voting rights statute for thepast quarter century, the Department of Justice has consistently employed a construction of the Voting Rights Actof 1965 contrary to that imposed upon the Act by the Courttoday. Apart from the deference such constructions arealways afforded, the Department's reading points us directlyto the necessary starting point of any exercise in statutoryinterpretation--the plain language of the statute.It is not impossible that language alone would lead oneto think that the phrase "will not have the effect" includessome temporal measure; the noun "effect" and the verb tense"will have" could imaginably give rise to a reading that requires a comparison between what is and what will be. Butthere is simply nothing in the word "purpose" or the entirephrase "does not have the purpose" that would lead anyoneto think that Congress had anything in mind but a presenttense, intentional effort to "den[y] or abridg[e] the right tovote on account of race." See,e. g., Webster's Third NewInternational Dictionary 1847 (1966). Ergo, if a municipality intends to deny or abridge voting rights because of race,it may not obtain preclearance.LikeJustice Souter, I am persuaded that the dissenting opinions of Justices White and Marshall were more faith-ful to the intent of the Congress that enacted the VotingRights Act of 1965 than that of the majority in Beer v. UnitedStates, 425 U. S. 130 (1976). One need not, however, disavow that precedent in order to explain my profound dis-agreement with the Court's holding today. The readingabove makes clear that there is no necessary tension be-tween theBeer majority's interpretation of the word "effect"in $ 5 and the Department's consistent interpretation of theword "purpose." For even if retrogression is an acceptable standard for identifying prohibited effects, that assumption does not justify an interpretation of the word528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.Breyer, J., dissenting"purpose" that is at war with both controlling precedentand the plain meaning of the statutory text.Accordingly, for these reasons and for those stated atgreater length byJustice Souter, I respectfully dissent.Justice Breyer, dissenting.I agree with Justice Souter, with one qualification.I would not reconsider the correctness of the Court's deci-sion inBeer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130 (1976)--an "effects" case--because, regardless, $ 5 of the Voting Rights Actof 1965 prohibits preclearance of a voting change that hasthe purpose of unconstitutionally depriving minorities of theright to vote.As Justice Souter points out, ante, at 360-361 (opinionconcurring in part and dissenting in part), Congress enacted$ 5 in 1965 in part to prevent certain jurisdictions from limiting the number of black voters through "the extraordinarystratagem of contriving new rules of various kinds for thesole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination in theface of adverse federal court decrees." South Carolinav. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 335 (1966). This "stratagem"created a moving target with a consequent risk of judicialrunaround. See, e. g., Perkins v. Matthews, 400 U. S. 379,395-396 (1971). And this "stratagem" could prove similarlyeffective where the State's "new rules" were intended to retrogress and where they were not. Indeed, since at the time,in certain places, historical discrimination had left the number of black voters at close to zero, retrogression would haveproved virtually impossible where $ 5 was needed most.An example drawn from history makes the point clear. InForrest County, Mississippi, as of 1962, precisely threetenths of 1% of the voting age black population was registered to vote. United States v. Mississippi, 229 F. Supp.925, 994, n. 86 (SD Miss. 1964) (dissenting opinion), rev'd, 380U. S. 128 (1965). This number was due in large part to thecounty registrar's discriminatory application of the State's528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN375Cite as: 528 U. S. 320 (2000)Breyer, J., dissentingvoter registration requirements. Prior to 1961, the regis-trar had simply refused to accept voter registration formsfrom black citizens. See United States v. Lynd, 301 F. 2d818, 821 (CA5 1962). After 1961, those blacks who wereallowed to apply to register had been subjected to a moredifficult test than whites, while whites had been offeredassistance with their less taxing applications. And the registrar, upon denying the applications of black citizens, hadrefused to supply them with an explanation.Id., at 822.The Government attacked these practices, and the FifthCircuit enjoined the registrar from "[f]ailing to process applications for registrations submitted by Negro applicantson the same basis as applications submitted by white applicants." Id., at 823.Mississippi's "immediate response" to this injunction wasto impose a "good moral character requirement," Mississippi, supra, at 997, a standard this Court has characterized as "an open invitation to abuse at the hands of votingofficials," Katzenbach, supra, at 313. One federal judgebelieved that this change was designed to avoid the FifthCircuit's injunction by "defy[ing] a Federal Appellate Courtdetermination that particular applicants were qualified[to vote]." Mississippi, supra, at 997. Such defiance wouldresult in maintaining--though not, in light of the absence ofblacks from the Forrest County voting rolls, in increasing--white political supremacy.This is precisely the kind of activity for which $ 5 was designed, and the purpose of $ 5 would have demanded its application in such a case. See, e. g., Perkins, supra, at 395-396 (Congress knew that the "Department of Justice d[id]not have the resources to police effectively all the States . . .covered by the Act," and $ 5 was intended to ensure thatStates not institute "new laws with respect to voting thatmight have a racially discriminatory purpose"); Katzenbach,supra, at 314 (Prior to 1965, "[e]ven when favorable decisionsha[d] finally been obtained, some of the States affected ha[d]528US2 Unit: $U23 [06-27-01 14:26:56] PAGES PGT: OPIN376 RENO v.

See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 439, 89th Cong., 1stSess., 10 (1965) ("Barring one contrivance too often hascaused no change in result, only in methods"); S. Rep.No. 162, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 3, p. 12 (1965) ( joint viewsof 12 members of Senate Judiciary Committee, describingUnited States v. Parker, 236 F. Supp. 511, 517 (MD Ala.1964), in which a jurisdiction responded to an injunction byinstituting various means for "the rejection of qualifiedNegro applicants"); Hearings on H. R. 6400 before Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the Judiciary,89th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1965) (testimony of Attorney General Katzenbach) (discussing those jurisdictions that are"able, even after apparent defeat in the courts, to devisewhole new methods of discrimination"); Hearings on S. 1564before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 89th Cong.,1st Sess., pt. 1, p. 11 (1965) (testimony of Attorney GeneralKatzenbach) (similar).It seems obvious, then, that if Mississippi had enactedits "moral character" requirement in 1966 (after enactmentof the Voting Rights Act), a court applying $ 5 would havefound "the purpose . . . of denying or abridging the rightto vote on account of race," even if Mississippi had in-tended to permit, say, 0.4%, rather than 0.3%, of the blackvoting age population of Forrest County to register. Andif so, then irrespective of the complexity surrounding theadministration of an "effects" test, the answer to today'spurpose question is "yes."528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN377OCTOBER TERM, 1999SyllabusNIXON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MISSOURI, et al.v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PAC et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuitNo. 98-963. Argued October 5, 1999--Decided January 24, 2000Respondents Shrink Missouri Government PAC, a political action committee, and Zev David Fredman, a candidate for the 1998 Republican nomination for Missouri state auditor, filed suit, alleging that a Missouri statute imposing limits ranging from $275 to $1,075 on contributions tocandidates for state office violated their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Shrink Missouri gave Fredman $1,025 in 1997, and $50 in1998, and represented that, without the statutory limitation, it wouldcontribute more. Fredman alleged he could campaign effectively onlywith more generous contributions than the statute allowed. On crossmotions for summary judgment, the District Court sustained the statute. Applying Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (per curiam), the courtfound adequate support for the law in the proposition that large contributions raise suspicions of influence peddling tending to undermine citizens' confidence in government integrity. The court rejected respondents' contention that inflation since Buckley's approval of a federal$1,000 restriction meant that the state limit of $1,075 for a statewideoffice could not be constitutional today. In reversing, the Eighth Circuit found that Buckley had articulated and applied a strict scrutinystandard of review, and held that Missouri had to demonstrate that ithad a compelling interest and that the contribution limits at issue werenarrowly drawn to serve that interest. Treating Missouri's claim ofa compelling interest in avoiding the corruption or the perception ofcorruption caused by candidates' acceptance of large campaign contributions as insufficient by itself to satisfy strict scrutiny, the court requireddemonstrable evidence that genuine problems resulted from contributions in amounts greater than the statutory limits. It ruled that theState's evidence was inadequate for this purpose.Held: Buckley is authority for comparable state limits on contributions tostate political candidates, and those limits need not be pegged to theprecise dollar amounts approved in Buckley. Pp. 385-398.(a) The Buckley Court held, inter alia, that a Federal Election Campaign Act provision placing a $1,000 annual ceiling on independentexpenditures linked to specific candidates for federal office infringedspeech and association guarantees of the First Amendment and the528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN378 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACSyllabusEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth, but upheld other provisionslimiting contributions by individuals to any single candidate to $1,000per election. P. 385.(b) In addressing the speech claim, the Buckley Court explicitly rejected both intermediate scrutiny for communicative action, see UnitedStates v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, and the similar standard applicable tomerely time, place, and manner restrictions, see, e. g., Adderley v. Florida, 385 U. S. 39, and instead referred generally to "the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment," 424 U. S., at 16. The Courtthen drew a line between expenditures and contributions, treating expenditure restrictions as direct restraints on speech, id., at 19, but saying, in effect, that limiting contributions left communication significantlyunimpaired, id., at 20-21. The Court flagged a similar difference between the impacts of expenditure and contribution limits on associationrights, id., at 22; see also id., at 28, and later made that distinctionexplicit, e. g., Federal Election Comm'n v. Massachusetts Citizens forLife, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 259-260. Thus, under Buckley's standard ofscrutiny, a contribution limit involving significant interference with associational rights could survive if the Government demonstrated thatregulating contributions was a means "closely drawn" to match a "sufficiently important interest," 424 U. S., at 25, though the dollar amountof the limit need not be "fine tun[ed]," id., at 30. While Buckley didnot attempt to parse distinctions between the speech and associationalstandards of scrutiny for contribution limits, the Court made clear thatsuch restrictions bore more heavily on associational rights than onspeech rights, and thus proceeded on the understanding that a contribution limitation surviving a claim of associational abridgment would survive a speech challenge as well. The Court found the prevention ofcorruption and the appearance of corruption to be a constitutionally sufficient justification for the contribution limits at issue. Id., at 25-28.Pp. 386-389.(c) In defending its statute, Missouri espouses those same interests ofpreventing corruption and the appearance of it. Even without Buckley,there would be no serious question about the legitimacy of these interests, which underlie bribery and antigratuity statutes. Rather, respondents take the State to task for failing to justify the invocation ofthose interests with empirical evidence of actually corrupt practices orof a perception among Missouri voters that unrestricted contributionsmust have been exerting a covertly corrosive influence. The state statute is not void, however, for want of evidence. The quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislativejudgments will vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of thejustification raised. Buckley demonstrates that the dangers of large,528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN379Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Syllabuscorrupt contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are corrupt are neither novel nor implausible. See 424 U. S., at 27, and n. 28.Respondents are wrong in arguing that this Court has "supplemented"its Buckley holding with a new requirement that governments enactingcontribution limits must demonstrate that the recited harms are real,not merely conjectural, a contention for which respondents rely principally on Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. FederalElection Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604. This Court has never accepted mereconjecture as adequate to carry a First Amendment burden, and Colorado Republican deals not with a government's burden to justify contribution limits, but with limits on independent expenditures by politicalparties, which the principal opinion expressly distinguished from contribution limits. Id., at 615-618. In any event, this case does not presenta close call requiring further definition of whatever the State's evidentiary obligation may be. Although the record does not show that theMissouri Legislature relied on the evidence and findings accepted inBuckley, the evidence introduced by petitioners or cited by the lowercourts in this action and a prior case involving a related ballot initiativeis enough to show that the substantiation of the congressional concernsreflected in Buckley has its counterpart in support of the Missouri law.Moreover, although majority votes do not, as such, defeat First Amendment protections, the statewide vote adopting the initiative attested tothe public perception that contribution limits are necessary to combatcorruption and the appearance thereof. A more extensive evidentiarydocumentation might be necessary if respondents had made any showing of their own to cast doubt on the apparent implications of Buckley'sevidence and the record here. However, the nearest they come to challenging these conclusions is their invocation of academic studies that arecontradicted by other studies. Pp. 390-395.(d) There is no support for respondents' various arguments that theMissouri limitations are so different in kind from those sustained inBuckley as to raise essentially a new issue about the adequacy of theMissouri statute's tailoring to serve its purposes. Here, as in Buckley,supra, at 21, there is no indication that those limits have had any dramatic adverse effect on the funding of campaigns and political associations, and thus there is no showing that the limitations prevented candidates from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy.Indeed, the District Court found that since the Missouri limits becameeffective, candidates for state office have been able to raise funds sufficient to run effective campaigns, and that candidates are still able toamass impressive campaign war chests. The plausibility of these conclusions is buttressed by petitioners' evidence that in the last electionbefore the contributions became effective, 97.62 percent of all contribu528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN380 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACSyllabustors to candidates for state auditor made contributions of $2,000 or less.Even assuming that the contribution limits affected respondentFredman's ability to wage a competitive campaign, a showing of oneaffected individual does not point up a system of suppressed politicaladvocacy that would be unconstitutional under Buckley. The DistrictCourt's conclusions and the supporting evidence also suffice to answerrespondents' variant claim that the Missouri limits today differ in kindfrom Buckley's owing to inflation since that case was decided. Respondents' assumption that Buckley set a minimum constitutionalthreshold for contribution limits, which in dollars adjusted for loss ofpurchasing power are now well above the lines drawn by Missouri, is afundamental misunderstanding of that case. The Court there specifically rejected the contention that $1,000, or any other amount, was aconstitutional minimum, and instead asked whether the contributionlimitation was so low as to impede the ability of candidates to amass theresources necessary for effective advocacy. 424 U.

SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACOpinion of the Courtwhether the federal limits approved in Buckley, with orwithout adjustment for inflation, define the scope of permissible state limitations today. We hold Buckley to be author-ity for comparable state regulation, which need not bepegged to Buckley's dollars.IIn 1994, the Legislature of Missouri enacted Senate Bill650 to restrict the permissible amounts of contributions tocandidates for state office. Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 130.032 (1994).Before the statute became effective, however, Missouri voters approved a ballot initiative with even stricter contribu-tion limits, effective immediately. The United States Courtof Appeals for the Eighth Circuit then held the initiative'scontribution limits unconstitutional under the First Amendment, Carver v. Nixon, 72 F. 3d 633, 645 (CA8 1995), cert.denied, 518 U. S. 1033 (1996), with the upshot that the previously dormant 1994 statute took effect. Shrink MissouriGovernment PAC v. Adams, 161 F. 3d 519, 520 (CA8 1998).As amended in 1997, that statute imposes contribution lim-its ranging from $250 to $1,000, depending on specified stateoffice or size of constituency. See Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 130.032.1(1998 Cum. Supp.); 161 F. 3d, at 520. The particular provision challenged here reads that"[t]o elect an individual to the office of governor, lieuten-ant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, stateauditor or attorney general, [[t]he amount of contribu-tions made by or accepted from any person other thanthe candidate in any one election shall not exceed] onethousand dollars." Mo. Rev. Stat. $ 130.032.1(1) (1998Cum. Supp.).The statutory dollar amounts are baselines for an adjust-ment each even-numbered year, to be made "by multiplyingthe base year amount by the cumulative consumer price528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN383Cite as: 528 U.

Shrink Missourigave $1,025 to Fredman's candidate committee in 1997, andanother $50 in 1998. Shrink Missouri represented that,without the limitation, it would contribute more to theFredman campaign. Fredman alleged he could campaigneffectively only with more generous contributions than$ 130.032.1 allowed. Shrink Missouri Government PAC v.Adams, 5 F.

Supp.2d, at 740.The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit nonethelessenjoined enforcement of the law pending appeal, 151 F. 3d763, 765 (1998), and ultimately reversed the District Court,161 F. 3d, at 520. Finding that Buckley had " `articulatedand applied a strict scrutiny standard of review,' " the Courtof Appeals held that Missouri was bound to demonstrate"that it has a compelling interest and that the contributionlimits at issue are narrowly drawn to serve that interest."161 F. 3d, at 521 (quotingCarver v. Nixon, supra, at 637).The appeals court treated Missouri's claim of a compellinginterest "in avoiding the corruption or the perception of corruption brought about when candidates for elective office ac-cept large campaign contributions" as insufficient by itself tosatisfy strict scrutiny. 161 F. 3d, at 521-522. Relying onCircuit precedent, seeRussell v. Burris, 146 F. 3d 563, 568(CA8), cert. denied, 525 U. S. 1001 (1998); Carver v. Nixon,supra, at 638, the Court of Appeals required"some demonstrable evidence that there were genuineproblems that resulted from contributions in amountsgreater than the limits in place. . . ."[T]he Buckley Court noted the perfidy that had beenuncovered in federal campaign financing in 1972. . . .But we are unwilling to extrapolate from those exam-ples that in Missouri at this time there is corruption ora perception of corruption from `large' campaign contributions, without some evidence that such problemsreally exist." 161 F. 3d, at 521-522 (citations omitted).The court thought that the only evidence presented by theState, an affidavit from the cochairman of the state legislature's Interim Joint Committee on Campaign Finance Reform when the statute was passed, was inadequate to raise528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN385Cite as: 528 U.

Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976)(per curiam), included claims that federal campaign financelegislation infringed speech and association protections ofthe First Amendment and the equal protection guarantee ofthe Fifth. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, 86Stat. 3, as amended by the Federal Election Campaign ActAmendments of 1974, 88 Stat. 1263, limited (and still limits)contributions by individuals to any single candidate for fed-eral office to $1,000 per election. 18 U. S. C. $$ 608(b)(1), (3)(1970 ed., Supp. IV); Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 13. UntilBuckley struck it down, the law also placed a $1,000 annualceiling on independent expenditures linked to specific candidates. 18 U. S. C. $ 608(e) (1970 ed., Supp. IV); 424 U. S.,at 13. We found violations of the First Amendment in theexpenditure regulations, but held the contribution restric-tions constitutional.Buckley v. Valeo, supra.2 Chief Judge Bowman also would have found the law invalid becausethe contribution limits were severely tailored beyond any need to servethe State's interest. Comparing the Missouri limits with those consideredin Buckley, the Chief Judge said that "[a]fter inflation, limits of $1,075,$525, and $275 cannot compare with the $1,000 limit approved in Buckleytwenty-two years ago," and "can only be regarded as `too low to allowmeaningful participation in protected political speech and association.' "161 F. 3d, at 522-523 (quoting Day v. Holahan, 34 F. 3d 1356, 1366 (CA81994), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 1127 (1995)). Judge Ross, concurring in thejudgment, did not join this portion of Chief Judge Bowman's opinion. 161F. 3d, at 523.Judge Gibson dissented from the panel's decision. Ibid.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN386 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACOpinion of the CourtAPrecision about the relative rigor of the standard to reviewcontribution limits was not a pretense of the Buckley percuriam opinion. To be sure, in addressing the speech claim,we explicitly rejected both O'Brien intermediate scrutinyfor communicative action, see United States v. O'Brien, 391U. S. 367 (1968), and the similar standard applicable tomerely time, place, and manner restrictions, see Adderley v.Florida, 385 U. S. 39 (1966); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 536(1965); Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77 (1949). In distinguishing these tests, the discussion referred generally to "the exacting scrutiny required by the First Amendment," Buckleyv. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 16, and added that " `the constitutionalguarantee has its fullest and most urgent application precisely to the conduct of campaigns for political office,' " id.,at 15 (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U. S. 265,272 (1971)).We then, however, drew a line between expenditures andcontributions, treating expenditure restrictions as directrestraints on speech, 424 U. S., at 19, which nonetheless suffered little direct effect from contribution limits:"[A] limitation upon the amount that any one person orgroup may contribute to a candidate or political committee entails only a marginal restriction upon the contributor's ability to engage in free communication. A contribution serves as a general expression of support for thecandidate and his views, but does not communicate theunderlying basis for the support. The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution, since the expression rests solely on the undifferentiated symbolic act ofcontributing. At most, the size of the contribution provides a very rough index of the intensity of the contributor's support for the candidate. A limitation on theamount of money a person may give to a candidate or528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN387Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Opinion of the Courtcampaign organization thus involves little direct re-straint on his political communication, for it permits thesymbolic expression of support evidenced by a contribu-tion but does not in any way infringe the contributor'sfreedom to discuss candidates and issues." Id., at 20-21(footnote omitted).We thus said, in effect, that limiting contributions left com-munication significantly unimpaired.We flagged a similar difference between expenditure andcontribution limitations in their impacts on the associationright. While an expenditure limit "precludes most associa-tions from effectively amplifying the voice of their adherents," id., at 22 (thus interfering with the freedom of theadherents as well as the association,ibid.), the contributionlimits "leave the contributor free to become a member of anypolitical association and to assist personally in the associa-tion's efforts on behalf of candidates," ibid.; see also id., at28. While we did not then say in so many words that differ-ent standards might govern expenditure and contributionlimits affecting associational rights, we have since then saidso explicitly in Federal Election Comm'n v. MassachusettsCitizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238, 259-260 (1986): "Wehave consistently held that restrictions on contributions require less compelling justification than restrictions on inde-pendent spending." It has, in any event, been plain eversince Buckley that contribution limits would more readilyclear the hurdles before them. Cf.Colorado RepublicanFederal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518U. S. 604, 610 (1996) (opinion of Breyer, J.) (noting that incampaign finance case law, "[t]he provisions that the Courtfound constitutional mostly imposed contribution limits"(emphasis in original)). Thus, under Buckley's standard ofscrutiny, a contribution limit involving "significant interfer-ence" with associational rights, 424 U. S., at 25 (internal quotation marks omitted), could survive if the Government dem-onstrated that contribution regulation was "closely drawn"528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN388 NIXON v.

We consequently proceeded on theunderstanding that a contribution limitation surviving aclaim of associational abridgment would survive a speechchallenge as well, and we held the standard satisfied by thecontribution limits under review."[T]he prevention of corruption and the appearance ofcorruption" was found to be a "constitutionally sufficientjustification," id., at 25-26:"To the extent that large contributions are given to se-cure a political quid pro quo from current and potentialoffice holders, the integrity of our system of representa-tive democracy is undermined. . . ."Of almost equal concern as the danger of actual quidpro quo arrangements is the impact of the appearanceof corruption stemming from public awareness of the op-portunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial contributions. . . .

These werethe obvious points behind our recognition that the Congresscould constitutionally address the power of money "to influence governmental action" in ways less "blatant and specific"than bribery.Buckley v.

SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACOpinion of the CourtBIn defending its own statute, Missouri espouses thosesame interests of preventing corruption and the appearanceof it that flows from munificent campaign contributions.Even without the authority ofBuckley, there would be noserious question about the legitimacy of the interestsclaimed, which, after all, underlie bribery and antigratuitystatutes. While neither law nor morals equate all politicalcontributions, without more, with bribes, we spoke in Buck-ley of the perception of corruption "inherent in a regime oflarge individual financial contributions" to candidates forpublic office,id., at 27, as a source of concern "almost equal"to quid pro quo improbity, ibid. The public interest in countering that perception was, indeed, the entire answer to theoverbreadth claim raised in the Buckley case. Id., at 30.This made perfect sense. Leave the perception of impropri-ety unanswered, and the cynical assumption that large donors call the tune could jeopardize the willingness of votersto take part in democratic governance. Democracy works"only if the people have faith in those who govern, and thatfaith is bound to be shattered when high officials and theirappointees engage in activities which arouse suspicions ofmalfeasance and corruption."United States v. MississippiValley Generating Co., 364 U. S. 520, 562 (1961).Although respondents neither challenge the legitimacy ofthese objectives nor call for any reconsideration of Buckley,they take the State to task, as the Court of Appeals did,for failing to justify the invocation of those interests withempirical evidence of actually corrupt practices or of a perfaced. We found no support for the proposition that an incumbent's advantages were leveraged into something significantly more powerful bycontribution limitations applicable to all candidates, whether veterans orupstarts, 424 U. S., at 31-35. Since we do not relax Buckley's standard,no more need be said about respondents' argument, though we note thatnothing in the record here gives respondents a stronger argument thanthe Buckley petitioners made.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN391Cite as: 528 U.

Buckley demonstrates that the dangers oflarge, corrupt contributions and the suspicion that large contributions are corrupt are neither novel nor implausible.The opinion noted that "the deeply disturbing examples surfacing after the 1972 election demonstrate that the problem[of corruption] is not an illusory one." 424 U. S., at 27, andn. 28. Although we did not ourselves marshal the evidencein support of the congressional concern, we referred to "anumber of the abuses" detailed in the Court of Appeals'sdecision,ibid., which described how corporations, well-financed interest groups, and rich individuals had made largecontributions, some of which were illegal under existing law,others of which reached at least the verge of bribery. SeeBuckley v. Valeo, 519 F. 2d 821, 839-840, and nn. 36-38(CADC 1975). The evidence before the Court of Appealsdescribed public revelations by the parties in question morethan sufficient to show why voters would tend to identify abig donation with a corrupt purpose.WhileBuckley's evidentiary showing exemplifies a suffi-cient justification for contribution limits, it does not speak towhat may be necessary as a minimum.5 As to that, respond5 Cf.

Brief for Pacific Legal Foundation et al.as Amici Curiae 23-29. We specifically rejected this notion in Buckleyv. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), where we said that antibriberylaws "deal with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those withmoney to influence government action," and that "Congress was surelyentitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial measure, and thatcontribution ceilings were a necessary legislative concomitant to deal withthe reality or appearance of corruption inherent in a system permittingunlimited financial contributions, even when the identities of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions are fully disclosed." Id., at28. We understood contribution limits, on the other hand, to "focu[s] precisely on the problem of large campaign contributions--the narrow aspectof political association where the actuality and potential for corruptionhave been identified--while leaving persons free to engage in independentpolitical expression, to associate actively through volunteering their services, and to assist to a limited but nonetheless substantial extent in supporting candidates and committees with financial resources." Ibid.There is no reason to view contribution limits any differently today.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN396 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACOpinion of the Court"the limitations prevented candidates and political commit-tees from amassing the resources necessary for effective advocacy." 424 U. S., at 21. The District Court found herethat in the period since the Missouri limits became effective,"candidates for state elected office [have been] quite able toraise funds sufficient to run effective campaigns," 5 F. Supp.2d, at 740, and that "candidates for political office in the stateare still able to amass impressive campaign war chests,"id.,at 741.8 The plausibility of these conclusions is buttressedby petitioners' evidence that in the 1994 Missouri elections(before any relevant state limitations went into effect), 97.62percent of all contributors to candidates for state auditormade contributions of $2,000 or less.Ibid.; App. 34-36.9Even if we were to assume that the contribution limits af-fected respondent Fredman's ability to wage a competitivecampaign (no small assumption given that Fredman onlyidentified one contributor, Shrink Missouri, that would havegiven him more than $1,075 per election), a showing of oneaffected individual does not point up a system of suppressedpolitical advocacy that would be unconstitutional underBuckley.These conclusions of the District Court and the supportingevidence also suffice to answer respondents' variant claimthat the Missouri limits today differ in kind fromBuckley'sowing to inflation since 1976. Respondents seem to assumethatBuckley set a minimum constitutional threshold for contribution limits, which in dollars adjusted for loss of purchas-ing power are now well above the lines drawn by Missouri.But this assumption is a fundamental misunderstanding ofwhat we held.8 This case does not, however, involve any claim that the Missouri lawhas restricted access to the ballot in any election other than that forstate auditor.9 Similarly, data showed that less than 1.5 percent of the contributors tocandidates in the 1992 election for Missouri secretary of state made aggregate contributions in excess of $2,000. 5 F.

S. 377 (2000)Opinion of the CourtIn Buckley, we specifically rejected the contention that$1,000, or any other amount, was a constitutional minimumbelow which legislatures could not regulate. As indicatedabove, we referred instead to the outer limits of contributionregulation by asking whether there was any showing thatthe limits were so low as to impede the ability of candidatesto "amas[s] the resources necessary for effective advocacy,"424 U. S., at 21. We asked, in other words, whether the contribution limitation was so radical in effect as to render polit-ical association ineffective, drive the sound of a candidate'svoice below the level of notice, and render contributionspointless. Such being the test, the issue in later cases cannot be truncated to a narrow question about the power ofthe dollar, but must go to the power to mount a campaignwith all the dollars likely to be forthcoming. As Judge Gib-son put it, the dictates of the First Amendment are not merefunctions of the Consumer Price Index. 161 F. 3d, at 525(dissenting opinion).DThe dissenters in this case think our reasoning evades thereal issue.Justice Thomas chides us for "hiding behind"Buckley, post, at 422, and Justice Kennedy faults us forseeing this case as "a routine application of our analysis" inBuckley instead of facing up to what he describes as theconsequences ofBuckley, post, at 405. Each dissenterwould overrule Buckley and thinks we should do the same.The answer is that we are supposed to decide this case.Shrink and Fredman did not request that Buckley be overruled; the furthest reach of their arguments about the lawwas that subsequent decisions already on the books had enhanced the State's burden of justification beyond what Buck-ley required, a proposition we have rejected as mistaken.IIIThere is no reason in logic or evidence to doubt the suffi-ciency ofBuckley to govern this case in support of the Mis528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN398 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACStevens, J., concurringsouri statute. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is,accordingly, reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, concurring.Justice Kennedy suggests that the misuse of soft moneytolerated by this Court's misguided decision inColoradoRepublican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal ElectionComm'n, 518 U. S. 604 (1996), demonstrates the need for afresh examination of the constitutional issues raised by Congress' enactment of the Federal Election Campaign Acts of1971 and 1974 and this Court's resolution of those issues inBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). In re-sponse to his call for a new beginning, therefore, I make onesimple point. Money is property; it is not speech.Speech has the power to inspire volunteers to perform amultitude of tasks on a campaign trail, on a battleground, oreven on a football field. Money, meanwhile, has the powerto pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks. It doesnot follow, however, that the First Amendment provides thesame measure of protection to the use of money to accom-plish such goals as it provides to the use of ideas to achievethe same results.*Our Constitution and our heritage properly protect the individual's interest in making decisions about the use of hisor her own property. Governmental regulation of such decisions can sometimes be viewed either as "deprivations of lib*Unless, of course, the prohibition entirely forecloses a channel of communication, such as the use of paid petition circulators. See, e. g., Meyerv. Grant, 486 U. S. 414, 424 (1988) ("Colorado's prohibition of paid petition circulators restricts access to the most effective, fundamental, andperhaps economical avenue of political discourse, direct one-on-onecommunication. . . . The First Amendment protects appellees' right notonly to advocate their cause but also to select what they believe to be themost effective means for so doing").528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN399Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Breyer, J., concurringerty" or as "deprivations of property," see, e. g., Moore v.East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494, 513 (1977) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment). Telling a grandmother that she maynot use her own property to provide shelter to a grandchild--or to hire mercenaries to work in that grandchild'scampaign for public office--raises important constitutionalconcerns that are unrelated to the First Amendment. Because I did not participate in the Court's decision in Buckley,I did not have the opportunity to suggest then that thoseproperty and liberty concerns adequately explain the Court'sdecision to invalidate the expenditure limitations in the1974 Act.Reliance on the First Amendment to justify the invalidation of campaign finance regulations is the functional equivalent of the Court's candid reliance on the doctrine of substantive due process as articulated in the two prevailing opinionsin Moore v. East Cleveland. The right to use one's ownmoney to hire gladiators, or to fund "speech by proxy," certainly merits significant constitutional protection. Theseproperty rights, however, are not entitled to the same protection as the right to say what one pleases.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,concurring.The dissenters accuse the Court of weakening the FirstAmendment. They believe that failing to adopt a "strictscrutiny" standard "balance[s] away First Amendment freedoms." Post, at 410 (opinion of Thomas, J.). But the principal dissent oversimplifies the problem faced in the campaign finance context. It takes a difficult constitutionalproblem and turns it into a lopsided dispute between politicalexpression and government censorship. Under the cover ofthis fiction and its accompanying formula, the dissent wouldmake the Court absolute arbiter of a difficult question bestleft, in the main, to the political branches. I write sepa528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN400 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACBreyer, J., concurringrately to address the critical question of how the Court oughtto review this kind of problem, and to explain why I believethe Court's choice here is correct.If the dissent believes that the Court diminishes the importance of the First Amendment interests before us, it iswrong. The Court's opinion does not question the constitutional importance of political speech or that its protectionlies at the heart of the First Amendment. Nor does it ques-tion the need for particularly careful, precise, and independent judicial review where, as here, that protection is at issue.But this is a case where constitutionally protected interestslie on both sides of the legal equation. For that reason thereis no place for a strong presumption against constitutionality,of the sort often thought to accompany the words "strictscrutiny." Nor can we expect that mechanical applicationof the tests associated with "strict scrutiny"--the tests of"compelling interests" and "least restrictive means"--willproperly resolve the difficult constitutional problem thatcampaign finance statutes pose. Cf. Kovacs v. Cooper, 336U. S. 77, 96 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., concurring) (objecting, inthe First Amendment context, to "oversimplified formulas");see also Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic CentralComm., 489 U. S. 214, 233-234 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring); Illinois Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party,440 U. S. 173, 188-189 (1979) (Blackmun, J., concurring)(same).On the one hand, a decision to contribute money to a campaign is a matter of First Amendment concern--not becausemoney is speech (it is not); but because it enables speech.Through contributions the contributor associates himselfwith the candidate's cause, helps the candidate communicatea political message with which the contributor agrees, andhelps the candidate win by attracting the votes of similarlyminded voters. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1976)(per curiam). Both political association and political communication are at stake.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN401Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Breyer, J., concurringOn the other hand, restrictions upon the amount any oneindividual can contribute to a particular candidate seek toprotect the integrity of the electoral process--the meansthrough which a free society democratically translates political speech into concrete governmental action. See id., at26-27;Burroughs v. United States, 290 U. S. 534, 545 (1934)(upholding 1925 Federal Corrupt Practices Act by emphasizing constitutional importance of safeguarding the electoralprocess); see alsoBurson v. Freeman, 504 U. S. 191, 199(1992) (plurality opinion) (recognizing compelling interestin preserving integrity of electoral process). Moreover, bylimiting the size of the largest contributions, such restrictions aim to democratize the influence that money itself maybring to bear upon the electoral process. Cf. Reynolds v.Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 565 (1964) (in the context of apportionment, the Constitution "demands" that each citizen have "anequally effective voice"). In doing so, they seek to buildpublic confidence in that process and broaden the base ofa candidate's meaningful financial support, encouraging thepublic participation and open discussion that the FirstAmendment itself presupposes. See Mills v. Alabama, 384U. S. 214, 218-219 (1966); Whitney v. California, 274 U. S.357, 375-376 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring); A. Meiklejohn,Free Speech and Its Relation to Self-Government 24-27(1948).In service of these objectives, the statute imposes restrictions of degree. It does not deny the contributor the opportunity to associate with the candidate through a contribution,though it limits a contribution's size. Nor does it preventthe contributor from using money (alone or with others) topay for the expression of the same views in other ways. Instead, it permits all supporters to contribute the sameamount of money, in an attempt to make the process fairerand more democratic.Under these circumstances, a presumption against constitutionality is out of place. I recognize that Buckley used528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN402 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACBreyer, J., concurringlanguage that could be interpreted to the contrary. It said,for example, that it rejected "the concept that governmentmay restrict the speech of some elements of our society inorder to enhance the relative voice of others." 424 U. S.,at 48-49. But those words cannot be taken literally. TheConstitution often permits restrictions on the speech of somein order to prevent a few from drowning out the many--in Congress, for example, where constitutionally protecteddebate, Art. I, $ 6, is limited to provide every Member anequal opportunity to express his or her views. Or in elec-tions, where the Constitution tolerates numerous restrictions on ballot access, limiting the political rights of some soas to make effective the political rights of the entire electorate. See, e. g., Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 736 (1974).Regardless, as the result in Buckley made clear, the statement does not automatically invalidate a statute that seeksa fairer electoral debate through contribution limits, norshould it forbid the Court to take account of the competingconstitutional interests just mentioned.In such circumstances--where a law significantly implicates competing constitutionally protected interests in complex ways--the Court has closely scrutinized the statute'simpact on those interests, but refrained from employing asimple test that effectively presumes unconstitutionality.Rather, it has balanced interests. And in practice that hasmeant asking whether the statute burdens any one such interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute's salutaryeffects upon the others (perhaps, but not necessarily, becauseof the existence of a clearly superior, less restrictive alternative). Where a legislature has significantly greater institutional expertise, as, for example, in the field of election regulation, the Court in practice defers to empirical legislativejudgments--at least where that deference does not risk suchconstitutional evils as, say, permitting incumbents to insulatethemselves from effective electoral challenge. This approach is that taken in fact by Buckley for contributions, and528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN403Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Breyer, J., concurringis found generally where competing constitutional interestsare implicated, such as privacy, see,e. g., Frisby v. Schultz,487 U. S. 474, 485-488 (1988) (balancing rights of privacy andexpression);Rowan v. Post Office Dept., 397 U. S. 728, 736(1970) (same), First Amendment interests of listeners orviewers, see,e. g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,520 U. S. 180, 192-194 (1997) (recognizing the speech interests of both viewers and cable operators); Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee,412 U. S. 94, 102-103 (1973) ("Balancing the various FirstAmendment interests involved in the broadcast media . . . isa task of a great delicacy and difficulty"); Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 389-390 (1969) (FirstAmendment permits the Federal Communications Commission to restrict the speech of some to enable the speech ofothers), and the integrity of the electoral process, see, e. g.,Burson, supra, at 198-211 (weighing First Amendmentrights against electoral integrity necessary for right to vote);Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 788-790 (1983) (same);Storer v. Brown, supra, at 730 ("[T]here must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest").The approach taken by these cases is consistent with that ofother constitutional courts facing similarly complex constitutional problems. See, e. g., Bowman v. United Kingdom, 26Eur. Ct. H. R. 1 (European Comm'n of Human Rights 1998)(demanding proportionality in the campaign finance context);Libman v. Quebec (Attorney General), 151 D. L. R. (4th) 385(Canada 1997) (same). For the dissenters to call the approach "sui generis," post, at 410 (opinion of Thomas, J.),overstates their case.Applying this approach to the present case, I would upholdthe statute essentially for the reasons stated by the Court.I agree that the legislature understands the problem--thethreat to electoral integrity, the need for democratization--better than do we. We should defer to its political judgmentthat unlimited spending threatens the integrity of the528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN404 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACBreyer, J., concurringelectoral process. But we should not defer in respectto whether its solution, by imposing too low a contribution limit, significantly increases the reputation-related ormedia-related advantages of incumbency and thereby insulates legislators from effective electoral challenge. Thestatutory limit here, $1,075 (or 378, 1976 dollars), is lowenough to raise such a question. But given the empiricalinformation presented--the type of election at issue; the rec-ord of adequate candidate financing postreform; and the factthat the statute indexes the amount for inflation--I agreewith the Court that the statute does not work disproportionate harm. The limit may have prevented the plaintiff, ZevDavid Fredman, from financing his own campaign for office,for Fredman's support among potential contributors was notsufficiently widespread. But any contribution statute (likeany statute setting ballot eligibility requirements, see, e. g.,Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431, 442 (1971)) will narrowthe field of conceivable challengers to some degree. Undueinsulation is a practical matter, and it cannot be inferred automatically from the fact that the limit makes ballot accessmore difficult for one previously unsuccessful candidate.The approach I have outlined here is consistent with theapproach this Court has taken in many complex FirstAmendment cases. See supra, at 402-403. The Buckleydecision, as well, might be interpreted as embodying sufficient flexibility for the problem at hand. After all, Buckley's holding seems to leave the political branches broad authority to enact laws regulating contributions that take theform of "soft money." It held public financing laws constitutional, 424 U. S., at 57, n. 65, 85-109. It says nothing oneway or the other about such important proposed reforms asreduced-price media time. And later cases presuppose thatthe Federal Election Commission has the delegated authority to interpret broad statutory provisions in light of thecampaign finance law's basic purposes, despite disagreements over whether the Commission has exercised that au528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN405Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Kennedy, J., dissentingthority in a particular case. See Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518U. S. 604, 619-621 (1996) (whether claimed "independentexpenditure" is a "coordinated expenditure"); accord,id., at648-650 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Alternatively, it mightprove possible to reinterpret aspects ofBuckley in light ofthe post-Buckley experience stressed by Justice Kennedy,post, at 406-409 (dissenting opinion), making less absolutethe contribution/expenditure line, particularly in respectto independently wealthy candidates, whose expendituresmight be considered contributions to their own campaigns.But what if I am wrong about Buckley? Suppose Buckley denies the political branches sufficient leeway to enactcomprehensive solutions to the problems posed by campaignfinance. If so, like Justice Kennedy, I believe the Constitution would require us to reconsider Buckley. With thatunderstanding I join the Court's opinion.Justice Kennedy, dissenting.The Court's decision has lasting consequences for politicalspeech in the course of elections, the speech upon which democracy depends. Yet in defining the controlling standardof review and applying it to the urgent claim presented, theCourt seems almost indifferent. Its analysis would not beacceptable for the routine case of a single protester with ahand-scrawled sign, see City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43(1994), a few demonstrators on a public sidewalk, see UnitedStates v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171 (1983), or a driver who tapedover the motto on his license plate because he disagreed withits message, see Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U. S. 705 (1977).Surely the Court's approach is unacceptable for a case announcing a rule that suppresses one of our most essentialand prevalent forms of political speech.It would be no answer to say that this is a routine application of our analysis in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976)(per curiam), to a similar set of facts, so that a cavalier dis528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN406 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACKennedy, J., dissentingmissal of respondents' claim is appropriate. The justifica-tions for the case system and stare decisis must rest uponthe Court's capacity, and responsibility, to acknowledge itsmissteps. It is our duty to face up to adverse, unintendedconsequences flowing from our own prior decisions. Withall respect, I submit the Court does not accept this obligationin the case before us. Instead, it perpetuates and com-pounds a serious distortion of the First Amendment resulting from our own intervention in Buckley. The Court isconcerned about voter suspicion of the role of money in politics. Amidst an atmosphere of skepticism, however, ithardly inspires confidence for the Court to abandon the rigors of our traditional First Amendment structure.IZev David Fredman asks us to evaluate his speech claimin the context of a system which favors candidates and officeholders whose campaigns are supported by soft money,usually funneled through political parties. The Court payshim no heed. The plain fact is that the compromise theCourt invented in Buckley set the stage for a new kind ofspeech to enter the political system. It is covert speech.The Court has forced a substantial amount of political speechunderground, as contributors and candidates devise evermore elaborate methods of avoiding contribution limits, limits which take no account of rising campaign costs. The pre-ferred method has been to conceal the real purpose of thespeech. Soft money may be contributed to political partiesin unlimited amounts, seeColorado Republican FederalCampaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S.604, 616 (1996), and is used often to fund so-called issue advo-cacy, advertisements that promote or attack a candidate's positions without specifically urging his or her election or de-feat.

S. 377 (2000)Kennedy, J., dissentingsupra, at 42-44, while straightforward speech in the form offinancial contributions paid to a candidate, speech subject tofull disclosure and prompt evaluation by the public, is not.Thus has the Court's decision given us covert speech. Thismocks the First Amendment. The current system would beunfortunate, and suspect under the First Amendment, had itevolved from a deliberate legislative choice; but its unhappyorigins are in our earlier decree in Buckley, which by accept-ing half of what Congress did (limiting contributions) butrejecting the other (limiting expenditures) created a mis-shapen system, one which distorts the meaning of speech.The irony that we would impose this regime in the name offree speech ought to be sufficient ground to reject Buckley'swooden formula in the present case. The wrong goesdeeper, however. By operation of the Buckley rule, a candidate cannot oppose this system in an effective way withoutselling out to it first. Soft money must be raised to attackthe problem of soft money. In effect, the Court immunizesits own erroneous ruling from change. Rulings of thisCourt must never be viewed with more caution than whenthey provide immunity from their own correction in the political process and in the forum of unrestrained speech. Themelancholy history of campaign finance in Buckley's wakeshows what can happen when we intervene in the dynamicsof speech and expression by inventing an artificial scheme ofour own.The case in one sense might seem unimportant. It appears that Mr. Fredman was an outsider candidate who maynot have had much of a chance. Yet, by binding him to theoutdated limit of $1,075 per contribution in a system whereparties can raise soft money without limitation and a powerful press faces no restrictions on use of its own resources toback its preferred candidates, the Court tells Mr. Fredmanhe cannot challenge the status quo unless he first gives intoit. This is not the First Amendment with which I amfamiliar.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN408 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACKennedy, J., dissentingTo defend its extension of Buckley to present times, theCourt, of course, recites the dangers of corruption, or theappearance of corruption, when an interested person contrib-utes money to a candidate. What the Court does not do isexamine and defend the substitute it has encouraged, covertspeech funded by unlimited soft money. In my view thatsystem creates dangers greater than the one it has replaced.The first danger is the one already mentioned: that we re-quire contributors of soft money and its beneficiaries to masktheir real purpose. Second, we have an indirect system ofaccountability that is confusing, if not dispiriting, to thevoter. The very disaffection or distrust that the Court citesas the justification for limits on direct contributions has nowspread to the entire political discourse. Buckley has notworked.My colleagues in the majority, in my respectful submission, do much disservice to our First Amendment jurisprudence by failing to acknowledge or evaluate the whole operation of the system that we ourselves created in Buckley.Our First Amendment principles surely tell us that an interest thought to be the compelling reason for enacting a law iscast into grave doubt when a worse evil surfaces in the law'sactual operation. And our obligation to examine the operation of the law is all the more urgent when the new evil isitself a distortion of speech. By these measures the law before us cannot pass any serious standard of First Amendment review.Among the facts the Court declines to take into account isthe emergence of cyberspace communication by which political contributions can be reported almost simultaneously withpayment. The public can then judge for itself whether thecandidate or the officeholder has so overstepped that we nolonger trust him or her to make a detached and neutral judgment. This is a far more immediate way to assess the integrity and the performance of our leaders than through thehidden world of soft money and covert speech.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN409Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Kennedy, J., dissentingOfficeholders face a dilemma inherent in the democraticprocess and one that has never been easy to resolve: how toexercise their best judgment while soliciting the continuedsupport and loyalty of constituents whose interests may notalways coincide with that judgment. Edmund Burke cap-tured the tension in his Speeches at Bristol. "Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment;and he betrays instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it toyour opinion." E. Burke, Speeches of the Right Hon. Ed-mund Burke 130 (J. Burke ed. 1867). Whether our officeholders can discharge their duties in a proper way when theyare beholden to certain interests both for reelection and forcampaign support is, I should think, of constant concern notalone to citizens but to conscientious officeholders themselves. There are no easy answers, but the Constitution re-lies on one: open, robust, honest, unfettered speech that thevoters can examine and assess in an ever-changing and morecomplex environment.IITo this point my view may seem to be but a reflection ofwhatJustice Thomas has written, and to a large extent Iagree with his insightful and careful discussion of our precedents. If an ensuing chapter must be written, I may wellcome out as he does, for his reasoning and my own seem topoint to the conclusion that the legislature can do little byway of imposing limits on political speech of this sort. Fornow, however, I would leave open the possibility that Con-gress, or a state legislature, might devise a system in whichthere are some limits on both expenditures and contribu-tions, thus permitting officeholders to concentrate their timeand efforts on official duties rather than on fundraising. Forthe reasons I have sought to express, there are serious constitutional questions to be confronted in enacting any suchscheme, but I would not foreclose it at the outset. I wouldoverrule Buckley and then free Congress or state legisla-tures to attempt some new reform, if, based upon their own528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN410 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissentingconsidered view of the First Amendment, it is possible todo so. Until any reexamination takes place, however, theexisting distortion of speech caused by the halfway housewe created in Buckley ought to be eliminated. The FirstAmendment ought to be allowed to take its own course with-out further obstruction from the artificial system we haveimposed. It suffices here to say that the law in questiondoes not come even close to passing any serious scrutiny.For these reasons, though I am in substantial agreementwith whatJustice Thomas says in his opinion, I havethought it necessary to file a separate dissent.Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,dissenting.In the process of ratifying Missouri's sweeping repressionof political speech, the Court today adopts the analytic fallacies of our flawed decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1(1976)(per curiam). Unfortunately, the Court is not con-tent to merely adhere to erroneous precedent. Under theguise of applying Buckley, the Court proceeds to weakenthe already enfeebled constitutional protection thatBuckleyafforded campaign contributions. In the end, the Court employs a sui generis test to balance away First Amendmentfreedoms.Because the Court errs with each step it takes, I dissent.As I indicated in Colorado Republican Federal CampaignComm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604, 635-644(1996) (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting inpart), our decision in Buckley was in error, and I would over-rule it. I would subject campaign contribution limitationsto strict scrutiny, under which Missouri's contribution limitsare patently unconstitutional.II begin with a proposition that ought to be unassailable:Political speech is the primary object of First Amendment528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN411Cite as: 528 U.

J. 1, 20 (1971); Sunstein, Free SpeechNow, in The Bill of Rights in the Modern State 304-307 (G.Stone, R. Epstein, & C. Sunstein eds. 1992). The Founderssought to protect the rights of individuals to engage in political speech because a self-governing people depends upon thefree exchange of political information. And that free exchange should receive the most protection when it mattersthe most--during campaigns for elective office. "The valueand efficacy of [the right to elect the members of government] depends on the knowledge of the comparative meritsand demerits of the candidates for public trust, and on theequal freedom, consequently, of examining and discussingthese merits and demerits of the candidates respectively."Madison, Report on the Resolutions (1799), in 6 Writings ofJames Madison 397 (G. Hunt ed. 1906).I do not start with these foundational principles becausethe Court openly disagrees with them--it could not, for theyare solidly embedded in our precedents. See, e. g., Eu v.San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S.214, 223 (1989) ("[T]he First Amendment `has its fullest andmost urgent application' to speech uttered during a campaign for political office" (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v.Roy, 401 U.

S.45, 53 (1982) ("The free exchange of ideas provides specialvitality to the process traditionally at the heart of Americanconstitutional democracy--the political campaign"); Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 74-75 (1964) ("[S]peech concerning public affairs is . . . the essence of self-government").Instead, I start with them because the Court today abandonsthem. For nearly half a century, this Court has extendedFirst Amendment protection to a multitude of forms of528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN412 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissenting"speech," such as making false defamatory statements, filinglawsuits, dancing nude, exhibiting drive-in movies with nudity, burning flags, and wearing military uniforms.1 Notsurprisingly, the Courts of Appeals have followed our leadand concluded that the First Amendment protects, for exam-ple, begging, shouting obscenities, erecting tables on a sidewalk, and refusing to wear a necktie.2 In light of the manycases of this sort, today's decision is a most curious anomaly.Whatever the proper status of such activities under the FirstAmendment, I am confident that they are less integral tothe functioning of our Republic than campaign contributions.Yet the majority today, rather than going out of its way toprotect political speech, goes out of its way to avoid protect-ing it. As I explain below, contributions to political campaigns generate essential political speech. And contributioncaps, which place a direct and substantial limit on corespeech, should be met with the utmost skepticism and shouldreceive the strictest scrutiny.IIAt bottom, the majority's refusal to apply strict scrutinyto contribution limits rests upon Buckley's discounting of theFirst Amendment interests at stake. The analytic founda-tion of Buckley, however, was tenuous from the very beginning and has only continued to erode in the interveningyears. What remains of Buckley fails to provide an adequate justification for limiting individual contributions to po-litical candidates.1 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964); NAACP v.

S., at 19,while contribution limits "entai[l] only a marginal restrictionupon the contributor's ability to engage in free communication," id., at 20-21 (quoted ante, at 386). In drawing thisdistinction, the Court in Buckley relied on the premise thatcontributing to a candidate differs qualitatively from directlyspending money. It noted that "[w]hile contributions mayresult in political expression if spent by a candidate or anassociation to present views to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech bysomeone other than the contributor." 424 U. S., at 21. Seealso California Medical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n,453 U. S. 182, 196 (1981) (plurality opinion) ("[T]he `speechby proxy' that [a contributor] seeks to achieve through itscontributions . . . is not the sort of political advocacy thatthis Court in Buckley found entitled to full First Amendment protection").But this was a faulty distinction ab initio because it ignored the reality of how speech of all kinds is disseminated:"Even in the case of a direct expenditure, there is usually some go-between that facilitates the disseminationof the spender's message--for instance, an advertisingagency or a television station. To call a contribution`speech by proxy' thus does little to differentiate it froman expenditure. The only possible difference is thatcontributions involve an extra step in the proxy chain.But again, that is a difference in form, not substance."Colorado Republican, 518 U. S., at 638-639 (Thomas, J.,concurring in judgment and dissenting in part) (citations omitted).528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN414 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissentingAnd, inasmuch as the speech-by-proxy argument was disconnected from the realities of political speech to begin with, itis not surprising that we have firmly rejected it since Buckley. In Federal Election Comm'n v. National ConservativePolitical Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480 (1985), we cast asidethe argument that a contribution does not represent the constitutionally protected speech of a contributor, recognizing"that the contributors obviously like the message they arehearing from these organizations and want to add theirvoices to that message; otherwise they would not part withtheir money." Id., at 495. Though in that case we considered limitations on expenditures made by associations, ourholding that the speech-by-proxy argument fails to diminishcontributors' First Amendment rights is directly applicableto this case. In both cases, donors seek to disseminate information by giving to an organization controlled by others.Through contributing, citizens see to it that their views onpolicy and politics are articulated. In short, "they areaware that however great the confidence they may justly feelin their own good sense, their interests can be more effectually promoted by [another] than by themselves." The Federalist No. 35, p. 214 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).Without the assistance of the speech-by-proxy argument,the remainder of Buckley's rationales founder. Those rationales--that the "quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of hiscontribution," Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 21 (quoted ante, at386), that "the size of the contribution provides a very roughindex of the intensity of the contributor's support for thecandidate," 424 U. S., at 21 (quoted ante, at 386), and that"[a] contribution serves as a general expression of supportfor the candidate and his views, but does not communicatethe underlying basis for the support," 424 U. S., at 21 (quotedante, at 386)--still rest on the proposition that speech byproxy is not fully protected. These contentions simply ig528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN415Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Thomas, J., dissentingnore that a contribution, by amplifying the voice of the candi-date, helps to ensure the dissemination of the messages thatthe contributor wishes to convey. Absent the ability to reston the denigration of contributions as mere "proxy speech,"the arguments fall apart.3The decision of individuals to speak through contributionsrather than through independent expenditures is entirelyreasonable.4 Political campaigns are largely candidate fo3 If one were to accept the speech-by-proxy point and consider a contribution a mere symbolic gesture, Buckley's auxiliary arguments still falter.The claim that a large contribution receives less protection because it onlyexpresses the "intensity of the contributor's support for the candidate,"Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 21 (1976) (per curiam) (quoted ante, at 386),fails under our jurisprudence because we have accorded full First Amendment protection to expressions of intensity. See Cohen v. California, 403U. S. 15, 25-26 (1971) (protecting the use of an obscenity to stress a point).Equally unavailing is the claim that a contribution warrants less protection because it "does not communicate the underlying basis for the support." Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 21 (quoted ante, at 386). We regularlyhold that speech is protected when the underlying basis for a position isnot given. See, e. g., City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 46 (1994) (signreading "For Peace in the Gulf"); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 510-511 (1969) (black armband signifying opposition to Vietnam war). See also Colorado Republican FederalCampaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604, 640 (1996)(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part) ("Even a puremessage of support, unadorned with reasons, is valuable to the democraticprocess"). Cf. Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and BisexualGroup of Boston, Inc., 515 U. S. 557, 569 (1995) (opinion of the Court bySouter, J.) ("[A] narrow, succinctly articulable message is not a conditionof constitutional protection").4 Justice Stevens asserts that "[m]oney is property; it is not speech,"ante, at 398 (concurring opinion), and contends that there is no FirstAmendment right "to hire mercenaries" and "to hire gladiators," ante, at399. These propositions are directly contradicted by many of our precedents. For example, in Meyer v. Grant, 486 U. S. 414 (1988) (opinion ofthe Court by Stevens, J.), this Court confronted a state ban on paymentsto petition circulators. The District Court upheld the law, finding thatthe ban on monetary payments did not restrain expression and that the528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN416 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissentingcused and candidate driven. Citizens recognize that thebest advocate for a candidate (and the policy positions hesupports) tends to be the candidate himself. And candidateorganizations also offer other advantages to citizens wishingto partake in political expression. Campaign organizationsoffer a ready-built, convenient means of communicating fordonors wishing to support and amplify political messages.Furthermore, the leader of the organization--the candidate--has a strong self-interest in efficiently expendingfunds in a manner that maximizes the power of the messagesthe contributor seeks to disseminate. Individual citizensunderstandably realize that they "may add more to politicalwould-be payors remained free to use their money in other ways. Id., at418. We disagreed and held that "[t]he refusal to permit appellees to paypetition circulators restricts political expression" by "limit[ing] the number of voices who will convey appellees' message and the hours they canspeak and, therefore, limits the size of the audience they can reach." Id.,at 422-423. In short, the Court held that the First Amendment protectsthe right to pay others to help get a message out. In other cases, thisCourt extended such protection, holding that the First Amendment prohibits laws that do not ban, but instead only regulate, the terms uponwhich so-called mercenaries and gladiators are retained. See Riley v.National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781 (1988) (holdingthat the First Amendment prohibits state restriction on the amount acharity may pay a professional fundraiser); Secretary of State of Md. v.Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.

(holding that the First Amendment restrains government-compelled exactionsof money); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977) (same). Inthese cases, the Court did not resort to Justice Stevens' assertion thatmoney "is not speech" to dismiss challenges to monetary regulations. Instead, the Court properly examined the impact of the regulations on freeexpression. See also, e. g., Federal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U.

S., at 21 (quoted ante,at 387), ignores the distinct role of candidate organizationsas a means of individual participation in the Nation's civicdialogue.6 The result is simply the suppression of political5 Even if contributions to a candidate were not the most effective meansof speaking--and contribution caps left political speech "significantly unimpaired," ante, at 387--an individual's choice of that mode of expressionwould still be protected. "The First Amendment protects [individuals']right not only to advocate their cause but also to select what they believeto be the most effective means for so doing." Meyer, supra, at 424 (opinion of the Court by Stevens, J.). See also Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliott, Inc., 521 U. S. 457, 488 (1997) (Souter, J., dissenting) (notinga "First Amendment interest in touting [one's] wares as he sees fit").6 Buckley's approach to associational freedom is also unsound. In defense of its decision, the Court in Buckley explained that contributionlimits "leave the contributor free to become a member of any politicalassociation and to assist personally in the association's efforts on behalf ofcandidates." 424 U. S., at 22 (quoted ante, at 387). In essence, the Courtaccepted contribution limits because alternative channels of associationremained open. This justification, however, is peculiar because we haverejected the notion that a law will pass First Amendment muster simplybecause it leaves open other opportunities. Spence v. Washington, 418U. S. 405, 411, n. 4 (1974) (per curiam) (Although a prohibition's effectmay be " `minuscule and trifling,' " a person " `is not to have the exerciseof his liberty of expression in appropriate places abridged on the plea thatit may be exercised in some other place' " (quoting Schneider v.

By depriving donors of their right to speak throughthe candidate, contribution limits relegate donors' points ofview to less effective modes of communication. Addition-ally, limiting contributions curtails individual participation."Even for the affluent, the added costs in money or time oftaking out a newspaper advertisement, handing out leafletson the street, or standing in front of one's house with ahand-held sign may make the difference between participating and not participating in some public debate." City ofLadue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 57 (1994) (opinion of the CourtbyStevens, J.). Buckley completely failed in its attemptto provide a basis for permitting government to secondguess the individual choices of citizens partaking in quint-essentially democratic activities.

S. 781, 790-791 (1988).BThe Court in Buckley denigrated the speech interests notonly of contributors, but also of candidates. Although theCourt purported to be concerned about the plight of candi-dates, it nevertheless proceeded to disregard their interestswithout justification. The Court did not even attempt toclaim that contribution limits do not suppress the speech ofpolitical candidates. See 424 U.

Instead, the Courtabstracted from a candidate's individual right to speak andfocused exclusively on aggregate campaign funding. SeeBuckley v.

Valeo, supra, at21)).The Court's flawed and unsupported aggregate approachignores both the rights and value of individual candidates.The First Amendment "is designed and intended to removegovernmental restraints from the arena of public discussion,putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced largelyinto the hands of each of us, in the hope that use of suchfreedom will ultimately produce a more capable citizenry andmore perfect polity and in the belief that no other approachwould comport with the premise of individual dignity andchoice upon which our political system rests."

The Court in Buckley provided no basis for suppressing the speech of an individual candidate simply because other candidates (or candidates in the aggregate) may succeed in reaching the votingpublic. And any such reasoning would fly in the face of thepremise of our political system--liberty vested in individualhands safeguards the functioning of our democracy. In thecase at hand, the Missouri scheme has a clear and detrimental effect on a candidate such as respondent Fredman, wholacks the advantages of incumbency, name recognition, orsubstantial personal wealth, but who has managed to attractthe support of a relatively small number of dedicated supporters: It forbids his message from reaching the voters.And the silencing of a candidate has consequences for political debate and competition overall. See Arkansas Ed. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U. S. 666, 692, n. 14 (1998)(Stevens, J., dissenting) (noting that the suppression of aminor candidate's speech may directly affect the outcome ofan election); cf. NAACP v. Button, 371 U.

S. 377 (2000)Thomas, J., dissentingthe speech-by-proxy argument or the reality that Buckley'sremaining premises fall when deprived of that support.7After ignoring these shortcomings, the Court proceeds toapply something less--much less--than strict scrutiny. Justhow much less the majority never says. The Court in Buck-ley at least purported to employ a test of " `closest scrutiny.' "424 U. S., at 25 (quoting NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U. S. 449, 461 (1958)). (The Court's words were be-lied by its actions, however, and it never deployed the testin the fashion that the superlative instructs. See ColoradoRepublican, 518 U. S., at 640-641, n. 7 (Thomas, J., concur-ring in judgment and dissenting in part) (noting thatBuck-ley purported to apply strict scrutiny but failed to do so infact).) The Court today abandons even that pretense andreviews contributions under the sui generis "Buckley'sstandard of scrutiny," ante, at 387, which fails to obscure theCourt's ad hoc balancing away of First Amendment rights.Apart from its endorsement of Buckley's rejection of the in-termediate standards of review used to evaluate expressiveconduct and time, place, and manner restrictions, ante, at386, the Court makes no effort to justify its deviation fromthe tests we traditionally employ in free speech cases. SeeDenver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v.FCC, 518 U. S. 727, 774 (1996) (Souter, J., concurring) ("Re-viewing speech regulations under fairly strict categoricalrules keeps the starch in the standards for those moments7 Implicitly, however, the majority downplays its reliance upon thespeech-by-proxy argument. In fact, the majority reprints nearly all ofBuckley's analysis of contributors' speech interests, block quoting almostan entire paragraph from that decision. See ante, at 386-387 (quotingBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 20-21). Tellingly, the only complete sentence from that paragraph that the majority fails to quote is the finalsentence--which happens to be the one directly setting forth the speechby-proxy rationale. See id., at 21 ("While contributions may result inpolitical expression if spent by a candidate or an association to presentviews to the voters, the transformation of contributions into political debate involves speech by someone other than the contributor").528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN422 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissentingwhen the daily politics cries loudest for limiting what maybe said").Unfortunately, the majority does not stop with a revisionofBuckley's labels. After hiding behind Buckley's discredited reasoning and invoking "Buckley's standard of scru-tiny,"ante, at 387, the Court proceeds to significantly extendthe holding in that case. The Court's substantive departurefrom Buckley begins with a revision of our compelling-interest jurisprudence. InBuckley, the Court indicatedthat the only interest that could qualify as "compelling" inthis area was the government's interest in reducing actualand apparent corruption.8 424 U. S., at 25-26. And theCourt repeatedly used the word "corruption" in the narrowquid pro quo sense, meaning "[p]erversion or destruction ofintegrity in the discharge of public duties by bribery or favour." 3 Oxford English Dictionary 974 (2d ed. 1989). Seealso Webster's Third New International Dictionary 512(1976) ("inducement (as of a political official) by means ofimproper considerations (as bribery) to commit a violation ofduty"). When the Court set forth the interest in preventingactual corruption, it spoke about "large contributions . . .given to secure a political quid pro quo from current andpotential office holders." Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 26.The Court used similar language when it set forth the interest in protecting against the appearance of corruption: "Ofalmost equal concern as the danger of actual quid pro quoarrangements is the impact of the appearance of corruptionstemming from public awareness of the opportunities forabuse inherent in a regime of large individual financial con8 The Court in Buckley explicitly rejected two other proffered rationalesfor campaign finance regulation as out of tune with the First Amendment:equalization of the ability of citizens to affect the outcome of elections andcontrolling the costs of campaigns. See 424 U. S., at 48-49 (governmentally imposed equalization measures are "wholly foreign to the FirstAmendment"); id., at 57 (mounting costs of elections "provid[e] no basisfor governmental restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending").528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN423Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Thomas, J., dissentingtributions." Id., at 27. Later, in discussing limits on inde-pendent expenditures, the Court yet again referred to theinterest in protecting against the "dangers of actual or ap-parentquid pro quo arrangements." Id., at 45. See alsoid., at 47 (referring to "the danger that expenditures will begiven as aquid pro quo for improper commitments"); id., at67 (corruption relates to "post-election special favors thatmay be given in return" for contributions). To be sure,after mentioningquid pro quo transactions, the Court wenton to use more general terms such as "opportunities forabuse,"id., at 27, "potential for abuse," id., at 47, "improperinfluence," id., at 27, 29, 45, "attempts . . . to influence," id.,at 28, and "buy[ing] influence,"id., at 45. But this generallanguage acquires concrete meaning only in light of the pre-ceding specific references toquid pro quo arrangements.Almost a decade after Buckley, we reiterated that "cor-ruption" has a narrow meaning with respect to contributionlimitations on individuals:"Corruption is a subversion of the political process.Elected officials are influenced to act contrary to theirobligations of office by the prospect of financial gain tothemselves or infusions of money into their campaigns.The hallmark of corruption is the financialquid pro quo:dollars for political favors." National ConservativePolitical Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 497.In that same opinion, we also used "giving official favors" asa synonym for corruption.Id., at 498.The majority today, by contrast, separates "corruption"from itsquid pro quo roots and gives it a new, far-reaching(and speech-suppressing) definition, something like "[t]heperversion of anything from an original state of purity." 3Oxford English Dictionary, supra, at 974. See also Webster's Third New International Dictionary, supra, at 512 ("adeparture from what is pure or correct"). And the Courtproceeds to define that state of purity, casting aspersions on528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN424 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissenting"politicians too compliant with the wishes of large contribu-tors."Ante, at 389. "But precisely what the `corruption'may consist of we are never told with assurance." NationalConservative Political Action Comm., supra, at 498. Presumably, the majority does not mean that politicians shouldbe free of attachments to constituent groups.9 And the majority does not explicitly rely upon the "harm" that the Courtin Buckley rejected out of hand, namely, that speech couldbe regulated to equalize the voices of citizens.Buckley v.Valeo, supra, at 48-49. Instead, without bothering to offerany elaboration, much less justification, the majority permitsvague and unenumerated harms to suffice as a compellingreason for the government to smother political speech.In refashioning Buckley, the Court then goes on to weakenthe requisite precision in tailoring, while at the same timerepresenting that its fiat "do[es] not relax Buckley's standard." Ante, at 390, n. 4. The fact is that the majority rati9 The Framers, of course, thought such attachments inevitable in a freesociety and that faction would infest the political process. As to controlling faction, James Madison explained, "There are again two methods ofremoving the causes of faction: the one, by destroying the liberty whichis essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every citizen the sameopinions, the same passions, and the same interests." The FederalistNo. 10, p. 78 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Contribution caps are an example ofthe first method, which Madison contemptuously dismissed:"It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy that it wasworse than the disease. Liberty is to faction what air is to fire, an alimentwithout which it instantly expires. But it could not be a less folly toabolish liberty, which is essential to political life, because it nourishes faction than it would be to wish the annihilation of air, which is essential toanimal life, because it imparts to fire its destructive agency." Ibid.The Framers preferred a political system that harnessed such faction forgood, preserving liberty while also ensuring good government. Ratherthan adopting the repressive "cure" for faction that the majority todayendorses, the Framers armed individual citizens with a remedy. "If afaction consists of less than a majority, relief is supplied by the republicanprinciple, which enables the majority to defeat its sinister views by regular vote." Id., at 80.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN425Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Thomas, J., dissentingfies a law with a much broader sweep than that approved inBuckley. In Buckley, the Court upheld contribution limitsof $1,000 on individuals and $5,000 on political committees(in 1976 dollars). 424 U. S., at 28-29, 35-36. Here, by contrast, the Court approves much more restrictive contributionlimitations, ranging from $250 to $1,000 (in 1995 dollars) forboth individuals and political committees. Mo. Rev. Stat.$ 130.032.1 (Supp. 1999). The disparity between Missouri'scaps and those upheld inBuckley is more pronounced whenone takes into account some measure of inflation. SeeShrink Missouri Government PAC v. Adams, 161 F. 3d 519,523, and n. 4 (CA8 1998) (noting that, according to the Consumer Price Index, a dollar today purchases about a third ofwhat it did in 1976 when Buckley was decided). Yet theCourt's opinion gives not a single indication that the twolaws may differ in their tailoring. See ante, at 395 (Missouri's caps are "striking [in their] resemblance to the limitations sustained in Buckley"). The Court fails to pay anyregard to the drastically lower level of the limits here, failsto explain why political committees should be subjected tothe same limits as individuals, and fails to explain why capsthat vary with the size of political districts are tailored tocorruption. I cannot fathom how a $251 contribution couldpose a substantial risk of "secur[ing] a political quid proquo." Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 26. Thus, contributioncaps set at such levels could never be "closely drawn," ante,at 387 (quoting Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 25), to preventingquid pro quo corruption. The majority itself undertakes nosuch defense.The Court also reworks Buckley's aggregate approach tothe free speech rights of candidates. It begins on the sametrack as Buckley, noting that "a showing of one affected individual does not point up a system of suppressed politicaladvocacy that would be unconstitutional under Buckley."Ante, at 396. See also, e. g., ibid. (claiming that candidates" `are still able to amass impressive campaign war chests' "528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN426 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissenting(quoting Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Adams, 5F. Supp. 2d 734, 741 (ED Mo. 1998))). But the Court quicklydeviates from Buckley, persuading itself that Missouri's lim-its do not suppress political speech because, prior to the enactment of contribution limits, "97.62 percent of all contribu-tors to candidates for state auditor made contributions of$2,000 or less." Ante, at 396. But this statistical anecdoteoffers the Court no refuge and the citizenry no comfort. Asan initial matter, the statistic provides no assurance thatMissouri's law has not reduced the resources supporting political speech, since the largest contributors provide a dispro-portionate amount of funds. The majority conspicuously offers no data revealing the percentage of funds provided bylarge contributors. (At least the Court inBuckley relied onthe percentage of funds raised by contributions in excess ofthe limits. 424 U. S., at 21-22, n. 23, 26, n. 27.) But what-ever the data would reveal, the Court's position would remain indefensible. If the majority's assumption is incor-rect--i. e., if Missouri's contribution limits actually dosignificantly reduce campaign speech--then the majority'scalm assurance that political speech remains unaffected col-lapses. If the majority's assumption is correct--i. e., if largecontributions provide very little assistance to a candidateseeking to get out his message (and thus will not be missedwhen capped)--then the majority's reasoning still falters.For if large contributions offer as little help to a candidateas the Court maintains, then the Court fails to explain whya candidate would engage in "corruption" for such a meagerbenefit. The majority's statistical claim directly undercutsits constitutional defense that large contributions pose a substantial risk of corruption.1010 The majority's statistical analysis also overlooks the quantitative datain the record that directly undercut its position that Missouri's law doesnot create "a system of suppressed political advocacy." Ante, at 396.For example, the Court does not bother to note that following the imposition of contribution limits, total combined spending during primary and528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN427Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Thomas, J., dissentingGiven the majority's ill-advised and illiberal aggregaterights approach, it is unsurprising that the Court's pro formahunt for suppressed speech proves futile. See ante, at 395-397. Such will always be the case, for courts have no yardstick by which to judge the proper amount and effectivenessof campaign speech. See, e. g., Smith, Faulty Assumptionsand Undemocratic Consequences of Campaign Finance Re-form, 105 Yale L. J. 1049, 1061 (1996). I, however, wouldnot fret about such matters. The First Amendment vestschoices about the proper amount and effectiveness of politicaladvocacy not in the government--whether in the legislaturesor the courts--but in the people.IVIn light of the importance of political speech to republicangovernment, Missouri's substantial restriction of speech warrants strict scrutiny, which requires that contribution limitsbe narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest.SeeBuckley v. American Constitutional Law Foundation,Inc., 525 U. S. 182, 207 (1999) (Thomas, J., concurring injudgment);Colorado Republican, 518 U. S., at 640-641(Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part).general elections for five statewide offices was cut by over half, fallingfrom $21,599,000 to $9,337,000. See App. 24-28. Significantly, totalprimary election expenditures in each of the races decreased. Ibid. Infact, after contribution limits were imposed, overall spending in statewideprimary elections plummeted 89 percent, falling from $14,249,000 to$1,625,000. Ibid. Most importantly, the majority does not bother tomention that before spending caps were enacted each of the 10 statewideprimary elections was contested, with two to four candidates vying forevery nomination in 1992. After caps were enacted, however, only 1 ofthe 10 primary elections was contested. Overall, the total number of candidates participating in statewide primaries fell from 32 to 11. See ibid.Even if these data do not conclusively show that Missouri's contributionlimits diminish political speech (although it is undeniable that the datastrongly suggest such a result), they at least cast great doubt on the majority's assumption that the picture is rosy.528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN428 NIXON v. SHRINK MISSOURI GOVERNMENT PACThomas, J., dissentingMissouri does assert that its contribution caps are aimedat preventing actual and apparent corruption. Brief forPetitioners 26-28. As we have noted, "preventing corrup-tion or the appearance of corruption are the only legitimateand compelling government interests thus far identified forrestricting campaign finances."National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S., at 496-497. But the State'scontribution limits are not narrowly tailored to that harm.The limits directly suppress the political speech of both contributors and candidates, and only clumsily further the gov-ernmental interests that they allegedly serve. They arecrudely tailored because they are massively overinclusive,prohibiting all donors who wish to contribute in excess ofthe cap from doing so and restricting donations without regard to whether the donors pose any real corruption risk.See Colorado Republican, supra, at 642 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment and dissenting in part) (" `Where FirstAmendment rights are involved, a blunderbuss approachwhich prohibits mostly innocent speech cannot be held ameans narrowly and precisely directed to the governmentalinterest in the small minority of contributions that are notinnocent' " (quoting Brief for Appellants in Buckley v.

And disclosure laws" `deter actual corruption and avoid the appearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and expendituresto the light of publicity.'

In fact, Missouri has enacted strict disclo528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN429Cite as: 528 U. S. 377 (2000)Thomas, J., dissentingsure laws. See Mo. Rev. Stat. $$ 130.041, 130.046, 130.057(Supp. 1999).In the end, contribution limitations find support only inthe proposition that other means will not be as effective atrooting out corruption. But when it comes to a significantinfringement on our fundamental liberties, that some undesirable conduct may not be deterred is an insufficient justification to sweep in vast amounts of protected political speech.Our First Amendment precedents have repeatedly stressedthis point. For example, in Martin v. City of Struthers,supra, we struck down an ordinance prohibiting door-to-doordistribution of handbills. Although we recognized that"burglars frequently pose as canvassers," id., at 144, we alsonoted that door-to-door distribution was "useful [to] members of society engaged in the dissemination of ideas in accordance with the best tradition of free discussion," id., at145. We then struck down the ordinance, observing that the"dangers of distribution can so easily be controlled by traditional legal methods." Id., at 147. Similarly, in Riley v.National Federation of Blind of N. C., Inc., 487 U. S. 781(1988), we struck down a law regulating the fees charged byprofessional fundraisers. In response to the assertion thatcitizens would be defrauded in the absence of such a law,we explained that the State had an antifraud law which "wepresume[d] that law enforcement officers [we]re ready andable to enforce," id., at 795, and that the State could constitutionally require fundraisers to disclose certain financial information, ibid. We concluded by acknowledging the obviousconsequences of the narrow tailoring requirement: "If this isnot the most efficient means of preventing fraud, we reaffirmsimply and emphatically that the First Amendment does notpermit the State to sacrifice speech for efficiency." Ibid.See also, e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308U. S. 147, 162 (1939) ("There are obvious methods of preventing littering. Amongst these is the punishment of thosewho actually throw papers on the streets").528US2 Unit: $U24 [06-27-01 14:28:22] PAGES PGT: OPIN430 NIXON v.

UNITED STATEScertiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuitNo. 98-1667. Argued January 18, 2000--Decided February 22, 2000Two remittances were made to the Internal Revenue Service toward petitioner Baral's income tax liability for the 1988 tax year: a withholdingof $4,104 from Baral's wages throughout 1988 by his employer, and anestimated income tax of $1,100 remitted in January 1989 by Baral. Baral's income tax return for 1988 was due on April 15, 1989. Though hereceived an extension until August 15, he missed this deadline and didnot file the return until June 1, 1993. On the return, he claimed a $1,175overpayment and asked the Service to apply this excess as a credittoward his outstanding tax obligations for the 1989 tax year. The Service denied the requested credit, concluding that the claim exceeded theceiling imposed by 26 U. S. C. $ 6511(b)(2)(A), which states that "theamount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portion of the taxpaid within the period, immediately preceding the filing of the claim,equal to 3 years plus the period of any extension of time for filing thereturn." Since Baral filed his return on June 1, 1993, and received a4-month extension from the initial due date, the relevant look-back period under $ 6511(b)(2)(A) extended from June 1, 1993, back to February1, 1990 (i. e., three years plus four months). According to the Service,Baral had paid no portion of the overpaid tax during that period, andso faced a ceiling of zero on any allowable refund or credit. Baral commenced this suit for refund in the Federal District Court, which grantedthe Service summary judgment. The Court of Appeals affirmed, concluding that both remittances were "paid" on April 15, 1989.Held: Remittances of estimated income tax and withholding tax are "paid"on the due date of a calendar year taxpayer's income tax return. Sections 6513(b)(1) and (2) unequivocally provide that the two remittanceswere "paid" on April 15, 1989, for purposes of $ 6511(b)(2)(A), so thatthey precede the look-back period, which began on February 1, 1990.Subsection (1) resolves when the remittance of Baral's employer's withholding tax was "paid," and subsection (2) determines when his remittance of estimated income tax was "paid." Because neither these remittances nor any others were "paid" within the look-back period, theceiling on Baral's requested $1,175 credit is zero, and the Service wascorrect to deny that credit. Contrary to Baral's claim, the withholdingtax and estimated tax are not taxes in their own right (separate from528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN432 BARAL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe income tax), that are converted into income tax only on the incometax return. Rather, they are methods for collecting income taxes.And the Tax Code directly contradicts Baral's notion that income tax is"paid" under $ 6511(b)(2)(A) only when the income tax is assessed. See$ 6151(a). His position also finds no support in Rosenman v. UnitedStates, 323 U. S. 658, and would work to the detriment of timely taxpayers, who would be denied interest for the time between filing a returnclaiming a refund or credit and the Service's assessment.

S. C.$ 6511(b)(2)(A). We are called upon in this case to decidewhen two types of remittance are "paid" for purposes of thissection: a remittance by a taxpayer of estimated income tax,and a remittance by a taxpayer's employer of withholdingtax. The plain language of a nearby Code section, $ 6513(b),provides the answer: These remittances are "paid" on thedue date of the taxpayer's income tax return.IThe relevant facts are not disputed. Two remittanceswere made to the Internal Revenue Service toward peti528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN433Cite as: 528 U. S. 431 (2000)Opinion of the Courttioner David H. Baral's income tax liability for the 1988 taxyear. The first, a withholding of $4,104 from Baral's wagesthroughout 1988, was a garden-variety collection of incometax by the employer, see $ 3402. The second, an estimatedincome tax of $1,100 remitted in January 1989, was sent byBaral himself out of concern that his employer's withholdingmight be inadequate to meet his tax obligation for the year,see $ 6654. In the ordinary course, Baral's income tax re-turn for 1988 was due to be filed on April 15, 1989. Thoughhe applied for and received an extension of time until August15, Baral missed this deadline; he did not file the return untilnearly four years later, on June 1, 1993. The Service, onJuly 19, 1993, assessed the tax liability reported on this belated return.On the return, Baral claimed that he (and his employer onhis behalf) had remitted $1,175 more with respect to the 1988taxable year than he actually owed. Baral requested thatthe Service apply this excess as a credit toward his outstanding tax obligations for the 1989 taxable year. The Servicedenied the requested credit. It did not dispute that Baralhad timely filed the request under the relevant filing deadline--"within 3 years from the time the return was filed or2 years from the time the tax was paid, whichever of suchperiods expires the later." $ 6511(a); see $ 6511(b)(1). Butthe Service concluded that the claim exceeded the ceilingimposed by $ 6511(b)(2)(A). That provision states that "theamount of the credit or refund shall not exceed the portionof the tax paid within the period, immediately preceding thefiling of the claim, equal to 3 years plus the period of anyextension of time for filing the return." Ibid.; see generallyCommissioner v. Lundy, 516 U. S. 235, 240 (1996) (explainingthat $ 6511 contains two separate timeliness provisions: (1)$ 6511(b)(1)'s filing deadline and (2) $ 6511(b)(2)'s ceilings,which are defined by reference to that provision's "look-backperiod[s]"). Since Baral had filed his return on June 1, 1993,and had earlier received a 4-month extension from the initial528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN434 BARAL v.

According to the Service,Baral had paid no portion of the overpaid tax during thatperiod, and so faced a ceiling of zero on any allowable refundor credit.Baral then commenced the instant suit for refund in Fed-eral District Court. That court sustained the Service's position and granted summary judgment in its favor. The Courtof Appeals affirmed. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-1, judgt.order reported at 172 F. 3d 918 (CADC 1999). The Court ofAppeals looked to $ 6513(b)(1), which states that amounts oftax withheld from wages "shall . . . be deemed to have beenpaid by [the taxpayer] on the 15th day of the fourth monthfollowing the close of his taxable year," and to $ 6513(b)(2),which makes similar provision for amounts submitted as estimated income tax, and concluded that, under these subsec-tions, both of the remittances at issue were "paid" on April15, 1989.

United States, 720 F. 2d 1096, 1096-1097 (CA9 1983) (withholding from wages). In view of apparent tension betweenthis approach and a decision of the Court of Appeals for theFifth Circuit, Ford v. United States, 618 F. 2d 357, 360-361,and n. 4 (1980) (suggesting that a remittance respecting anysort of tax is "paid" under $ 6511 only when the Service as-sesses the tax liability), we granted certiorari, 527 U.

The Government submits that $$ 6513(b)(1) and (2)unequivocally provide that the two remittances at issue were"paid" on April 15, 1989, for purposes of $ 6511(b)(2)(A), sothat they precede the look-back period, which, as noted, com-menced on February 1, 1990. Baral, on the other hand,urges that a tax cannot be "paid" within the meaning of528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN435Cite as: 528 U. S. 431 (2000)Opinion of the Court$ 6511(b)(2)(A) until the tax liability is assessed (i. e., thevalue of the liability is definitively fixed). According toBaral, the requisite assessment might be made either whenthe taxpayer files his return (here June 1, 1993) or when theService, under $ 6201, formally assesses the liability (hereJuly 19, 1993), though he seems to prefer the latter date.See Brief for Petitioner 9 ("Payment of the income tax . . .occurred at the earliest on June 1, 1993, when the amount ofthat tax first became known, and more precisely on July 19,1993, when the income tax was assessed").We agree with the Government that $$ 6513(b)(1) and (2)settle the matter. We set out these provisions in full:"(b) Prepaid income tax"For purposes of section 6511 or 6512--"(1) Any tax actually deducted and withheld at thesource during any calendar year under chapter 24 shall,in respect of the recipient of the income, be deemed tohave been paid by him on the 15th day of the fourthmonth following the close of his taxable year with respect to which such tax is allowable as a credit undersection 31."(2) Any amount paid as estimated income tax for anytaxable year shall be deemed to have been paid on thelast day prescribed for filing the return under section6012 for such taxable year (determined without regardto any extension of time for filing such return)."Subsection (1) resolves when the remittance of withholdingtax by Baral's employer was "paid": Since Baral is a calendaryear taxpayer, the $4,104 withheld from his wages duringthe 1988 calendar year was "paid" on April 15, 1989. Sub-section (2) determines when Baral's remittance of estimatedincome tax was "paid": Since the referenced $ 6012 togetherwith $ 6072(a) requires that a calendar year taxpayer likeBaral file his income tax return on the April 15th followingthe close of the calendar year, the $1,100 remitted as an esti-mated income tax in respect of Baral's 1988 tax liability was528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN436 BARAL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtlikewise "paid" on April 15, 1989. And both of these statu-torily defined payment dates apply "[f]or purposes of section6511," the provision directly at issue in this case. Thismeans that, under $ 6511(b)(2)(A), both remittances at issue(the withholding and the estimated income tax) fall before,and hence outside, the look-back period, which commencedon February 1, 1990. Because neither these remittances norany others were "paid" within the look-back period (Febru-ary 1, 1990, to June 1, 1993), the ceiling on Baral's requestedcredit of $1,175 is zero, and the Service was correct to denythe requested credit.Baral disputes this reading of $ 6513(b). He claims that$$ 6513(b)(1) and (2) establish a "deemed paid" date for payment of estimated tax and withholding tax, but in no senseprescribe when the income tax is "paid," which is the crucialinquiry under $ 6511(b)(2)(A). According to Baral, withholding tax and estimated tax are taxes in their own right (separate from the income tax), and are converted into income taxonly on the income tax return. (On this view, payment ofthe income tax occurred no earlier than June 1, 1993, whenBaral filed the return.) This reading is evident, he says,from the significance that the Treasury Regulations place onthe filing of the return, see 26 CFR $ 301.6315-1 (1999) ("Theaggregate amount of the payments of estimated tax shouldbe entered upon the income tax return for such taxable yearas payments to be applied against the tax shown on suchreturn"); $ 301.6402-3(a)(1) (providing that "in the case of anoverpayment of income taxes, a claim for credit or refund ofsuch overpayment shall be made on the appropriate incometax return"), and from the fact that the Code's provisionsregarding withholding and estimated tax are found in different subtitles (C and F, respectively) from the provisions governing income tax (A).We disagree. Withholding and estimated tax remittancesare not taxes in their own right, but methods for collectingthe income tax. Thus, $ 31(a)(1) of the Code provides that528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN437Cite as: 528 U. S. 431 (2000)Opinion of the Courtamounts withheld from wages "shall be allowed to the recipi-ent of the income as a credit against the [income] tax," and$ 6315 states that "[p]ayment of the estimated income tax,or any installment thereof, shall be considered payment onaccount of the income taxes imposed by subtitle A for thetaxable year." Similarly, one of the regulations cited byBaral explains that a remittance of estimated income tax"shall be considered payment on account of the income taxfor the taxable year for which the estimate is made." 26CFR $ 301.6315-1 (1999) (emphasis added). Baral's readingfails, moreover, to give any meaning to 26 U. S. C. $ 6513.That section exists "[f]or purposes of section 6511," and$ 6511 concerns credits and refunds, which result only whenthe aggregate of remittances (such as withholding tax andestimated income tax) exceed the tax liability, see $ 6401.Thus, the concepts of credit or refund have no meaning asapplied to Baral's notion of withholding taxes and estimatedtaxes as freestanding taxes. Not surprisingly, the captionto $ 6513(b) describes withholding and estimated income taxremittances as "[p]repaid income tax."Taking a more metaphysical tack, Baral contends thatincome tax is "paid" under $ 6511(b)(2)(A) only when theincome tax is assessed--here, June 1 or July 19, 1993, seesupra, at 434-435--because the concept of payment makessense only when the liability is "defined, known, and fixed byassessment," Brief for Petitioner 9. But the Code directlycontradicts the notion that payment may not occur beforeassessment. See $ 6151(a) ("[T]he person required to make[a return of tax] shall, without assessment or notice anddemand from the Secretary, pay such tax . . . at the timeand place fixed for filing the return" (emphasis added));$ 6213(b)(4) ("Any amount paid as a tax or in respect of a taxmay be assessed upon the receipt of such payment" (emphasis added)). Nor does Baral's argument find support in ourdecision in Rosenman v. United States, 323 U. S. 658 (1945),where we applied $ 6511's predecessor to a remittance of esti528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN438 BARAL v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtmated estate tax. To be sure, a part of our opinion seemsto endorse petitioner's view that payment only occurs atassessment:"It is [the] erroneous assessment that gave rise to aclaim for refund. Not until then was there such a claimas could start the time running for presenting the claim.In any responsible sense payment was then made by theapplication of the balance credited to the petitioners inthe suspense account . . . ."Id., at 661.But the remittance in Rosenman, unlike the ones here, wasnot governed by a "deemed paid" provision akin to $ 6513,and we therefore had no occasion to consider the implicationsof such a provision for determining when a tax is "paid"under the predecessor to $ 6511. See ibid. (noting that "noextraneous relevant aids to construction have been called toour attention"). Moreover, if the quoted passage had repre-sented our holding, we would have broadly rejected the Government's argument that payment occurred when the remit-tance of estimated estate tax was made, instead of rejectingthe argument, as we did, only because it was not in accordwith the "tenor" of the "business transaction," id., at 663.1We observe, finally, that Baral's position--to the extent hesubmits that payment occurs only at the Service's assessment--would work to the detriment of taxpayers who timelyfile their returns and claim a refund or credit as compensa1 Central to our analysis in this regard was a concern that the Serviceshould not be able to treat the same remittance as a payment for statuteof limitations purposes--disadvantaging the taxpayer by decreasing thetime in which a refund claim could be filed--and as a deposit for purposesof accrual of interest on overpayments--disadvantaging the taxpayer bystarting the accrual of interest only at assessment. Rosenman, 323 U. S.,at 662-663. Indeed, we suggested that an amendment to the Code disapproving of the Service's treatment of remittances as deposits for interestpurposes might change the analysis. Id., at 663 (citing Current Tax Payment Act of 1943, $ 4(d), 57 Stat. 140) (presently codified at 26 U. S. C.$ 6401(c)).528US2 Unit: $U25 [06-15-01 18:08:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN439Cite as: 528 U. S. 431 (2000)Opinion of the Courttion for an overpayment. The Service will not always as-sess the taxpayer's liability immediately upon receiving thereturn; the Service generally has three years in which to doso, see 26 U. S. C. $ 6501(a) (1994 ed., Supp. III). The Codedoes allow for payment of interest to the taxpayer on over-payments once the return has been filed and the tax paid, 26U. S. C. $ 6611 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), but under Baral'sview no interest could accrue during the time between thefiling of the return and the Service's assessment. Fortu-nately for the timely taxpayer, the Code definitively rejectsBaral's position in this setting. Section 6611(d) of 26 U. S. C.explains that the date of payment is determined accordingto the provisions of $ 6513, which, as noted, supra, at 435-436, plainly set a deemed date of payment for remittances ofwithholding and estimated income tax on the April 15 follow-ing the relevant taxable year.2* * *For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment below.
