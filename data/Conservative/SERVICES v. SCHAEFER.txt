SCHAEFEROpinion of the Courtdecision of the Secretary of Health and Human Servicesdenying Social Security benefits. One possible outcome ofsuch a suit is that the district court, pursuant to sentencefour of $ 405(g), will enter "a judgment . . . reversing thedecision of the Secretary . . . [and] remanding the cause fora rehearing." The issue here is whether the 30-day periodfor filing an application for EAJA fees begins immediatelyupon expiration of the time for appeal of such a "sentencefour remand order," or sometime after the administrativeproceedings on remand are complete.IIn 1986, respondent Richard Schaefer filed an applicationfor disability benefits under Title II of the Social SecurityAct, 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 401 et seq. (1988ed. and Supp. III). He was denied benefits at the administrative level, and sought judicial review by filing suit againstthe Secretary as authorized by $ 405(g). Schaefer and theSecretary filed cross-motions for summary judgment. OnApril 4, 1989, the District Court held that the Secretary hadcommitted three errors in ruling on Schaefer's case and en-tered an order stating that "the Secretary's decision denyingdisability insurance benefits to [Schaefer] is reversed, thatthe parties' cross-motions for summary judgment are denied,and that the case is remanded to the Secretary for furtherconsideration in light of this Order." App. to Pet. for Cert.27a.In accordance with this order, Schaefer's application forbenefits was reconsidered at the administrative level, andwas granted. On July 18, 1990, Schaefer returned to theDistrict Court and filed an application for attorney's feespursuant to EAJA. In response, the Secretary noted thatSchaefer was required to file any application for EAJA fees"within thirty days of final judgment in the action," 28U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(B), and argued that the relevant "finaljudgment" in the case was the administrative decision on509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT295Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)Opinion of the Courtremand, which had become final on April 2, 1990. The Dis-trict Court stayed action on Schaefer's EAJA applicationpending this Court's imminent ruling in Melkonyan v. Sulli-van, 501 U. S. 89 (1991).Melkonyan was announced shortly thereafter, holdingthat a final administrative decision could not constitute a"final judgment" for purposes of $ 2412(d)(1)(B). Id., at 96.In light ofMelkonyan, the Secretary changed positions toargue that EAJA's 30-day clock began running when theDistrict Court's April 4, 1989 order (not the administrativeruling on remand) became final, which would have occurredat the end of the 60 days for appeal provided under FederalRule of Appellate Procedure 4(a). Thus, the Secretary concluded, Schaefer's time to file his EAJA application expiredon July 3, 1989, over a year before the application was filed.The District Court, however, found Schaefer's EAJA appli-cation timely under the controlling Circuit precedent ofWel-ter v. Sullivan, 941 F. 2d 674 (CA8 1991), which held that asentence-four remand order is not a final judgment where"the district court retain[s] jurisdiction . . . and plan[s] toenter dispositive sentence four judgmen[t]" after the admin-istrative proceedings on remand are complete.Id., at 675.The District Court went on to rule that Schaefer was entitled to $1,372.50 in attorney's fees.The Secretary fared no better on appeal. The Eighth Circuit declined the Secretary's suggestion for en banc reconsid-eration ofWelter, and affirmed the District Court in an un-published per curiam opinion. Judgt. order reported at 960F. 2d 1053 (1992). The Secretary filed a petition for certio-rari, urging us to reverse the Court of Appeals summarily.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 997 (1992), and set the casefor oral argument.IIThe first sentence of 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(1)(B) provides:"A party seeking an award of fees and other expensesshall,within thirty days of final judgment in the action,509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT296 SHALALA v. SCHAEFEROpinion of the Courtsubmit to the court an application for fees and other ex-penses which shows that the party is a prevailing partyand is eligible to receive an award under this subsection,and the amount sought, including an itemized statementfrom any attorney or expert witness representing or ap-pearing in behalf of the party stating the actual timeexpended and the rate at which fees and other expenseswere computed." (Emphasis added.)In Melkonyan v. Sullivan, we held that the term "final judg-ment" in the highlighted phrase above "refers to judgmentsentered by a court of law, and does not encompass decisionsrendered by an administrative agency." See 501 U. S., at96. Thus, the only order in this case that could have re-sulted in the starting of EAJA's 30-day clock was the District Court's April 4, 1989, order, which reversed the Secre-tary's decision denying disability benefits and remanded thecase to the Secretary for further proceedings.In cases reviewing final agency decisions on Social Security benefits, the exclusive methods by which district courtsmay remand to the Secretary are set forth in sentence fourand sentence six of $ 405(g), which are set forth in the mar-gin.1 See Melkonyan, supra, at 99-100. Schaefer correctly1 Sentences four and six of 42 U. S. C. $ 405(g) provide:"[4] The [district] court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings andtranscript of the record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or reversingthe decision of the Secretary, with or without remanding the cause for arehearing. . . . [6] The court may, on motion of the Secretary made forgood cause shown before he files his answer, remand the case to the Secretary for further action by the Secretary, and it may at any time orderadditional evidence to be taken before the Secretary, but only upon ashowing that there is new evidence which is material and that there isgood cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the record ina prior proceeding; and the Secretary shall, after the case is remanded,and after hearing such additional evidence if so ordered, modify or affirmhis findings of fact or his decision, or both, and shall file with the courtany such additional and modified findings of fact and decision, and a tran509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT297Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)Opinion of the Courtconcedes that the District Court's remand order in this casewas entered pursuant to sentence four.2 He argues, however, that a district court proceeding under that provisionneed not enter a judgment at the time of remand, but maypostpone it and retain jurisdiction pending completion of theadministrative proceedings. That argument, however, is inconsistent with the plain language of sentence four, whichauthorizes a district court to enter a judgment "with or without" a remand order, not a remand order "with or without"a judgment. SeeSullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U. S. 617, 629(1990). Immediate entry of judgment (as opposed to entryof judgment after postremand agency proceedings have beencompleted and their results filed with the court) is in fact theprincipal feature that distinguishes a sentence-four remandfrom a sentence-six remand. SeeMelkonyan, supra, at101-102.Nor is it possible to argue that the judgment authorizedby sentence four, if it includes a remand, does not become a"final judgment"--as required by $ 2412(d)--upon expirationof the time for appeal. If that were true, there would neverbe any final judgment in cases reversed and remanded forfurther agency proceedings (including those which sufferthat fate after the Secretary has filed the results of asentence-six remand). Sentence eight of $ 405(g) states that"[t]he judgment of the court"--which must be a reference toa sentence-four judgment, since that is theonly judgmentauthorized by $ 405(g)--"shall be final except that it shall bescript of the additional record and testimony upon which his action inmodifying or affirming was based."2 Sentence-six remands may be ordered in only two situations: wherethe Secretary requests a remand before answering the complaint, orwhere new, material evidence is adduced that was for good cause not presented before the agency. See $ 405(g) (sentence six); Melkonyan v. Sullivan, 501 U. S. 89, 99-100, and n. 2 (1991); cf. Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496U. S. 617, 626 (1990). The District Court's April 4, 1989, remand orderclearly does not fit within either situation.509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT298 SHALALA v. SCHAEFEROpinion of the Courtsubject to review in the same manner as a judgment in othercivil actions." Thus, when the time for seeking appellatereview has run, the sentence-four judgment fits squarelywithin the term "final judgment" as used in $ 2412(d), whichis defined to mean "a judgment that is final and not appealable." 28 U. S. C. $ 2412(d)(2)(G). We described the lawwith complete accuracy inMelkonyan, when we said:"In sentence four cases, the filing period begins afterthe final judgment (`affirming, modifying, or reversing')is entered by the court and the appeal period has run,so that the judgment is no longer appealable. . . . Insentence six cases, the filing period does not begin untilafter the postremand proceedings are completed, theSecretary returns to court, the court enters a final judg-ment, and the appeal period runs." 501 U. S., at 102.Schaefer raises two arguments that merit further discus-sion. The first is based on our decision inSullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877, 892 (1989), which held that fees incurredduring administrative proceedings held pursuant to a districtcourt's remand order could be recovered under EAJA. Inorder "to effectuateHudson," Schaefer contends, a districtcourt entering a sentence-four remand order may properlyhold its judgment in abeyance (and thereby delay the startof EAJA's 30-day clock) until postremand administrativeproceedings are complete; otherwise, as far as fees incurredduring the yet-to-be-held administrative proceedings areconcerned, the claimant would be unable to comply with therequirement of $ 2412(d)(1)(B) that the fee application include"the amount sought" and "an itemized statement . . . [of] theactual time expended" by attorneys and experts. In response, the Secretary argues that Hudson applies only tocases remanded pursuant to sentence six of $ 405(g), wherethere is no final judgment and the clock does not begin torun. The difficulty with that, Schaefer contends, is thatHudson itself clearly involved a sentence-four remand.509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT299Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)Opinion of the CourtOn the last point, Schaefer is right. Given the facts re-cited by the Court in Hudson, the remand order there couldhave been authorized only under sentence four. See 490U. S., at 880-881; cf. n. 2, supra. However, the facts in Hudson also show that the District Court had not terminated thecase, but had retained jurisdiction during the remand. Andthat was a central element in our decision, as the penultimatesentence of the opinion shows:"We conclude that where a court orders a remand tothe Secretary in a benefits litigationand retains contin-uing jurisdiction over the case pending a decision fromthe Secretary which will determine the claimant's enti-tlement to benefits, the proceedings on remand are anintegral part of the `civil action' for judicial review, andthus attorney's fees for representation on remand areavailable subject to the other limitations in the EAJA."490 U. S., at 892 (emphasis added).We have since made clear, in Finkelstein, that that retentionof jurisdiction, that failure to terminate the case, was error:Under $ 405(g), "each final decision of the Secretary [is] re-viewable by aseparate piece of litigation," and a sentence-four remand order "terminate[s] the civil action" seekingjudicial review of the Secretary's final decision. 496 U. S.,at 624-625 (emphases added). What we adjudicated in Hudson, in other words, was a hybrid: a sentence-four remandthat the District Court had improperly (but without objection) treated like a sentence-six remand.3 We specifically3 The Secretary not only failed to object to the District Court's retentionof jurisdiction, but affirmatively endorsed the practice as a means of accommodating the lower court cases holding that a $ 405(g) plaintiff doesnot become a prevailing party until Social Security benefits are actuallyawarded. Reply Brief for Petitioner in Sullivan v. Hudson, O. T. 1988,No. 616, pp. 12-13. Those precedents were highly favorable to the Government, of course, because they relieved the Secretary of liability forEAJA fees in all cases where Social Security benefits were ultimatelydenied. But they were also at war with the view--expressed later in the509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:53 PAGES OPINPGT300 SHALALA v. SCHAEFEROpinion of the Courtnoted in Melkonyan that Hudson was limited to a "narrowclass of qualifying administrative proceedings" where "thedistrict court retains jurisdiction of the civil action" pendingthe completion of the administrative proceedings. 501 U. S.,at 97. We therefore do not consider the holding of Hudsonbinding as to sentence-four remands that are ordered (asthey should be) without retention of jurisdiction, or that areordered with retention of jurisdiction that is challenged.4Schaefer's second argument is that a sentence-four remandorder cannot be considered a "final judgment" for purposesof $ 2412(d)(1)(B) because that provision requires the partyseeking fees to submit an application "show[ing] that [he] isa prevailing party." That showing, Schaefer contends, can-not be made until the proceedings on remand are complete,since a Social Security claimant does not "prevail" until he isawarded Social Security benefits. The premise of this argument is wrong. No holding of this Court has ever deniedprevailing-party status (under $ 2412(d)(1)(B)) to a plaintiffwho won a remand order pursuant to sentence four of$ 405(g). Dicta in Hudson stated that "a Social SecuritySecretary's Hudson reply brief--that a sentence-four remand order is a"final judgment" in the civil action. Id., at 16. Essentially, the Secretaryin Hudson wanted it both ways: He wanted us to regard retention ofjurisdiction as proper for purposes of determining prevailing-party status,but as improper for purposes of awarding fees on remand.4 Justice Stevens says that our holding "overrul[es]" Sullivan v. Hudson, 490 U. S. 877 (1989). Post, at 304, 311. We do not think that is anaccurate characterization. Hudson remains good law as applied to remands ordered pursuant to sentence six. And since the distinction between sentence-four and sentence-six remands was neither properly presented nor considered in Hudson, see supra, at 299, and n. 3, and infrathis page and 301, limiting Hudson to sentence-six cases does not "overrule" the decision even in part. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619,631 (1993). We agree with Justice Stevens that until today there hasbeen some contradiction in our case law on this subject. In resolving it,however, we have not simply chosen Melkonyan's dicta over Hudson, buthave grounded our decision in the text and structure of the relevant statutes, particularly $ 405.509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:54 PAGES OPINPGT301Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)Opinion of the Courtclaimant would not, as a general matter, be a prevailingparty within the meaning of the EAJA merely because acourt had remanded the action to the agency for further pro-ceedings." 490 U. S., at 887. But that statement (like theholding of the case) simply failed to recognize the distinctionbetween a sentence-four remand, which terminates the litigation with victory for the plaintiff, and a sentence-six re-mand, which does not. The sharp distinction between thetwo types of remand had not been made in the lower courtopinions inHudson, see Hudson v. Secretary of Health andHuman Services, 839 F. 2d 1453 (CA11 1988); App. to Pet. forCert. in Sullivan v. Hudson, O. T. 1988, No. 616, pp. 17a-20a(setting forth unpublished District Court opinion), was notincluded in the question presented for decision,5 and wasmentioned for the first time in the closing pages of the Secretary's reply brief, see Reply Brief for Petitioner in Sullivanv.Hudson, O. T. 1988, No. 616, pp. 14-17. It is only decisionsafter Hudson--specifically Finkelstein and Melkonyan--which establish that the sentence-four, sentence-six distinc-tion is crucial to the structure of judicial review establishedunder $ 405(g). See Finkelstein, 496 U. S., at 626; Melkon-yan, 501 U. S., at 97-98.Hudson's dicta that remand does not generally conferprevailing-party status relied on three cases, none of whichsupports that proposition as applied to sentence-four re-mands.Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U. S. 754, 758-759(1980), rejected an assertion of prevailing-party status, notby virtue of having secured a remand, but by virtue of hav-ing obtained a favorable procedural ruling (the reversal onappeal of a directed verdict) during the course of the judicialproceedings.Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U. S. 755 (1987), held5 As formulated in the Secretary's petition, the question on which theCourt granted certiorari in Hudson was: "Whether Social Security administrative proceedings conducted after a remand from the courts are `adversary adjudications' for which attorney fees are available under the[EAJA]." Pet. for Cert. in Sullivan v. Hudson, O. T. 1988, No. 616, p. I.509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:54 PAGES OPINPGT302 SHALALA v. SCHAEFEROpinion of the Courtthat a plaintiff does not become a prevailing party merely byobtaining "a favorable judicial statement of law in the courseof litigation that results in judgment against the plaintiff,"id., at 763 (emphasis added). (A sentence-four remand, ofcourse, is a judgment for the plaintiff.) And the third casecited inHudson, Texas State Teachers Assn. v. GarlandIndependent School Dist., 489 U. S. 782 (1989), affirmativelysupports the proposition that a party who wins a sentence-four remand order is a prevailing party. Garland held thatstatus to have been obtained "[i]f the plaintiff has succeededon any significant issue in litigation which achieve[d] some ofthe benefit . . . sought in bringing suit." Id., at 791-792 (ci-tation and internal quotation marks omitted). Obtaining asentence-four judgment reversing the Secretary's denial ofbenefits certainly meets this description. See alsoFarrarv. Hobby, 506 U. S. 103 (1992).IIIFinally, Schaefer argues that, even if the District Courtshould have entered judgment in connection with its April4, 1989 order remanding the case to the Secretary, the factremains that it did not. And since no judgment was entered, he contends, the 30-day time period for filing an appli-cation for EAJA fees cannot have run. We agree.An EAJA application may be filed until 30 days after ajudgment becomes "not appealable"--i. e., 30 days after thetime for appeal has ended. See $$ 2412(d)(1)(B), (d)(2)(G);see also Melkonyan, 501 U. S., at 102. Rule 4(a) of the Fed-eral Rules of Appellate Procedure establishes that, in a civilcase to which a federal officer is a party, the time for appealdoes not end until 60 days after "entry of judgment," andthat a judgment is considered entered for purposes of theRule only if it has been "entered in compliance with Rul[e]58 . . . of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure." Fed. RulesApp. Proc. 4(a)(1), (7). Rule 58, in turn, requires a districtcourt to set forth every judgment "on a separate document"and provides that "[a] judgment is effective only when so set509us2106K 05-04-97 17:33:54 PAGES OPINPGT303Cite as: 509 U. S. 292 (1993)Stevens, J., concurring in judgmentforth." See United States v. Indrelunas, 411 U. S. 216, 220(1973) (per curiam).Since the District Court's April 4 remand order was a finaljudgment, see supra, at 299, a "separate document" of judgment should have been entered. It is clear from the recordthat this was not done. The Secretary does not dispute that,but argues that a formal "separate document" of judgmentis not needed for an order of a district court tobecome ap-pealable. That is quite true, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1291; BankersTrust Co. v. Mallis, 435 U. S. 381 (1978) (per curiam); Fink-elstein, supra, at 628, n. 7, but also quite irrelevant. EAJA's30-day time limit runs from the end of the period for appeal,not thebeginning. Absent a formal judgment, the DistrictCourt's April 4 order remained "appealable" at the time thatSchaefer filed his application for EAJA fees, and thus theapplication was timely under $ 2412(d)(1).6* * *For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is
