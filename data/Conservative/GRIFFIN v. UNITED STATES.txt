This case presents the question whether, in a federalprosecution, a general guilty verdict on a multiple-objectconspiracy charge must be set aside if the evidence is inade-quate to support conviction as to one of the objects.IA federal grand jury returned a 23-count indictmentagainst petitioner Diane Griffin and others. Count 20, theonly count in which Griffin was named, charged her, AlexBeverly, and Betty McNulty with conspiring to defraud anagency of the Federal Government in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 371, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:"If two or more persons conspire either to commit anyoffense against the United States, or to defraud theUnited States, or any agency thereof in any manner orfor any purpose, and one or more of such persons do anyact to effect the object of the conspiracy, each shall be[guilty of a crime]."The unlawful conspiracy was alleged to have had two objects:(1) impairing the efforts of the Internal Revenue Service(IRS) to ascertain income taxes; and (2) impairing the effortsof the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to ascertainforfeitable assets.The evidence introduced at trial implicated Beverly andMcNulty in both conspiratorial objects, and petitioner in the502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT48 GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIRS object. However, because testimony anticipated by theGovernment from one of its witnesses did not materialize,the evidence did not connect petitioner to the DEA object.On that basis, petitioner moved for a severance, but her motion was denied. At the close of trial, she proposed instructions to the effect that she could be convicted only if the juryfound she was aware of the IRS object of the conspiracy.She also proposed special interrogatories asking the jury toidentify the object or objects of the conspiracy of which shehad knowledge. Both requests were denied. The court instructed the jury in a manner that would permit it to returna guilty verdict against petitioner on Count 20 if it found herto have participated in either one of the two objects of theconspiracy. The jury returned a general verdict of guilty onCount 20 against Beverly, McNulty, and petitioner.The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld petitioner's conviction, rejecting the argument that the generalverdict could not stand because it left in doubt whether thejury had convicted her of conspiring to defraud the IRS, forwhich there was sufficient proof, or of conspiring to defraudthe DEA, for which (as the Government concedes) there wasnot. United States v. Beverly, 913 F. 2d 337 (1990). Wegranted certiorari, 498 U. S. 1082 (1991).The question presented for review, as set forth in the petition, is simply whether a general verdict of guilty under circumstances such as existed here "is reversible." The bodyof the petition, however, sets forth the Due Process Clauseof the Fifth Amendment and the jury trial provision of theSixth Amendment as bases for the relief requested. Onlythe former has been discussed (and that briefly) in the written and oral argument before us. For that reason, and alsobecause the alleged defect here is not that a jury determination was denied but rather that a jury determination waspermitted, we find it unnecessary to say anything moreabout the Sixth Amendment. We address below the Due502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT49Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)Opinion of the CourtProcess Clause and also the various case precedents reliedupon by petitioner.IIThe rule of criminal procedure applied by the SeventhCircuit here is not an innovation. It was settled law in England before the Declaration of Independence, and in thiscountry long afterwards, that a general jury verdict wasvalid so long as it was legally supportable on one of the sub-mitted grounds--even though that gave no assurance that avalid ground, rather than an invalid one, was actually thebasis for the jury's action. As Wharton wrote in 1889:"For years it was the prevailing practice in Englandand this country, where there was a general verdict ofguilty on an indictment containing several counts, somebad and some good, to pass judgment on the counts thatwere good, on the presumption that it was to them thatthe verdict of the jury attached, and upon the withdrawal by the prosecution of the bad counts. . . . [I]n theUnited States, with but few exceptions, the courts haveunited in sustaining general judgments on an indictmentin which there are several counts stating cognate offences, irrespective of the question whether one ofthese counts is bad." F. Wharton, Criminal Pleadingand Practice $ 771, pp. 533-536 (9th ed. 1889) (footnotesomitted).And as this Court has observed:"In criminal cases, the general rule, as stated by LordMansfield before the Declaration of Independence, is`that if there is any one count to support the verdict, itshall stand good, notwithstanding all the rest are bad.'And it is settled law in this court, and in this countrygenerally, that in any criminal case a general verdict andjudgment on an indictment or information containingseveral counts cannot be reversed on error, if any one ofthe counts is good and warrants the judgment, because,502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT50 GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtin the absence of anything in the record to show thecontrary, the presumption of law is that the courtawarded sentence on the good count only." Claassen v.United States, 142 U. S. 140, 146 (1891) (quoting Peakev. Oldham, 1 Cowper 275, 276, 98 Eng. Rep. 1083 (K. B.1775)) (other citations omitted).See also Snyder v. United States, 112 U. S. 216, 217 (1884);Clifton v. United States, 4 How. 242, 250 (1846); 1 J. Bishop,Criminal Procedure $ 1015, p. 631 (2d ed. 1872).This common-law rule applied in a variety of contexts. Itvalidated general verdicts returned on multicount indictments where some of the counts were legally defective("bad"), see, e. g., Clifton, supra, at 250; State v. Shelledy, 8Iowa 477, 511 (1859); State v. Burke, 38 Me. 574, 575-576(1854); Commonwealth v. Holmes, 17 Mass. 336, 337 (1821),and general verdicts returned on multicount indictmentswhere some of the counts were unsupported by the evidence,see, e. g., State v. Long, 52 N. C. 24, 26 (1859); State v. Bugbee,22 Vt. 32, 35 (1849); 1 Bishop, supra, $ 1014, p. 630. It alsoapplied to the analogous situation at issue here: a generaljury verdict under a single count charging the commissionof an offense by two or more means. For example, in reviewing a count charging defendants with composing, printing, and publishing a libel, Lord Ellenborough stated:"It is enough to prove publication. If an indictmentcharges that the defendant did and caused to be done aparticular act, it is enough to prove either. The distinction runs through the whole criminal law, and it is invariably enough to prove so much of the indictment asshows that the defendant has committed a substantivecrime therein specified." King v. Hunt, 2 Camp. 583,584-585, 170 Eng. Rep. 1260 (N. P. 1811).502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT51Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)Opinion of the CourtThe latter application of the rule made it a regular practicefor prosecutors to charge conjunctively, in one count, the various means of committing a statutory offense, in order toavoid the pitfalls of duplicitous pleading."A statute often makes punishable the doing of onethingor another, . . . sometimes thus specifying a considerable number of things. Then, by proper and ordinaryconstruction, a person who in one transaction does all,violates the statute but once, and incurs only one pen-alty. Yet he violates it equally by doing one of thethings. Therefore the indictment on such a statute mayallege, in a single count, that the defendant did as manyof the forbidden things as the pleader chooses, employing the conjunction and where the statute has `or,' andit will not be double, and it will be established at thetrial by proof of any one of them." 1 J. Bishop, NewCriminal Procedure $ 436, pp. 355-356 (2d ed. 1913)(footnotes omitted).See, e. g., Crain v. United States, 162 U. S. 625, 636 (1896);Sanford v. State, 8 Ala. App. 245, 247, 62 So. 317, 318 (1913);State v. Bresee, 137 Iowa 673, 681, 114 N. W. 45, 48 (1907);Morganstern v. Commonwealth, 94 Va. 787, 790, 26 S. E. 402,403 (1896). See alsoSchad v. Arizona, 501 U. S. 624, 630-631 (1991); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 7(c)(1) (authorizing a singlecount to allege that an offense was committed "by one ormore specified means").The historical practice, therefore, fails to support petition-er's claim under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.See Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co.,18 How. 272, 276-277 (1856). Petitioner argues, however,that--whether as a matter of due process or by virtue of oursupervisory power over federal courts--a result contrary tothe earlier practice has been prescribed by our decision inYates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957). Yates involveda single-count federal indictment charging a conspiracy "(1)502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT52 GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtto advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) to organize, as the Communist Party of theUnited States, a society of persons who so advocate andteach." Id., at 300. The first of these objects (the "advocacy" charge) violated $ 2(a)(1) of the Smith Act of 1940 (subsequently repealed and substantially reenacted as 18 U. S. C.$ 2385), and the second of them (the "organizing" charge) violated $ 2(a)(3). We found that the "organizing" object wasinsufficient in law, since the statutory term referred to initialformation, and the Communist Party had been "organized"in that sense at a time beyond the period of the applicablestatute of limitations. 354 U. S., at 304-311. We then rejected the Government's argument that the convictions couldnonetheless stand on the basis of the "advocacy" object.Our analysis made no mention of the Due Process Clause butconsisted in its entirety of the following:"In these circumstances we think the proper rule to beapplied is that which requires a verdict to be set asidein cases where the verdict is supportable on one ground,but not on another, and it is impossible to tell whichground the jury selected. Stromberg v. California, 283U. S. 359, 367-368; Williams v. North Carolina, 317U. S. 287, 291-292; Cramer v. United States, 325 U. S. 1,36, n. 45." Id., at 312.None of the three authorities cited for that expansiveproposition in fact establishes it. The first of them, Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931), is the fountainheadof decisions departing from the common law with respect tothe point at issue here. That case, however--which does notexplicitly invoke the Due Process Clause--does not sanctionas broad a departure as the dictum in Yates expresses, orindeed even the somewhat narrower departure that the holding in Yates adopts. The defendant in Stromberg was502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT53Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)Opinion of the Courtcharged in one count of violating a California statute prohibiting the display of a red flag in a public place for any one ofthree purposes: (a) as a symbol of opposition to organizedgovernment; (b) as an invitation to anarchistic action; or (c)as an aid to seditious propaganda. Id., at 361. The jurywas instructed that it could convict if it found the defendantguilty of violating any one purpose of the statute. Id., at363-364. A conviction in the form of a general verdict followed. The California appellate court upheld the convictionon the ground that, even though it doubted the constitutionality of criminalizing the first of the three purposes, the statute (and conviction) could be saved if that provision was severed from the statute. We rejected that:"As there were three purposes set forth in the statute,and the jury were instructed that their verdict might begiven with respect to any one of them, independentlyconsidered, it is impossible to say under which clause ofthe statute the conviction was obtained. If any one ofthese clauses, which the state court has held to be separable, was invalid, it cannot be determined upon this record that the appellant was not convicted under thatclause. . . . It follows that instead of its being permissibleto hold, with the state court, that the verdict could besustained if any one of the clauses of the statute werefound to be valid, the necessary conclusion from themanner in which the case was sent to the jury is that,if any of the clauses in question is invalid under theFederal Constitution, the conviction cannot be upheld."Id., at 368.This language, and the holding of Stromberg, do not necessarily stand for anything more than the principle that, wherea provision of the Constitution forbids conviction on a particular ground, the constitutional guarantee is violated by ageneral verdict that may have rested on that ground.502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT54 GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe same principle explains the other two cases relied onby Yates. In Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287(1942), the defendant was convicted of bigamous cohabitationafter the jury had been instructed that it could disregard thedefendants' Nevada divorce decrees on the ground eitherthat North Carolina did not recognize decrees based on substituted service or that the decrees were procured by fraud.Id., at 290-291. The former of these grounds, we found, violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause. We continued:"[T]he verdict of the jury for all we know may have beenrendered on that [unconstitutional] ground alone, sinceit did not specify the basis on which it rested. . . . Noreason has been suggested why the rule of the Stromberg case is inapplicable here. Nor has any reason beenadvanced why the rule of the Stromberg case is not bothappropriate and necessary for the protection of rights ofthe accused. To say that a general verdict of guiltyshould be upheld though we cannot know that it did notrest on the invalid constitutional ground on which thecase was submitted to the jury, would be to countenancea procedure which would cause a serious impairment ofconstitutional rights." Id., at 292.The third case cited by Yates, Cramer v. United States, 325U. S. 1 (1945), was our first opportunity to interpret the provision of Article III, $ 3, which requires, for conviction oftreason against the United States, that there be "two Witnesses to the same overt Act." The prosecution had submitted proof of three overt acts to the jury, which had returneda general verdict of guilty. After a comprehensive analysisof the overt-act requirement, id., at 8-35, we found that twoof the acts proffered by the prosecution did not satisfy it, id.,at 36-44, and accordingly reversed the conviction. "Since itis not possible," we said, "to identify the grounds on whichCramer was convicted, the verdict must be set aside if any502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT55Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)Opinion of the Courtof the separable acts submitted was insufficient." Id., at36, n. 45.1A host of our decisions, both before and after Yates, hasapplied whatWilliams called "the rule of the Strombergcase" to general-verdict convictions that may have rested onan unconstitutional ground. See,e. g., Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U. S. 564, 570-571 (1970); Leary v. United States,395 U. S. 6, 31-32 (1969); Street v. New York, 394 U. S. 576,585-588 (1969);Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U. S. 1, 5 (1949);Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 529 (1945). Cf. Zant v.Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 880-884 (1983) (rejecting contentionthat Stromberg required a death sentence to be set aside ifone of several statutory aggravating circumstances underlying the jury verdict was unconstitutionally vague). Yates,however, was the first and only case of ours to apply Stromberg to a general verdict in which one of the possible basesof conviction did not violate any provision of the Constitutionbut was simply legally inadequate (because of a statutorytime bar). As we have described, that was an unexplained1 At the outset of its discussion of the two overt acts, the Cramer Courtsaid: "At the present stage of the case we need not weigh their sufficiencyas a matter of pleading. Whatever the averments might have permittedthe Government to prove, we now consider their adequacy on the proof asmade." 325 U. S., at 37. Petitioner suggests this means that Cramerwas a sufficiency-of-the-evidence case--a point relevant to our later analysis, see infra, at 58-59. That suggestion is mistaken. As is apparentfrom the Court's full discussion, "adequacy on the proof as made" meantnot whether the evidence sufficed to enable an alleged fact to be found,but rather whether the facts adduced at trial sufficed in law to constituteovert acts of treason. Thus the Court could say: "It is not relevant to ourissue to appraise weight or credibility of the evidence apart from determining its constitutional sufficiency." 325 U. S., at 43. The Court of Appeals' opinion in Cramer makes even clearer that legal as opposed to evidentiary sufficiency was at issue; it specifically distinguishes the case fromthose in which multiple overt acts sufficient in law are submitted to thejury and the conviction is upheld as long as the evidence suffices to showone of them. See United States v. Cramer, 137 F. 2d 888, 893-894 (CA21943).502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT56 GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtextension, explicitly invoking neither the Due ProcessClause (which is an unlikely basis) nor our supervisory powers over the procedures employed in a federal prosecution.Our continued adherence to the holding of Yates is not atissue in this case. What petitioner seeks is an extension ofits holding--an expansion of its expansion of Stromberg--toa context in which we have never applied it before. Petitioner cites no case, and we are aware of none, in which wehave set aside a general verdict because one of the possiblebases of conviction was neither unconstitutional as in Stromberg, nor even illegal as in Yates, but merely unsupportedby sufficient evidence. If such invalidation on evidentiarygrounds were appropriate, it is hard to see how it could belimited to those alternative bases of conviction that constitute separate legal grounds; surely the underlying principlewould apply equally, for example, to an indictment chargingmurder by shooting or drowning, where the evidence ofdrowning proves inadequate. See Schad v. Arizona, 501U. S., at 630-631. But petitioner's requested extension isnot merely unprecedented and extreme; it also contradictsanother case, postdating Yates, that in our view must govern here.Turner v. United States, 396 U. S. 398 (1970), involved aclaim that the evidence was insufficient to support a generalguilty verdict under a one-count indictment charging the defendant with knowingly purchasing, possessing, dispensing,and distributing heroin not in or from the original stampedpackage, in violation of 26 U. S. C. $ 4704(a) (1964 ed.). Weheld that the conviction would have to be sustained if therewas sufficient evidence of distribution alone. We set forthas the prevailing rule: "[W]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive, as Turner's indictment did, the verdict stands if theevidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT57Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)Opinion of the Courtcharged." Id., at 420. Cf. United States v. Miller, 471 U. S.130, 136 (1985).Although petitioner does not ask us to overrule Turner,neither does she give us any adequate basis for distinguishing it. She claims that we have not yet applied the rule ofthat case to multiple-act conspiracies. That is questionable.See United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150,250 (1940). But whether we have yet done so or not, thecontrolling point is that a logical and consistent applicationofTurner demands that proof of alternative facts in conspir-acy cases be treated the same as proof of alternative facts inother contexts. Imagine the not unlikely case of a prosecu-tion for defrauding an insurer through two means and forconspiring to defraud the insurer through the same twomeans; and imagine a failure of proof with respect to one ofthe means. Petitioner's proposal would produce the strangeresult of voiding a conviction on the conspiracy while sustaining a conviction on the substantive offense. We agreewith the vast majority of Federal Courts of Appeals, whichhave made no exception to the Turner rule for multiple-object and multiple-overt-act conspiracies. See, e. g., UnitedStates v. Bilzerian, 926 F. 2d 1285, 1302 (CA2 1991), cert.denied, post, p. 813; United States v. Beverly, 913 F. 2d 337,362-365 (CA7 1990) (case below); United States v.

S. 959 (1976); Moss v. UnitedStates, 132 F. 2d 875, 877-878 (CA6 1943).22 The only Court of Appeals we are aware of that adheres to the contraryrule is the Third Circuit, albeit without distinguishing, or even acknowledging the existence of, Turner. See United States v. Tarnopol, 561 F. 2d466, 474-475 (1977). Many cases can be found, some of which are cited502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT58 GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtPetitioner also seeks to distinguish Turner on the basisthat it applies only where one can be sure that the jury didnot use the inadequately supported ground as the basis ofconviction. That assurance exists, petitioner claims, whenthe prosecution presents no evidence whatever to supportthe insufficient theory; if the prosecution offerssome, butinsufficient, evidence on the point, as it did in this case, thenthe Yates "impossible to tell" rationale controls. This noveltheory posits two different degrees of failure of proof--a failure that is sufficiently insufficient, to which Turner wouldapply, and one that is insufficiently insufficient, to whichYates would apply. Besides producing an odd system inwhich the greater failure of proof is rewarded, the ruleseems to us full of practical difficulty, bereft of support inTurner, and without foundation in the common-law presump-tion upon which Turner is based.Finally, petitioner asserts that the distinction betweenlegal error (Yates) and insufficiency of proof (Turner) is illusory, since judgments that are not supported by the requisiteminimum of proof are invalidas a matter of law--and in-deed, in the criminal law field at least, are constitutionallyby petitioner, that invalidate general conspiracy verdicts on the basis oflegal deficiency of some of the objects rather than inadequacy of proof;these are of course irrelevant. See, e. g., United States v. Irwin, 654 F. 2d671, 680 (CA10 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 1016 (1982); United States v.Head, 641 F. 2d 174, 178-179 (CA4 1981), cert. denied, 462 U. S. 1132 (1983);United States v. Kavazanjian, 623 F. 2d 730, 739-740 (CA1 1980); UnitedStates v. Carman, 577 F. 2d 556, 567-568 (CA9 1978); United States v.Baranski, 484 F. 2d 556, 560-561 (CA7 1973); Van Liew v. United States,321 F. 2d 664, 672 (CA5 1963). Some other cases cited by petitioner donot involve a conspiracy charge at all, e. g., United States v. Natelli, 527F. 2d 311, 324-325 (CA2 1975), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 934 (1976), or applytheir ruling to both substantive and conspiracy charges, e. g., UnitedStates v. Garcia, 907 F. 2d 380, 381 (CA2 1990)--which means that theyflatly contradict Turner and offer no support for the distinction that petitioner suggests. Still others have been distinguished (or effectively overruled) by later cases within the Circuit, see, e. g., United States v. Berardi,675 F. 2d 894, 902 (CA7 1982).502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT59Cite as: 502 U. S. 46 (1991)Opinion of the Courtrequired to be set aside. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U. S.307, 319 (1979). Insufficiency of proof, in other words, islegal error. This represents a purely semantical dispute.In one sense "legal error" includes inadequacy of evidence--namely, when the phrase is used as a term of art to designatethose mistakes that it is the business of judges (in jury cases)and of appellate courts to identify and correct. In this sense"legal error" occurs when a jury, properly instructed as tothe law, convicts on the basis of evidence that no reasonableperson could regard as sufficient. But in another sense--amore natural and less artful sense--the term "legal error"means a mistake about the law, as opposed to a mistake concerning the weight or the factual import of the evidence.The answer to petitioner's objection is simply that we areusing "legal error" in the latter sense.That surely establishes a clear line that will separateTurner from Yates, and it happens to be a line that makesgood sense. Jurors are not generally equipped to determinewhether a particular theory of conviction submitted to themis contrary to law--whether, for example, the action in question is protected by the Constitution, is time barred, or failsto come within the statutory definition of the crime. When,therefore, jurors have been left the option of relying upon alegally inadequate theory, there is no reason to think thattheir own intelligence and expertise will save them from thaterror. Quite the opposite is true, however, when they havebeen left the option of relying upon a factually inadequatetheory, since jurors are well equipped to analyze the evidence, see Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 157 (1968).As the Seventh Circuit has put it:"It is one thing to negate a verdict that, while supportedby evidence, may have been based on an erroneous viewof the law; it is another to do so merely on the chance--remote, it seems to us--that the jury convicted on aground that was not supported by adequate evidencewhen there existed alternative grounds for which the502us1$$6K 08-21-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT60 GRIFFIN v. UNITED STATESBlackmun, J., concurring in judgmentevidence was sufficient." United States v. Townsend,924 F. 2d 1385, 1414 (1991).* * *What we have said today does not mean that a districtcourt cannot, in its discretion, give an instruction of the sortpetitioner requested here, eliminating from the jury's consideration an alternative basis of liability that does not haveadequate evidentiary support. Indeed, if the evidence is insufficient to support an alternative legal theory of liability,it would generally be preferable for the court to give an instruction removing that theory from the jury's consideration.The refusal to do so, however, does not provide an independ-ent basis for reversing an otherwise valid conviction. Thejudgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
