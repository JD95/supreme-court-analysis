RUCKEROpinion of the Courthousing authority to evict a tenant when a member of thetenant's household or a guest engages in drug-related criminal activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew, or hadreason to know, of that activity. Respondents say it doesnot. We agree with petitioners.Respondents are four public housing tenants of the Oakland Housing Authority (OHA). Paragraph 9(m) of respond-ents' leases, tracking the language of $ 1437d(l)(6), obligatesthe tenants to "assure that the tenant, any member of thehousehold, a guest, or another person under the tenant's con-trol, shall not engage in . . . [a]ny drug-related criminal activity on or near the premise[s]." App. 59. Respondents alsosigned an agreement stating that the tenant "understand[s]that if I or any member of my household or guests shouldviolate this lease provision, my tenancy may be terminatedand I may be evicted." Id., at 69.In late 1997 and early 1998, OHA instituted eviction proceedings in state court against respondents, alleging viola-tions of this lease provision. The complaint alleged: (1) thatthe respective grandsons of respondents William Lee andBarbara Hill, both of whom were listed as residents on theleases, were caught in the apartment complex parking lotsmoking marijuana; (2) that the daughter of respondentPearlie Rucker, who resides with her and is listed on thelease as a resident, was found with cocaine and a crack cocaine pipe three blocks from Rucker's apartment;1 and(3) that on three instances within a 2-month period, respondent Herman Walker's caregiver and two others were foundwith cocaine in Walker's apartment. OHA had issuedWalker notices of a lease violation on the first two occasions,before initiating the eviction action after the third violation.United States Department of Housing and Urban Develop-ment (HUD) regulations administering $ 1437d(l)(6) require1 In February 1998, OHA dismissed the unlawful detainer action againstRucker, after her daughter was incarcerated, and thus no longer posed athreat to other tenants.535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 535 U.

The agency made clear that local public housing authorities' discretion to evict for drug-relatedactivity includes those situations in which "[the] tenant didnot know, could not foresee, or could not control behavior byother occupants of the unit." 56 Fed. Reg. 51560, 51567(1991).After OHA initiated the eviction proceedings in statecourt, respondents commenced actions against HUD, OHA,and OHA's director in United States District Court. Theychallenged HUD's interpretation of the statute under theAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A), arguingthat 42 U. S.

See Rucker v. Davis, 203 F. 3d627 (CA9 2000). An en banc panel of the Court of Appealsreversed and affirmed the District Court's grant of the preliminary injunction. See Rucker v. Davis, 237 F. 3d 1113(2001). That court held that HUD's interpretation permitting the eviction of so-called "innocent" tenants "is inconsistent with Congressional intent and must be rejected" underthe first step of Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural ResourcesDefense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-843 (1984). 237F. 3d, at 1126.We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 976 (2001), 534 U. S. 813(2001), and now reverse, holding that 42 U. S. C. $ 1437d(l)(6)unambiguously requires lease terms that vest local publichousing authorities with the discretion to evict tenants forthe drug-related activity of household members and guestswhether or not the tenant knew, or should have known, aboutthe activity.That this is so seems evident from the plain language ofthe statute. It provides that "[e]ach public housing agencyshall utilize leases which . . . provide that . . . any drugrelated criminal activity on or off such premises, engagedin by a public housing tenant, any member of the tenant'shousehold, or any guest or other person under the tenant'scontrol, shall be cause for termination of tenancy." 42U. S. C. $ 1437d(l)(6) (1994 ed., Supp. V). The en banc Courtof Appeals thought the statute did not address "the level ofpersonal knowledge or fault that is required for eviction."237 F. 3d, at 1120. Yet Congress' decision not to impose any535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 535 U. S. 125 (2002)Opinion of the Courtqualification in the statute, combined with its use of the term"any" to modify "drug-related criminal activity," precludesany knowledge requirement. See United States v. Monsanto, 491 U. S. 600, 609 (1989). As we have explained, "theword `any' has an expansive meaning, that is, `one or someindiscriminately of whatever kind.' " United States v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997). Thus, any drug-related activityengaged in by the specified persons is grounds for termination, not just drug-related activity that the tenant knew, orshould have known, about.The en banc Court of Appeals also thought it possible that"under the tenant's control" modifies not just "other person,"but also "member of the tenant's household" and "guest."237 F. 3d, at 1120. The court ultimately adopted this reading, concluding that the statute prohibits eviction where thetenant, "for a lack of knowledge or other reason, could notrealistically exercise control over the conduct of a householdmember or guest." Id., at 1126. But this interpretationruns counter to basic rules of grammar. The disjunctive"or" means that the qualification applies only to "other person." Indeed, the view that "under the tenant's control"modifies everything coming before it in the sentence wouldresult in the nonsensical reading that the statute applies to"a public housing tenant . . . under the tenant's control."HUD offers a convincing explanation for the grammaticalimperative that "under the tenant's control" modifies only"other person": "by `control,' the statute means control in thesense that the tenant has permitted access to the premises."66 Fed. Reg. 28781 (2001). Implicit in the terms "householdmember" or "guest" is that access to the premises has beengranted by the tenant. Thus, the plain language of$ 1437d(l)(6) requires leases that grant public housing authorities the discretion to terminate tenancy without regardto the tenant's knowledge of the drug-related criminalactivity.535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN132 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBANDEVELOPMENT v. RUCKEROpinion of the CourtComparing $ 1437d(l)(6) to a related statutory provisionreinforces the unambiguous text. The civil forfeiture statute that makes all leasehold interests subject to forfeiture when used to commit drug-related criminal activitiesexpressly exempts tenants who had no knowledge of theactivity: "[N]o property shall be forfeited under thisparagraph . . . by reason of any act or omission establishedby that owner to have been committed or omitted withoutthe knowledge or consent of that owner." 21 U. S. C.$ 881(a)(7) (1994 ed.). Because this forfeiture provision wasamended in the same Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 that created 42 U. S. C. $ 1437d(l)(6), the en banc Court of Appealsthought Congress "meant them to be read consistently" sothat the knowledge requirement should be read into the eviction provision. 237 F. 3d, at 1121-1122. But the two sections deal with distinctly different matters. The "innocentowner" defense for drug forfeiture cases was already in existence prior to 1988 as part of 21 U. S. C. $ 881(a)(7). Allthat Congress did in the 1988 Act was to add leasehold interests to the property interests that might be forfeited underthe drug statute. And if such a forfeiture action were to bebrought against a leasehold interest, it would be subject tothe pre-existing "innocent owner" defense. But 42 U. S. C.$ 1437(d)(l)(6), with which we deal here, is a quite differentmeasure. It is entirely reasonable to think that the Government, when seeking to transfer private property to itself ina forfeiture proceeding, should be subject to an "innocentowner defense," while it should not be when acting as a landlord in a public housing project. The forfeiture provisionshows that Congress knew exactly how to provide an "innocent owner" defense. It did not provide one in $ 1437d(l)(6).The en banc Court of Appeals next resorted to legislativehistory. The Court of Appeals correctly recognized that reference to legislative history is inappropriate when the textof the statute is unambiguous. 237 F. 3d, at 1123. Giventhat the en banc Court of Appeals' finding of textual ambigu535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN133Cite as: 535 U. S. 125 (2002)Opinion of the Courtity is wrong, see supra, at 130-132, there is no need to con-sult legislative history.4Nor was the en banc Court of Appeals correct in conclud-ing that this plain reading of the statute leads to absurd results.5 The statute does not require the eviction of any ten4 Even if it were appropriate to look at legislative history, it would nothelp respondents. The en banc Court of Appeals relied on two passagesfrom a 1990 Senate Report on a proposed amendment to the eviction provision. 237 F. 3d, at 1123 (citing S. Rep. No. 101-316 (1990)). But thisReport was commenting on language from a Senate version of the 1990amendment, which was never enacted. The language in the Senate version, which would have imposed a different standard of cause for evictionfor drug-related crimes than the unqualified language of $ 1437d(l)(6), see136 Cong. Rec. 15991, 16012 (1990) (reproducing S. 566, 101st Cong., 2dSess., $$ 521(f) and 714(a) (1990)), was rejected at Conference. See H. R.Conf. Rep. No. 101-943, p. 418 (1990). And, as the dissent from the enbanc decision below explained, the passages may plausibly be read as amere suggestion about how local public housing authorities should exercisethe "wide discretion to evict tenants connected with drug-related criminalbehavior" that the lease provision affords them. 237 F. 3d, at 1134(Sneed, J., dissenting).Respondents also cite language from a House Report commenting onthe Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000, codified at 18 U. S. C. $ 983.Brief for Respondents 15-16. For the reasons discussed supra, at 132and this page, legislative history concerning forfeiture provisions is notprobative on the interpretation of $ 1437d(l)(6).A 1996 amendment to $ 1437d(l)(6), enacted five years after HUD issuedits interpretation of the statute, supports our holding. The 1996 amendment expanded the reach of $ 1437d(l)(6), changing the language of thelease provision from applying to activity taking place "on or near" thepublic housing premises, to activity occurring "on or off" the public housing premises. See Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996,$ 9(a)(2), 110 Stat. 836. But Congress, "presumed to be aware" of HUD'sinterpretation rejecting a knowledge requirement, made no other changeto the statute. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U. S. 575, 580 (1978).5 For the reasons discussed above, no-fault eviction, which is specificallyauthorized under $ 1437d(l)(6), does not violate $ 1437d(l)(2), which prohibits public housing authorities from including "unreasonable terms and conditions [in their leases]." In addition, the general statutory provision inthe latter section cannot trump the clear language of the more specific$ 1437d(l)(6). See Green v. Bock Laundry Machine Co., 490 U. S. 504,524-526 (1989).535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN134 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBANDEVELOPMENT v. RUCKEROpinion of the Courtant who violated the lease provision. Instead, it entruststhat decision to the local public housing authorities, who arein the best position to take account of, among other things,the degree to which the housing project suffers from "rampant drug-related or violent crime," 42 U. S. C. $ 11901(2)(1994 ed. and Supp. V), "the seriousness of the offending action," 66 Fed. Reg., at 28803, and "the extent to which theleaseholder has . . . taken all reasonable steps to prevent ormitigate the offending action,"ibid. It is not "absurd" thata local housing authority may sometimes evict a tenant whohad no knowledge of the drug-related activity. Such "nofault" eviction is a common "incident of tenant responsibilityunder normal landlord-tenant law and practice." 56 Fed.Reg., at 51567. Strict liability maximizes deterrence andeases enforcement difficulties. See Pacific Mut. Life Ins.Co. v. Haslip, 499 U. S. 1, 14 (1991).And, of course, there is an obvious reason why Congresswould have permitted local public housing authorities to conduct no-fault evictions: Regardless of knowledge, a tenantwho "cannot control drug crime, or other criminal activitiesby a household member which threaten health or safety ofother residents, is a threat to other residents and the project." 56 Fed. Reg., at 51567. With drugs leading to "murders, muggings, and other forms of violence against tenants,"and to the "deterioration of the physical environment thatrequires substantial government expenditures," 42 U. S. C.$ 11901(4) (1994 ed., Supp. V), it was reasonable for Congressto permit no-fault evictions in order to "provide public andother federally assisted low-income housing that is decent,safe, and free from illegal drugs," $ 11901(1) (1994 ed.).In another effort to avoid the plain meaning of the statute,the en banc Court of Appeals invoked the canon of constitutional avoidance. But that canon "has no application in theabsence of statutory ambiguity." United States v. OaklandCannabis Buyers' Cooperative, 532 U. S. 483, 494 (2001)."Any other conclusion, while purporting to be an exercise in535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN135Cite as: 535 U. S. 125 (2002)Opinion of the Courtjudicial restraint, would trench upon the legislative powersvested in Congress by Art. I, $ 1, of the Constitution."United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 680 (1985). Thereare, moreover, no "serious constitutional doubts" about Congress' affording local public housing authorities the discre-tion to conduct no-fault evictions for drug-related crime.Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 314, n. 9 (1993) (emphasisdeleted).The en banc Court of Appeals held that HUD's interpretation "raise[s] serious questions under the Due Process Clauseof the Fourteenth Amendment," because it permits "tenantsto be deprived of their property interest without any relationship to individual wrongdoing." 237 F. 3d, at 1124-1125(citing Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 224-225 (1961);Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Co. v. Danaher, 238U. S. 482 (1915)). But both of these cases deal with the actsof government as sovereign. In Scales, the United Statescriminally charged the defendant with knowing membershipin an organization that advocated the overthrow of theUnited States Government. In Danaher, an Arkansas statute forbade discrimination among customers of a telephonecompany. The situation in the present cases is entirely different. The government is not attempting to criminallypunish or civilly regulate respondents as members of thegeneral populace. It is instead acting as a landlord of property that it owns, invoking a clause in a lease to which respondents have agreed and which Congress has expresslyrequired. Scales and Danaher cast no constitutional doubton such actions.The Court of Appeals sought to bolster its discussion ofconstitutional doubt by pointing to the fact that respondentshave a property interest in their leasehold interest, citingGreene v. Lindsey, 456 U. S. 444 (1982). This is undoubtedlytrue, and Greene held that an effort to deprive a tenant ofsuch a right without proper notice violated the Due ProcessClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. But, in the present535US1 Unit: $U32 [09-18-03 15:34:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN136 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBANDEVELOPMENT v. RUCKEROpinion of the Courtcases, such deprivation will occur in the state court whereOHA brought the unlawful detainer action against respondents. There is no indication that notice has not been givenby OHA in the past, or that it will not be given in the future.Any individual factual disputes about whether the lease pro-vision was actually violated can, of course, be resolved inthese proceedings.6We hold that "Congress has directly spoken to the precisequestion at issue." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S., at 842. Section1437d(l)(6) requires lease terms that give local public housing authorities the discretion to terminate the lease of a ten-ant when a member of the household or a guest engages indrug-related activity, regardless of whether the tenant knew,or should have known, of the drug-related activity.Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is re-versed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
