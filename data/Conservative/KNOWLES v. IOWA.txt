An Iowa police officer stopped petitioner Knowles forspeeding, but issued him a citation rather than arrestinghim. The question presented is whether such a procedureauthorizes the officer, consistently with the Fourth Amendment, to conduct a full search of the car. We answer thisquestion "no."Knowles was stopped in Newton, Iowa, after having beenclocked driving 43 miles per hour on a road where the speedlimit was 25 miles per hour. The police officer issued a cita-tion to Knowles, although under Iowa law he might havearrested him. The officer then conducted a full search ofthe car, and under the driver's seat he found a bag of marijuana and a "pot pipe." Knowles was then arrested andcharged with violation of state laws dealing with controlledsubstances.Before trial, Knowles moved to suppress the evidence soobtained. He argued that the search could not be sustainedunder the "search incident to arrest" exception recognized inUnited States v. Robinson, 414 U. S. 218 (1973), because hehad not been placed under arrest. At the hearing on themotion to suppress, the police officer conceded that he had*James J. Tomkovicz, Steven R. Shapiro, Susan N. Herman, and LisaB. Kemler filed a brief for the American Civil Liberties Union et al. asamici curiae urging reversal.Stephen R. McSpadden filed a brief for the National Association ofPolice Organizations, Inc., as amicus curiae urging affirmance.525US1 Unit: $$U6 [10-23-00 11:39:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN115Cite as: 525 U. S. 113 (1998)Opinion of the Courtneither Knowles' consent nor probable cause to conduct thesearch. He relied on Iowa law dealing with such searches.Iowa Code Ann. $ 321.485(1)(a) (West 1997) provides thatIowa peace officers having cause to believe that a person hasviolated any traffic or motor vehicle equipment law may ar-rest the person and immediately take the person before amagistrate. Iowa law also authorizes the far more usualpractice of issuing a citation in lieu of arrest or in lieu ofcontinued custody after an initial arrest.1 See Iowa CodeAnn. $ 805.1(1) (West Supp. 1997). Section 805.1(4) providesthat the issuance of a citation in lieu of an arrest "does notaffect the officer's authority to conduct an otherwise lawfulsearch." The Iowa Supreme Court has interpreted this pro-vision as providing authority to officers to conduct a fullblown search of an automobile and driver in those caseswhere police elect not to make a custodial arrest and insteadissue a citation--that is, a search incident to citation. SeeState v. Meyer, 543 N. W. 2d 876, 879 (1996); State v. Becker,458 N. W. 2d 604, 607 (1990).Based on this authority, the trial court denied the motionto suppress and found Knowles guilty. The Supreme Courtof Iowa, sitting en banc, affirmed by a divided vote. 569N. W. 2d 601 (1997). Relying on its earlier opinion in Statev.Doran, 563 N. W. 2d 620 (1997), the Iowa Supreme Courtupheld the constitutionality of the search under a bright-line"search incident to citation" exception to the Fourth Amend-ment's warrant requirement, reasoning that so long as the1 Iowa law permits the issuance of a citation in lieu of arrest for mostoffenses for which an accused person would be "eligible for bail." SeeIowa Code Ann. $ 805.1(1) (West Supp. 1997). In addition to traffic andmotor vehicle equipment violations, this would permit the issuance of acitation in lieu of arrest for such serious felonies as second-degree burglary, $ 713.5 (West Supp. 1997), and first-degree theft, $ 714.2(1) (West1993), both bailable offenses under Iowa law. See $ 811.1 (West Supp.1997) (listing all nonbailable offenses). The practice in Iowa of permitting citation in lieu of arrest is consistent with law reform efforts. See 3W. LaFave, Search and Seizure $ 5.2(h), p. 99, and n. 151 (3d ed. 1996).525US1 Unit: $$U6 [10-23-00 11:39:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN116 KNOWLES v. IOWAOpinion of the Courtarresting officer had probable cause to make a custodial arrest, there need not in fact have been a custodial arrest. Wegranted certiorari, 523 U. S. 1019 (1998), and we now reverse.The State contends that Knowles has challenged IowaCode's $ 805.1(4) only "on its face" and not "as applied," inwhich case, the argument continues, his challenge would runafoul of Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 (1968). But in hismotion to suppress, Knowles argued that "[b]ecause the officer had no probable cause and no search warrant, and thesearch cannot otherwise be justified under the FourthAmendment, the search of the car was unconstitutional."App. 7. Knowles did not argue below, and does not arguehere, that the statute could never be lawfully applied. Thequestion we therefore address is whether the search at issue,authorized as it was by state law, nonetheless violates theFourth Amendment.2In Robinson, supra, we noted the two historical rationalesfor the "search incident to arrest" exception: (1) the need todisarm the suspect in order to take him into custody, and (2)the need to preserve evidence for later use at trial. 414U. S., at 234. See also United States v. Edwards, 415 U. S.800, 802-803 (1974); Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752, 762-763 (1969); Preston v. United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 (1964);2 Iowa also contends that Knowles' challenge is precluded because hefailed to seek review of a separate decision of the Iowa Supreme Court,which affirmed his conviction for possession of drug paraphernalia in violation of a city ordinance. That decision, Iowa argues, resulted from thesame search at issue here, rejected the same Fourth Amendment challenge Knowles now makes, and, under principles of res judicata, bars hispresent challenge. Even if Knowles' failure to seek certiorari review ofthis decision could preclude his present challenge, Iowa waived this argument by failing to raise it in its brief in opposition to the petition forcertiorari. See this Court's Rule 15.2; Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S.808, 816 (1985) ("Nonjurisdictional defects of this sort should be broughtto our attention no later than in respondent's brief in opposition to thepetition for certiorari; if not, we consider it within our discretion to deemthe defect waived").525US1 Unit: $$U6 [10-23-00 11:39:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN117Cite as: 525 U. S. 113 (1998)Opinion of the CourtAgnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30 (1925); Weeks v.United States, 232 U. S. 383, 392 (1914). But neither ofthese underlying rationales for the search incident to arrestexception is sufficient to justify the search in the presentcase.We have recog nized that the first rationale--officersafety--is " `both legitimate and weighty,' "Maryland v.Wilson, 519 U. S. 408, 412 (1997) (quoting Pennsylvania v.Mimms, 434 U. S. 106, 110 (1977) (per curiam)). The threatto officer safety from issuing a traffic citation, however, is agood deal less than in the case of a custodial arrest. InRobinson, we stated that a custodial arrest involves "danger toan officer" because of "the extended exposure which followsthe taking of a suspect into custody and transporting him tothe police station." 414 U. S., at 234-235. We recognizedthat "[t]he danger to the police officer flows from the fact ofthe arrest, and its attendant proximity, stress, and uncertainty, and not from the grounds for arrest." Id., at 234,n. 5. A routine traffic stop, on the other hand, is a relativelybrief encounter and "is more analogous to a so-called `Terrystop' . . . than to a formal arrest." Berkemer v. McCarty,468 U. S. 420, 439 (1984). See also Cupp v. Murphy, 412U. S. 291, 296 (1973) ("Where there is no formal arrest . . . aperson might well be less hostile to the police and less likelyto take conspicuous, immediate steps to destroy incriminating evidence").This is not to say that the concern for officer safety isabsent in the case of a routine traffic stop. It plainly is not.See Mimms, supra, at 110; Wilson, supra, at 413-414. Butwhile the concern for officer safety in this context may justify the "minimal" additional intrusion of ordering a driverand passengers out of the car, it does not by itself justify theoften considerably greater intrusion attending a full fieldtype search. Even without the search authority Iowa urges,officers have other, independent bases to search for weaponsand protect themselves from danger. For example, they525US1 Unit: $$U6 [10-23-00 11:39:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN118 KNOWLES v. IOWAOpinion of the Courtmay order out of a vehicle both the driver, Mimms, supra,at 111, and any passengers,Wilson, supra, at 414; performa "patdown" of a driver and any passengers upon reasonablesuspicion that they may be armed and dangerous,Terry v.Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968); conduct a "Terry patdown" of thepassenger compartment of a vehicle upon reasonable suspi-cion that an occupant is dangerous and may gain immediatecontrol of a weapon, Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1049(1983); and even conduct a full search of the passenger compartment, including any containers therein, pursuant to acustodial arrest,New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454, 460(1981).Nor has Iowa shown the second justification for the authority to search incident to arrest--the need to discover andpreserve evidence. Once Knowles was stopped for speedingand issued a citation, all the evidence necessary to prosecutethat offense had been obtained. No further evidence of excessive speed was going to be found either on the person ofthe offender or in the passenger compartment of the car.Iowa nevertheless argues that a "search incident to citation" is justified because a suspect who is subject to a routinetraffic stop may attempt to hide or destroy evidence relatedto his identity (e. g., a driver's license or vehicle registration),or destroy evidence of another, as yet undetected crime. Asfor the destruction of evidence relating to identity, if a policeofficer is not satisfied with the identification furnished by thedriver, this may be a basis for arresting him rather thanmerely issuing a citation. As for destroying evidence ofother crimes, the possibility that an officer would stumbleonto evidence wholly unrelated to the speeding offenseseems remote.In Robinson, we held that the authority to conduct a fullfield search as incident to an arrest was a "bright-line rule,"which was based on the concern for officer safety and destruction or loss of evidence, but which did not depend inevery case upon the existence of either concern. Here we525US1 Unit: $$U6 [10-23-00 11:39:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN119Cite as: 525 U. S. 113 (1998)Opinion of the Courtare asked to extend that "bright-line rule" to a situationwhere the concern for officer safety is not present to thesame extent and the concern for destruction or loss of evi-dence is not present at all. We decline to do so. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Iowa is reversed, and thecause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistentwith this opinion.
