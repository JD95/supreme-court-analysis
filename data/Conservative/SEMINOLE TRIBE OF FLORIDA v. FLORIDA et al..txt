The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides that an In-dian tribe may conduct certain gaming activities only in conformance with a valid compact between the tribe and theState in which the gaming activities are located. 102 Stat.2475, 25 U. S. C. $ 2710(d)(1)(C). The Act, passed by Con-gress under the Indian Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art.I, $ 8, cl. 3, imposes upon the States a duty to negotiate ingood faith with an Indian tribe toward the formation of acompact, $ 2710(d)(3)(A), and authorizes a tribe to bring suitin federal court against a State in order to compel performance of that duty, $ 2710(d)(7). We hold that notwithstand-ing Congress' clear intent to abrogate the States' sovereignimmunity, the Indian Commerce Clause does not grant Con-gress that power, and therefore $ 2710(d)(7) cannot grant jurisdiction over a State that does not consent to be sued. Wefurther hold that the doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S.123 (1908), may not be used to enforce $ 2710(d)(3) against astate official.follows: Jeff Sessions of Alabama, Grant Woods of Arizona, WinstonBryant of Arkansas, Gale A.

FLORIDAOpinion of the CourtICongress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in1988 in order to provide a statutory basis for the operationand regulation of gaming by Indian tribes. See 25 U. S. C.$ 2702. The Act divides gaming on Indian lands into threeclasses--I, II, and III--and provides a different regulatoryscheme for each class. Class III gaming--the type withwhich we are here concerned--is defined as "all forms ofgaming that are not class I gaming or class II gaming,"$ 2703(8), and includes such things as slot machines, casinogames, banking card games, dog racing, and lotteries.1 It isthe most heavily regulated of the three classes. The Actprovides that class III gaming is lawful only where it is: (1)authorized by an ordinance or resolution that (a) is adoptedby the governing body of the Indian tribe, (b) satisfies certain statutorily prescribed requirements, and (c) is approvedby the National Indian Gaming Commission; (2) located ina State that permits such gaming for any purpose by anyperson, organization, or entity; and (3) "conducted in conformance with a Tribal-State compact entered into by the1 Class I gaming "means social games solely for prizes of minimal valueor traditional forms of Indian gaming engaged in by individuals as a partof, or in connection with, tribal ceremonies or celebrations," 25 U. S. C.$ 2703(6), and is left by the Act to "the exclusive jurisdiction of the Indiantribes," $ 2710(a)(1).Class II gaming is more extensively defined to include bingo, gamessimilar to bingo, nonbanking card games not illegal under the laws of theState, and card games actually operated in particular States prior to thepassage of the Act. See $ 2703(7). Banking card games, electronic gamesof chance, and slot machines are expressly excluded from the scope of classII gaming. $ 2703(B). The Act allows class II gaming where the State"permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization or entity," and the "governing body of the Indian tribe adopts an ordinance orresolution which is approved by the Chairman" of the National IndianGaming Commission. $ 2710(b)(1). Regulation of class II gaming contemplates a federal role, but places primary emphasis on tribal selfregulation. See $$ 2710(c)(3)-(6).517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT49Cite as: 517 U.

More significant for our purposes,however, is that $ 2710(d)(3) describes the process by whicha State and an Indian tribe begin negotiations toward aTribal-State compact:"(A) Any Indian tribe having jurisdiction over the In-dian lands upon which a class III gaming activity isbeing conducted, or is to be conducted, shall request theState in which such lands are located to enter into negotiations for the purpose of entering into a Tribal-Statecompact governing the conduct of gaming activities.Upon receiving such a request, the State shall negotiatewith the Indian tribe in good faith to enter into sucha compact."The State's obligation to "negotiate with the Indian tribein good faith" is made judicially enforceable by $$ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) and (B)(i):"(A) The United States district courts shall have ju-risdiction over--"(i) any cause of action initiated by an Indian tribearising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations with the Indian tribe for the purpose of enteringinto a Tribal-State compact under paragraph (3) or toconduct such negotiations in good faith . . . ."(B)(i) An Indian tribe may initiate a cause of actiondescribed in subparagraph (A)(i) only after the close ofthe 180-day period beginning on the date on which the517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT50 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the CourtIndian tribe requested the State to enter into negotia-tions under paragraph (3)(A)."Sections 2710(d)(7)(B)(ii)-(vii) describe an elaborate remedialscheme designed to ensure the formation of a Tribal-Statecompact. A tribe that brings an action under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) must show that no Tribal-State compact has beenentered and that the State failed to respond in good faith tothe tribe's request to negotiate; at that point, the burdenthen shifts to the State to prove that it did in fact negotiatein good faith. $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(ii). If the district court concludes that the State has failed to negotiate in good faithtoward the formation of a Tribal-State compact, then it"shall order the State and Indian Tribe to conclude such acompact within a 60-day period." $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(iii). If nocompact has been concluded 60 days after the court's order,then "the Indian tribe and the State shall each submit to amediator appointed by the court a proposed compact thatrepresents their last best offer for a compact." $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(iv). The mediator chooses from between the two pro-posed compacts the one "which best comports with the termsof [the Act] and any other applicable Federal law and withthe findings and order of the court," ibid., and submits it tothe State and the Indian tribe, $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(v). If theState consents to the proposed compact within 60 days of itssubmission by the mediator, then the proposed compact is"treated as a Tribal-State compact entered into under paragraph (3)." $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(vi). If, however, the State doesnot consent within that 60-day period, then the Act providesthat the mediator "shall notify the Secretary [of the Inte-rior]" and that the Secretary "shall prescribe . . . procedures. . . under which class III gaming may be conducted on theIndian lands over which the Indian tribe has jurisdiction."$ 2710(d)(7)(B)(vii).22 Sections 2710(d)(7)(B)(ii)-(vii) provide in full:"(ii) In any action described in subparagraph (A)(i), upon the introduction of evidence by an Indian tribe that--517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT51Cite as: 517 U.

Petitioner's Complaint || 24, see App. 18. Respondents movedto dismiss the complaint, arguing that the suit violated theState's sovereign immunity from suit in federal court. TheDistrict Court denied respondents' motion, 801 F. Supp. 655(SD Fla. 1992), and respondents took an interlocutory appealof that decision. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and SewerAuthority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993) (collateral order doctrine allows immediate appellate review oforder denying claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity).The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversedthe decision of the District Court, holding that the EleventhAmendment barred petitioner's suit against respondents.311 F. 3d 1016 (1994). The court agreed with the DistrictCourt that Congress in $ 2710(d)(7) intended to abrogate theStates' sovereign immunity, and also agreed that the Act hadbeen passed pursuant to Congress' power under the IndianCommerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3.

Although the District Court in that case had granted the defendants' motions to dismiss, the legal issues presented by the two appealswere virtually identical. See Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Alabama,776 F. Supp. 550 (SD Ala. 1991) (Eleventh Amendment bars suit againstState), and 784 F. Supp. 1549 (SD Ala. 1992) (Eleventh Amendment barssuit against Governor).517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT53Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)Opinion of the CourtCommerce Clause grants Congress the power to abrogate aState's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, and concluded therefore that it had no jurisdiction over petitioner'ssuit against Florida. The court further held that Ex parteYoung, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), does not permit an Indian tribeto force good-faith negotiations by suing the Governor of aState. Finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction,the Eleventh Circuit remanded to the District Court withdirections to dismiss petitioner's suit.4Petitioner sought our review of the Eleventh Circuit'sdecision,5 and we granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 1125 (1995),in order to consider two questions: (1) Does the EleventhAmendment prevent Congress from authorizing suits by Indian tribes against States for prospective injunctive relief toenforce legislation enacted pursuant to the Indian CommerceClause?; and (2) Does the doctrine of Ex parte Young permitsuits against a State's Governor for prospective injunctiverelief to enforce the good-faith bargaining requirement of theAct? We answer the first question in the affirmative, thesecond in the negative, and we therefore affirm the EleventhCircuit's dismissal of petitioner's suit.64 Following its conclusion that petitioner's suit should be dismissed, theCourt of Appeals went on to consider how $ 2710(d)(7) would operate inthe wake of its decision. The court decided that those provisions of$ 2710(d)(7) that were problematic could be severed from the rest of thesection, and read the surviving provisions of $ 2710(d)(7) to provide anIndian tribe with immediate recourse to the Secretary of the Interior fromthe dismissal of a suit against a State. 11 F. 3d 1016, 1029 (1994).5 Respondents filed a cross-petition, No. 94-219, challenging only theEleventh Circuit's modification of $ 2710(d)(7), see n. 4, supra. That petition is still pending.6 While the appeal was pending before the Eleventh Circuit, the DistrictCourt granted respondents' earlier filed summary judgment motion, finding that Florida had fulfilled its obligation under the Act to negotiate ingood faith. The Eleventh Circuit has stayed its review of that decisionpending the disposition of this case.517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT54 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v.

Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U. S. 775, 779 (1991). That presupposition, first ob-served over a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.

Any conceivable doubt as to theidentity of the defendant in an action under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i)is dispelled when one looks to the various provisions of$ 2710(d)(7)(B), which describe the remedial scheme availableto a tribe that files suit under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i). Section2710(d)(7)(B)(ii)(II) provides that if a suing tribe meets itsburden of proof, then the "burden of proof shall be upon theState . . ."; $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(iii) states that if the court "findsthat the State has failed to negotiate in good faith . . . , thecourt shall order the State . . ."; $ 2710(d)(7)(B)(iv) providesthat "the State shall . . . submit to a mediator appointedby the court" and subsection (B)(v) of $ 2710(d)(7) states thatthe mediator "shall submit to the State." Sections 2710(d)(7)(B)(vi) and (vii) also refer to the "State" in a context thatmakes it clear that the State is the defendant to the suitbrought by an Indian tribe under $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i). In sum,we think that the numerous references to the "State" in thetext of $ 2710(d)(7)(B) make it indubitable that Congress in-tended through the Act to abrogate the States' sovereignimmunity from suit.9 BHaving concluded that Congress clearly intended to abro-gate the States' sovereign immunity through $ 2710(d)(7), we9 Justice Souter, in his dissenting opinion, argues that in order toavoid a constitutional question, we should interpret the Act to provideonly a suit against state officials rather than a suit against the State itself.Post, at 182. But in light of the plain text of $ 2710(d)(7)(B), we disagreewith the dissent's assertion that the Act can reasonably be read in thatway. "We cannot press statutory construction `to the point of disingenuous evasion' even to avoid a constitutional question." See United Statesv. Locke, 471 U.

FLORIDAOpinion of the Courtturn now to consider whether the Act was passed "pursuantto a valid exercise of power."Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S.,at 68. Before we address that question here, however, wethink it necessary first to define the scope of our inquiry.Petitioner suggests that one consideration weighing infavor of finding the power to abrogate here is that the Actauthorizes only prospective injunctive relief rather than retroactive monetary relief. But we have often made it clearthat the relief sought by a plaintiff suing a State is irrelevantto the question whether the suit is barred by the EleventhAmendment. See,e. g., Cory v. White, 457 U. S. 85, 90 (1982)("It would be a novel proposition indeed that the EleventhAmendment does not bar a suit to enjoin the State itselfsimply because no money judgment is sought"). We thinkit follows a fortiori from this proposition that the type ofrelief sought is irrelevant to whether Congress has power toabrogate States' immunity. The Eleventh Amendment doesnot exist solely in order to "preven[t] federal-court judgments that must be paid out of a State's treasury," Hess v.Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 48(1994); it also serves to avoid "the indignity of subjecting aState to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties," Puerto Rico Aqueduct and SewerAuthor i ty, 506 U. S., at 146 ( internal quotation marksomitted).Similarly, petitioner argues that the abrogation power isvalidly exercised here because the Act grants the States apower that they would not otherwise have, viz., some measure of authority over gaming on Indian lands. It is trueenough that the Act extends to the States a power withheldfrom them by the Constitution. See California v. CabazonBand of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987). Nevertheless, we do not see how that consideration is relevant to thequestion whether Congress may abrogate state sovereignimmunity. The Eleventh Amendment immunity may not belifted by Congress unilaterally deciding that it will be re517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT59Cite as: 517 U.

S., at 246-247 ("[T]he mere receipt of federal fundscannot establish that a State has consented to suit in fed-eral court").Thus our inquiry into whether Congress has the powerto abrogate unilaterally the States' immunity from suit isnarrowly focused on one question: Was the Act in questionpassed pursuant to a constitutional provision grantingCongress the power to abrogate? See,e. g., Fitzpatrick v.Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 452-456 (1976). Previously, in conduct-ing that inquiry, we have found authority to abrogate underonly two provisions of the Constitution. In Fitzpatrick, werecognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expandingfederal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal powerstruck by the Constitution. Id., at 455. We noted that $ 1of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the States and that $ 5 of the Amendmentexpressly provided that "The Congress shall have power toenforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of thisarticle." See id., at 453 (internal quotation marks omitted).We held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federalpower extended to intrude upon the province of the EleventhAmendment and therefore that $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the immunity from suitguaranteed by that Amendment.In only one other case has congressional abrogation of theStates' Eleventh Amendment immunity been upheld. InPennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), a plurality of the Court found that the Interstate Commerce Clause,Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3, granted Congress the power to abrogatestate sovereign immunity, stating that the power to regulateinterstate commerce would be "incomplete without the authority to render States liable in damages." 491 U. S., at19-20. Justice White added the fifth vote necessary to theresult in that case, but wrote separately in order to express517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT60 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Courtthat he "[did] not agree with much of [the plurality's] reason-ing."Id., at 57 (opinion concurring in judgment in part anddissenting in part).In arguing that Congress through the Act abrogated theStates' sovereign immunity, petitioner does not challenge theEleventh Circuit's conclusion that the Act was passed pursu-ant to neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the InterstateCommerce Clause. Instead, accepting the lower court's con-clusion that the Act was passed pursuant to Congress' powerunder the Indian Commerce Clause, petitioner now asks usto consider whether that Clause grants Congress the powerto abrogate the States' sovereign immunity.Petitioner begins with the plurality decision in Union Gasand contends that "[t]here is no principled basis for findingthat congressional power under the Indian Commerce Clauseis less than that conferred by the Interstate CommerceClause." Brief for Petitioner 17. Noting that the UnionGas plurality found the power to abrogate from the "plenary" character of the grant of authority over interstatecommerce, petitioner emphasizes that the Interstate Commerce Clause leaves the States with some power to regulate,see, e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186(1994), whereas the Indian Commerce Clause makes "Indianrelations . . . the exclusive province of federal law." Countyof Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226,234 (1985). Contending that the Indian Commerce Clausevests the Federal Government with "the duty of protect[ing]" the tribes from "local ill feeling" and "the people ofthe States," United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 383-384(1886), petitioner argues that the abrogation power is necessary "to protect the tribes from state action denying federally guaranteed rights." Brief for Petitioner 20.Respondents dispute petitioner's analogy between the Indian Commerce Clause and the Interstate Commerce Clause.They note that we have recognized that "the InterstateCommerce and Indian Commerce Clauses have very differ517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT61Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)Opinion of the Courtent applications," Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico,490 U. S. 163, 192 (1989), and from that they argue that thetwo provisions are "wholly dissimilar." Brief for Respondents 21. Respondents contend that the Interstate Commerce Clause grants the power of abrogation only becauseCongress' authority to regulate interstate commerce wouldbe "incomplete" without that "necessary" power. Id., at 23,citing Union Gas, supra, at 19-20. The Indian CommerceClause is distinguishable, respondents contend, because itgives Congress complete authority over the Indian tribes.Therefore, the abrogation power is not "necessary" to Congress' exercise of its power under the Indian CommerceClause.10Both parties make their arguments from the plurality decision in Union Gas, and we, too, begin there. We think itclear that Justice Brennan's opinion finds Congress' power toabrogate under the Interstate Commerce Clause from theStates' cession of their sovereignty when they gave Congress plenary power to regulate interstate commerce. SeeUnion Gas, 491 U. S., at 17 ("The important point . . . isthat the provision both expands federal power and contractsstate power"). Respondents' focus elsewhere is misplaced.While the plurality decision states that Congress' powerunder the Interstate Commerce Clause would be incompletewithout the power to abrogate, that statement is made solelyin order to emphasize the broad scope of Congress' authorityover interstate commerce. Id., at 19-20. Moreover, respondents' rationale would mean that where Congress has10 Respondents also contend that the Act mandates state regulation ofIndian gaming and therefore violates the Tenth Amendment by allowingfederal officials to avoid political accountability for those actions for whichthey are in fact responsible. See New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144(1992). This argument was not considered below by either the EleventhCircuit or the District Court, and is not fairly within the question presented. Therefore we do not consider it here. See this Court's Rule 14.1;Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S. 519 (1992).517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT62 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Courtless authority, and the States have more, Congress' meansfor exercising that power must be greater. We read the plurality opinion to provide just the opposite. Indeed, it wasin those circumstances where Congress exercised completeauthority that Justice Brennan thought the power to abrogate most necessary. Id., at 20 ("Since the States may notlegislate at all in [the aforementioned] situations, a conclusion that Congress may not create a cause of action formoney damages against the States would mean that no onecould do so. And in many situations, it is only money dam-ages that will carry out Congress' legitimate objectivesunder the Commerce Clause").Following the rationale of the Union Gas plurality, ourinquiry is limited to determining whether the Indian Commerce Clause, like the Interstate Commerce Clause, is agrant of authority to the Federal Government at the expenseof the States. The answer to that question is obvious. Ifanything, the Indian Commerce Clause accomplishes agreater transfer of power from the States to the FederalGovernment than does the Interstate Commerce Clause.This is clear enough from the fact that the States still exercise some authority over interstate trade but have been divested of virtually all authority over Indian commerce andIndian tribes. Under the rationale of Union Gas, if theStates' partial cession of authority over a particular areaincludes cession of the immunity from suit, then their virtually total cession of authority over a different area must alsoinclude cession of the immunity from suit. See id., at 42(Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor andKennedy, JJ., dissenting) ("[I]f the Article I commercepower enables abrogation of state sovereign immunity, so doall the other Article I powers"); see Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma v. Oklahoma, 37 F. 3d 1422, 1428 (CA10 1994) (IndianCommerce Clause grants power to abrogate), cert. pending,No. 94-1029; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe v. South Dakota,3 F. 3d 273, 281 (CA8 1993) (same); cf. Chavez v. Arte Publico517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT63Cite as: 517 U.

We agree with petitionerthat the plurality opinion inUnion Gas allows no principleddistinction in favor of the States to be drawn between theIndian Commerce Clause and the Interstate CommerceClause.Respondents argue, however, that we need not concludethat the Indian Commerce Clause grants the power to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity. Instead, they contendthat if we find the rationale of theUnion Gas plurality toextend to the Indian Commerce Clause, then "Union Gasshould be reconsidered and overruled." Brief for Respondents 25. Generally, the principle of stare decisis, and theinterests that it serves, viz., "the evenhanded, predictable,and consistent development of legal principles, . . . relianceon judicial decisions, and . . . the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process," Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S.808, 827 (1991), counsel strongly against reconsideration ofour precedent. Nevertheless, we always have treated staredecisis as a "principle of policy," Helvering v. Hallock, 309U. S. 106, 119 (1940), and not as an "inexorable command,"Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. "[W]hen governing decisions areunworkable or are badly reasoned, `this Court has never feltconstrained to follow precedent.' " Id., at 827 (quotingSmith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944)). Our willingness to reconsider our earlier decisions has been "particularly true in constitutional cases, because in such cases `correction through legislative action is practically impossible.' "Payne, supra, at 828 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & GasCo., 285 U. S. 393, 407 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).The Court in Union Gas reached a result without an expressed rationale agreed upon by a majority of the Court.We have already seen that Justice Brennan's opinion received the support of only three other Justices. See UnionGas, 491 U. S., at 5 (Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ.,517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT64 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Courtjoined Justice Brennan). Of the other five, Justice White,who provided the fifth vote for the result, wrote separatelyin order to indicate his disagreement with the plurality'srationale,id., at 57 (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part), and four Justices joined together in a dissentthat rejected the plurality's rationale, id., at 35-45 (Scalia,J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O'Connor andKennedy, JJ.). Since it was issued, Union Gas has createdconfusion among the lower courts that have sought to understand and apply the deeply fractured decision. See, e. g.,Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, supra, at 543-545 ("JusticeWhite's concurrence must be taken on its face to disavow"the plurality's theory); 11 F. 3d, at 1027 (Justice White's"vague concurrence renders the continuing validity of UnionGas in doubt").The plurality's rationale also deviated sharply from our established federalism jurisprudence and essentially eviscerated our decision in Hans. See Union Gas, supra, at 36 ("IfHans means only that federal-question suits for money damages against the States cannot be brought in federal courtunless Congress clearly says so, it means nothing at all")(Scalia, J., dissenting). It was well established in 1989when Union Gas was decided that the Eleventh Amendmentstood for the constitutional principle that state sovereign immunity limited the federal courts' jurisdiction under ArticleIII. The text of the Amendment itself is clear enough onthis point: "The Judicial power of the United States shall notbe construed to extend to any suit . . . ." And our decisionssince Hans had been equally clear that the Eleventh Amendment reflects "the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity [that] limits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III,"Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465U. S. 89, 97-98 (1984); see Union Gas, supra, at 38 (" `[T]heentire judicial power granted by the Constitution does notembrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given . . .

S. 490, 497(1921)); see also cases cited at n. 7,supra. As the dissent inUnion Gas recognized, the plurality's conclusion--that Con-gress could under Article I expand the scope of the federalcourts' jurisdiction under Article III--"contradict[ed] ourunvarying approach to Article III as setting forth theexclusive catalog of permissible federal-court jurisdiction."Union Gas, supra, at 39.Never before the decision inUnion Gas had we suggestedthat the bounds of Article III could be expanded by Congressoperating pursuant to any constitutional provision other thanthe Fourteenth Amendment. Indeed, it had seemed fundamental that Congress could not expand the jurisdiction ofthe federal courts beyond the bounds of Article III. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803). The plurality's citation of prior decisions for support was based upon what webelieve to be a misreading of precedent. See Union Gas,491 U. S., at 40-41 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The pluralityclaimed support for its decision from a case holding the unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that theStates may waive their sovereign immunity, see id., at 14-15(citing Parden v. Terminal Railway of Ala. Docks Dept., 377U. S. 184 (1964)), and cited as precedent propositions that hadbeen merely assumed for the sake of argument in earliercases, see 491 U. S., at 15 (citing Welch v. Texas Dept. ofHighways and Public Transp., 483 U. S., at 475-476, andn. 5, and County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y.,470 U. S., at 252).The plurality's extended reliance upon our decision in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), that Congress couldunder the Fourteenth Amendment abrogate the States'sovereign immunity was also, we believe, misplaced. Fitzpatrick was based upon a rationale wholly inapplicable tothe Interstate Commerce Clause, viz., that the FourteenthAmendment, adopted well after the adoption of the EleventhAmendment and the ratification of the Constitution, oper517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT66 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Courtated to alter the pre-existing balance between state and fed-eral power achieved by Article III and the Eleventh Amendment. Id., at 454. As the dissent in Union Gas made clear,Fitzpatrick cannot be read to justify "limitation of the principle embodied in the Eleventh Amendment through appealto antecedent provisions of the Constitution."Union Gas,supra, at 42 (Scalia, J., dissenting).In the five years since it was decided,Union Gas hasproved to be a solitary departure from established law. SeePuerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf &Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993). Reconsidering the decisionin Union Gas, we conclude that none of the policies underly-ingstare decisis require our continuing adherence to its hold-ing. The decision has, since its issuance, been of questionable precedential value, largely because a majority of theCourt expressly disagreed with the rationale of the plurality.See Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994) (the"degree of confusion following a splintered decision . . . isitself a reason for reexamining that decision"). The case in-volved the interpretation of the Constitution and thereforemay be altered only by constitutional amendment or revisionby this Court. Finally, both the result inUnion Gas andthe plurality's rationale depart from our established understanding of the Eleventh Amendment and undermine theaccepted function of Article III. We feel bound to concludethat Union Gas was wrongly decided and that it should be,and now is, overruled.The dissent makes no effort to defend the decision inUnion Gas, see post, at 100, but nonetheless would find con-gressional power to abrogate in this case.11 Contending thatour decision is a novel extension of the Eleventh Amend-ment, the dissent chides us for "attend[ing]" to dicta. Weadhere in this case, however, not to mere obiter dicta, butrather to the well-established rationale upon which the11 Unless otherwise indicated, all references to the dissent are to thedissenting opinion authored by Justice Souter.517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT67Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)Opinion of the CourtCourt based the results of its earlier decisions. When anopinion issues for the Court, it is not only the result but alsothose portions of the opinion necessary to that result bywhich we are bound. Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court ofCal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 613 (1990) (exclusivebasis of a judgment is not dicta) (plurality); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 668 (1989) ("As a general rule,the principle of stare decisis directs us to adhere not only tothe holdings of our prior cases, but also to their explicationsof the governing rules of law") (Kennedy, J., concurring anddissenting); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 490(1986) ("Although technically dicta, . . . an important part ofthe Court's rationale for the result that it reache[s] . . . isentitled to greater weight . . .") (O'Connor, J., concurring).For over a century, we have grounded our decisions in theoft-repeated understanding of state sovereign immunity asan essential part of the Eleventh Amendment. In Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), theCourt held that the Eleventh Amendment barred a suitbrought against a State by a foreign state. Chief JusticeHughes wrote for a unanimous Court:"[N]either the literal sweep of the words of Clause oneof $ 2 of Article III, nor the absence of restriction in theletter of the Eleventh Amendment, permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described inClause one, and omitted from the words of the EleventhAmendment, a State may be sued without her consent.Thus Clause one specifically provides that the judicialPower shall extend `to all Cases, in Law and Equity,arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the UnitedStates, and Treaties made, or which shall be made,under their Authority.' But, although a case may ariseunder the Constitution and laws of the United States,the judicial power does not extend to it if the suit is517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT68 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v.

There is the essential postulate that the controversies, as contemplated,shall be found to be of a justiciable character. Thereis also the postulate that States of the Union, still pos-sessing attributes of sovereignty, shall be immunefrom suits, without their consent, save where there hasbeen a `surrender of this immunity in the plan of theconvention.' " Id., at 321-323 (citations and footnoteomitted).See id., at 329-330; see also Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 98 ("Inshort, the principle of sovereign immunity is a constitutionallimitation on the federal judicial power established in Art.III"); Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 ("[T]he entirejudicial power granted by the Constitution does not embraceauthority to entertain a suit brought by private partiesagainst a State without consent given . . ."). It is true thatwe have not had occasion previously to apply establishedEleventh Amendment principles to the question whetherCongress has the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity (save in Union Gas). But consideration of that ques-tion must proceed with fidelity to this century-old doctrine.The dissent, to the contrary, disregards our case law infavor of a theory cobbled together from law review articlesand its own version of historical events. The dissent citesnot a single decision since Hans (other than Union Gas) thatsupports its view of state sovereign immunity, instead rely-ing upon the now-discredited decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). See, e. g., post, at 152, n. 47. Its un-documented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT69Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)Opinion of the Courtthe decision in Hans is a disservice to the Court's traditionalmethod of adjudication. Seepost, at 120-123.The dissent mischaracterizes the Hans opinion. That de-cision found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental " `jurisprudence inall civilized nations.' " Hans, 134 U. S., at 17, quoting Beersv.Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858); see also The FederalistNo. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (sovereignimmunity "is the general sense and the general practice ofmankind"). The dissent's proposition that the common lawof England, where adopted by the States, was open to changeby the Legislature is wholly unexceptionable and largely beside the point: that common law provided the substantiverules of law rather than jurisdiction. Cf. Monaco, supra, at323 (state sovereign immunity, like the requirement thatthere be a "justiciable" controversy, is a constitutionallygrounded limit on federal jurisdiction). It also is noteworthy that the principle of state sovereign immunity standsdistinct from other principles of the common law in that onlythe former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.Hans--with a much closer vantage point than the dissent--recognized that the decision in Chisholm was contraryto the well-understood meaning of the Constitution. Thedissent's conclusion that the decision in Chisholm was "reasonable," post, at 106, certainly would have struck the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment as quite odd: That decisioncreated "such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted." Monaco, supra,at 325. The dissent's lengthy analysis of the text of theEleventh Amendment is directed at a straw man--we longhave recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is " `to strain the Constitution and the lawto a construction never imagined or dreamed of.' " Monaco,supra, at 326, quoting Hans, supra, at 15. The text dealt interms only with the problem presented by the decision inChisholm; in light of the fact that the federal courts did not517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT70 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Courthave federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amend-ment was passed (and would not have it until 1875), it seemsunlikely that much thought was given to the prospect offederal-question jurisdiction over the States.That same consideration causes the dissent's criticism ofthe views of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton to ring hollow.The dissent cites statements made by those three influentialFramers, the most natural reading of which would precludeall federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.12 Strug-gling against this reading, however, the dissent finds significant the absence of any contention that sovereign immu-nity would affect the new federal-question jurisdiction.Post,at 142-150. But the lack of any statute vesting generalfederal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts until muchlater makes the dissent's demand for greater specificity abouta then-dormant jurisdiction overly exacting.1312 We note here also that the dissent quotes selectively from the Framers' statements that it references. The dissent cites the following, forinstance, as a statement made by Madison: "[T]he Constitution `give[s] acitizen a right to be heard in the federal courts; and if a state shouldcondescend to be a party, this court may take cognizance of it.' " Post, at143 (opinion of Souter, J.). But that statement, perhaps ambiguous whenread in isolation, was preceded by the following: "[J]urisdiction in controversies between a state and citizens of another state is much objectedto, and perhaps without reason. It is not in the power of individuals tocall any state into court. The only operation it can have, is that, if astate should wish to bring a suit against a citizen, it must be broughtbefore the federal courts. It appears to me that this can have no operation but this:" See 3 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 533(2d ed. 1836).13 Although the absence of any discussion dealing with federal-questionjurisdiction is therefore unremarkable, what is notably lacking in theFramers' statements is any mention of Congress' power to abrogate theStates' immunity. The absence of any discussion of that power is particularly striking in light of the fact that the Framers virtually alwayswere very specific about the exception to state sovereign immunity arising from a State's consent to suit. See, e. g., The Federalist No. 81,pp. 487-488 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) ("It is inherent in thenature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual with517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT71Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)Opinion of the CourtIn putting forward a new theory of state sovereign immu-nity, the dissent develops its own vision of the political system created by the Framers, concluding with the statementthat "[t]he Framers' principal objectives in rejecting Englishtheories of unitary sovereignty . . . would have been impededif a new concept of sovereign immunity had taken its placein federal-question cases, and would have been substantiallythwarted if that new immunity had been held untouchableby any congressional effort to abrogate it." 14 Post, at 157.This sweeping statement ignores the fact that the Nationsurvived for nearly two centuries without the question of theexistence of such power ever being presented to this Court.And Congress itself waited nearly a century before even con-ferring federal-question jurisdiction on the lower federalcourts.15out its consent. . . . Unless, therefore, there is a surrender of this immunityin the plan of the convention, it will remain with the States and the dangerintimated must be merely ideal") (emphasis in the original); 3 Elliot,supra, at 533 (J. Madison) ("It is not in the power of individuals to call anystate into court. . . . [The Constitution] can have no operation but this: . . .if a state should condescend to be a party, this court may take cognizanceof it").14 This argument wholly disregards other methods of ensuring theStates' compliance with federal law: The Federal Government can bringsuit in federal court against a State, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143U. S. 621, 644-645 (1892) (finding such power necessary to the "permanence of the Union"); an individual can bring suit against a state officer inorder to ensure that the officer's conduct is in compliance with federal law,see, e. g., Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908); and this Court is empowered to review a question of federal law arising from a state-court decisionwhere a State has consented to suit, see, e. g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat.264 (1821).15 Justice Stevens, in his dissenting opinion, makes two points thatmerit separate response. First, he contends that no distinction may bedrawn between state sovereign immunity and the immunity enjoyed bystate and federal officials. But even assuming that the latter has no constitutional foundation, the distinction is clear: The Constitution specificallyrecognizes the States as sovereign entities, while government officialsenjoy no such constitutional recognition. Second, Justice Stevens criti517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT72 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the CourtIn overruling Union Gas today, we reconfirm that thebackground principle of state sovereign immunity embodiedin the Eleventh Amendment is not so ephemeral as to dissi-pate when the subject of the suit is an area, like the regulation of Indian commerce, that is under the exclusive controlof the Federal Government. Even when the Constitutionvests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over a par-ticular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against uncon-senting States.16 The Eleventh Amendment restricts thecizes our prior decisions applying the "clear statement rule," suggestingthat they were based upon an understanding that Article I allowed Congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity. His criticism, however, ignores the fact that many of those cases arose in the context of a statutepassed under the Fourteenth Amendment, where Congress' authority toabrogate is undisputed. See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332 (1979).And a more fundamental flaw of the criticism is its failure to recognizethat both the doctrine requiring avoidance of constitutional questions, andprinciples of federalism, require us always to apply the clear statementrule before we consider the constitutional question whether Congress hasthe power to abrogate.16 Justice Stevens understands our opinion to prohibit federal jurisdiction over suits to enforce the bankruptcy, copyright, and antitrust lawsagainst the States. He notes that federal jurisdiction over those statutory schemes is exclusive, and therefore concludes that there is "no remedy" for state violations of those federal statutes. Post, at 78, n. 1.That conclusion is exaggerated both in its substance and in its significance. First, Justice Stevens' statement is misleadingly overbroad.We have already seen that several avenues remain open for ensuring statecompliance with federal law. See n. 14, supra. Most notably, an individual may obtain injunctive relief under Ex parte Young in order to remedya state officer's ongoing violation of federal law. See n. 14, supra. Second, contrary to the implication of Justice Stevens' conclusion, it has notbeen widely thought that the federal antitrust, bankruptcy, or copyrightstatutes abrogated the States' sovereign immunity. This Court never hasawarded relief against a State under any of those statutory schemes; in thedecision of this Court that Justice Stevens cites (and somehow labels"incompatible" with our decision here), we specifically reserved the question whether the Eleventh Amendment would allow a suit to enforce theantitrust laws against a State. See Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT73Cite as: 517 U.

Petitioner's suit against the State ofFlorida must be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction.IIIPetitioner argues that we may exercise jurisdiction overits suit to enforce $ 2710(d)(3) against the Governor notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment.Petitioner notes that since our decision inEx parte Young,209 U. S. 123 (1908), we often have found federal jurisdictionover a suit against a state official when that suit seeks onlyprospective injunctive relief in order to "end a continuingviolation of federal law." Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S., at68. The situation presented here, however, is sufficientlydifferent from that giving rise to the traditional Ex parteYoung action so as to preclude the availability of thatdoctrine.Here, the "continuing violation of federal law" alleged bypetitioner is the Governor's failure to bring the State intocompliance with $ 2710(d)(3). But the duty to negotiateimposed upon the State by that statutory provision doesnot stand alone. Rather, as we have seen, supra, at 49-50,Congress passed $ 2710(d)(3) in conjunction with the careU. S. 773, 792, n. 22 (1975). Although the copyright and bankruptcy lawshave existed practically since our Nation's inception, and the antitrustlaws have been in force for over a century, there is no established traditionin the lower federal courts of allowing enforcement of those federal statutes against the States. Notably, both Court of Appeals decisions citedby Justice Stevens were issued last year and were based upon UnionGas. See Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, 59 F. 3d 539 (CA5 1995); Matterof Merchants Grain, Inc. v. Mahern, 59 F. 3d 630 (CA7 1995). Indeed,while the Court of Appeals in Chavez allowed the suit against the Stateto go forward, it expressly recognized that its holding was unprecedented.See Chavez, 59 F. 3d, at 546 ("[W]e are aware of no case that specificallyholds that laws passed pursuant to the Copyright Clause can abrogateState immunity").517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT74 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAOpinion of the Courtfully crafted and intricate remedial scheme set forth in$ 2710(d)(7).Where Congress has created a remedial scheme for theenforcement of a particular federal right, we have, in suitsagainst federal officers, refused to supplement that schemewith one created by the judiciary. Schweiker v. Chilicky,487 U. S. 412, 423 (1988) ("When the design of a Governmentprogram suggests that Congress has provided what it consid-ers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration, wehave not created additional . . . remedies"). Here, of course,the question is not whether a remedy should be created, butinstead is whether the Eleventh Amendment bar should belifted, as it was in Ex parte Young, in order to allow a suitagainst a state officer. Nevertheless, we think that thesame general principle applies: Therefore, where Congresshas prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a courtshould hesitate before casting aside those limitations andpermitting an action against a state officer based upon Exparte Young.Here, Congress intended $ 2710(d)(3) to be enforcedagainst the State in an action brought under $ 2710(d)(7); theintricate procedures set forth in that provision show thatCongress intended therein not only to define, but also to limitsignificantly, the duty imposed by $ 2710(d)(3). For example,where the court finds that the State has failed to negotiatein good faith, the only remedy prescribed is an order directing the State and the Indian tribe to conclude a compactwithin 60 days. And if the parties disregard the court'sorder and fail to conclude a compact within the 60-day period, the only sanction is that each party then must submita proposed compact to a mediator who selects the one whichbest embodies the terms of the Act. Finally, if the Statefails to accept the compact selected by the mediator, the onlysanction against it is that the mediator shall notify the Secre517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT75Cite as: 517 U. S. 44 (1996)Opinion of the Courttary of the Interior who then must prescribe regulationsgoverning class III gaming on the tribal lands at issue. Bycontrast with this quite modest set of sanctions, an ac-tion brought against a state official under Ex parte Youngwould expose that official to the full remedial powers of afederal court, including, presumably, contempt sanctions. If$ 2710(d)(3) could be enforced in a suit under Ex parte Young,$ 2710(d)(7) would have been superfluous; it is difficult to seewhy an Indian tribe would suffer through the intricatescheme of $ 2710(d)(7) when more complete and more immediate relief would be available under Ex parte Young.17Here, of course, we have found that Congress does nothave authority under the Constitution to make the State su-able in federal court under $ 2710(d)(7). Nevertheless, thefact that Congress chose to impose upon the State a liability17 Contrary to the claims of the dissent, we do not hold that Congresscannot authorize federal jurisdiction under Ex parte Young over a causeof action with a limited remedial scheme. We find only that Congress didnot intend that result in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Althoughone might argue that the text of $ 2710(d)(7)(A)(i), taken alone, is broadenough to encompass both a suit against a State (under an abrogationtheory) and a suit against a state official (under an Ex parte Young theory), subsection (A)(i) of $ 2710(d)(7) cannot be read in isolation from subsections (B)(ii)-(vii), which repeatedly refer exclusively to "the State."See supra, at 56-57. In this regard, $ 2710(d)(7) stands in contrast to thestatutes cited by the dissent as examples where lower courts have foundthat Congress implicitly authorized suit under Ex parte Young. Compare28 U. S. C. $ 2254(e) (federal court authorized to issue an "order directedto an appropriate State official"); 42 U. S. C. $ 11001 (1988 ed.) (requiring"the Governor" of a State to perform certain actions and holding "theGovernor" responsible for nonperformance); 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(a) (authorizing a suit against "any person" who is alleged to be in violation of relevantwater pollution laws). Similarly the duty imposed by the Act--to "negotiate . . . in good faith to enter into" a compact with another sovereign--stands distinct in that it is not of the sort likely to be performed by anindividual state executive officer or even a group of officers. Cf. State exrel. Stephan v. Finney, 836 P. 2d 1169, 251 Kan. 559 (1992) (Governor ofKansas may negotiate but may not enter into compact without grant ofpower from legislature).517us1$37H 02-23-99 16:36:05 PAGES OPINPGT76 SEMINOLE TRIBE OF FLA. v. FLORIDAStevens, J., dissentingthat is significantly more limited than would be the liabilityimposed upon the state officer under Ex parte Youngstrongly indicates that Congress had no wish to create thelatter under $ 2710(d)(3). Nor are we free to rewrite thestatutory scheme in order to approximate what we thinkCongress might have wanted had it known that $ 2710(d)(7)was beyond its authority. If that effort is to be made, itshould be made by Congress, and not by the federal courts.We hold that Ex parte Young is inapplicable to petitioner'ssuit against the Governor of Florida, and therefore that suitis barred by the Eleventh Amendment and must be dis-missed for a lack of jurisdiction.IVThe Eleventh Amendment prohibits Congress from mak-ing the State of Florida capable of being sued in federalcourt. The narrow exception to the Eleventh Amendmentprovided by the Ex parte Young doctrine cannot be usedto enforce $ 2710(d)(3) because Congress enacted a remedialscheme, $ 2710(d)(7), specifically designed for the enforcement of that right. The Eleventh Circuit's dismissal ofpetitioner's suit is hereby affirmed.18
