When an alien is found ineligible to remain in the UnitedStates, the process for selecting the country to which he willbe removed is prescribed by 8 U. S. C. $ 1231(b)(2). Thequestion in this case is whether this provision prohibits removing an alien to a country without the explicit, advanceconsent of that country's government.IPetitioner Keyse Jama was born in Somalia and remains acitizen of that nation. He was admitted to the United Statesas a refugee, but his refugee status was terminated in 2000by reason of a criminal conviction. SeeJama v. INS, 329F. 3d 630, 631 (CA8 2003). The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) brought an action to remove petitionerfrom the United States for having committed a crimeinvolving moral turpitude. Ibid.; see 8 U. S.

In the administrative hearing,petitioner conceded that he was subject to removal, al-though he sought various forms of relief from that determination (adjustment of status, withholding of removal, andasylum relief under the United Nations Convention AgainstTorture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatmentor Punishment).

The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed that determination, and petitioner did not seek review in the Court of Appeals.Instead, petitioner instituted collateral proceedings underthe habeas statute, 28 U.

He filed his petition inthe United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, alleging that Somalia has no functioning government,that Somalia therefore could not consent in advance to hisremoval, and that the Government was barred from removing him to Somalia absent such advance consent. The District Court agreed that petitioner could not be removed to acountry that had not consented in advance to receive him,Jama v. INS, Civ.

Immigration and Nationality Act, $ 241(b)(2), as added by the Illegal Immigra-tion Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996(IIRIRA), $ 305(a)(3), 110 Stat. 3009-600.The statute thus provides four consecutive removal com-mands: (1) An alien shall be removed to the country of hischoice (subparagraphs (A) to (C)), unless one of the condi-tions eliminating that command is satisfied; (2) otherwise heshall be removed to the country of which he is a citizen (sub-paragraph (D)), unless one of the conditions eliminating thatcommand is satisfied; (3) otherwise he shall be removed toone of the countries with which he has a lesser connection(clauses (i) to (vi) of subparagraph (E)); or (4) if that is "im-practicable, inadvisable, or impossible," he shall be removedto "another country whose government will accept the alieninto that country" (clause (vii) of subparagraph (E)). Petitioner declined to designate a country of choice, so the firststep was inapplicable. Petitioner is a citizen of Somalia,which has not informed the Attorney General of its willing-ness to receive him (clause (i) of subparagraph (D)), so theAttorney General was not obliged to remove petitioner toSomalia under the second step. The question is whether theAttorney General was precluded from removing petitionerto Somalia under the third step (clause (iv) of subparagraph(E)) because Somalia had not given its consent.AWe do not lightly assume that Congress has omitted fromits adopted text requirements that it nonetheless intends toapply, and our reluctance is even greater when Congress hasshown elsewhere in the same statute that it knows how tomake such a requirement manifest. In all of subparagraph(E), an acceptance requirement appears only in the terminalclause (vii), a clause that the Attorney General may invokeonly after he finds that the removal options presented in the543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG342 JAMA v. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENTOpinion of the Courtother six are "impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible."Clauses (i) through (vi) come first--in the statute and in theprocess of selecting a country. And those six clauses containnot a word about acceptance by the destination country; theymerely direct that "the Attorney General shall remove thealien" to any one of them.Effects are attached to nonacceptance throughout the restof paragraph (2), making the failure to specify any such effectin most of subparagraph (E) conspicuous--and more likelyintentional. Subparagraph (C) prescribes the consequenceof nonacceptance in the first step of the selection process;subparagraph (D) does the same for the second step; andclause (vii) of subparagraph (E) does the same for the fourthstep.2 With respect to the third step, however, the Attorney General is directed to move on to the fourth step only ifit is "impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to remove thealien to each country described in" the third step. Non-acceptance may surely be one of the factors considered indetermining whether removal to a given country is imprac-ticable or inadvisable, but the statute does not give it thedispositive effect petitioner wishes.Petitioner seizes upon the word "another" in clause (vii)as a means of importing the acceptance requirement intoclauses (i) through (vi). He argues that if the last resortcountry is "another country whose government will acceptthe alien," then the countries enumerated in clauses (i)through (vi) must also be "countries whose governmentswill accept the alien." That stretches the modifier too far.2 The dissent contends that there are only three steps, with all of subparagraph (E) constituting only a single step, and that clause (vii)'s acceptancerequirement therefore covers the entire subparagraph. Post, at 353, n. 2(opinion of Souter, J.). We think not. Clause (vii) applies only after theoptions set out in the third step are exhausted; it is nothing if not a discrete, further step in the process. That step four is a separate clauserather than a separate subparagraph is immaterial: Step one, which isindisputably set out in three subparagraphs, belies the dissent's theorythat steps must precisely parallel subparagraphs.543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG343Cite as: 543 U.

Barnhart v.Thomas, 540 U. S. 20, 26 (2003). There, a statute referredfirst to a claimant's "previous work" and then to "any otherkind of substantial gainful work which exists in the nationaleconomy"; under the rule of the last antecedent, we declinedto read the limiting clause "which exists in the national economy" into the term "previous work." Id., at 26-28 (empha-sis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted); accord,FTCv. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U. S. 385, 389-390 (1959). Wethus did not treat "any other" as the "apparently connectingmodifier" that the dissent here thinks "another" to be, post,at 355.33 Indeed, both "other" and "another" are just as likely to be words ofdifferentiation as they are to be words of connection. Here the word"another" serves simply to rule out the countries already tried at thethird step and referred to in the conditional prologue of clause (vii)("If impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible to remove the alien to eachcountry described in a previous clause of this subparagraph, anothercountry . . . "). It is the fact of that close earlier reference that makes itnatural to say "another country" here, whereas "[a] country" is used atthe outset of $ 1231(b)(1)(C)(iv), in which the reference to "each countrydescribed in a previous clause of this subparagraph" comes later and hencecannot serve as an antecedent for "another." The dissent makes a mountain of this molehill, see post, at 356-357.The dissent also finds profound meaning in the fact that Congresschanged the text from "any country" in the 1996 legislation to "anothercountry" in the current version. "The Court cannot be right," it says, "inreducing the 1996 amendment to this level of whimsy." Post, at 358. Butif one lays the pre-1996 version of the statute beside the current version,he will find numerous changes that are attributable to nothing more thanstylistic preference. To take merely one example: Clause (E)(ii) of thecurrent law, which reads "The country in which is located the foreign portfrom which the alien left for the United States or for a foreign territorycontiguous to the United States," previously read "the country in whichis located the foreign port at which such alien embarked for the United543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG344 JAMA v. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENTOpinion of the CourtNor does the structure of subparagraph (E) refute the inference derived from the last antecedent rule. Each clauseis distinct and ends with a period, strongly suggesting thateach may be understood completely without reading any further.4 And as we have already noted, it is not necessary toturn to the acceptance language of clause (vii) to find theconditions under which the Attorney General is to abandonthe third step and move to the fourth, the last resort optionof any willing country. The Attorney General must do so ifin his judgment it would be "impracticable, inadvisable, orimpossible to remove the alien to each country described in"clauses (i) to (vi). This allows the Attorney General to takeboth practical and geopolitical concerns into account whenselecting a destination country (and accords with the similarflexibility to pass over inappropriate countries that the statute gives the Attorney General at the other steps, see infra,at 348). Petitioner's reading would abridge that exercise ofexecutive judgment, effectively deeming the removal of analien to any country to be per se "impracticable, inadvisable,or impossible" absent that country's advance acceptance,even though in many cases--such as this one--it is nothingof the sort. (Removing an alien to Somalia apparently involves no more than putting the alien on one of the regularlyStates or for foreign contiguous territory." 8 U. S. C. $ 1253(a)(2) (1994ed.). The dissent must explain why these changes were insignificantwhereas the change from "any country" to "another country" was a momentous limitation upon executive authority.4 By contrast, in the cases on which the dissent relies to rebut the lastantecedent inference, see post, at 354-356, the structure cut the other way:The modifying clause appeared not in a structurally discrete statutoryprovision, but at the end of a single, integrated list--for example, " `receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce.'

We do not disputethat a word is known by its fellows, but here the structure refutes thepremise of fellowship.543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG345Cite as: 543 U.

Even without advanceconsultation, a country with a functioning government maywell accept a removed alien when he is presented at the border or a port of entry; the absence of advance consent ishardly synonymous with impracticability or impossibility.5BPetitioner contends that even if no acceptance requirementis explicit in the text, one is manifest in the entire structureof $ 1231(b)(2). The Attorney General may not remove analien to a country under subparagraph (A) or (D) withoutthat country's consent, petitioner reasons, so he must bebarred from circumventing that limitation by removing thesame alien to the same country under subparagraph (E).The dissent rests its argument only on the existence of anacceptance requirement in step two (subparagraph (D)) andnot in step one (subparagraphs (A) through (C)).65 The Government argued below that even if clauses (i) through (vi) ofsubparagraph (E) require some form of consent, the destination country's acceptance of the alien at the port of entry suffices.

IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENTOpinion of the CourtWe note initially a point that applies to both petitioner'sand the dissent's positions: The "circumvention" argumentrequires that the country the Attorney General selects atstep three--here, the country of birth under clause (iv)--alsobe the country of citizenship that was disqualified at steptwo for failure to accept the alien. That will sometimes betrue, yet the reason step three exists at all is that it will notalways be true. (Indeed, in petitioner's case, several of theclauses of subparagraph (E) describe Kenya, not Somalia.)Despite this imperfect overlap, petitioner and the dissentseek to impose an acceptance requirement onall removalsunder step three, in the name of preventing the AttorneyGeneral from "circumventing" step two in the cases where astep-three country is also the country of citizenship.The more fundamental defect in petitioner's argument,which appeals to a presumed uniformity of acceptance requirement throughout $ 1231(b)(2), is that its premise is false.It is simply not true that the Attorney General may notremove an alien to a country under subparagraph (A) or(D) without that country's consent. Subparagraph (C)specifies that the Attorney General "may disregard" thealien's subparagraph (A) designation if the designated country's government proves unwilling to accept the alien or failsto respond within 30 days. The word "may" customarilyconnotes discretion. See, e. g., Haig v. Agee, 453 U. S. 280,294, n. 26 (1981). That connotation is particularly aptwhere, as here, "may" is used in contraposition to the word"shall": The Attorney General "shall remove" an alien to thedesignated country, except that the Attorney General "may"disregard the designation if any one of four potentially countervailing circumstances arises. And examining those fourcircumstances reinforces the inappropriateness of reading"may" to mean "shall" in subparagraph (C): Would Congressreally have wanted to preclude the Attorney General fromremoving an alien to his country of choice, merely becausethat country took 31 days rather than 30 to manifest its ac543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG347Cite as: 543 U. S. 335 (2005)Opinion of the Courtceptance? (Subparagraph (C), unlike subparagraph (D), offers no "reasonable time" exception to the 30-day rule.)Petitioner insists that a lack of advance acceptance is an absolute bar to removal, but offers no plausible way of squaringthat insistence with the text of subparagraph (C).7Nor does the existence of an acceptance requirement atthe fourth and final step create any structural inference thatsuch a requirement must exist at the third. It would be astretch to conclude that merely because Congress expresslydirected the Attorney General to obtain consent when removing an alien to a country with which the alien lacks theties of citizenship, nativity, previous presence, and so on,Congress must also have implicitly required him to obtainadvance acceptance from countries with which the alien doeshave such ties. Moreover, if the Attorney General is unableto secure an alien's removal at the third step, all that is leftis the last resort provision allowing removal to a countrywith which the alien has little or no connection--if a countrycan be found that will take him. If none exists, the alien isleft in the same removable-but-unremovable limbo as thealiens in Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U. S. 678 (2001), and Clarkv. Martinez, post, p. 371, and under the rule announced inthose cases must presumptively be released into American7 The same incompatibility may exist with regard to subparagraph (D),which prescribes that the Attorney General "shall remove the alien" tohis country of citizenship "unless" that country's government declines toaccept the alien or fails to manifest its acceptance within a reasonabletime. The Government urges that the two exceptions preserve discretionfor the Attorney General: If one of those conditions exists, the AttorneyGeneral is no longer required to remove the alien to that country, but hemay still do so. We need not resolve whether subparagraph (D) affordsthis residual level of discretion; subparagraph (C) is more than enough todemonstrate that an acceptance requirement does not pervade the selection process in the way petitioner claims, and other factors suffice to refutethe dissent's more limited contention. Rejection of the Government's argument is essential, however, to the dissent's position, see post, at 365-368--and the proper resolution is far from clear.543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG348 JAMA v.

If this is the result that obtainswhen the country-selection process fails, there is every reason to refrain from reading restrictions into that process thatdo not clearly appear--particularly restrictions upon thethird step, which will often afford the Attorney General hislast realistic option for removal.To infer an absolute rule of acceptance where Congresshas not clearly set it forth would run counter to our customary policy of deference to the President in matters of foreignaffairs. Removal decisions, including the selection of a removed alien's destination, "may implicate our relations withforeign powers" and require consideration of "changing political and economic circumstances." Mathews v. Diaz, 426U. S. 67, 81 (1976). Congress has already provided a wayfor the Attorney General to avoid removals that are likely toruffle diplomatic feathers, or simply to prove futile. At eachstep in the selection process, he is empowered to skip over acountry that resists accepting the alien, or a country that hasdeclined to provide assurances that its border guards willallow the alien entry.Nor is it necessary to infer an acceptance requirement inorder to ensure that the Attorney General will give appropriate consideration to conditions in the country of removal.If aliens would face persecution or other mistreatment in thecountry designated under $ 1231(b)(2), they have a numberof available remedies: asylum, $ 1158(b)(1); withholding of removal, $ 1231(b)(3)(A); relief under an international agreement prohibiting torture, see 8 CFR $$ 208.16(c)(4), 208.17(a)(2004); and temporary protec ted st atus, 8 U. S. C.$ 1254a(a)(1). These individualized determinations strike abetter balance between securing the removal of inadmissiblealiens and ensuring their humane treatment than does petitioner's suggestion that silence from Mogadishu inevitablyportends future mistreatment and justifies declining to remove anyone to Somalia.543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG349Cite as: 543 U.

"The distinctionwas carefully preserved in Title II" of the Immigration andNationality Act (INA): expelling an alien who had alreadyentered required a deportation proceeding, whereas expelling an alien still seeking admission could be achievedthrough the more summary exclusion proceeding.Ibid.; seeLandon v.

But see id., at 365, and n. 4(opinion of Pettine, J.).In other words, IIRIRA forged the new removal procedure out of two provisions, only one of which had been con-strued as petitioner wishes.11 And even the supposed judicial consensus with respect to that one provision boils downto the decisions of two Courts of Appeals--one of which wasonly a two-sentence per curiam that considered step two,not step three.Rogers, supra, at 471; see n. 9, supra.12 Inthe context of new $ 1231(b)(2), the acceptance requirementis "neither a settled judicial construction nor one which wewould be justified in presuming Congress, by its silence, impliedly approved." United States v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, 55,n. 13 (1964) (citation omitted). Even notwithstanding the11 The dissent's assertion, post, at 361-362, that $ 1231(b)(2) descendssolely from the former deportation provision is, in the relevant respect,erroneous. To be sure, the former exclusion provision has its own exclusive descendant in $ 1231(b)(1), but that applies only to aliens placed inremoval proceedings immediately upon their arrival at the border, see$$ 1231(b)(1)(A), (c)(1), not to formerly excludable aliens who, like petitioner, were paroled or otherwise allowed into the country. Whereas previously some aliens who had been allowed into the country were excludedand some deported, see $$ 1227(a)(1), 1253(a) (1994 ed.), now all are removed and their destination chosen under $ 1231(b)(2), not (b)(1). Section1231(b)(2) is thus a descendant of the exclusion provision as well as thedeportation provision, and cases decided under the former represent therelevant prior law no less than cases decided under the latter.The dissent repeatedly contends that Congress intended to make nosubstantive change to the prior law when it enacted $ 1231(b)(2). E. g.,post, at 361-362. But on the dissent's view the 1996 amendment workedrather a large change: Refugees like petitioner, who previously couldbe expelled without acceptance (under former $ 1227), now cannot. Seen. 8, supra.12 The additional dicta cited by the dissent, post, at 359, do not lend anyadditional weight to the argument that Congress ratified a settled judicialconstruction. Dictum settles nothing, even in the court that utters it.543US2 Unit: $U15 [03-16-07 06:52:30] PAGES PGT: OPLG352 JAMA v.
