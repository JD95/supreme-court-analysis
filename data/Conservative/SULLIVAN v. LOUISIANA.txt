The question presented is whether a constitutionally defi-cient reasonable-doubt instruction may be harmless error.IPetitioner was charged with first-degree murder in thecourse of committing an armed robbery at a New Orleansbar. His alleged accomplice in the crime, a convicted felonnamed Michael Hillhouse, testifying at the trial pursuant toa grant of immunity, identified petitioner as the murderer.Although several other people were in the bar at the time ofthe robbery, only one testified at trial. This witness, whohad been unable to identify either Hillhouse or petitioner ata physical lineup, testified that they committed the robbery,and that she saw petitioner hold a gun to the victim's head.There was other circumstantial evidence supporting the con-clusion that petitioner was the triggerman. 596 So. 2d 177,180-181 (La. 1992). In closing argument, defense counselargued that there was reasonable doubt as to both the identity of the murderer and his intent.*Barry S. Simon filed a brief for the National Association of CriminalDefense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging reversal.508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT277Cite as: 508 U. S. 275 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIn his instructions to the jury, the trial judge gave a defi-nition of "reasonable doubt" that was, as the State concededbelow, essentially identical to the one held unconstitutionalin Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U. S. 39 (1990) (per curiam). See596 So. 2d, at 185, and n. 3. The jury found petitioner guiltyof first-degree murder and subsequently recommended thathe be sentenced to death. The trial court agreed. On di-rect appeal, the Supreme Court of Louisiana held, consistentwith its opinion on remand from our decision in Cage, Statev.Cage, 583 So. 2d 1125, cert. denied, 502 U. S. 874 (1991),that the erroneous instruction was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. 596 So. 2d, at 186. It therefore upheld theconviction, though remanding for a new sentencing hearingbecause of ineffectiveness of counsel in the sentencing phase.We granted certiorari, 506 U. S. 939 (1992).IIThe Sixth Amendment provides that "[i]n all criminalprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedyand public trial, by an impartial jury . . . ." In Duncan v.Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), we found this right totrial by jury in serious criminal cases to be "fundamental tothe American scheme of justice," and therefore applicable instate proceedings. The right includes, of course, as its mostimportant element, the right to have the jury, rather thanthe judge, reach the requisite finding of "guilty." SeeSparfv. United States, 156 U. S. 51, 105-106 (1895). Thus, although a judge may direct a verdict for the defendant if theevidence is legally insufficient to establish guilt, he may notdirect a verdict for the State, no matter how overwhelm-ing the evidence.Ibid. See also United States v. MartinLinen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 572-573 (1977); Carpentersv. United States, 330 U. S. 395, 410 (1947).What the factfinder must determine to return a verdict ofguilty is prescribed by the Due Process Clause.

New York, 432 U. S. 197,210 (1977); Leland v. Oregon, 343 U. S. 790, 795 (1952), andmust persuade the factfinder "beyond a reasonable doubt"of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements,see, e. g., In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970); Cool v.United States, 409 U. S. 100, 104 (1972) (per curiam). Thisbeyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirement, which was adheredto by virtually all common-law jurisdictions, applies in stateas well as federal proceedings. Winship, supra.It is self-evident, we think, that the Fifth Amendment re-quirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the SixthAmendment requirement of a jury verdict are interrelated.It would not satisfy the Sixth Amendment to have a jurydetermine that the defendant is probably guilty, and thenleave it up to the judge to determine (asWinship requires)whether he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In otherwords, the jury verdict required by the Sixth Amendment isa jury verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Our percuriam opinion in Cage, which we accept as controlling, heldthat an instruction of the sort given here does not producesuch a verdict.* Petitioner's Sixth Amendment right tojury trial was therefore denied.IIIIn Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), we re-jected the view that all federal constitutional errors in thecourse of a criminal trial require reversal. We held that the*The State has argued in this Court that the Cage standard for reviewof jury instructions, which looked to whether a jury "could have" appliedthe instructions in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution, was contradicted in Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370, 380 (1990), and disapproved in Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 72-73, n. 4 (1991). In view ofthe question presented and the State's failure to raise this issue below,we do not consider whether the instruction given here would survive review under the Boyde standard. See Granfinanciera, S. A. v. Nordberg,492 U. S. 33, 38-39 (1989); Washington v. Confederated Bands and Tribesof Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 476, n. 20 (1979).508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT279Cite as: 508 U. S. 275 (1993)Opinion of the CourtFifth Amendment violation of prosecutorial comment uponthe defendant's failure to testify would not require reversalof the conviction if the State could show "beyond a reason-able doubt that the error complained of did not contribute tothe verdict obtained." Id., at 24. The Chapman standardrecognizes that "certain constitutional errors, no less thanother errors, may have been `harmless' in terms of theireffect on the factfinding process at trial." Delaware v. VanArsdall, 475 U. S. 673, 681 (1986). Although most constitutional errors have been held amenable to harmless-erroranalysis, seeArizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 306-307(1991) (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J., for the Court) (collecting examples), some will always invalidate the conviction.Id., at 309-310 (citing, inter alia, Gideon v. Wainwright,372 U. S. 335 (1963) (total deprivation of the right to counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (trial by a biasedjudge); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168 (1984) (right toself-representation)). The question in the present case isto which category the present error belongs.Chapman itself suggests the answer. Consistent with thejury-trial guarantee, the question it instructs the reviewingcourt to consider is not what effect the constitutional errormight generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury,but rather what effect it had upon the guilty verdict in thecase at hand. See Chapman, supra, at 24 (analyzing effect of error on "verdict obtained"). Harmless-error review looks, we have said, to the basis on which "the jury actually rested its verdict." Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 404(1991) (emphasis added). The inquiry, in other words, is notwhether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guiltyverdict would surely have been rendered, but whether theguilty verdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable to the error. That must be so, because to hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact rendered--nomatter how inescapable the findings to support that verdictmight be--would violate the jury-trial guarantee. See Rose508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT280 SULLIVAN v. LOUISIANAOpinion of the Courtv. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 578 (1986); id., at 593 (Blackmun, J.,dissenting);Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 509-510 (1987)(Stevens, J., dissenting).Once the proper role of an appellate court engaged in theChapman inquiry is understood, the illogic of harmless-errorreview in the present case becomes evident. Since, for thereasons described above, there has been no jury verdictwithin the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, the entirepremise ofChapman review is simply absent. There beingno jury verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt, thequestion whether thesame verdict of guilty-beyond-areasonable-doubt would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless. There is no object,so to speak, upon which harmless-error scrutiny can operate.The most an appellate court can conclude is that a jury wouldsurely have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonabledoubt--not that the jury's actual finding of guilty beyonda reasonable doubt would surely not have been differentabsent the constitutional error. That is not enough. SeeYates, supra, at 413-414 (Scalia, J., concurring in part andconcurring in judgment). The Sixth Amendment requiresmore than appellate speculation about a hypothetical jury'saction, or else directed verdicts for the State would be sustainable on appeal; it requires an actual jury finding of guilty.See Bollenbach v. United States, 326 U. S. 607, 614 (1946).Insofar as the possibility of harmless-error review is concerned, the jury-instruction error in this case is quite different from the jury-instruction error of erecting a presumptionregarding an element of the offense. A mandatory presumption--for example, the presumption that a person intends the ordinary consequences of his voluntary acts--violates the Fourteenth Amendment, because it may relieve theState of its burden of proving all elements of the offense.Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U. S. 510 (1979); Francis v.Franklin, 471 U. S. 307 (1985). But "[w]hen a jury is instructed to presume malice from predicate facts, it still must508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT281Cite as: 508 U. S. 275 (1993)Opinion of the Courtfind the existence of those facts beyond a reasonable doubt."Rose v. Clark, supra, at 580. And when the latter facts "areso closely related to the ultimate fact to be presumed thatno rational jury could find those facts without also findingthat ultimate fact, making those findings is functionallyequivalent to finding the element required to be presumed."Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 271 (1989) (Scalia, J.,concurring in judgment). See also Pope, supra, at 504(Scalia, J., concurring). A reviewing court may thus beable to conclude that the presumption played no significantrole in the finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Yates, supra, at 402-406. But the essential connection to a"beyond a reasonable doubt" factual finding cannot be madewhere the instructional error consists of a misdescription ofthe burden of proof, which vitiates all the jury's findings. Areviewing court can only engage in pure speculation--itsview of what a reasonable jury would have done. And whenit does that, "the wrong entity judge[s] the defendant guilty."Rose, supra, at 578.Another mode of analysis leads to the same conclusion thatharmless-error analysis does not apply: In Fulminante, wedistinguished between, on the one hand, "structural defectsin the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by `harmless-error' standards," 499 U. S., at 309, and, onthe other hand, trial errors which occur "during the presentation of the case to the jury, and which may therefore bequantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented," id., at 307-308. Denial of the right to a jury verdictof guilt beyond a reasonable doubt is certainly an error ofthe former sort, the jury guarantee being a "basic protectio[n]" whose precise effects are unmeasurable, but withoutwhich a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function,Rose, supra, at 577. The right to trial by jury reflects, wehave said, "a profound judgment about the way in which lawshould be enforced and justice administered." Duncan v.Louisiana, 391 U. S., at 155. The deprivation of that right,508us1$80Z 01-24-96 16:59:20 PAGES OPINPGT282 SULLIVAN v. LOUISIANARehnquist, C. J., concurringwith consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and in-determinate, unquestionably qualifies as "structural error."The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana is re-versed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
