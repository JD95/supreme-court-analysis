As Enron Corporation's financial difficulties became publicin 2001, petitioner Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor,instructed its employees to destroy documents pursuant toits document retention policy. A jury found that this actionmade petitioner guilty of violating 18 U. S. C. $$ 1512(b)(2)(A) and (B). These sections make it a crime to "knowingly us[e] intimidation or physical force, threate[n], or cor-ruptly persuad[e] another person . . . with intent to . . . cause"that person to "withhold" documents from, or "alter" docu-ments for use in, an "official proceeding."1 The Court ofAppeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. We hold that thejury instructions failed to convey properly the elements of a"corrup[t] persua[sion]" conviction under $ 1512(b), and there-fore reverse.Enron Corporation, during the 1990's, switched its busi-ness from operation of natural gas pipelines to an energyconglomerate, a move that was accompanied by aggressiveaccounting practices and rapid growth.

Within days, Sherron Wat-kins, a senior accountant at Enron, warned Kenneth Lay,Enron's newly reappointed CEO, that Enron could "implodein a wave of accounting scandals." Brief for United States2. She likewise informed Duncan and Michael Odom, one ofpetitioner's partners who had supervisory responsibilityover Duncan, of the looming problems.On August 28, an article in the Wall Street Journal suggested improprieties at Enron, and the SEC opened an in-formal investigation. By early September, petitioner hadformed an Enron "crisis-response" team, which includedNancy Temple, an in-house counsel.3 On October 8, petitioner retained outside counsel to represent it in any litiga-tion that might arise from the Enron matter. The next day,Temple discussed Enron with other in-house counsel. Hernotes from that meeting reflect that "some SEC investigation" is "highly probable." Id., at 3.On October 10, Odom spoke at a general training meetingattended by 89 employees, including 10 from the Enron en2 During this time, petitioner faced problems of its own. In June 2001,petitioner entered into a settlement agreement with the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC) related to its audit work of Waste Management, Inc. As part of the settlement, petitioner paid a massive fine. Italso was censured and enjoined from committing further violations of thesecurities laws. In July 2001, the SEC filed an amended complaint alleging improprieties by Sunbeam Corporation, and petitioner's lead partneron the Sunbeam audit was named.3 A key accounting problem involved Enron's use of "Raptors," whichwere special purpose entities used to engage in "off-balance-sheet" activities. Petitioner's engagement team had allowed Enron to "aggregate" theRaptors for accounting purposes so that they reflected a positive return.This was, in the words of petitioner's experts, a "black-and-white" violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.

Odom urged everyone to comply with thefirm's document retention policy.4 He added: " `[I]f it's destroyed in the course of [the] normal policy and litigation isfiled the next day, that's great. . . . [W]e've followed our ownpolicy, and whatever there was that might have been of in-terest to somebody is gone and irretrievable.' " 374 F. 3d281, 286 (CA5 2004). On October 12, Temple entered theEnron matter into her computer, designating the "Type ofPotential Claim" as "Professional Practice--Government/Regulatory Inv[estigation]." App. JA-127. Temple alsoe-mailed Odom, suggesting that he " `remin[d] the engagement team of our documentation and retention policy.' "Brief for United States 6.On October 16, Enron announced its third quarter results.That release disclosed a $1.01 billion charge to earnings.5The following day, the SEC notified Enron by letter that ithad opened an investigation in August and requested certaininformation and documents. On October 19, Enron forwarded a copy of that letter to petitioner.4 The firm's policy called for a single central engagement file, which"should contain only that information which is relevant to supporting ourwork." App. JA-45. The policy stated that, "[i]n cases of threatenedlitigation, . . . no related information will be destroyed." Id., at JA-44.It also separately provided that, if petitioner is "advised of litigation orsubpoenas regarding a particular engagement, the related informationshould not be destroyed. See Policy Statement No. 780--Notification ofLitigation." Id., at JA-65 (emphasis deleted). Policy Statement No. 780set forth "notification" procedures for whenever "professional practice litigation against [petitioner] or any of its personnel has been commenced,has been threatened or is judged likely to occur, or when governmental orprofessional investigations that may involve [petitioner] or any of its personnel have been commenced or are judged likely." Id., at JA-29 toJA-30.5 The release characterized the charge to earnings as "non-recurring."Brief for United States 6, n. 4. Petitioner had expressed doubts aboutthis characterization to Enron, but Enron refused to alter the release.Temple wrote an e-mail to Duncan that "suggested deleting some languagethat might suggest we have concluded the release is misleading."

S. 696 (2005)Opinion of the CourtOn the same day, Temple also sent an e-mail to a memberof petitioner's internal team of accounting experts andattached a copy of the document policy. On October 20, theEnron crisis-response team held a conference call, duringwhich Temple instructed everyone to "[m]ake sure to followthe [document] policy." Brief for United States 7 (bracketsin original). On October 23, Enron CEO Lay declined toanswer questions during a call with analysts because of "potential lawsuits, as well as the SEC inquiry." Ibid. Afterthe call, Duncan met with other Andersen partners on theEnron engagement team and told them that they should ensure team members were complying with the documentpolicy. Another meeting for all team members followed,during which Duncan distributed the policy and told everyone to comply. These, and other smaller meetings, were followed by substantial destruction of paper and electronicdocuments.On October 26, one of petitioner's senior partners circulated a New York Times article discussing the SEC's response to Enron. His e-mail commented that "the problemsare just beginning and we will be in the cross hairs. Themarketplace is going to keep the pressure on this and isgoing to force the SEC to be tough." Id., at 8. On October30, the SEC opened a formal investigation and sent Enron aletter that requested accounting documents.Throughout this time period, the document destructioncontinued, despite reservations by some of petitioner's managers.6 On November 8, Enron announced that it would6 For example, on October 26, John Riley, another partner with petitioner, saw Duncan shredding documents and told him "this wouldn't bethe best time in the world for you guys to be shredding a bunch of stuff."Brief for United States 9. On October 31, David Stulb, a forensics investigator for petitioner, met with Duncan. During the meeting, Duncanpicked up a document with the words "smoking gun" written on it andbegan to destroy it, adding "we don't need this." Ibid. Stulb cautionedDuncan on the need to maintain documents and later informed Templethat Duncan needed advice on the document retention policy.544US2 Unit: $U51 [03-17-06 18:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN702 ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtissue a comprehensive restatement of its earnings andassets. Also on November 8, the SEC served Enron andpetitioner with subpoenas for records. On November 9,Duncan's secretary sent an e-mail that stated: "Per Dave--No more shredding. . . . We have been officially served forour documents." Id., at 10. Enron filed for bankruptcy lessthan a month later. Duncan was fired and later pleadedguilty to witness tampering.In March 2002, petitioner was indicted in the SouthernDistrict of Texas on one count of violating $$ 1512(b)(2)(A)and (B). The indictment alleged that, between October 10and November 9, 2001, petitioner "did knowingly, intentionally and corruptly persuade . . . other persons, to wit:[petitioner's] employees, with intent to cause" them to withhold documents from, and alter documents for use in, "officialproceedings, namely: regulatory and criminal proceedingsand investigations." App. JA-139. A jury trial followed.When the case went to the jury, that body deliberated forseven days and then declared that it was deadlocked. TheDistrict Court delivered an "Allen charge," Allen v. UnitedStates, 164 U. S. 492 (1896), and, after three more days ofdeliberation, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The District Court denied petitioner's motion for a judgment ofacquittal.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 374F. 3d, at 284. It held that the jury instructions properlyconveyed the meaning of "corruptly persuades" and "officialproceeding"; that the jury need not find any consciousnessof wrongdoing; and that there was no reversible error. Because of a split of authority regarding the meaning of$ 1512(b), we granted certiorari.7 543 U. S. 1042 (2005).7 Compare, e. g., United States v. Shotts, 145 F. 3d 1289, 1301 (CA111998), with United States v. Farrell, 126 F. 3d 484, 489-490 (CA3 1997).544US2 Unit: $U51 [03-17-06 18:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN703Cite as: 544 U. S. 696 (2005)Opinion of the CourtChapter 73 of Title 18 of the United States Code providescriminal sanctions for those who obstruct justice. Sections1512(b)(2)(A) and (B), part of the witness tampering provisions, provide in relevant part:"Whoever knowingly uses intimidation or physical force,threatens, or corruptly persuades another person, or attempts to do so, or engages in misleading conduct toward another person, with intent to . . . cause or induceany person to . . . withhold testimony, or withhold a record, document, or other object, from an official proceeding [or] alter, destroy, mutilate, or conceal an object withintent to impair the object's integrity or availability foruse in an official proceeding . . . shall be fined under thistitle or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both."In this case, our attention is focused on what it means to"knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[e]" another person "withintent to . . . cause" that person to "withhold" documents from, or "alter" documents for use in, an "officialproceeding.""We have traditionally exercised restraint in assessing thereach of a federal criminal statute, both out of deference tothe prerogatives of Congress, Dowling v. United States, 473U. S. 207 (1985), and out of concern that `a fair warningshould be given to the world in language that the commonworld will understand, of what the law intends to do if acertain line is passed,' McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S.25, 27 (1931)." United States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 600(1995).Such restraint is particularly appropriate here, where theact underlying the conviction--"persua[sion]"--is by itselfinnocuous. Indeed, "persuad[ing]" a person "with intentto . . . cause" that person to "withhold" testimony or documents from a Government proceeding or Government official544US2 Unit: $U51 [03-17-06 18:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN704 ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtis not inherently malign.8 Consider, for instance, a motherwho suggests to her son that he invoke his right against compelled self-incrimination, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, or a wifewho persuades her husband not to disclose marital confidences, see Trammel v. United States, 445 U. S. 40 (1980).Nor is it necessarily corrupt for an attorney to "persuad[e]" a client "with intent to . . . cause" that client to"withhold" documents from the Government. InUpjohnCo. v. United States, 449 U. S. 383 (1981), for example, weheld that Upjohn was justified in withholding documents thatwere covered by the attorney-client privilege from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). See id., at 395. No one wouldsuggest that an attorney who "persuade[d]" Upjohn to takethat step acted wrongfully, even though he surely intendedthat his client keep those documents out of the IRS' hands."Document retention policies," which are created in partto keep certain information from getting into the hands ofothers, including the Government, are common in business.See generally Chase, To Shred or Not to Shred: DocumentRetention Policies and Federal Obstruction of Justice Stat-utes, 8 Ford. J. Corp. & Fin. L. 721 (2003). It is, of course,not wrongful for a manager to instruct his employees to com-ply with a valid document retention policy under ordinarycircumstances.Acknowledging this point, the parties have largely focusedtheir attention on the word "corruptly" as the key to whatmay or may not lawfully be done in the situation presentedhere. Section 1512(b) punishes not just "corruptly per-suad[ing]" another, but "knowingly . . . corruptly per-suad[ing]" another. (Emphasis added.) The Governmentsuggests that "knowingly" does not modify "corruptly per8 Section 1512(b)(2) addresses testimony, as well as documents. Section1512(b)(1) also addresses testimony. Section 1512(b)(3) addresses "persuade[rs]" who intend to prevent "the communication to a law enforcementofficer or judge of the United States of information" relating to a federalcrime.544US2 Unit: $U51 [03-17-06 18:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN705Cite as: 544 U. S. 696 (2005)Opinion of the Courtsuades," but that is not how the statute most naturally reads.It provides the mens rea--"knowingly"--and then a list ofacts--"uses intimidation or physical force, threatens, or cor-ruptly persuades." We have recognized with regard to similar statutory language that the mens rea at least appliesto the acts that immediately follow, if not to other elements down the statutory chain. See United States v. XCitement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 68 (1994) (recognizingthat the "most natural grammatical reading" of 18 U. S. C.$$ 2252(a)(1) and (2) "suggests that the term `knowingly'modifies only the surrounding verbs: transports, ships, receives, distributes, or reproduces"); see also Liparota v.United States, 471 U. S. 419 (1985). The Government suggests that it is "questionable whether Congress wouldemploy such an inelegant formulation as `knowingly . . .corruptly persuades.' " Brief for United States 35, n. 18.Long experience has not taught us to share the Government's doubts on this score, and we must simply interpretthe statute as written.The parties have not pointed us to another interpretationof "knowingly . . . corruptly" to guide us here.9 In anyevent, the natural meaning of these terms provides a clearanswer. SeeBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144-145(1995). "[K]nowledge" and "knowingly" are normally associated with awareness, understanding, or consciousness.See Black's Law Dictionary 888 (8th ed. 2004) (hereinafterBlack's); Webster's Third New International Dictionary1252-1253 (1993) (hereinafter Webster's 3d); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 725 (1981) (herein-after Am. Hert.). "Corrupt" and "corruptly" are normallyassociated with wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil. SeeBlack's 371; Webster's 3d 512; Am. Hert. 299-300. Joiningthese meanings together here makes sense both linguisti9 The parties have pointed us to two other obstruction provisions, 18U. S. C. $$ 1503 and 1505, which contain the word "corruptly." But theseprovisions lack the modifier "knowingly," making any analogy inexact.544US2 Unit: $U51 [03-17-06 18:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN706 ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcally and in the statutory scheme. Only persons consciousof wrongdoing can be said to "knowingly . . . corruptly persuad[e]." And limiting criminality to persuaders consciousof their wrongdoing sensibly allows $ 1512(b) to reach onlythose with the level of "culpability . . . we usually requirein order to impose criminal liability."United States v.Aguilar, 515 U. S., at 602; see also Liparota v. United States,supra, at 426.The outer limits of this element need not be explored herebecause the jury instructions at issue simply failed to conveythe requisite consciousness of wrongdoing. Indeed, it isstriking how little culpability the instructions required.For example, the jury was told that, "even if [petitioner] honestly and sincerely believed that its conduct was lawful, youmay find [petitioner] guilty." App. JA-213. The instructions also diluted the meaning of "corruptly" so that it covered innocent conduct. Id., at JA-212.The parties vigorously disputed how the jury would beinstructed on "corruptly." The District Court based its instruction on the definition of that term found in the FifthCircuit Pattern Jury Instruction for $ 1503. This pattern instruction defined "corruptly" as " `knowingly and dishonestly,with the specific intent to subvert or undermine the integrity' " of a proceeding. Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 3 (emphasisdeleted). The Government, however, insisted on excluding"dishonestly" and adding the term "impede" to the phrase"subvert or undermine." Ibid. (internal quotation marksomitted). The District Court agreed over petitioner's objections, and the jury was told to convict if it found petitionerintended to "subvert, undermine, or impede" governmentalfactfinding by suggesting to its employees that they enforcethe document retention policy. App. JA-212.These changes were significant. No longer was any typeof "dishonest[y]" necessary to a finding of guilt, and it wasenough for petitioner to have simply "impede[d]" the Government's factfinding ability. As the Government conceded544US2 Unit: $U51 [03-17-06 18:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN707Cite as: 544 U. S. 696 (2005)Opinion of the Courtat oral argument, " `[i]mpede' " has broader connotationsthan " `subvert' " or even " `[u]ndermine,' " see Tr. of OralArg. 38, and many of these connotations do not incorporateany "corrupt[ness]" at all. The dictionary defines "impede"as "to interfere with or get in the way of the progress of "or "hold up" or "detract from." Webster's 3d 1132. Bydefinition, anyone who innocently persuades another to with-hold information from the Government "get[s] in the way ofthe progress of " the Government. With regard to such in-nocent conduct, the "corruptly" instructions did no limitingwork whatsoever.The instructions also were infirm for another reason.They led the jury to believe that it did not have to find anynexus between the "persua[sion]" to destroy documents andany particular proceeding.10 In resisting any type of nexuselement, the Government relies heavily on $ 1512(e)(1), whichstates that an official proceeding "need not be pending orabout to be instituted at the time of the offense." It is, however, one thing to say that a proceeding "need not be pendingor about to be instituted at the time of the offense," and10 We disagree with the Government's suggestion that petitioner's"nexus" argument is not preserved or that it is only subject to plain-errorreview for failure to comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure30(d). Petitioner plainly argued for, and objected to the instructions' lackof, a nexus requirement. See, e. g., Record 425 (arguing for a "nexus" andexplaining that "it is insufficient for the government to show that thedefendant intended to affect some hypothetical future federal proceeding"); id., at 931-932, 938; Tr. 4339-4345 (May 25, 2002). In so doing, itreasonably relied on language in United States v. Shively, 927 F. 2d 804,812-813 (CA5 1991). Although the instruction petitioner proposed, basedon Shively, does not mirror the nexus requirement it now proposes, itsactions were sufficient to satisfy Rule 30(d). This argument also was preserved in the Court of Appeals, which recognized that petitioner was challenging "the concreteness of the defendant's expectation[s] of a proceeding." 374 F. 3d 281, 298 (CA5 2004); see United States v. Williams, 504U. S. 36, 41-42 (1992). However, the Court of Appeals did not address,and petitioner did not preserve, its argument that informal inquiries arenot covered by the statute. See ibid.544US2 Unit: $U51 [03-17-06 18:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN708 ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtquite another to say a proceeding need not even be foreseen.A "knowingly . . . corrup[t] persaude[r]" cannot be someonewho persuades others to shred documents under a documentretention policy when he does not have in contemplationany particular official proceeding in which those documentsmight be material.We faced a similar situation in Aguilar, supra. Respond-ent Aguilar lied to a Federal Bureau of Investigation agentin the course of an investigation and was convicted of " `cor-ruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct, and impede [a] . . .grand jury investigation' " under $ 1503. 515 U. S., at 599.All the Government had shown was that Aguilar had utteredfalse statements to an investigating agent "who might ormight not testify before a grand jury."Id., at 600. We heldthat $ 1503 required something more--specifically, a "nexus"between the obstructive act and the proceeding. Id., at599-600. "[I]f the defendant lacks knowledge that his actions are likely to affect the judicial proceeding," we ex-plained, "he lacks the requisite intent to obstruct."Id.,at 599.For these reasons, the jury instructions here were flawedin important respects. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further pro-ceedings consistent with this opinion.
