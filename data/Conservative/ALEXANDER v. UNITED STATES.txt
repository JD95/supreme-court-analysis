After a full criminal trial, petitioner Ferris J. Alexander,owner of more than a dozen stores and theaters dealing insexually explicit materials, was convicted on, inter alia, 17obscenity counts and 3 counts of violating the RacketeerInfluenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Theobscenity convictions, based on the jury's findings that fourmagazines and three videotapes sold at several of petitioner's stores were obscene, served as the predicates for histhree RICO convictions. In addition to imposing a prisonterm and fine, the District Court ordered petitioner to for-feit, pursuant to 18 U. S. C. $ 1963 (1988 ed. and Supp. III),certain assets that were directly related to his racketeeringactivity as punishment for his RICO violations. Petitionerargues that this forfeiture violated the First and EighthAmendments to the Constitution.

S. 544 (1993)Opinion of the Courtclaims under the First Amendment but remand for reconsid-eration of his Eighth Amendment challenge.Petitioner was in the so-called "adult entertainment" busi-ness for more than 30 years, selling pornographic magazinesand sexual paraphernalia, showing sexually explicit movies,and eventually selling and renting videotapes of a similarnature. He received shipments of these materials at a warehouse in Minneapolis, Minnesota, where they were wrappedin plastic, priced, and boxed. He then sold his productsthrough some 13 retail stores in several different Minnesotacities, generating millions of dollars in annual revenues. In1989, federal authorities filed a 41-count indictment againstpetitioner and others, alleging, inter alia, operation of aracketeering enterprise in violation of RICO. The indictment charged 34 obscenity counts and 3 RICO counts, theracketeering counts being predicated on the obscenitycharges. The indictment also charged numerous counts oftax evasion and related offenses that are not relevant to thequestions before us.Following a 4-month jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, petitioner was convicted of 17 substantive obscenity offenses: 12 counts oftransporting obscene material in interstate commerce for thepurpose of sale or distribution, in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 1465; and 5 counts of engaging in the business of sellingobscene material, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1466 (1988 ed.and Supp. III). He also was convicted of 3 RICO offensesthat were predicated on the obscenity convictions: one countof receiving and using income derived from a pattern ofracketeering activity, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(a);one count of conducting a RICO enterprise, in violation of$ 1962(c); and one count of conspiring to conduct a RICO enterprise, in violation of $ 1962(d). As a basis for the obscenity and RICO convictions, the jury determined that fourmagazines and three videotapes were obscene. Multiplecopies of these magazines and videos, which graphically de509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT548 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtpicted a variety of "hard core" sexual acts, were distributedthroughout petitioner's adult entertainment empire.Petitioner was sentenced to a total of six years in prison,fined $100,000, and ordered to pay the cost of prosecution,incarceration, and supervised release. In addition to thesepunishments, the District Court reconvened the samejury and conducted a forfeiture proceeding pursuant to$ 1963(a)(2). At this proceeding, the Government soughtforfeiture of the businesses and real estate that representedpetitioner's interest in the racketeering enterprise, $ 1963(a)(2)(A), the property that afforded petitioner influence overthat enterprise, $ 1963(a)(2)(D), and the assets and proceedspetitioner had obtained from his racketeering offenses,$$ 1963(a)(1), (3). The jury found that petitioner had an interest in 10 pieces of commercial real estate and 31 currentor former businesses, all of which had been used to conducthis racketeering enterprise. Sitting without the jury, theDistrict Court then found that petitioner had acquired a variety of assets as a result of his racketeering activities. Thecourt ultimately ordered petitioner to forfeit his wholesaleand retail businesses (including all the assets of those busi-nesses) and almost $9 million in moneys acquired throughracketeering activity.1The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's forfeiture order. Alexander v. Thornburgh, 943 F. 2d 825 (CA81991). It rejected petitioner's argument that the application of RICO's forfeiture provisions constituted a prior re-straint on speech and hence violated the First Amendment.Recognizing the well-established distinction between priorrestraints and subsequent criminal punishments, the Courtof Appeals found that the forfeiture here was "a criminal1 Not wishing to go into the business of selling pornographic materials--regardless of whether they were legally obscene--the Government decided that it would be better to destroy the forfeited expressive materialsthan sell them to members of the public.

The court also rejectedpetitioner's claim that RICO's forfeiture provisions are constitutionally overbroad, pointing out that the forfeiture orderwas properly limited to assets linked to petitioner's pastracketeering offenses.Id., at 835. Lastly, the Court of Appeals concluded that the forfeiture order does not violate theEighth Amendment's prohibition against "cruel and unusualpunishments" and "excessive fines." In so ruling, however,the court did not consider whether the forfeiture in this casewas grossly disproportionate or excessive, believing that theEighth Amendment " `does not require a proportionality review of any sentence less than life imprisonment without thepossibility of parole.' " Id., at 836 (quoting United States v.Pryba, 900 F. 2d 748, 757 (CA4), cert. denied, 498 U. S. 924(1990)). We granted certiorari, 505 U. S. 1217 (1992).Petitioner first contends that the forfeiture in this case,which effectively shut down his adult entertainment business, constituted an unconstitutional prior restraint onspeech, rather than a permissible criminal punishment. According to petitioner, forfeiture of expressive materials andthe assets of businesses engaged in expressive activity, whenpredicated solely upon previous obscenity violations, operates as a prior restraint because it prohibits future presumptively protected expression in retaliation for prior unprotected speech. Practically speaking, petitioner argues, theeffect of the RICO forfeiture order here was no differentfrom the injunction prohibiting the publication of expressivematerial found to be a prior restraint in Near v. Minnesotaex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931). As petitioner puts it, seeBrief for Petitioner 25, the forfeiture order imposed a complete ban on his future expression because of previous unprotected speech. We disagree. By lumping the forfeiture imposed in this case after a full criminal trial with an injunctionenjoining future speech, petitioner stretches the term "prior509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT550 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtrestraint" well beyond the limits established by our cases.To accept petitioner's argument would virtually obliteratethe distinction, solidly grounded in our cases, between priorrestraints and subsequent punishments.The term "prior restraint" is used "to describe administrative and judicial orders forbidding certain communicationswhen issued in advance of the time that such communicationsare to occur." M. Nimmer, Nimmer on Freedom of Speech$ 4.03, p. 4-14 (1984) (emphasis added). Temporary restraining orders and permanent injunctions--i. e., court ordersthat actually forbid speech activities--are classic examplesof prior restraints. See id., $ 4.03, at 4-16. This understanding of what constitutes a prior restraint is borne out byour cases, even those on which petitioner relies. In Near v.Minnesota ex rel. Olson, supra, we invalidated a court orderthat perpetually enjoined the named party, who had published a newspaper containing articles found to violate astate nuisance statute, from producing any future "malicious,scandalous or defamatory" publication. Id., at 706. Near,therefore, involved a true restraint on future speech--a permanent injunction. So, too, did Organization for a BetterAustin v. Keefe, 402 U. S. 415 (1971), and Vance v. UniversalAmusement Co., 445 U. S. 308 (1980) (per curiam), two othercases cited by petitioner. In Keefe, we vacated an order"enjoining petitioners from distributing leaflets anywhere inthe town of Westchester, Illinois." 402 U. S., at 415 (emphasis added). And in Vance, we struck down a Texas statutethat authorized courts, upon a showing that obscene filmshad been shown in the past, to issue an injunction of indefinite duration prohibiting the future exhibition of films thathave not yet been found to be obscene. 445 U. S., at 311.See also New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713,714 (1971) (per curiam) (Government sought to enjoin publication of the Pentagon Papers).By contrast, the RICO forfeiture order in this case doesnot forbid petitioner to engage in any expressive activi509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT551Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)Opinion of the Courtties in the future, nor does it require him to obtain priorapproval for any expressive activities. It only deprives himof specific assets that were found to be related to his previ-ous racketeering violations. Assuming, of course, that hehas sufficient untainted assets to open new stores, restockhis inventory, and hire staff, petitioner can go back into theadult entertainment business tomorrow, and sell as manysexually explicit magazines and videotapes as he likes, with-out any risk of being held in contempt for violating a courtorder. Unlike the injunctions in Near, Keefe, and Vance, theforfeiture order in this case imposes no legal impedimentto--no prior restraint on--petitioner's ability to engage inany expressive activity he chooses. He is perfectly free toopen an adult bookstore or otherwise engage in the production and distribution of erotic materials; he just cannot finance these enterprises with assets derived from his priorracketeering offenses.The constitutional infirmity in nearly all of our prior restraint cases involving obscene material, including those onwhich petitioner and the dissent rely, see post, at 570-571,577, was that the government had seized or otherwise restrained materials suspected of being obscene without aprior judicial determination that they were in fact so. See,e. g., Marcus v. Search Warrant of Kansas City, Mo., Property, 367 U. S. 717 (1961); Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan,372 U. S. 58 (1963); Quantity of Copies of Books v. Kansas,378 U. S. 205 (1964); Roaden v. Kentucky, 413 U. S. 496(1973); Vance, supra. In this case, however, the assets inquestion were ordered forfeited not because they were believed to be obscene, but because they were directly relatedto petitioner's past racketeering violations. The RICO forfeiture statute calls for the forfeiture of assets because of thefinancial role they play in the operation of the racketeeringenterprise. The statute is oblivious to the expressive ornonexpressive nature of the assets forfeited; books, sportscars, narcotics, and cash are all forfeitable alike under RICO.509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT552 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtIndeed, a contrary scheme would be disastrous from a policystandpoint, enabling racketeers to evade forfeiture by investing the proceeds of their crimes in businesses engaging inexpressive activity.Nor were the assets in question ordered forfeited withoutaccording petitioner the requisite procedural safeguards, an-other recurring theme in our prior restraint cases. Contrasting this case with Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana,489 U. S. 46 (1989), aptly illustrates this point. InFortWayne Books, we rejected on constitutional grounds the pre-trial seizure of certain expressive material that was basedupon a finding of "no more than probable cause to believethat a RICO violation had occurred." Id., at 66 (emphasisin original). In so holding, we emphasized that there hadbeen no prior judicial "determination that the seized itemswere `obscene' or that a RICO violation ha[d] occurred."Ibid. (emphasis in original). "[M]ere probable cause to believe a legal violation ha[d] transpired," we said, "is not adequate to remove books or films from circulation." Ibid.Here, by contrast, the seizure was not premature, becausethe Government established beyond a reasonable doubt thebasis for the forfeiture. Petitioner had a full criminal trialon the merits of the obscenity and RICO charges duringwhich the Government proved that four magazines and threevideotapes were obscene and that the other forfeited assetswere directly linked to petitioner's commission of racketeering offenses.Petitioner's claim that the RICO forfeiture statute operated as an unconstitutional prior restraint in this case is alsoinconsistent with our decision in Arcara v. Cloud Books,Inc., 478 U. S. 697 (1986). In that case, we sustained a courtorder, issued under a general nuisance statute, that closeddown an adult bookstore that was being used as a place ofprostitution and lewdness. In rejecting out-of-hand a claimthat the closure order amounted to an improper prior restraint on speech, we stated:509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT553Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)Opinion of the Court"The closure order sought in this case differs from aprior restraint in two significant respects. First, theorder would impose no restraint at all on the dissemina-tion of particular materials, since respondents are freeto carry on their bookselling business at another loca-tion, even if such locations are difficult to find. Second,the closure order sought would not be imposed on thebasis of an advance determination that the distributionof particular materials is prohibited--indeed, the impo-sition of the closure order has nothing to do with anyexpressive conduct at all." Id., at 705-706, n. 2.This reasoning applies with equal force to this case, and thusconfirms that the RICO forfeiture order was not a priorrestraint on speech, but a punishment for past criminalconduct. Petitioner attempts to distinguishArcara on theground that obscenity, unlike prostitution or lewdness, has" `a significant expressive element.' " Brief for Petitioner 16(quoting Arcara, supra, at 706). But that distinction has nobearing on the question whether the forfeiture order in thiscase was an impermissible prior restraint.Finally, petitioner's proposed definition of the term "priorrestraint" would undermine the time-honored distinctionbetween barring speech in the future and penalizing pastspeech. The doctrine of prior restraint originated in thecommon law of England, where prior restraints of the presswere not permitted, but punishment after publication was.This very limited application of the principle of freedom ofspeech was held inconsistent with our First Amendment aslong ago as Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233,246 (1936). While we may have given a broader definitionto the term "prior restraint" than was given to it in Englishcommon law,2 our decisions have steadfastly preserved the2 The doctrine of prior restraint has its roots in the 16th- and 17thcentury English system of censorship. Under that system, all printingpresses and printers were licensed by the government, and nothing couldlawfully be published without the prior approval of a government or509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT554 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtdistinction between prior restraints and subsequent punish-ments. Though petitioner tries to dismiss this distinctionas "neither meaningful nor useful," Brief for Petitioner 29,we think it is critical to our First Amendment jurisprudence.Because we have interpreted the First Amendment as pro-viding greater protection from prior restraints than fromsubsequent punishments, see Southeastern Promotions, Ltd.v.Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 558-559 (1975), it is important forus to delineate with some precision the defining characteristics of a prior restraint. To hold that the forfeiture order inthis case constituted a prior restraint would have the exactopposite effect: It would blur the line separating prior re-straints from subsequent punishments to such a degree thatit would be impossible to determine with any certaintywhether a particular measure is a prior restraint or not.In sum, we think that fidelity to our cases requires us toanalyze the forfeiture here not as a prior restraint, but undernormal First Amendment standards. So analyzing it, wefind that petitioner's claim falls well short of the mark. Hedoes not challenge either his 6-year jail sentence or his$100,000 fine as violative of the First Amendment. The firstinquiry that comes to mind, then, is why, if incarceration forsix years and a fine of $100,000 are permissible forms of punishment under the RICO statute, the challenged forfeitureof certain assets directly related to petitioner's racketeeringactivity is not. Our cases support the instinct from whichchurch censor. See generally T. Emerson, System of Freedom of Expression 504 (1970). Beginning with Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283U. S. 697 (1931), we expanded this doctrine to include not only licensingschemes requiring speech to be submitted to an administrative censor forprepublication review, but also injunctions against future speech issuedby judges. See Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on HumanRelations, 413 U. S. 376, 389-390 (1973) ("[T]he protection against priorrestraint at common law barred only a system of administrativecensorship. . . . [T]he Court boldly stepped beyond this narrow doctrine inNear"). Quite obviously, however, we have never before countenancedthe essentially limitless expansion of the term that petitioner proposes.509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT555Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthis question arises; they establish quite clearly that theFirst Amendment does not prohibit either stringent criminalsanctions for obscenity offenses or forfeiture of expressivematerials as punishment for criminal conduct.We have in the past rejected First Amendment challengesto statutes that impose severe prison sentences and fines aspunishment for obscenity offenses. See,e. g., Ginzburg v.United States, 383 U. S. 463, 464-465, n. 2 (1966); Smith v.United States, 431 U. S. 291, 296, n. 3 (1977); Fort WayneBooks, 489 U. S., at 59, n. 8. Petitioner does not questionthe holding of those cases; he instead argues that RICO'sforfeiture provisions are constitutionally overbroad becausethey are not limited solely to obscene materials and the proceeds from the sale of such materials. Petitioner acknowledges that this is an unprecedented use of the overbreadthprinciple. See Brief for Petitioner 36. The "overbreadth"doctrine, which is a departure from traditional rules ofstanding, permits a defendant to make a facial challenge toan overly broad statute restricting speech, even if he himselfhas engaged in speech that could be regulated under a morenarrowly drawn statute. See, e. g., Broadrick v. Oklahoma,413 U. S. 601, 612-613 (1973); City Council of Los Angeles v.Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 798-801 (1984). Butthe RICO statute does not criminalize constitutionally protected speech and therefore is materially different from thestatutes at issue in our overbreadth cases. Cf., e. g., Boardof Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc.,482 U. S. 569, 574-575 (1987).Petitioner's real complaint is not that the RICO statuteis overbroad, but that applying RICO's forfeiture provisionsto businesses dealing in expressive materials may have animproper "chilling" effect on free expression by deterringothers from engaging in protected speech. No doubt themonetarily large forfeiture in this case may induce cautiousbooksellers to practice self-censorship and remove marginally protected materials from their shelves out of fear that509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT556 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthose materials could be found obscene and thus subjectthem to forfeiture. But the defendant inFort Wayne Booksmade a similar argument, which was rejected by the Courtin this language:"[D]eterrence of the sale of obscene materials is a legiti-mate end of state antiobscenity laws, and our cases havelong recognized the practical reality that `any form ofcriminal obscenity statute applicable to a bookseller willinduce some tendency to self-censorship and have someinhibitory effect on the dissemination of material not obscene.' " 489 U. S., at 60 (quoting Smith v. California,361 U. S. 147, 154-155 (1959)).Fort Wayne Books is dispositive of any chilling argumenthere, since the threat of forfeiture has no more of a chillingeffect on free expression than the threat of a prison term ora large fine. Each racketeering charge exposes a defendantto a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment and a fineof up to $250,000. 18 U. S. C. $ 1963(a) (1988 ed. and Supp.III). See Brief for United States 19. Needless to say, theprospect of such a lengthy prison sentence would have a farmore powerful deterrent effect on protected speech than theprospect of any sort of forfeiture. Cf. Blanton v. North LasVegas, 489 U. S. 538, 542 (1989) (loss of liberty is a more severe form of punishment than any monetary sanction). Similarly, a fine of several hundred thousand dollars would cer-tainly be just as fatal to most businesses--and, as such,would result in the same degree of self-censorship--as a for-feiture of assets. Yet these penalties are clearly constitutional under Fort Wayne Books.We also have rejected a First Amendment challenge to acourt order closing down an entire business that was engaged in expressive activity as punishment for criminal conduct. See Arcara, 478 U. S., at 707. Once again, petitionerdoes not question the holding of that case; in fact, he concedes that expressive businesses and assets can be forfeited509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT557Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)Opinion of the Courtunder RICO as punishment for, say, narcotic offenses. SeeBrief for Petitioner 11 ("[F]orfeiture of a media business purchased by a drug cartel would be constitutionally permissi-ble"). Petitioner instead insists that the result here shouldbe different because the RICO predicate acts were obscenityoffenses. In Arcara, we held that criminal and civil sanc-tions having some incidental effect on First Amendment activities are subject to First Amendment scrutiny "onlywhere it was conduct with a significant expressive elementthat drew the legal remedy in the first place, as in [UnitedStates v.] O'Brien, [391 U. S. 367 (1968),] or where a statutebased on a nonexpressive activity has the inevitable effectof singling out those engaged in expressive activity, as inMinneapolis Star [& Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm'r ofRevenue, 460 U. S. 575 (1983)]." 478 U. S., at 706-707 (footnote omitted). Applying that standard, we held that prostitution and lewdness, the criminal conduct at issue in Arcara,involve neither situation, and thus concluded that the FirstAmendment was not implicated by the enforcement of a general health regulation resulting in the closure of an adultbookstore. Id., at 707. Under our analysis in Arcara, theforfeiture in this case cannot be said to offend the FirstAmendment. To be sure, the conduct that "drew the legalremedy" here--racketeering committed through obscenityviolations--may be "expressive," see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, 505U. S. 377, 385 (1992), but our cases clearly hold that "obscenity" can be regulated or actually proscribed consistent withthe First Amendment, see, e. g., Roth v. United States, 354U. S. 476, 485 (1957); Miller v. California, 413 U. S. 15, 23(1973).Confronted with our decisions in Fort Wayne Books andArcara--neither of which he challenges--petitioner's position boils down to this: Stiff criminal penalties for obscenityoffenses are consistent with the First Amendment; so is theforfeiture of expressive materials as punishment for criminalconduct; but the combination of the two somehow results509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT558 ALEXANDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtin a violation of the First Amendment. We reject thiscounterintuitive conclusion, which in effect would say thatthe whole is greater than the sum of the parts.Petitioner also argues that the forfeiture order in thiscase--considered atop his 6-year prison term and $100,000fine--is disproportionate to the gravity of his offenses andtherefore violates the Eighth Amendment, either as a "crueland unusual punishment" or as an "excessive fine."3 Brieffor Petitioner 40. The Court of Appeals, though, failed todistinguish between these two components of petitioner'sEighth Amendment challenge. Instead, the court lumpedthe two together, disposing of them both with the generalstatement that the Eighth Amendment does not require anyproportionality review of a sentence less than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. 943 F. 2d, at 836.But that statement has relevance only to the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishments.Unlike the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause, which isconcerned with matters such as the duration or conditions ofconfinement, "[t]he Excessive Fines Clause limits the government's power to extract payments, whether in cash or inkind, as punishment for some offense."Austin v. UnitedStates, post, at 609-610 (emphasis and internal quotationmarks omitted); accord, Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt.,Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U. S. 257, 265 (1989) ("[A]tthe time of the drafting and ratification of the [Eighth]Amendment, the word `fine' was understood to mean a payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense"); id., at265, n. 6. Thein personam criminal forfeiture at issue hereis clearly a form of monetary punishment no different, forEighth Amendment purposes, from a traditional "fine." Ac3 This sense of disproportionality animates much of petitioner's FirstAmendment arguments as well. Questions of proportionality, however,should be dealt with directly and forthrightly under the Eighth Amendment and not be allowed to influence sub silentio courts' First Amendment analysis.509us3113M 04-04-97 17:55:40 PAGES OPINPGT559Cite as: 509 U. S. 544 (1993)Opinion of Souter, J.cord, Austin, supra.4 Accordingly, the forfeiture in thiscase should be analyzed under the Excessive Fines Clause.Petitioner contends that forfeiture of his entire businesswas an "excessive" penalty for the Government to exact "[o]nthe basis of a few materials the jury ultimately decided wereobscene." Brief for Petitioner 40. It is somewhat misleading, we think, to characterize the racketeering crimes forwhich petitioner was convicted as involving just a few materials ultimately found to be obscene. Petitioner was con-victed of creating and managing what the District Court described as "an enormous racketeering enterprise." App. toPet. for Cert. 160. It is in the light of the extensive criminalactivities which petitioner apparently conducted throughthis racketeering enterprise over a substantial period of timethat the question whether the forfeiture was "excessive"must be considered. We think it preferable that this question be addressed by the Court of Appeals in the firstinstance.For these reasons, we hold that RICO's forfeiture provi-sions, as applied in this case, did not violate the FirstAmendment, but that the Court of Appeals should have con-sidered whether they resulted in an "excessive" penaltywithin the meaning of the Eighth Amendment's ExcessiveFines Clause. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of theCourt of Appeals and remand the case for further proceed-ings consistent with this opinion.
