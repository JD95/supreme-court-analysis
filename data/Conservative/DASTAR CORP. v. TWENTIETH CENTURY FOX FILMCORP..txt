TWENTIETH CENTURY FOXFILM CORP.Opinion of the Courtcalled Crusade in Europe, based on the book, and Time as-signed its copyright in the series to Fox. The television series, consisting of 26 episodes, was first broadcast in 1949.It combined a soundtrack based on a narration of the bookwith film footage from the United States Army, Navy, andCoast Guard, the British Ministry of Information and WarOffice, the National Film Board of Canada, and unidentified"Newsreel Pool Cameramen." In 1975, Doubleday renewedthe copyright on the book as the " `proprietor of copyright ina work made for hire.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a. Fox,however, did not renew the copyright on the Crusade television series, which expired in 1977, leaving the televisionseries in the public domain.In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights in GeneralEisenhower's book, including the exclusive right to distribute the Crusade television series on video and to sublicenseothers to do so. Respondents SFM Entertainment and NewLine Home Video, Inc., in turn, acquired from Fox the exclusive rights to distribute Crusade on video. SFM obtainedthe negatives of the original television series, restored them,and repackaged the series on videotape; New Line distributed the videotapes.Enter petitioner Dastar. In 1995, Dastar decided to expand its product line from music compact discs to videos.Anticipating renewed interest in World War II on the 50thanniversary of the war's end, Dastar released a video setentitled World War II Campaigns in Europe. To make Campaigns, Dastar purchased eight beta cam tapes of the original version of the Crusade television series, which is in thepublic domain, copied them, and then edited the series.Dastar's Campaigns series is slightly more than half as longas the original Crusade television series. Dastar substituted a new opening sequence, credit page, and final closingfor those of the Crusade television series; inserted newchapter-title sequences and narrated chapter introductions;moved the "recap" in the Crusade television series to the539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN27Cite as: 539 U.

Dastar created new packaging for its Campaigns series and (as already noted) a newtitle.Dastar manufactured and sold the Campaigns video set asits own product. The advertising states: "Produced andDistributed by: Entertainment D istr ibuting " (which isowned by Dastar), and makes no reference to the Crusade television series. Similarly, the screen credits state"DASTAR CORP presents" and "an ENTERTAINMENTDISTRIBUTING Production," and list as executive producer, producer, and associate producer employees ofDastar. Supp. App. 2-3, 30. The Campaigns videos themselves also make no reference to the Crusade television se-ries, New Line's Crusade videotapes, or the book. Dastarsells its Campaigns videos to Sam's Club, Costco, Best Buy,and other retailers and mail-order companies for $25 per set,substantially less than New Line's video set.In 1998, respondents Fox, SFM, and New Line broughtthis action alleging that Dastar's sale of its Campaigns videoset infringes Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower'sbook and, thus, their exclusive television rights in the book.Respondents later amended their complaint to add claimsthat Dastar's sale of Campaigns "without proper credit" tothe Crusade television series constitutes "reverse passingoff "1 in violation of $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 60 Stat.441, 15 U.

As orig-inally enacted, $ 43(a) created a federal remedy against aperson who used in commerce either "a false designation oforigin, or any false description or representation" in connection with "any goods or services." 60 Stat. 441. As theSecond Circuit accurately observed with regard to the original enactment, however--and as remains true after the 1988revision--$ 43(a) "does not have boundless application as aremedy for unfair trade practices," Alfred Dunhill, Ltd. v.Interstate Cigar Co., 499 F. 2d 232, 237 (1974).

Moreover, every Circuitto consider the issue found $ 43(a) broad enough to encompass reverse passing off. See, e. g., Williams v. CurtissWright Corp., 691 F. 2d 168, 172 (CA3 1982); Arrow UnitedIndus., Inc. v. Hugh Richards, Inc., 678 F. 2d 410, 415 (CA21982); F. E. L. Publications, Ltd. v.

TheTrademark Law Revision Act of 1988 made clear that $ 43(a)covers origin of production as well as geographic origin.4Its language is amply inclusive, moreover, of reverse passingoff--if indeed it does not implicitly adopt the unanimouscourt-of-appeals jurisprudence on that subject. See, e. g.,likely to be damaged by the use of any such false description or representation." 60 Stat. 441.4 Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act now provides:"Any person who, on or in connection with any goods or services, or anycontainer for goods, uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, ordevice, or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, falseor misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation offact, which--"(A) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as tothe affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, services, or commercial activities by another person, or"(B) in commercial advertising or promotion, misrepresents the nature,characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or anotherperson's goods, services, or commercial activities,"shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or sheis or is likely to be damaged by such act." 15 U.

Ralston Purina Co., 913 F. 2d 958,963-964, n. 6 (CADC 1990) (Thomas, J.).Thus, as it comes to us, the gravamen of respondents' claimis that, in marketing and selling Campaigns as its own product without acknowledging its nearly wholesale reliance onthe Crusade television series, Dastar has made a "false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, orfalse or misleading representation of fact, which . . . is likelyto cause confusion . . . as to the origin . . . of his or her goods."$ 43(a). See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 8, 11. That claimwould undoubtedly be sustained if Dastar had bought someof New Line's Crusade videotapes and merely repackagedthem as its own. Dastar's alleged wrongdoing, however, isvastly different: It took a creative work in the public domain--the Crusade television series--copied it, made modifications (arguably minor), and produced its very own seriesof videotapes. If "origin" refers only to the manufactureror producer of the physical "goods" that are made availableto the public (in this case the videotapes), Dastar was theorigin. If, however, "origin" includes the creator of the underlying work that Dastar copied, then someone else (perhaps Fox) was the origin of Dastar's product. At bottom,we must decide what $ 43(a)(1)(A) of the Lanham Act meansby the "origin" of "goods."IIIThe dictionary definition of "origin" is "[t]he fact or process of coming into being from a source," and "[t]hat fromwhich anything primarily proceeds; source." Webster'sNew International Dictionary 1720-1721 (2d ed. 1949). Andthe dictionary definition of "goods" (as relevant here) is"[w]ares; merchandise." Id., at 1079. We think the mostnatural understanding of the "origin" of "goods"--the sourceof wares--is the producer of the tangible product sold in themarketplace, in this case the physical Campaigns videotapesold by Dastar. The concept might be stretched (as it was539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN32 DASTAR CORP. v. TWENTIETH CENTURY FOXFILM CORP.Opinion of the Courtunder the original version of $ 43(a)) 5 to include not only theactual producer, but also the trademark owner who commissioned or assumed responsibility for ("stood behind") production of the physical product. But as used in the LanhamAct, the phrase "origin of goods" is in our view incapable ofconnoting the person or entity that originated the ideas orcommunications that "goods" embody or contain. Such anextension would not only stretch the text, but it would beout of accord with the history and purpose of the LanhamAct and inconsistent with precedent.Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act prohibits actions liketrademark infringement that deceive consumers and impair aproducer's goodwill. It forbids, for example, the Coca-ColaCompany's passing off its product as Pepsi-Cola or reversepassing off Pepsi-Cola as its product. But the brand-loyalconsumer who prefers the drink that the Coca-Cola Company or PepsiCo sells, while he believes that that companyproduced (or at least stands behind the production of ) thatproduct, surely does not necessarily believe that that company was the "origin" of the drink in the sense that it wasthe very first to devise the formula. The consumer whobuys a branded product does not automatically assume thatthe brand-name company is the same entity that came upwith the idea for the product, or designed the product--andtypically does not care whether it is. The words of the Lan5 Under the 1946 version of the Act, $ 43(a) was read as providing a causeof action for trademark infringement even where the trademark ownerhad not itself produced the goods sold under its mark, but had licensedothers to sell under its name goods produced by them--the typical franchise arrangement. See, e. g., My Pie Int'l, Inc. v. Debould, Inc., 687 F. 2d919 (CA7 1982). This stretching of the concept "origin of goods" is seemingly no longer needed: The 1988 amendments to $ 43(a) now expresslyprohibit the use of any "word, term, name, symbol, or device," or "false ormisleading description of fact" that is likely to cause confusion as to "affiliation, connection, or association . . . with another person," or as to "sponsorship, or approval" of goods. 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a).539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN33Cite as: 539 U. S. 23 (2003)Opinion of the Courtham Act should not be stretched to cover matters that aretypically of no consequence to purchasers.It could be argued, perhaps, that the reality of purchaserconcern is different for what might be called a communicative product--one that is valued not primarily for its physi-cal qualities, such as a hammer, but for the intellectual content that it conveys, such as a book or, as here, a video. Thepurchaser of a novel is interested not merely, if at all, in theidentity of the producer of the physical tome (the publisher),but also, and indeed primarily, in the identity of the creatorof the story it conveys (the author). And the author, ofcourse, has at least as much interest in avoiding passing off(or reverse passing off) of his creation as does the publisher.For such a communicative product (the argument goes) "origin of goods" in $ 43(a) must be deemed to include not merelythe producer of the physical item (the publishing house Farrar, Straus and Giroux, or the video producer Dastar) butalso the creator of the content that the physical item conveys(the author Tom Wolfe, or--assertedly--respondents).The problem with this argument according special treatment to communicative products is that it causes the LanhamAct to conflict with the law of copyright, which addressesthat subject specifically. The right to copy, and to copywithout attribution, once a copyright has expired, like"the right to make [an article whose patent has expired]--including the right to make it in precisely the shape it carriedwhen patented--passes to the public." Sears, Roebuck &Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225, 230 (1964); see also KelloggCo. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U. S. 111, 121-122 (1938)."In general, unless an intellectual property right such as apatent or copyright protects an item, it will be subject tocopying." TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays,Inc., 532 U. S. 23, 29 (2001). The rights of a patentee orcopyright holder are part of a "carefully crafted bargain,"Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S.141, 150-151 (1989), under which, once the patent or copy539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN34 DASTAR CORP. v. TWENTIETH CENTURY FOXFILM CORP.Opinion of the Courtright monopoly has expired, the public may use the inventionor work at will and without attribution. Thus, in construingthe Lanham Act, we have been "careful to caution againstmisuse or over-extension" of trademark and related protections into areas traditionally occupied by patent or copyright.TrafFix, 532 U. S., at 29. "The Lanham Act," we havesaid, "does not exist to reward manufacturers for theirinnovation in creating a particular device; that is the pur-pose of the patent law and its period of exclusivity."Id.,at 34. Federal trademark law "has no necessary relation toinvention or discovery,"Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U. S. 82, 94(1879), but rather, by preventing competitors from copying"a source-identifying mark," "reduce[s] the customer's costsof shopping and making purchasing decisions," and "helpsassure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor)will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associatedwith a desirable product," Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson ProductsCo., 514 U. S. 159, 163-164 (1995) (internal quotation marksand citation omitted). Assuming for the sake of argumentthat Dastar's representation of itself as the "Producer" of itsvideos amounted to a representation that it originated thecreative work conveyed by the videos, allowing a cause ofaction under $ 43(a) for that representation would create aspecies of mutant copyright law that limits the public's "federal right to `copy and to use' " expired copyrights, BonitoBoats, supra, at 165.When Congress has wished to create such an addition tothe law of copyright, it has done so with much more specificity than the Lanham Act's ambiguous use of "origin." TheVisual Artists Rights Act of 1990, $ 603(a), 104 Stat. 5128,provides that the author of an artistic work "shall have theright . . . to claim authorship of that work." 17 U. S. C.$ 106A(a)(1)(A). That express right of attribution is carefully limited and focused: It attaches only to specified"work[s] of visual art," $ 101, is personal to the artist,$$ 106A(b) and (e), and endures only for "the life of the au539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN35Cite as: 539 U. S. 23 (2003)Opinion of the Courtthor," $ 106A(d)(1). Recognizing in $ 43(a) a cause of actionfor misrepresentation of authorship of noncopyrighted works(visual or otherwise) would render these limitations superfluous. A statutory interpretation that renders anotherstatute superfluous is of course to be avoided. E. g., Mackeyv. Lanier Collection Agency & Service, Inc., 486 U. S. 825,837, and n. 11 (1988).Reading "origin" in $ 43(a) to require attribution of uncopyrighted materials would pose serious practical problems.Without a copyrighted work as the basepoint, the word "origin" has no discernable limits. A video of the MGM filmCarmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would presumably require attribution not just to MGM, but to OscarHammerstein II (who wrote the musical on which the filmwas based), to Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on whichthe musical was based), and to Prosper Me' rime' e (who wrotethe novel on which the opera was based). In many cases,figuring out who is in the line of "origin" would be no simpletask. Indeed, in the present case it is far from clear thatrespondents have that status. Neither SFM nor New Linehad anything to do with the production of the Crusade television series--they merely were licensed to distribute thevideo version. While Fox might have a claim to being inthe line of origin, its involvement with the creation of thetelevision series was limited at best. Time, Inc., was theprincipal, if not the exclusive, creator, albeit under arrangement with Fox. And of course it was neither Fox nor Time,Inc., that shot the film used in the Crusade television series.Rather, that footage came from the United States Army,Navy, and Coast Guard, the British Ministry of Informationand War Office, the National Film Board of Canada, and unidentified "Newsreel Pool Cameramen." If anyone has aclaim to being the original creator of the material used inboth the Crusade television series and the Campaigns videotapes, it would be those groups, rather than Fox. We do not539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN36 DASTAR CORP. v. TWENTIETH CENTURY FOXFILM CORP.Opinion of the Courtthink the Lanham Act requires this search for the source ofthe Nile and all its tributaries.Another practical difficulty of adopting a special definitionof "origin" for communicative products is that it places themanufacturers of those products in a difficult position. Onthe one hand, they would face Lanham Act liability forfailing to credit the creator of a work on which their lawfulcopies are based; and on the other hand they could face Lan-ham Act liability forcrediting the creator if that should beregarded as implying the creator's "sponsorship or approval"of the copy, 15 U. S. C. $ 1125(a)(1)(A). In this case, for example, if Dastar had simply "copied [the television series] asCrusade in Europe and sold it as Crusade in Europe," without changing the title or packaging (including the originalcredits to Fox), it is hard to have confidence in respondents'assurance that they "would not be here on a Lanham Actcause of action," Tr. of Oral Arg. 35.Finally, reading $ 43(a) of the Lanham Act as creating acause of action for, in effect, plagiarism--the use of otherwise unprotected works and inventions without attribution--would be hard to reconcile with our previous decisions.For example, in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Samara Brothers,Inc., 529 U. S. 205 (2000), we considered whether productdesign trade dress can ever be inherently distinctive. WalMart produced "knockoffs" of children's clothes designed andmanufactured by Samara Brothers, containing only "minormodifications" of the original designs. Id., at 208. We concluded that the designs could not be protected under $ 43(a)without a showing that they had acquired "secondary meaning," id., at 214, so that they " `identify the source of theproduct rather than the product itself,' " id., at 211 (quotingInwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982)). This carefully considered limitation would be entirely pointless if the "original" producercould turn around and pursue a reverse-passing-off claimunder exactly the same provision of the Lanham Act. Sa539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN37Cite as: 539 U. S. 23 (2003)Opinion of the Courtmara would merely have had to argue that it was the "ori-gin" of the designs that Wal-Mart was selling as its own line.It was not, because "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act re-ferred to the producer of the clothes, and not the producerof the (potentially) copyrightable or patentable designs thatthe clothes embodied.Similarly under respondents' theory, the "origin of goods"provision of $ 43(a) would have supported the suit that werejected inBonito Boats, 489 U. S. 141, where the defendants had used molds to duplicate the plaintiff 's unpatentedboat hulls (apparently without crediting the plaintiff). Andit would have supported the suit we rejected in TrafFix,532 U. S. 23: The plaintiff, whose patents on flexible roadsigns had expired, and who could not prevail on a trade-dressclaim under $ 43(a) because the features of the signs werefunctional, would have had a reverse-passing-off claim forunattributed copying of his design.In sum, reading the phrase "origin of goods" in the Lanham Act in accordance with the Act's common-law foundations (which were not designed to protect originality or creativity), and in light of the copyright and patent laws (whichwere), we conclude that the phrase refers to the producerof the tangible goods that are offered for sale, and not tothe author of any idea, concept, or communication embodiedin those goods. Cf. 17 U. S. C. $ 202 (distinguishing betweena copyrighted work and "any material object in which thework is embodied"). To hold otherwise would be akin tofinding that $ 43(a) created a species of perpetual patent andcopyright, which Congress may not do. See Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U. S. 186, 208 (2003).The creative talent of the sort that lay behind the Campaigns videos is not left without protection. The originalfilm footage used in the Crusade television series could havebeen copyrighted, see 17 U. S. C. $ 102(a)(6), as was copyrighted (as a compilation) the Crusade television series, eventhough it included material from the public domain, see539US1 Unit: $U63 [07-06-05 20:26:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN38 DASTAR CORP. v.

And respondents' contention thatCampaigns infringes Doubleday's copyright in General Eisenhower's book is still a live question on remand. If,moreover, the producer of a video that substantially copiedthe Crusade series were, in advertising or promotion, to givepurchasers the impression that the video was quite differentfrom that series, then one or more of the respondents mighthave a cause of action--not for reverse passing off under the"confusion . . . as to the origin" provision of $ 43(a)(1)(A), butfor misrepresentation under the "misrepresents the nature,characteristics [or] qualities" provision of $ 43(a)(1)(B). Formerely saying it is the producer of the video, however, noLanham Act liability attaches to Dastar.* * *Because we conclude that Dastar was the "origin" of theproducts it sold as its own, respondents cannot prevail ontheir Lanham Act claim. We thus have no occasion to con-sider whether the Lanham Act permitted an award of doublepetitioner's profits. The judgment of the Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remandedfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
