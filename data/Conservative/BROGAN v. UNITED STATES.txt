This case presents the question whether there is an excep-tion to criminal liability under 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 for a falsestatement that consists of the mere denial of wrongdoing,the so-called "exculpatory no."IWhile acting as a union officer during 1987 and 1988, peti-tioner James Brogan accepted cash payments from JRDManagement Corporation, a real estate company whose em-ployees were represented by the union. On October 4, 1993,federal agents from the Department of Labor and the Inter-nal Revenue Service visited petitioner at his home. Theagents identified themselves and explained that they wereseeking petitioner's cooperation in an investigation of JRDand various individuals. They told petitioner that if hewished to cooperate, he should have an attorney contact theUnited States Attorney's Office, and that if he could not af-ford an attorney, one could be appointed for him.The agents then asked petitioner if he would answer somequestions, and he agreed. One question was whether he hadreceived any cash or gifts from JRD when he was a unionofficer. Petitioner's response was "no." At that point, the*Scott L. Nelson and Lisa Kemler filed a brief for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as amicus curiae urging reversal.522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN400 BROGAN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtagents disclosed that a search of JRD headquarters hadproduced company records showing the contrary. They alsotold petitioner that lying to federal agents in the course ofan investigation was a crime. Petitioner did not modify hisanswers, and the interview ended shortly thereafter.Petitioner was indicted for accepting unlawful cashpayments from an employer in violation of 29 U. S. C.$$ 186(b)(1), (a)(2), and (d)(2), and making a false statementwithin the jurisdiction of a federal agency in violation of18 U. S. C. $ 1001. He was tried, along with several codefendants, before a jury in the United States District Courtfor the Southern District of New York, and was found guilty.The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitaffirmed the convictions, 96 F. 3d 35 (1996). We granted certiorari on the issue of the "exculpatory no." 520 U. S. 1263(1997).IIAt the time petitioner falsely replied "no" to the Govern-ment investigators' question, 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 (1988 ed.)provided:"Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of anydepartment or agency of the United States knowinglyand willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick,scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false,fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, ormakes or uses any false writing or document knowingthe same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulentstatement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."By its terms, 18 U. S. C. $ 1001 covers "any" false state-ment--that is, a false statement "of whatever kind," UnitedStates v. Gonzales, 520 U. S. 1, 5 (1997) (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted). The word "no" in response toa question assuredly makes a "statement," see, e. g., Web-ster's New International Dictionary 2461 (2d ed. 1950) (def.522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN401Cite as: 522 U. S. 398 (1998)Opinion of the Court2: "That which is stated; an embodiment in words of facts oropinions"), and petitioner does not contest that his utterancewas false or that it was made "knowingly and willfully." Infact, petitioner concedes that under a "literal reading" of thestatute he loses. Brief for Petitioner 5.Petitioner asks us, however, to depart from the literal textthat Congress has enacted, and to approve the doctrineadopted by many Circuits which excludes from the scope of$ 1001 the "exculpatory no." The central feature of this doctrine is that a simple denial of guilt does not come withinthe statute. See,e. g., Moser v. United States, 18 F. 3d 469,473-474 (CA7 1994); United States v. Taylor, 907 F. 2d 801,805 (CA8 1990); United States v. Equihua-Juarez, 851 F. 2d1222, 1224 (CA9 1988); United States v. Cogdell, 844 F. 2d179, 183 (CA4 1988); United States v. Tabor, 788 F. 2d 714,717-719 (CA11 1986); United States v. Fitzgibbon, 619 F. 2d874, 880-881 (CA10 1980); United States v. Chevoor, 526 F. 2d178, 183-184 (CA1 1975), cert. denied, 425 U. S. 935 (1976).There is considerable variation among the Circuits concerning, among other things, what degree of elaborated taletelling carries a statement beyond simple denial. See generally Annot., 102 A. L. R. Fed. 742 (1991). In the presentcase, however, the Second Circuit agreed with petitioner thathis statement would constitute a "true `exculpatory n[o]' asrecognized in other circuits," 96 F. 3d, at 37, but aligned itselfwith the Fifth Circuit (one of whose panels had been thevery first to embrace the "exculpatory no," see Paternostrov. United States, 311 F. 2d 298 (CA5 1962)) in categoricallyrejecting the doctrine, see United States v. Rodriguez-Rios,14 F. 3d 1040 (CA5 1994) (en banc).Petitioner's argument in support of the "exculpatory no"doctrine proceeds from the major premise that $ 1001 criminalizes only those statements to Government investigatorsthat "pervert governmental functions"; to the minor premisethat simple denials of guilt to Government investigators donot pervert governmental functions; to the conclusion that522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN402 BROGAN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court$ 1001 does not criminalize simple denials of guilt to Govern-ment investigators. Both premises seem to us mistaken.As to the minor: We cannot imagine how it could be truethat falsely denying guilt in a Government investigation doesnot pervert a governmental function. Certainly the investi-gation of wrongdoing is a proper governmental function; andsince it is the very purpose of an investigation to uncoverthe truth, any falsehood relating to the subject of the investigation perverts that function. It could be argued, perhaps,that adisbelieved falsehood does not pervert an investiga-tion. But making the existence of this crime turn upon thecredulousness of the federal investigator (or the persuasiveness of the liar) would be exceedingly strange; such a defenseto the analogous crime of perjury is certainly unheard of.1Moreover, as we shall see, the only support for the "perversion of governmental functions" limitation is a statement ofthis Court referring to thepossibility (as opposed to thecertainty) of perversion of function--a possibility that existswhenever investigators are told a falsehood relevant totheir task.In any event, we find no basis for the major premise thatonly those falsehoods that pervert governmental functionsare covered by $ 1001. Petitioner derives this premise froma comment we made inUnited States v. Gilliland, 312 U. S.86 (1941), a case involving the predecessor to $ 1001. Thatearlier version of the statute subjected to criminal liability" `whoever shall knowingly and willfully . . . make or causeto be made any false or fraudulent statements or representa-tions, or make or use or cause to be made or used any falsebill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit,1 "The government need not show that because of the perjured testimony, the grand jury threw in the towel. . . .

S 903 (1978). See generally 70 C. J. S. Perjury $ 13,pp. 260-261 (1987).522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN403Cite as: 522 U. S. 398 (1998)Opinion of the Courtor deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulentor fictitious statement or entry, in any matter within thejurisdiction of any department or agency of the UnitedStates . . . .' " Id., at 92-93. The defendant in Gilliland,relying on the interpretive canon ejusdem generis,2 arguedthat the statute should be read to apply only to matters inwhich the Government has a financial or proprietary interest. In rejecting that argument, we noted that Congresshad specifically amended the statute to cover " `any matterwithin the jurisdiction of any department or agency of theUnited States,' " thereby indicating "the congressional intentto protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might resultfrom the deceptive practices described." Id., at 93. Petitioner would elevate this statement to a holding that $ 1001does not apply where a perversion of governmental functionsdoes not exist. But it is not, and cannot be, our practice torestrict the unqualified language of a statute to the particular evil that Congress was trying to remedy--even assumingthat it is possible to identify that evil from something otherthan the text of the statute itself. The holding of Gillilandcertainly does not exemplify such a practice, since it rejectedthe defendant's argument for a limitation that the text of thestatute would not bear. And even the relied-upon dictumfrom Gilliland does not support restricting text to supposedpurpose, but to the contrary acknowledges the reality thatthe reach of a statute often exceeds the precise evil to beeliminated. There is no inconsistency whatever betweenthe proposition that Congress intended "to protect the authorized functions of governmental departments and agencies from the perversion which might result" and the propo2 "Under the principle of ejusdem generis, when a general term followsa specific one, the general term should be understood as a reference tosubjects akin to the one with specific enumeration."

UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtsition that the statute forbids all "the deceptive practicesdescribed."Ibid.The second line of defense that petitioner invokes for the"exculpatory no" doctrine is inspired by the Fifth Amendment. He argues that a literal reading of $ 1001 violates the"spirit" of the Fifth Amendment because it places a "cor-nered suspect" in the "cruel trilemma" of admitting guilt,remaining silent, or falsely denying guilt. Brief for Peti-tioner 11. This "trilemma" is wholly of the guilty suspect'sown making, of course. An innocent person will not findhimself in a similar quandary (as one commentator has putit, the innocent person lacks even a "lemma," Allen, TheSimpson Affair, Reform of the Criminal Justice Process, andMagic Bullets, 67 U. Colo. L. Rev. 989, 1016 (1996)). Andeven the honest and contrite guilty person will not regardthe third prong of the "trilemma" (the blatant lie) as anavailable option. The bon mot "cruel trilemma" first appeared in Justice Goldberg's opinion for the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n of N. Y. Harbor, 378 U. S. 52(1964), where it was used to explain the importance of a suspect's Fifth Amendment right to remain silent when subpoenaed to testify in an official inquiry. Without that right, theopinion said, he would be exposed "to the cruel trilemma ofself-accusation, perjury or contempt." Id., at 55. In orderto validate the "exculpatory no," the elements of this "crueltrilemma" have now been altered--ratcheted up, as it were,so that the right to remain silent, which was the liberationfrom the original trilemma, is now itself a cruelty. We arenot disposed to write into our law this species of compassion inflation.Whether or not the predicament of the wrongdoer run toground tugs at the heartstrings, neither the text nor thespirit of the Fifth Amendment confers a privilege to lie."[P]roper invocation of the Fifth Amendment privilegeagainst compulsory self-incrimination allows a witness to remain silent, but not to swear falsely." United States v. Ap522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN405Cite as: 522 U. S. 398 (1998)Opinion of the Courtfelbaum, 445 U. S. 115, 117 (1980). See also United Statesv.Wong, 431 U. S. 174, 180 (1977); Bryson v. United States,396 U. S. 64, 72 (1969). Petitioner contends that silence isan "illusory" option because a suspect may fear that his silence will be used against him later, or may not even knowthat silence is an available option. Brief for Petitioner 12-13. As to the former: It is well established that the factthat a person's silence can be used against him--either assubstantive evidence of guilt or to impeach him if he takesthe stand--does not exert a form of pressure that exoneratesan otherwise unlawful lie. SeeUnited States v. Knox, 396U. S. 77, 81-82 (1969). And as for the possibility that theperson under investigation may be unaware of his right toremain silent: In the modern age of frequently dramatized"Miranda" warnings, that is implausible. Indeed, we foundit implausible (or irrelevant) 30 years ago, unless the suspectwas "in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way," Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S.436, 445 (1966).Petitioner repeats the argument made by many supportersof the "exculpatory no," that the doctrine is necessary toeliminate the grave risk that $ 1001 will become an instrument of prosecutorial abuse. The supposed danger is thatoverzealous prosecutors will use this provision as a meansof "piling on" offenses--sometimes punishing the denial ofwrongdoing more severely than the wrongdoing itself. Theobjectors' principal grievance on this score, however, lies notwith the hypothetical prosecutors but with Congress itself,which has decreed the obstruction of a legitimate investigation to be a separate offense, and a serious one. It is notfor us to revise that judgment. Petitioner has been unableto demonstrate, moreover, any history of prosecutorial excess, either before or after widespread judicial acceptance ofthe "exculpatory no." And finally, if there is a problem ofsupposed "overreaching" it is hard to see how the doctrineof the "exculpatory no" could solve it. It is easy enough for522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN406 BROGAN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtan interrogator to press the liar from the initial simple denialto a more detailed fabrication that would not qualify forthe exemption. IIIA brief word in response to the dissent's assertion that theCourt may interpret a criminal statute more narrowly thanit is written: Some of the cases it cites for that propositionrepresent instances in which the Court did not purport to bedeparting from a reasonable reading of the text, UnitedStates v. X-Citement Video, Inc., 513 U. S. 64, 77-78 (1994);Williams v. United States, 458 U. S. 279, 286-287 (1982). Inthe others, the Court applied what it thought to be a back-ground interpretive principle of general application. Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 619 (1994) (construingstatute to contain common-law requirement of mens rea);Sorrells v. United States, 287 U. S. 435, 446 (1932) (constru-ing statute not to cover violations produced by entrapment);United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 631 (1818) (construingstatute not to apply extraterritorially to noncitizens). Alsointo this last category falls the dissent's correct assertionthat the present statute does not "mak[e] it a crime for anundercover narcotics agent to make a false statement toa drug peddler."Post, at 419 (opinion of Stevens, J.).Criminal prohibitions do not generally apply to reasonableenforcement actions by officers of the law. See, e. g., 2P. Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses $ 142(a), p. 121 (1984)("Every American jurisdiction recognizes some form of lawenforcement authority justification").It is one thing to acknowledge and accept such well defined(or even newly enunciated), generally applicable, backgroundprinciples of assumed legislative intent. It is quite anotherto espouse the broad proposition that criminal statutes donot have to be read as broadly as they are written, butare subject to case-by-case exceptions. The problem withadopting such an expansive, user-friendly judicial rule is thatthere is no way of knowing when, or how, the rule is to be522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN407Cite as: 522 U. S. 398 (1998)Opinion of the Courtinvoked. As to the when: The only reason Justice Stevens adduces for invoking it here is that a felony convictionfor this offense seems to him harsh. Which it may well be.But the instances in which courts may ignore harsh penaltiesare set forth in the Constitution, see Art. I, $ 9; Art. III, $ 3;Amdt. 8; Amdt. 14, $ 1; and to go beyond them will surelyleave us at sea. And as to the how: There is no reason inprinciple why the dissent chooses to mitigate the harshnessby saying that $ 1001 does not embrace the "exculpatory no,"rather than by saying that $ 1001 has no application unlessthe defendant has been warned of the consequences of lying,or indeed unless the defendant has been put under oath. Weare again at sea.To be sure, some of this uncertainty would be eliminated,at our stage of judging, if we wrenched out of its context theprinciple quoted by the dissent from Sir Edward Coke, that"communis opinio is of good authoritie in law," 3 and if weapplied that principle consistently to a consensus in the judgments of the courts of appeals. (Of course the courts of appeals themselves, and the district courts, would still be entirely at sea, until such time as a consensus would havedeveloped.) But the dissent does not propose, and its authorhas not practiced, consistent application of the principle, see,e. g., Hubbard v. United States, 514 U. S. 695, 713 (1995)(opinion of Stevens, J.) ("We think the text of $ 1001 forecloses any argument that we should simply ratify the bodyof cases adopting the judicial function exception"); Chapmanv. United States, 500 U. S. 453, 468 (1991) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (disagreeing with the unanimous conclusions of theCourts of Appeals that interpreted the criminal statute at3 Coke said this in reference not to statutory law but to the lex communis, which most of his illustrious treatise dealt with. 1 E. Coke, Institutes186a (15th ed. 1794). As applied to that, of course, the statement is notonly true but almost an iteration; it amounts to saying that the commonlaw is the common law.522US2 Unit: $U22 [01-28-00 18:17:50] PAGES PGT: OPIN408 BROGAN v. UNITED STATESGinsburg, J., concurring in judgmentissue); thus it becomes yet another user-friendly judicial ruleto be invokedad libitum.* * *In sum, we find nothing to support the "exculpatory no"doctrine except the many Court of Appeals decisions thathave embraced it. While communis error facit jus may bea sadly accurate description of reality, it is not the normativebasis of this Court's jurisprudence. Courts may not createtheir own limitations on legislation, no matter how alluringthe policy arguments for doing so, and no matter how widelythe blame may be spread. Because the plain language of$ 1001 admits of no exception for an "exculpatory no," weaffirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.
