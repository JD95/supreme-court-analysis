We must decide in these cases whether the current methodof appointing military judges violates the AppointmentsClause of the Constitution, and whether the lack of a fixedterm of office for military judges violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. We conclude that neither con-stitutional provision is violated.Petitioner Weiss, a United States Marine, pleaded guiltyat a special court-martial to one count of larceny, in violationof Article 121 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice(UCMJ or Code), 10 U.

Rely-ing on its recent decision inUnited States v. Graf, 35 M. J.450 (1992), cert. pending, No. 92-1102, in which the courtunanimously held that due process does not require militaryjudges to have a fixed term of office, the court rejectedWeiss' due process argument. 36 M. J. 224, 235, n. 1 (1992).In a splintered decision, the court also rejected petitioner'sAppointments Clause challenge.Two of the five judges concluded that the initial appointment of military trial and appellate judges as commissionedofficers is sufficient to satisfy the Appointments Clause.Id.,at 225-234 (plurality opinion). A separate appointment before taking on the duties of a military judge is unnecessary,according to the plurality, in part because the duties ofa judge in the military justice system are germane to theduties that military officers already discharge. Ibid. Onejudge concurred in the result only, concluding that the Appointments Clause does not apply to the military. Id., at234-240 (opinion of Crawford, J.). The other two judgesdissented separately. Both stressed the significant changesbrought about by the Military Justice Act of 1968, particularly the duties added to the newly created office of militaryjudge, and both concluded that the duties of a military judgeare sufficiently distinct from the other duties performed bymilitary officers to require a second appointment. See id.,at 240-256 (Sullivan, C. J., dissenting), and id., at 256-263(Wiss, J., dissenting).The Court of Military Appeals accordingly affirmed petitioner Weiss' conviction.

See U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 14.At the trial level are the courts-martial, of which there arethree types: summary, special, and general. The summarycourt-martial adjudicates only minor offenses, has jurisdic-tion only over servicemembers, and can be conducted onlywith their consent. It is presided over by a single commis-sioned officer who can impose up to one month of confinementand other relatively modest punishments. Arts. 16(3), 20,UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $$ 816(3), 820.The special court-martial usually consists of a militaryjudge and three court-martial members,1 although the Codeallows the members to sit without a judge, or the accused toelect to be tried by the judge alone. Art. 16(2), UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 816(2). A special court-martial has jurisdictionover most offenses under the UCMJ, but it may impose punishment no greater than six months of confinement, threemonths of hard labor without confinement, a bad-conduct discharge, partial and temporary forfeiture of pay, and a reduc-tion in grade. Art. 19, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 819. The general court-martial consists of either a military judge and atleast five members, or the judge alone if the accused so requests. Art. 16(1), UCMJ, 10 U. S.

There are approximately 74 judgescurrently certified to preside at general and special courtsmartial. An additional 25 are certified to preside only overspecial courts-martial.At the next tier are the four Courts of Military Review,one each for the Army, Air Force, Coast Guard, and NavyMarine Corps. These courts, which usually sit in threejudge panels, review all cases in which the sentence imposedis for one or more years of confinement, involves the dismissal of a commissioned officer, or involves the punitive discharge of an enlisted servicemember.

The judges are selectedand assigned to serve by the appropriate Judge AdvocateGeneral. Ibid. Like military trial judges, appellate judgesdo not serve for a fixed term. There are presently 31 appellate military judges.Atop the system is the Court of Military Appeals, whichconsists of five civilian judges who are appointed by thePresident, with the advice and consent of the Senate, forfixed terms of 15 years. Arts. 67, 142, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C.$$ 867, 942 (1988 ed., Supp. IV). The appointment and tenure of these judges are not at issue here.IThe Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitutionreads as follows:"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with theAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of thesupreme Court, and all other Officers of the UnitedStates, whose Appointments are not herein otherwiseprovided for, and which shall be established by Law:but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment ofsuch inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads ofDepartments." U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2.We begin our analysis on common ground. The parties donot dispute that military judges, because of the authority andresponsibilities they possess, act as "Officers" of the UnitedStates. SeeFreytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868 (1991)(concluding special trial judges of Tax Court are officers);Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 126 (1976) ("[A]ny appointeeexercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of theUnited States is an `Officer of the United States,' and must,510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT170 WEISS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttherefore, be appointed in the manner prescribed by [the Ap-pointments Clause]"). The parties are also in agreement,and rightly so, that the Appointments Clause applies to mili-tary officers. As we said in Buckley, "all officers of theUnited States are to be appointed in accordance with theClause. . . . No class or type of officer is excluded because ofits special functions." Id., at 132 (emphasis in original).It follows that those serving as military judges must beappointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause. All of themilitary judges involved in these cases, however, were already commissioned officers when they were assigned toserve as judges,4 and thus they had already been appointedby the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.5The question we must answer, therefore, is whether theseofficers needed another appointment pursuant to the Appointments Clause before assuming their judicial duties.Petitioners contend that the position of military judge is sodifferent from other positions to which an officer may be assigned that either Congress has, by implication, required asecond appointment, or the Appointments Clause, by constitutional command, requires one. We reject both of thesearguments.Petitioners' argument that Congress by implication has re-quired a separate appointment is based in part on the factthat military judges must possess certain qualifications, in4 The constitutionality of the provision allowing civilians to be assignedto Courts of Military Review, without being appointed pursuant to theAppointments Clause, obviously presents a quite different question. SeeArt. 66(a), UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 866(a). It is not at issue here.5 Although the record before us does not contain complete informationregarding the military careers of the judges involved in these cases, it isquite possible that they had been appointed more than once before beingdetailed or assigned to serve as military judges. This is because 10U. S. C. $ 624 requires a new appointment by the President, with theadvice and consent of the Senate, each time a commissioned officer ispromoted to a higher grade--e. g., if a captain is promoted to major, hemust receive another appointment.510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT171Cite as: 510 U. S. 163 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcluding membership in a state or federal bar. But such spe-cial qualifications in themselves do not, we believe, indicatea congressional intent to create a separate office. Specialqualifications are needed to perform a host of military duties; yet no one could seriously contend that the positionsof military lawyer or pilot, for example, are distinct officesbecause officers performing those duties must possessadditional qualifications.Petitioners' argument also ignores the fact that Congresshas not hesitated to expressly require the separate appoint-ment of military officers to certain positions. An additionalappointment by the President and confirmation by the Senate is required for a number of top-level positions in the military hierarchy, including: the Chairman and Vice Chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 10 U. S. C. $$ 152, 154; the Chiefand Vice Chief of Naval Operations, $$ 5033, 5035; the Commandant and Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps,$$ 5043, 5044; the Surgeons General of the Army, Navy, andAir Force, $$ 3036, 5137, 8036; the Chief of Naval Personnel,$ 5141; the Chief of Chaplains, $ 5142; and the Judge Advocates General of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, $$ 3037,5148, 8037.With respect to other positions, however, Congress hasspoken quite differently. The Deputy and Assistant Chiefsof Staff for the Army, for example, are "general officers detailed to these positions." $ 3035 (emphasis added). TheChief of Staff of the Marine Corps and his assistants are"detailed" to those positions by the Secretary of the Navy.$ 5045. Commissioned officers "may be detailed for duty"with the American Red Cross by the appropriate militarySecretary. $ 711a. Secretaries of military departments"may assign or detail members of the armed forces" to beinspectors of buildings owned or occupied abroad by theUnited States. $ 713. The Secretary of the Navy "may assign" enlisted members of the Navy to serve as custodiansof foreign embassies and consulates. $ 5983. And the Pres510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT172 WEISS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtident may "detail" officers of the Navy to serve as superin-tendents or instructors at nautical schools. This contrastingtreatment indicates rather clearly that Congress repeatedlyand consistently distinguished between an office that wouldrequire a separate appointment and a position or duty towhich one could be "assigned" or "detailed" by a superiorofficer.The sections of the UCMJ relating to military judgesspeak explicitly and exclusively in terms of "detail" or "assign"; nowhere in these sections is mention made of a sepa-rate appointment. Section 826(a) provides that a militaryjudge shall be "detail[ed]" to each general court-martial, andmay be "detail[ed]" to any special court-martial. The military judge of a general court-martial must be designated bythe Judge Advocate General, or his designee, $ 826(c), but theappropriate Service Secretary prescribes by regulation themanner in which military judges are detailed for specialcourts-martial, and what persons are authorized to so detailthem. Section 866, in turn, provides that military appellatejudges shall be "assigned to a Court of Military Review."The appropriate Judge Advocate General designates a chiefjudge for each Court of Military Review, and the chief judgedetermines "on which panels of the court the appellatejudges assigned to the court will serve and which militaryjudge assigned to the court will act as the senior judge oneach panel." Ibid. (emphasis added).Congress' treatment of military judges is thus quite different from its treatment of those offices, such as Chairman ofthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, for which it wished to require asecond appointment before already-commissioned officerscould occupy them. This difference negates any permissibleinference that Congress intended that military judges shouldreceive a second appointment, but in a fit of absentmindedness forgot to say so.Petitioners' alternative contention is that even if Congressdid not intend to require a separate appointment for a mili510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT173Cite as: 510 U. S. 163 (1994)Opinion of the Courttary judge, the Appointments Clause requires such an ap-pointment by its own force. They urge upon us in supportof this contention our decisions in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S.1 (1976), Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868 (1991), andMorrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988). These decisionsundoubtedly establish the analytical framework upon whichto base the conclusion that a military judge is an "officer ofthe United States"--a proposition to which both partiesagree. But the decisions simply do not speak to the issue ofwhether, and when, the Appointments Clause may require asecond appointment.The lead and dissenting opinions in the Court of MilitaryAppeals devoted considerable attention to, and the partiesbefore us have extensively briefed, the significance of ouropinion in Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282 (1893).There Congress had enacted a statute establishing a commission to supervise the development of Rock Creek Park in theDistrict of Columbia. Three of the members were appointed by the President with the advice and consent of theSenate, but the remaining two members were the Chief ofEngineers of the Army and the Engineer Commissioner ofthe District of Columbia. Both of the latter were alreadycommissioned as military officers, but it was contended thatthe Appointments Clause required that they again be appointed to their new positions. The Court rejected theargument, saying:"[T]he argument is, that while Congress may create anoffice, it cannot appoint the officer; that the officer canonly be appointed by the President with the approval ofthe Senate. . . . As, however, the two persons whoseeligibility is questioned were at the time of the passageof the act . . . officers of the United States who had beentheretofore appointed by the President and confirmedby the Senate, we do not think that, because additionalduties, germane to the offices already held by them,were devolved upon them by the act, it was necessary510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT174 WEISS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthat they should be again appointed by the Presidentand confirmed by the Senate. It cannot be doubted, andit has frequently been the case, that Congress may in-crease the power and duties of an existing office withoutthereby rendering it necessary that the incumbentshould be again nominated and appointed."Id., at300-301.The present cases before us differ from Shoemaker in sev-eral respects, at least one of which is significant for purposesof Appointments Clause analysis. In Shoemaker, Congressassigned new duties to two existing offices, each of whichwas held by a single officer. This no doubt prompted theCourt's description of the argument as being that "whileCongress may create an office, it cannot appoint the officer."By looking to whether the additional duties assigned to theoffices were "germane," the Court sought to ensure thatCongress was not circumventing the Appointments Clauseby unilaterally appointing an incumbent to a new and dis-tinct office. But here the statute authorized an indefinitenumber of military judges, who could be designated fromamong hundreds or perhaps thousands of qualified commissioned officers. In short, there is no ground for suspicionhere that Congress was trying to both create an office andalso select a particular individual to fill the office. Nor hasCongress effected a "diffusion of the appointment power,"about which this Court expressed concern in Freytag, supra,at 878.Even if we assume, arguendo, that the principle of "ger-maneness" applies to the present situation, we think thatprinciple is satisfied here. By enacting the Uniform Code ofMilitary Justice in 1950, and through subsequent statutorychanges, Congress has gradually changed the system of mili-tary justice so that it has come to more closely resemble thecivilian system. But the military in important respects re-mains a "specialized society separate from civilian society,"Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 743 (1974). Although military510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT175Cite as: 510 U. S. 163 (1994)Opinion of the Courtjudges obviously perform certain unique and important func-tions, all military officers, consistent with a long tradition,play a role in the operation of the military justice system.Commissioned officers, for example, have the power andduty to "quell quarrels, frays, and disorders among personssubject to [the UCMJ] and to apprehend persons subject to[the UCMJ] who take part therein." Art. 7(c), UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 807(c). Commanding officers can impose nonjudi-cial disciplinary punishment for minor offenses, without theintervention of a court-martial, which includes correctionalcustody, forfeiture of pay, reduction in grade, extra duties,restriction to certain limits, and detention of pay. Art. 15,UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 815. A commissioned officer may serveas a summary court-martial or a member of a special orgeneral court-martial. When acting as a summary courtmartial or as the president of a special court-martial withouta military judge, this officer conducts the proceedings andresolves all issues that would be handled by the militaryjudge, except for challenge for cause against the presidentof a special court-martial without a military judge. Art.51, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 851. Convening authorities, finally,have the authority to review and modify the sentence imposed by courts-martial. Art. 60, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 860.Thus, by contrast to civilian society, nonjudicial militaryofficers play a significant part in the administration ofmilitary justice.By the same token, the position of military judge is lessdistinct from other military positions than the office of fulltime civilian judge is from other offices in civilian society.As the lead opinion in the Court of Military Appeals noted,military judges do not have any "inherent judicial authorityseparate from a court-martial to which they have been detailed. When they act, they do so as a court-martial, not asa military judge. Until detailed to a specific court-martial,they have no more authority than any other military officerof the same grade and rank." 36 M. J., at 228. Military510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT176 WEISS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtappellate judges similarly exercise judicial functions onlywhen they are "assigned" to a Court of Military Review.Neither military trial nor appellate judges, moreover, havea fixed term of office. Commissioned officers are assignedor detailed to the position of military judge by a Judge Advo-cate General for a period of time he deems necessary or appropriate, and then they may be reassigned to perform otherduties. Even while serving as military trial judges, officersmay perform, with the permission of the Judge AdvocateGeneral, duties unrelated to their judicial responsibilities.Art. 26(c), UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 826(c). Whatever might bethe case in civilian society, we think that the role of militaryjudge is "germane" to that of military officer.In sum, we believe that the current scheme satisfies theAppointments Clause. It is quite clear that Congress hasnot required a separate appointment to the position of military judge, and we believe it equally clear that the Appoint-ments Clause by its own force does not require a second appointment before military officers may discharge the dutiesof such a judge.IIPetitioners next contend that the Due Process Clause re-quires that military judges must have a fixed term of office.Petitioners recognize, as they must, that the Constitutiondoes not require life tenure for Article I judges, includingmilitary judges. See United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles,350 U. S. 11, 17 (1955). Nor does the trial by an Article Ijudge lacking life tenure violate an accused's due processrights. See Palmore v. United States, 411 U. S. 389, 410(1973). Petitioners thus confine their argument to the asser-tion that due process requires military judges to serve forsome fixed length of time--however short.Congress, of course, is subject to the requirements of theDue Process Clause when legislating in the area of militaryaffairs, and that Clause provides some measure of protectionto defendants in military proceedings. See Rostker v. Gold510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT177Cite as: 510 U. S. 163 (1994)Opinion of the Courtberg, 453 U. S. 57, 67 (1981); Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S.25, 43 (1976). But in determining what process is due,courts "must give particular deference to the determinationof Congress, made under its authority to regulate the landand naval forces, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8." Ibid. Petitioners urge that we apply the due process analysis establishedinMathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 334-335 (1976). TheGovernment contends that Medina v. California, 505 U. S.437 (1992), supplies the appropriate analytical framework.Neither Mathews nor Medina, however, arose in the mili-tary context, and we have recognized in past cases that "thetests and limitations [of due process] may differ because ofthe military context." Rostker, supra, at 67. The difference arises from the fact that the Constitution contemplatesthat Congress has "plenary control over rights, duties, andresponsibilities in the framework of the Military Establishment, including regulations, procedures, and remedies related to military discipline." Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S.296, 301 (1983). Judicial deference thus "is at its apogee"when reviewing congressional decisionmaking in this area.Rostker, supra, at 70. Our deference extends to rules relating to the rights of servicemembers: "Congress has primaryresponsibility for the delicate task of balancing the rights ofservicemen against the needs of the military. . . . [W]e haveadhered to this principle of deference in a variety of contextswhere, as here, the constitutional rights of servicemen wereimplicated." Solorio v. United States, 483 U. S. 435, 447-448 (1987).We therefore believe that the appropriate standard toapply in these cases is found in Middendorf, supra, wherewe also faced a due process challenge to a facet of the military justice system. In determining whether the Due Process Clause requires that servicemembers appearing beforea summary court-martial be assisted by counsel, we asked"whether the factors militating in favor of counsel at summary courts-martial are so extraordinarily weighty as to510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT178 WEISS v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtovercome the balance struck by Congress." 425 U. S., at 44.We ask the same question here with respect to fixed termsof office for military judges.It is elementary that "a fair trial in a fair tribunal is abasic requirement of due process." In re Murchison, 349U. S. 133, 136 (1955). A necessary component of a fair trialis an impartial judge. See ibid.; Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S.510, 532 (1927). Petitioners, however, do not allege that thejudges in their cases were or appeared to be biased. In-stead, they ask us to assume that a military judge who doesnot have a fixed term of office lacks the independence neces-sary to ensure impartiality. Neither history nor currentpractice, however, supports such an assumption.AAlthough a fixed term of office is a traditional componentof the Anglo-American civilian judicial system, it has neverbeen a part of the military justice tradition. The early Eng-lish military tribunals, which served as the model for ourown military justice system, were historically convened andpresided over by a military general. No tenured militaryjudge presided. See Schlueter, The Court-Martial: An His-torical Survey, 87 Mil. L. Rev. 129, 135, 136-144 (1980).In the United States, although Congress has on numerousoccasions during our history revised the procedures governing courts-martial, it has never required tenured judges topreside over courts-martial or to hear immediate appealstherefrom.6 See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents6 Congress did create a nine-member commission in 1983 to examine,inter alia, the possibility of providing tenure for military judges. Military Justice Act of 1983, Pub. L. 98-209, $ 9(b), 97 Stat. 1393, 1404-1405(1983). The commission published its report a year later, in which it recommended against providing a guaranteed term of office for military trialand appellate judges. See D. Schlueter, Military Criminal Justice: Practice and Procedure 33-34, and nn. 86, 87 (3d ed. 1992) (listing members ofcommission and describing report). Congress has taken no further actionon the subject.510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT179Cite as: 510 U. S. 163 (1994)Opinion of the Court21-24, 953-1000 (2d ed. 1920) (describing and reprinting theArticles of War, which governed court-martial proceedingsduring the 17th and 18th centuries); F. Gilligan & F. Lederer,1 Court-Martial Procedure 11-24 (1991) (describing 20thcentury revisions to Articles of War, and enactment ofand amendments to UCMJ). Indeed, as already mentioned,Congress did not even create the position of military judgeuntil 1968. Courts-martial thus have been conducted in thiscountry for over 200 years without the presence of a tenuredjudge, and for over 150 years without the presence of anyjudge at all. BAs the Court of Military Appeals observed in Graf, 35M. J., at 462, the historical maintenance of the military justice system without tenured judges "suggests the absence ofa fundamental fairness problem." Petitioners in effect urgeus to disregard this history, but we are unwilling to do so.We do not mean to say that any practice in military courtswhich might have been accepted at some time in history au-tomatically satisfies due process of law today. But as Congress has taken affirmative steps to make the system ofmilitary justice more like the American system of civilianjustice, it has nonetheless chosen not to give tenure to mili-tary judges. The question under the Due Process Clause iswhether the existence of such tenure is such an extraordi-narily weighty factor as to overcome the balance struck byCongress. And the historical fact that military judges havenever had tenure is a factor that must be weighed in thiscalculation.A fixed term of office, as petitioners recognize, is not anend in itself. It is a means of promoting judicial independ-ence, which in turn helps to ensure judicial impartiality. Webelieve the applicable provisions of the UCMJ, and corre-sponding regulations, by insulating military judges from theeffects of command influence, sufficiently preserve judicialimpartiality so as to satisfy the Due Process Clause.510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT180 WEISS v.

C. $ 826.Rather than exacerbating the alleged problems relating tojudicial independence, as petitioners suggest, we believe thisstructure helps protect that independence. Like all militaryofficers, Congress made military judges accountable to a superior officer for the performance of their duties. By placing judges under the control of Judge Advocates General,who have no interest in the outcome of a particular courtmartial, we believe Congress has achieved an acceptable balance between independence and accountability.Article 26 also protects against unlawful command influence by precluding a convening authority or any commanding officer from preparing or reviewing any reportconcerning the effectiveness, fitness, or efficiency of a military judge relating to his judicial duties. Ibid. Article 37prohibits convening authorities from censuring, reprimanding, or admonishing a military judge "with respect to thefindings or sentence adjudged by the court, or with respectto any other exercise of its or his functions in the conduct ofthe proceeding." 10 U. S. C. $ 837. Any officer who "knowingly and intentionally fails to enforce or comply" with Article 37 "shall be punished as a court-martial may direct."Art. 98, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 898. The Code also providesthat a military judge, either trial or appellate, must refrainfrom adjudicating a case in which he has previously participated, Arts. 26(c), 66(h), UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $$ 826(c), 866(h),and the Code allows the accused to challenge both a courtmartial member and a court-martial judge for cause, Art.41, UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 841. The Code also allows theaccused to learn the identity of the military judge beforechoosing whether to be tried by the judge alone, or by thejudge and court-martial members. Art. 16, UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 816.510us1$13M 06-18-97 17:14:34 PAGES OPINPGT181Cite as: 510 U. S. 163 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe entire system, finally, is overseen by the Court of Mili-tary Appeals, which is composed entirely of civilian judgeswho serve for fixed terms of 15 years. That court has dem-onstrated its vigilance in checking any attempts to exert improper influence over military judges. In United States v.Mabe, 33 M. J. 200 (1991), for example, the court consideredwhether the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, or his designee, could rate a military judge based on the appropriate-ness of the judge's sentences at courts-martial. As thecourt later described: "We held [in Mabe] that the existenceof such a power in these military officers was inconsistentwith Congress' establishment of the military `judge' in Arti-cle 26 and its exercise violated Article 37 of the Code."Graf, 35 M. J., at 465. And in Graf, the court held that itwould also violate Articles 26 and 37 if a Judge AdvocateGeneral decertified or transferred a military judge based onthe General's opinion of the appropriateness of the judge'sfindings and sentences. Ibid.7The absence of tenure as a historical matter in the systemof military justice, and the number of safeguards in place toensure impartiality, lead us to reject petitioners' due processchallenge. Petitioners have fallen far short of demonstrat-ing that the factors favoring fixed terms of office are so extraordinarily weighty as to overcome the balance achievedby Congress. SeeMiddendorf, 425 U. S., at 44.For the reasons stated, we reject the petitioners' Appointments Clause and Due Process Clause attacks on the judgeswho convicted them and those who heard their appeals. Thejudgments of the Court of Military Appeals are accordingly
