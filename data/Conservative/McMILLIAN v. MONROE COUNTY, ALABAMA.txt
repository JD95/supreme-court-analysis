Petitioner sued Monroe County, Alabama, under Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, for allegedly unconstitutional actions taken by Monroe County Sheriff Tom Tate. If thesheriff 's actions constitute county "policy," then the countyis liable for them. Monell v. New York City Dept. of SocialServs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978). The parties agree that thesheriff is a "policymaker" for $ 1983 purposes, but they disagree about whether he is a policymaker for Monroe Countyor for the State of Alabama. We hold that, as to the actionsat issue here, Sheriff Tate represents the State of Alabamaand is therefore not a county policymaker. We thus affirmthe Court of Appeals' dismissal of petitioner's $ 1983 claimsagainst Monroe County.IIn November 1986, Ronda Morrison was murdered in Mon-roe County, a sparsely populated county located in southwestAlabama. Petitioner and one Ralph Myers were indicted forthis crime. Myers then pleaded guilty to a lesser offenseand testified against petitioner at his trial. A jury convictedpetitioner of capital murder, and the trial court sentencedhim to death. After two remands, the Alabama Court ofCriminal Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction, holdingthat the State had violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83(1963), by suppressing statements from Myers that contradicted his trial testimony and other exculpatory evidence.McMillian v. State, 616 So. 2d 933, 942-948 (1993). Thus,after spending six years in prison, petitioner was released.He then brought this $ 1983 lawsuit in the District Courtfor the Middle District of Alabama against respondent Monroe County and numerous officials, including the three menin charge of investigating the Morrison murder--Tom Tate,the Sheriff of Monroe County; Larry Ikner, an investigatorwith the District Attorney's office in Monroe County; andSimon Benson, an investigator with the Alabama Bureau of520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN784 McMILLIAN v.

Only two of the officials were sued in theirofficial capacities--Sheriff Tate and investigator Ikner--andit is only these official-capacity suits that concern us here.1Petitioner principally alleged that Tate and Ikner, in theircapacities as officials of Monroe County, not as officers of theState of Alabama, intimidated Myers into making false statements and suppressed exculpatory evidence. App. to Pet.for Cert. 26a-33a;McMillian v. Johnson, 878 F. Supp. 1473,1486-1488 (MD Ala. 1995).The District Court dismissed the claims against MonroeCounty and the claims against Tate and Ikner in their officialcapacities. The court held that "any unlawful acts of De-fendants Tate and Ikner cannot be said to represent [Monroe] County's policy," because "an Alabama county has [no]authority to make policy in the area of law enforcement."App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a. Petitioner appealed the DistrictCourt's decision as to Sheriff Tate. The Court of Appealsfor the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the DistrictCourt that "Sheriff Tate is not a final policymaker for Mon-roe County in the area of law enforcement, because MonroeCounty has no law enforcement authority."

S. 701, 737 (1989).Here, the parties agree that Sheriff Tate has "final policy-making authority" in the area of law enforcement. Theysharply disagree, however, about whether Alabama sheriffsare policymakers for the State or for the county when theyact in a law enforcement capacity.2In deciding this dispute, our inquiry is guided by two principles. First, the question is not whether Sheriff Tate actsfor Alabama or Monroe County in some categorical, "all ornothing" manner. Our cases on the liability of local govern-ments under $ 1983 instruct us to ask whether governmentalofficials are final policymakers for the local government in aparticular area, or on a particular issue. Seeibid. (courtmust identify "those officials who have the power to makeofficial policy on a particular issue" (emphasis added)); id.,at 738 (question is whether school district superintendent"possessed final policymaking authority in the area of employee transfers" (emphasis added)); St. Louis v. Praprotnik,485 U. S. 112, 123 (1988) (plurality opinion) ("[T]he challenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policyadopted by the official or officials responsible under state lawfor making policy in that area of the city's business"). Thus,we are not seeking to make a characterization of Alabamasheriffs that will hold true for every type of official actionthey engage in. We simply ask whether Sheriff Tate repre2 We have explained that a suit against a governmental officer "in hisofficial capacity" is the same as a suit " `against [the] entity of which [the]officer is an agent,' " Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 165 (1985) (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 690,n. 55 (1978)), and that victory in such an "official-capacity" suit "imposesliability on the entity that [the officer] represents," Brandon v. Holt, 469U. S. 464, 471 (1985).520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN786 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTYOpinion of the Courtsents the State or the county when he acts in a law enforcement capacity.Second, our inquiry is dependent on an analysis of statelaw. Cf. Jett, supra, at 737 (" `[W]hether a particular officialhas "final policymaking authority" is a question of state law' "(quoting, with original emphasis, Praprotnik, supra, at 123(plurality opinion))); Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469,483 (1986) (plurality opinion) (same). This is not to say thatstate law can answer the question for us by, for example,simply labeling as a state official an official who clearlymakes county policy. But our understanding of the actualfunction of a governmental official, in a particular area, willnecessarily be dependent on the definition of the official'sfunctions under relevant state law. Cf. Regents of Univ. ofCal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425, 429, n. 5 (1997) ("[The] federalquestion can be answered only after considering the provisions of state law that define the agency's character").BThe Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit determinedthat under Alabama law, a sheriff acting in his law enforcement capacity is not a policymaker for the county. Since thejurisdiction of the Court of Appeals includes Alabama, wedefer considerably to that court's expertise in interpretingAlabama law.3 See Jett, supra, at 738 ("We think the Courtof Appeals [for the Fifth Circuit], whose expertise in interpreting Texas law is greater than our own, is in a betterposition to determine whether [the school district superintendent] possessed final policymaking authority in the areaof employee transfers"); Pembaur, supra, at 484, n. 13 ("We3 We note that two of the three judges on the Eleventh Circuit's panelare based in Alabama. In addition, this is the second Eleventh Circuitpanel to have reached this conclusion. See Swint v. Wadley, 5 F. 3d 1435,1450-1451 (1993), vacated for lack of appellate jurisdiction, 514 U.

S. 781 (1997)Opinion of the Courtgenerally accord great deference to the interpretation andapplication of state law by the courts of appeals").We begin with the Alabama Constitution, "the supremelaw of the state." Alexander v. State ex rel. Carver, 150So. 2d 204, 208 (Ala. 1963). We agree with the Court of Ap-peals that the constitutional provisions concerning sheriffs,the historical development of those provisions, and the inter-pretation given them by the Alabama Supreme Courtstrongly support Monroe County's contention that sheriffsrepresent the State, at least for some purposes. Alabama'sConstitution, adopted in 1901, states that "[t]he executive department shall consist of a governor, lieutenant governor,attorney-general, state auditor, secretary of state, statetreasurer, superintendent of education, commissioner of agriculture and industries, and a sheriff for each county." Ala.Const. of 1901, Art. V, $ 112. This designation is especiallyimportant for our purposes, because although every AlabamaConstitution has included sheriffs as constitutional officersand has provided for their election by county voters, see Ala.Const. of 1819, Art. IV, $ 24; Ala. Const. of 1861, Art. IV, $ 24;Ala. Const. of 1865, Art. VII, $ 3; Ala. Const. of 1867, Art. V,$ 21; Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. V, $ 26; Ala. Const. of 1901,Art. V, $ 138, sheriffs have not always been explicitly listedas members of the state "executive department." Thus, the1867 Constitution listed only the "governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, and attorneygeneral" as constituting "the executive department." Ala.Const. of 1867, Art. V, $ 1. This changed with the 1875 Con-stitution, when sheriffs and the superintendent of educationwere added to the list. Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. V, $ 1.44 Executive department officers have to take the constitutional oath ofoffice, Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. XVII, $ 279; Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. XV,$ 1, and are required to submit written reports to the Governor on demand. Submitting a false report was originally a crime, Ala. Const. of1875, Art. V, $ 9, and is now an impeachable offense, Ala. Const. of 1901,Art. V, $ 121.520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN788 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTYOpinion of the CourtThe framers of the 1901 Constitution took two significantsteps in an attempt to solidify the place of sheriffs in theexecutive department, and to clarify that sheriffs were act-ing for the State when exercising their law enforcementfunctions. First, faced with reports that sheriffs wereallowing mobs to abduct prisoners and lynch them, the fram-ers made such "neglect" by sheriffs an impeachable offense.See Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. V, $ 138 ("Whenever any pris-oner is taken from jail, or from the custody of any sheriff orhis deputy, and put to death, or suffers grievous bodily harm,owing to the neglect, connivance, cowardice, or other gravefault of the sheriff, such sheriff may be impeached"); Stateex rel. Garber v. Cazalas, 162 Ala. 210, 50 So. 296 (1909)(sheriff 's failure to close jail doors, resulting in lynching ofprisoner, constitutes impeachable offense); M. McMillan,Constitutional Development in Alabama, 1789-1901, p. 338,n. 186 (1955) (impeachment provision resulted in "much prog-ress made against lynching").Second, authority to impeach sheriffs was moved from thecounty courts to the State Supreme Court, because of "[t]hefailure of county courts to punish sheriffs for neglect ofduty."Parker v. Amerson, 519 So. 2d 442, 443 (Ala. 1987).One of the primary purposes of this change, proposed byex-Governor Thomas Goode Jones at the 1901 Convention,was "to augment the power of the Governor." Id., at 444.After this change, the Governor could order the State Supreme Court, rather than the county court, to begin impeachment proceedings against a wayward sheriff, andwould not have to worry that local support for the sheriffwould annul his effort at centralized control. See ibid.;Strengthening the Power of the Executive, Address ofEmmet O'Neal, Governor of Alabama, pp. 9-10 (Sept. 12,1911) (new impeachment provision increases Governor's control of sheriffs and "gives the Executive real power whichis respected and feared"). Thus, sheriffs now share thesame impeachment procedures as state legal officers andlower state court judges, Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. VII, $ 174,520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN789Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)Opinion of the Courtrather than county and municipal officers, Ala. Const. of 1875,Art. VII, $ 3.Critically for our case, the Alabama Supreme Court hasinterpreted these provisions and their historical backgroundas evidence of "the framers' intent to ensure that sheriffsbe considered executive officers of the state."Parker, 519So. 2d, at 444. Based primarily on this understanding ofthe State Constitution, the court has held unequivocally thatsheriffs are state officers, and that tort claims broughtagainst sheriffs based on their official acts therefore consti-tute suits against the State, not suits against the sheriff 'scounty. Id., at 443-445.5 Thus, Alabama counties are notliable under a theory of respondeat superior for a sheriff 'sofficial acts that are tortious. Id., at 442. The issues inParker are strikingly similar to the ones in the present case,and that decision is therefore strong evidence in favor of theCourt of Appeals' conclusion that sheriffs act on behalf ofthe State, rather than the county, when acting in their lawenforcement capacity.Turning from the Alabama Constitution to the AlabamaCode, the relevant provisions are less compelling, but stillsupport the conclusion of the Court of Appeals to some ex-tent. Section 36-22-3 of the code sets out a sheriff 's duties.First, a sheriff must "attend upon" the state courts in hiscounty, must "obey the lawful orders and directions" of thosecourts, and must "execute and return the process and or-ders" of any state court, even those outside his county. Ala.Code $$ 36-22-3(1), (2) (1991). Thus, judges (who are stateofficers, see Ala. Const. of 1901, Amdt. 328, $ 6.01) may order5 As a result of this holding and the State Constitution's sovereign immunity provision, see Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. I, $ 14 ("[T]he State ofAlabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity"),the Alabama Supreme Court has held that a sheriff is absolutely immunefrom all suits for damages based on his official acts. Parker v. Amerson,519 So. 2d 442, 446 (Ala. 1987). See also King v. Colbert County, 620So. 2d 623, 626 (Ala. 1993); Boshell v. Walker County Sheriff, 598 So. 2d843, 844 (Ala. 1992); Hereford v. Jefferson County, 586 So. 2d 209, 210(Ala. 1991).520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN790 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTYOpinion of the Courtthe sheriff to take certain actions, even if the judge sits in adistant county. And under Ala. Code $ 12-17-24 (1995), thepresiding circuit judge "exercise[s] a general supervision"over the county sheriffs in his circuit,6 just as if the sheriffsare normal "court [i. e., state] employees," see $ 12-17-1.Second, the sheriff must give to the county treasurer asworn written statement detailing the funds he has receivedfor the county since his last statement, and must pay thesefunds to the treasurer. $ 36-22-3(3). In contrast to thestate judges, however, the county treasurer does not appearto have any statutory authority to direct the sheriff to takespecific actions.Third and most importantly, "[i]t shall be the duty of sher-iffs in their respective counties, by themselves or deputies,to ferret out crime, to apprehend and arrest criminals and,insofar as within their power, to secure evidence of crimesin their counties and to present a report of the evidence sosecured to the district attorney or assistant district attorneyfor the county." $ 36-22-3(4). By this mandate, sheriffsare given complete authority to enforce the state criminallaw in their counties. In contrast, the "powers and duties"of the counties themselves--creatures of the State who haveonly the powers granted to them by the State, Alexander,150 So. 2d, at 206--do not include any provision in the areaof law enforcement. Ala. Code $ 11-3-11 (1989). Thus, the"governing body" of the counties--which in every Alabamacounty is the county commission, see Calvert v. CullmanCounty Comm'n, 669 So. 2d 119 (Ala. 1995) (citing $ 11-1-5)--cannot instruct the sheriff how to ferret out crime,how to arrest a criminal, or how to secure evidence of acrime. And when the sheriff does secure such evidence, hehas an obligation to share this information not with thecounty commission, but with the district attorney (a stateofficial, see Hooks v. Hitt, 539 So. 2d 157, 159 (Ala. 1988)).6 Seventeen of the forty judicial circuits in Alabama contain more thanone county, including the circuit in which Monroe County sits. Ala. Code$ 12-11-2 (1995).520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN791Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)Opinion of the CourtWhile the county commission thus has no direct controlover how the sheriff fulfills his law enforcement duty, theGovernor and the attorney general do have this kind of control. Pursuant to $ 36-22-5, they can direct the sheriff toinvestigate "any alleged violation of law in their counties."And after "proceed[ing] promptly" to complete this investigation, the sheriff must "promptly" write a report to thestate official in charge of the investigation, stating his findings, listing the witnesses he has secured, and summarizingwhat the witnesses can prove. Ibid. In addition, the salaries of all sheriffs are set by the state legislature, not by thecounty commissions. $ 36-22-16.To all of this, petitioner counters with four important provisions that cut in favor of the conclusion that sheriffs arecounty officials. First, the sheriff 's salary is paid "out of thecounty treasury." Ibid. Second, the county provides thesheriff with equipment (including cruisers), supplies, lodging, and reimbursement for expenses, to the extent "reasonably needed for the proper and efficient conduct of the affairsof the sheriff 's office." $ 36-22-18. Third, the sheriff 's jurisdiction is limited to the borders of his county. See, e. g.,$ 36-22-3(4) ("It shall be the duty of sheriffs in their respective counties . . . to ferret out crime" (emphasis added)).Fourth, the sheriff is elected locally by the voters in hiscounty (as he has been since Alabama's 1819 Constitution).See Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. V, $ 138; Ala. Const. of 1819,Art. IV, $ 24.We do not find these provisions sufficient to tip the balancein favor of petitioner. The county's payment of the sheriff 'ssalary does not translate into control over him, since thecounty neither has the authority to change his salary nor thediscretion to refuse payment completely. The county commissions do appear to have the discretion to deny funds tothe sheriffs for their operations beyond what is "reasonablynecessary." See Etowah County Comm'n v. Hayes, 569So. 2d 397, 399 (Ala. 1990) (per curiam). But at most, this520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN792 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTYOpinion of the Courtdiscretion would allow the commission to exert an attenu-ated and indirect influence over the sheriff 's operations.Petitioner's contention that sheriffs are county officials be-cause "state policymakers" typically make policy for the entire State (without limits on their jurisdiction) and are typically elected on a statewide (not local) basis, surely has someforce. But district attorneys and state judges are often considered (and in Alabama are considered) state officials, eventhough they, too, have limited jurisdictions and are electedlocally. These characteristics are therefore consistent withan understanding of the 67 Alabama sheriffs as state officialswho have been locally placed throughout the State, with anelement of control granted to the officials and residents ofthe county that receives the sheriff 's services.77 Petitioner also makes three other points that we believe have littlemerit. First, he points out that when the sheriff's office is vacant or whenthe sheriff is incapacitated, it is the county coroner that fills in for thesheriff. Ala. Code $ 11-5-5 (1989). We note that this temporary assignment only lasts until the Governor appoints a replacement for the sheriff,who then serves out the remainder of the sheriff's term. Ala. Code $ 36-9-17 (1991). Thus, even assuming that the county coroner is a countyofficial, we place little weight on this assignment of temporary responsibility, which by its nature must fall to an official who is already in the countyand available to step in for the sheriff at any time. Second, petitionercites several instances in the code where a group of officials that includesthe sheriff is designated a group of "county officials" or "county employees." See, e. g., $$ 36-3-4, 36-15-1, 36-22-16. But in light of the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusion that (i) sheriffs are state officials according to the State Constitution, see Parker, 519 So. 2d, at 443, and (ii)contrary statements in that court's prior decisions had ignored the Constitution and therefore should not be followed, id., at 445 (citing, among othercases, In re Opinions of Justices, 225 Ala. 359, 143 So. 345 (1932)), wethink that any contrary implication in the code is entitled to little weight.Finally, petitioner relies on the Monroe County Commission's insurancepolicy--which, according to the District Court, "may cover . . . some, butnot all, of the claims made against" Monroe County and Sheriff Tate in thissuit, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a--to establish that the commission will payany judgment rendered against Sheriff Tate. But this policy shows, at themost, that there was uncertainty as to whether the courts would con520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN793Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)Opinion of the CourtIn sum, although there is some evidence in Alabama lawthat supports petitioner's argument, we think the weight ofthe evidence is strongly on the side of the conclusion reachedby the Court of Appeals: Alabama sheriffs, when executingtheir law enforcement duties, represent the State of Ala-bama, not their counties. Cf.Praprotnik, 485 U. S., at 125("We are not, of course, predicting that state law will alwaysspeak with perfect clarity"); id., at 126-127 ("It may not bepossible to draw an elegant line that will resolve thisconundrum"). CPetitioner argues that this conclusion will create a lack ofuniformity in Alabama and throughout the country. First,he argues that it is anomalous to have 67 different "statepolicymakers" in the person of Alabama's 67 county sheriffs,all of whom may have different "state law enforcement poli-cies" in their counties. Second, he points out that most Federal Courts of Appeals have found county sheriffs to becounty, not state, officials, and he implies that our affirmanceof the Court of Appeals will either call those decisions intoquestion or create an unacceptable patchwork of rulings asto $ 1983 liability of counties for the acts of their sheriffs.We reject both arguments: The first ignores the history ofsheriffs, and the second ignores our Nation's federal nature.English sheriffs (or "shire-reeves") were the King 's"reeves" (officers or agents) in the "shires" (counties), at leastafter the Norman Conquest in 1066. See C. Wigan & D.Meston, Mather on Sheriff and Execution Law 1-2 (1935).Although chosen locally by the shire's inhabitants, the sheriffdid "all the king's business in the county," 1 W. Blackstone,Commentaries on the Laws of England 328 (1765), and was"the keeper of the king's peace," id., at 332. See alsoWigan & Meston, supra, at 2 ("It is this position of the Shersider Sheriff Tate a county policymaker in these circumstances, not thatthe county would pay any judgment against him.520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN794 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTYOpinion of the Courtiff as the executive officer of the Crown which has all alongbeen the outstanding characteristic of the office").As the basic forms of English government were trans-planted in our country, it also became the common understanding here that the sheriff, though limited in jurisdictionto his county and generally elected by county voters,8 was inreality an officer of the State, and ultimately represented theState in fulfilling his duty to keep the peace. See,e. g.,Wager, Introduction, in County Government Across the Nation 5 (P. Wager ed. 1950) ("The office of sheriff has an unbro-ken lineage from the Anglo-Saxon shire-reeve"); 1 W. Anderson, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs, Coroners andConstables 5 (1941) ("In the exercise of executive and administrative functions, in conserving the public peace, in vindi-cating the law, and in preserving the rights of the government, he (the sheriff) represents the sovereignty of the Stateand he has no superior in his county"); R. Cooley, Handbookon the Law of Municipal Corporations 512 (1914) ("Sheriffs,coroners, clerks and other so-called county officers are properly state officers for the county. Their functions and dutiespertain chiefly to the affairs of state in the county"); 3 J.Bouvier, Bouvier's Law Dictionary 3058 (8th ed. 1914) (de-fining sheriff as "[a] county officer representing the executiveor administrative power of the state within his county").This historical sketch indicates that the common law itselfenvisioned the possibility that state law enforcement "poli-cies" might vary locally, as particular sheriffs adopted varying practices for arresting criminals or securing evidence.98 See W. Murfree, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs and Other Ministerial Officers 6 (1890) (sheriffs elected by county voters in all States buttwo).9 Cf. McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F. 3d 1573, 1579 (CA11 1996) ("[W]e seeno anomaly in having different state policymakers in different counties.Such a situation would be no different than if each of a city's police precinct commanders had unreviewable authority over how arrestees wereprocessed.

S. 781 (1997)Opinion of the CourtThus, petiti oner 's disagreement with the concept that"county sheriffs" may actually be state officials is simply adisagreement with the ancient understanding of what it hasmeant to be a sheriff.Petitioner's second concern is that under our holding here,sheriffs will be characterized differently in different States.But while it might be easier to decide cases arising under$ 1983 andMonell if we insisted on a uniform, national char-acterization for all sheriffs, such a blunderbuss approachwould ignore a crucial axiom of our government: the Stateshave wide authority to set up their state and local governments as they wish. Understandably, then, the importanceof counties and the nature of county government have variedhistorically from region to region, and from State to State.See,e. g., Wager, supra, at 5-8 (describing different systemsof rural government that developed in the Massachusetts,New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia colonies, which laterresulted in counties having widely varying roles in the fourregions); Martin, American County Government, in CountyGovernments in an Era of Change 3-5 (P. Berman ed. 1993)(same); DeSantis & Renner, Governing the County, id., at16-25 (describing varying levels of power currently exer-cised by counties in different States, and explaining how regional influences have resulted in different forms of countygovernment in different States);id., at 19 (listing Alabamaas 37th among the 50 States in amount of discretionary au-thority granted to its counties). Thus, since it is entirelynatural that both the role of sheriffs and the importance ofcounties vary from State to State, there is no inconsistencycreated by court decisions that declare sheriffs to be countyofficers in one State, and not in another.1010 Compare, e. g., Strickler v. Waters, 989 F. 2d 1375, 1390 (CA4 1993)(Virginia "city sheriff" does not set city policy in area of jail conditions);Thompson v.
