Petitioner, an enlisted member of the United States CoastGuard, challenges his conviction by a court-martial. Hisconviction was affirmed first by the Coast Guard Court ofMilitary Review, and then by the United States Court ofMilitary Appeals.1 The latter court agreed with petitionerthat the two civilian judges who served on the Court of Military Review had not been appointed in accordance with thedictates of the Appointments Clause, U. S. Const., Art. II,$ 2, cl. 2, but nonetheless held that the actions of those judgeswere validde facto. We hold that the judges' actions werenot valid de facto.Petitioner was convicted of several drug offenses, and wassentenced by a general court-martial to five years' confinement (later reduced to three years), forfeiture of pay, reduc-tion in grade, and a dishonorable discharge. He appealed tothe Coast Guard Court of Military Review, which, except inone minor aspect, affirmed his conviction. 34 M. J. 1077(1992). On request for rehearing, petitioner challenged thecomposition of that court as violative of the AppointmentsClause of the Constitution because two of the judges on thethree-judge panel were civilians appointed by the GeneralCounsel of the Department of Transportation. The courtgranted rehearing and rejected this challenge. 34 M. J.1259 (1992).1 The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, Pub. L.103-337, $ 924, 108 Stat. 2831, changed the nomenclature for the militaryappellate courts. The previous "Court[s] of Military Review" were rechristened as the "Court[s] of Criminal Appeals" and the previous "UnitedStates Court of Military Appeals" was redesignated as the "United StatesCourt of Appeals for the Armed Forces." We adhere to the former namesconsistent with all previous proceedings in this case.515us1$68h 08-13-98 12:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT180 RYDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtThe Court of Military Appeals likewise affirmed petitioner's conviction, 39 M. J. 454 (1994), although it agreed withpetitioner that the appellate judges on the Coast GuardCourt of Military Review had been appointed in violation ofthe Appointments Clause. The court relied for this conclusion on its previous decision in United States v. Carpenter,37 M. J. 291 (1993), where it had decided that appellate military judges are inferior officers whose service requires appointment by a President, a court of law, or a head of a department. U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2.2 Despite findinga constitutional violation in the appointment of two judgeson petitioner's three-judge appellate panel, the Court of Military Appeals affirmed his conviction on the ground that theactions of these judges were valid de facto, citing Buckley v.Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976) (per curiam). We granted certiorari. 513 U. S. 1071 (1995).The de facto officer doctrine confers validity upon acts performed by a person acting under the color of official titleeven though it is later discovered that the legality of thatperson's appointment or election to office is deficient. Norton v. Shelby County, 118 U. S. 425, 440 (1886). "The defacto doctrine springs from the fear of the chaos that wouldresult from multiple and repetitious suits challenging everyaction taken by every official whose claim to office could beopen to question, and seeks to protect the public by insuringthe orderly functioning of the government despite technicaldefects in title to office." 63A Am. Jur. 2d, Public Officers2 The Appointments Clause reads in full:"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consentof the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the UnitedStates, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, andwhich shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vestthe Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in thePresident alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments."U.

The doctrine has been relied upon by this Court inseveral cases involving challenges by criminal defendants tothe authority of a judge who participated in some part of theproceedings leading to their conviction and sentence.In Ball v. United States, 140 U. S. 118 (1891), a CircuitJudge assigned a District Judge from the Western Districtof Louisiana to sit in the Eastern District of Texas as a re-placement for the resident judge who had fallen ill and wholater died. The assigned judge continued to sit until thesuccessor to the deceased judge was duly appointed. Theassigned judge had sentenced Ball after the resident judgehad died, and Ball made no objection at that time. Ball latermoved in arrest of judgment challenging the sentence imposed upon him by the assigned judge after the death of theresident judge, but this Court held that the assigned judge"was judge de facto if not de jure, and his acts as such arenot open to collateral attack." Id., at 128-129.Similarly, in McDowell v. United States, 159 U. S. 596(1895), a Circuit Judge assigned a judge from the EasternDistrict of North Carolina to sit as a District Judge in theDistrict of South Carolina until a vacancy in the latter district was filled. McDowell was indicted and convicted during the term in which the assigned judge served, but madeno objection at the time of his indictment or trial. He laterchallenged the validity of his conviction because of a claimederror in the assigned judge's designation. This Court decided that the assigned judge was a "judge de facto," andthat "his actions as such, so far as they affect third persons,are not open to question." Id., at 601. The Court furtherobserved that McDowell's claim "presents a mere matter ofstatutory construction . . . . It involves no trespass uponthe executive power of appointment." Id., at 598. In alater case, Ex parte Ward, 173 U. S. 452 (1899), petitionersought an original writ of habeas corpus to challenge theauthority of the District Judge who had sentenced him on515us1$68h 08-13-98 12:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT182 RYDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtthe grounds that the appointment of the judge during a Sen-ate recess was improper. This Court held that "the title ofa person acting with color of authority, even if he be not agood officer in point of law, cannot be collaterally attacked."Id., at 456.In the case before us, petitioner challenged the composi-tion of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review while hiscase was pending before that court on direct review. Unlikethe defendants inBall, McDowell, and Ward, petitionerraised his objection to the judges' titles before those veryjudges and prior to their action on his case. And his claimis based on the Appointments Clause of Article II of theConstitution--a claim that there has been a "trespass uponthe executive power of appointment," McDowell, supra, at598, rather than a misapplication of a statute providing forthe assignment of already appointed judges to serve inother districts.In Buckley v. Valeo, supra, at 125, we said "[t]he Appointments Clause could, of course, be read as merely dealing withetiquette or protocol in describing `Officers of the UnitedStates' but the drafters had a less frivolous purpose inmind." The Clause is a bulwark against one branch aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch, but itis more: it "preserves another aspect of the Constitution'sstructural integrity by preventing the diffusion of theappointment power." Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S.868, 878 (1991). In Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U. S. 530(1962), we declined to invoke the de facto officer doctrine inorder to avoid deciding a question arising under Article IIIof the Constitution, saying that the cases in which we hadrelied on that doctrine did not involve "basic constitutionalprotections designed in part for the benefit of litigants."Id., at 536 (plurality opinion). We think that one who makesa timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case is entitledto a decision on the merits of the question and whatever515us1$68h 08-13-98 12:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT183Cite as: 515 U. S. 177 (1995)Opinion of the Courtrelief may be appropriate if a violation indeed occurred.Any other rule would create a disincentive to raise Appointments Clause challenges with respect to questionable judi-cial appointments.The Court of Military Appeals relied, not without reason,on our decision in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1 (1976).There, plaintiffs challenged the appointment of the FederalElection Commission members on separation-of-powersgrounds. The Court agreed with them and held that theappointment of four members of the Commission by Con-gress, rather than the President, violated the AppointmentsClause. It nonetheless quite summarily held that the "pastacts of the Commission are therefore accorded de facto validity." Id., at 142. We cited as authority for this determination Connor v. Williams, 404 U. S. 549, 550-551 (1972), inwhich we held that legislative acts performed by legislatorsheld to have been elected in accordance with an unconstitutional apportionment were not therefore void.Neither Buckley nor Connor explicitly relied on the defacto officer doctrine, though the result reached in each casevalidated the past acts of public officials. But in Buckley,the constitutional challenge raised by the plaintiffs was decided in their favor, and the declaratory and injunctive reliefthey sought was awarded to them. And Connor, like othervoting rights cases, see Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393U. S. 544, 572 (1969); Cipriano v. City of Houma, 395 U. S.701 (1969) (per curiam), did not involve a defect in a specificofficer's title, but rather a challenge to the composition of anentire legislative body. The Court assumed, arguendo, thatan equal protection violation infected the District Court'sreapportionment plan, declined to invalidate the electionsthat had already occurred, and reserved judgment on thepropriety of the prospective relief requested by petitionerspending completion of further District Court proceedingsthat could rectify any constitutional violation present in thecourt-ordered redistricting plan. Connor, supra, at 550-515us1$68h 08-13-98 12:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT184 RYDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Court551. To the extent these civil cases may be thought to haveimplicitly applied a form of the de facto officer doctrine, weare not inclined to extend them beyond their facts.3The Government alternatively defends the decision of theCourt of Military Appeals on the grounds that it was, forseveral reasons, proper for that court to give its decision inCarpenter--holding that the appointment of the civilianjudges to the Coast Guard Court of Military Review violatedthe Appointments Clause--prospective application only. Itfirst argues that the Court of Military Appeals exercised remedial discretion pursuant to Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson, 404U. S. 97 (1971).4 But whatever the continuing validity of3 For similar reasons, we do not find instructive the Court's dispositionof petitioner's challenge in Northern Pipeline Constr. Co. v. MarathonPipe Line Co., 458 U. S. 50 (1982). The Court declared the broad grant ofjurisdiction to Article I bankruptcy courts unconstitutional and applied itsdecision prospectively only. Id., at 88. But in doing so, it affirmed thejudgment of the District Court, which had dismissed petitioner's bankruptcy action and afforded respondent the relief requested pursuant to itsconstitutional challenge. Id., at 57. So Northern Pipeline is not a casein which the Court invoked the de facto officer doctrine to deny relief tothe party before it and therefore does not support the Government inthis case.4 The Government advances a virtual cornucopia of factors more or lesspeculiar to this case which it says validate the Court of Military Appeals'exercise of discretion in this case and thus support affirmance. It pointsto the lack of any substantial impact that the improper appointments hadon petitioner's appeal, to the lack of any constitutional right to appellatereview, and to the deference owed the military and the public interest inavoiding disruption of that system. Brief for United States 22. At oralargument, it also contended that subsequent action taken by the Secretaryof Transportation to cure the Appointments Clause error, the fact thatpetitioner's underlying claims of error were meritless, and the fact thatthe civilian judges in this case had previously served under proper appointments while on active duty were relevant criteria. Tr. of Oral Arg.29-30, 33-34. The substance, if not the form, of several of these arguments is discussed and rejected in the text. Those that are not discussedare alternative grounds for affirmance which the Government did not raisebelow, see Answer to Supplement for Petition for Review in No. 68449 (Ct.Mil. App.), pp. 2-4, and which we decline to reach. Jenkins v. Anderson,515us1$68h 08-13-98 12:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT185Cite as: 515 U. S. 177 (1995)Opinion of the CourtChevron Oil after Harper v. Virginia Dept. of Taxation, 509U. S. 86 (1993), and Reynoldsville Casket Co. v. Hyde, 514U. S. 749 (1995), there is not the sort of grave disruptionor inequity involved in awarding retrospective relief to thispetitioner that would bring that doctrine into play. Theparties agree that the defective appointments of the civilianjudges affect only between 7 to 10 cases pending on directreview. As for the Government's concern that a flood ofhabeas corpus petitions will ensue, precedent provides littlebasis for such fears.Ex parte Ward, 173 U. S. 452 (1899).Nor does the Government persuade us that the inquiryinto clearly established law as it pertains to qualified immu-nity counsels in favor of discretion to deny a remedy in thiscase. Qualified immunity specially protects public officialsfrom the specter of damages liability for judgment callsmade in a legally uncertain environment. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 806 (1982) ("[O]ur decisions consistentlyhave held that government officials are entitled to some formof immunity from suits for damages" (emphasis added)).Providing relief to a claimant raising an AppointmentsClause challenge does not subject public officials to personaldamages that represent a "potentially disabling threa[t] ofliability," but only invalidates actions taken pursuant to de-fective title. The qualified immunity doctrine need not beextended to protect public officials from such attacks.Similarly, the practice of denying criminal defendants anexclusionary remedy from Fourth Amendment violationswhen those errors occur despite the good faith of the Government actors, United States v. Leon, 468 U. S. 897 (1984), doesnot require the affirmance of petitioner's conviction in thiscase. Finding the deterrent remedy of suppression not com-pelled by the Fourth Amendment, id., at 910, that case specifically relied on the "objectionable collateral consequenceof [the] interference with the criminal justice system's447 U. S. 231, 234-235, n. 1 (1980); FTC v. Grolier Inc., 462 U. S. 19, 23,n. 6 (1983).515us1$68h 08-13-98 12:34:06 PAGES OPINPGT186 RYDER v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttruth-finding function" in requiring a blanket exclusionaryremedy for all violations,id., at 907, and the relative ineffectiveness of such remedy to deter future Fourth Amendmentviolations in particular cases,id., at 918-921. No similarcollateral consequence arises from rectifying an Appointments Clause violation, and correcting Appointments Clauseviolations in cases such as this one provides a suitable incentive to make such challenges.The Government finally suggests that the Court of Military Appeals applied something akin to a harmless-errordoctrine in affirming petitioner's conviction, refusing to redress the violation because petitioner suffered no adverseconsequences from the composition of the court. Brief forUnited States 33. The Government did not argue belowthat the error, assuming it occurred, was harmless, and thereis no indication from the Court of Military Appeals' summarydisposition of this issue that it determined that no harm occurred in this case. We therefore need not address whetherthe alleged defects in the composition of petitioner's appellate panel are susceptible to harmless-error review. TheGovernment also argues, at least obliquely, that whateverdefect there may have been in the proceedings before theCoast Guard Court of Military Review was in effect curedby the review available to petitioner in the Court of MilitaryAppeals. Id., at 24, n. 16. Again, because of the hierarchical nature of sentence review in the system of militarycourts, we need not address whether this defect is susceptible to the cure envisioned by the Government.Congress has established three tiers of military courtspursuant to its power "[t]o make Rules for the Governmentand Regulation of the land and naval Forces."

United States v. Wilson, 6 M.
