S. 477 (1994)Opinion of the Courtproceeding pro se, filed this suit in Federal District Courtunder 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,1 naming as defendants respondentsJames Humphrey and Robert Ewbank, Dearborn Countyprosecutors, and Michael Krinoph, an investigator with theIndiana State Police. The complaint alleged that respondents, acting under color of state law, had engaged in an "un-lawful, unreasonable, and arbitrary investigation" leading topetitioner's arrest; "knowingly destroyed" evidence "whichwas exculpatory in nature and could have proved [petitioner's] innocence"; and caused "an illegal and unlawfulvoice identification procedure" to be used at petitioner's trial.App. 5-6. The complaint sought, among other things, com-pensatory and punitive monetary damages. It did not askfor injunctive relief, and petitioner has not sought releasefrom custody in this action.The District Court dismissed the action without prejudice,because the issues it raised "directly implicate the legalityof [petitioner's] confinement," id., at 13. While petitioner'sappeal to the Seventh Circuit was pending, the Indiana Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence on directappeal, Heck v. State, 552 N. E. 2d 446, 449 (Ind. 1990); hisfirst petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal DistrictCourt was dismissed because it contained unexhaustedclaims; and his second federal habeas petition was denied,and the denial affirmed by the Seventh Circuit.When the Seventh Circuit reached petitioner's appeal fromdismissal of his $ 1983 complaint, it affirmed the judgmentand approved the reasoning of the District Court: "If, regardless of the relief sought, the plaintiff [in a federal civil1 Section 1983 provides: "Every person who, under color of any statute,ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or theDistrict of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen ofthe United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to thedeprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law,suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT480 HECK v. HUMPHREYOpinion of the Courtrights action] is challenging the legality of his conviction,[2]so that if he won his case the state would be obliged to release him even if he hadn't sought that relief, the suit is classified as an application for habeas corpus and the plaintiffmust exhaust his state remedies, on pain of dismissal if hefails to do so." 997 F. 2d 355, 357 (1993). Heck filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted. 510 U. S. 1068 (1994).IIThis case lies at the intersection of the two most fertilesources of federal-court prisoner litigation--the Civil RightsAct of 1871, Rev. Stat. $ 1979, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,and the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254.Both of these provide access to a federal forum for claims ofunconstitutional treatment at the hands of state officials, butthey differ in their scope and operation. In general, exhaustion of state remedies "is not a prerequisite to an actionunder $ 1983," Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457 U. S.496, 501 (1982) (emphasis added), even an action by a stateprisoner, id., at 509. The federal habeas corpus statute, by2 Neither in his petition for certiorari nor in his principal brief on themerits did petitioner contest the description of his monetary claims (byboth the District Court and the Court of Appeals) as challenging the legality of his conviction. Thus, the question we understood to be before uswas whether money damages premised on an unlawful conviction could bepursued under $ 1983. Petitioner sought to challenge this premise in hisreply brief, contending that findings validating his damages claims wouldnot invalidate his conviction. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5-6. Thatargument comes too late. We did not take this case to review such afact-bound issue, and we accept the characterization of the lower courts.We also decline to pursue, without implying the nonexistence of, anotherissue, suggested by the Court of Appeals' statement that, if petitioner's"conviction were proper, this suit would in all likelihood be barred byres judicata." 997 F. 2d 355, 357 (CA7 1993). The res judicata effect ofstate-court decisions in $ 1983 actions is a matter of state law. See Migrav. Warren City School Dist. Bd. of Ed., 465 U. S. 75 (1984).512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT481Cite as: 512 U. S. 477 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcontrast, requires that state prisoners first seek redress in astate forum.3 See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509 (1982).Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475 (1973), considered thepotential overlap between these two provisions, and heldthat habeas corpus is the exclusive remedy for a state prisoner who challenges the fact or duration of his confinementand seeks immediate or speedier release, even though sucha claim may come within the literal terms of $ 1983. Id.,at 488-490. We emphasize that Preiser did not create anexception to the "no exhaustion" rule of $ 1983; it merelyheld that certain claims by state prisoners are not cognizableunder that provision, and must be brought in habeas corpusproceedings, which do contain an exhaustion requirement.This case is clearly not covered by the holding of Preiser,for petitioner seeks not immediate or speedier release, butmonetary damages, as to which he could not "have soughtand obtained fully effective relief through federal habeas corpus proceedings." Id., at 488. See also id., at 494; Allenv. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 104 (1980). In dictum, however,Preiser asserted that since a state prisoner seeking onlydamages "is attacking something other than the fact orlength of . . . confinement, and . . . is seeking something otherthan immediate or more speedy release[,] . . . a damages action by a state prisoner could be brought under [$ 1983] infederal court without any requirement of prior exhaustion ofstate remedies." 411 U. S., at 494. That statement maynot be true, however, when establishing the basis for thedamages claim necessarily demonstrates the invalidity of the3 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b) provides: "An application for a writ of habeascorpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of aState court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant hasexhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State, or that thereis either an absence of available State corrective process or the existenceof circumstances rendering such process ineffective to protect the rightsof the prisoner."512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT482 HECK v. HUMPHREYOpinion of the Courtconviction. In that situation, the claimant can be said to be"attacking . . . the fact or length of . . . confinement," bringing the suit within the other dictum of Preiser: "Congresshas determined that habeas corpus is the appropriate remedy for state prisoners attacking the validity of the fact orlength of their confinement, and that specific determinationmust override the general terms of $ 1983."Id., at 490. Inthe last analysis, we think the dicta of Preiser to be an un-reliable, if not an unintelligible, guide: that opinion had nocause to address, and did not carefully consider, the damagesquestion before us today.Before addressing that question, we respond to petitioner's contention that it has already been answered, in Wolffv. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974). See Reply Brief forPetitioner 1. First of all, if Wolff had answered the question we would not have expressly reserved it 10 years later,as we did in Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914 (1984). See id.,at 923. And secondly, a careful reading of Wolff itself doesnot support the contention. Like Preiser, Wolff involveda challenge to the procedures used by state prison officialsto deprive prisoners of good-time credits. The $ 1983 complaint sought restoration of good-time credits as well as"damages for the deprivation of civil rights resulting fromthe use of the allegedly unconstitutional procedures."Wolff, supra, at 553. The Court said, after holding the claimfor good-time credits to be foreclosed by Preiser, that thedamages claim was nonetheless "properly before the DistrictCourt and required determination of the validity of the procedures employed for imposing sanctions, including loss ofgood time," 418 U. S., at 554. Petitioner contends that thislanguage authorized the plaintiffs in Wolff to recover damages measured by the actual loss of good time. We thinknot. In light of the earlier language characterizing theclaim as one of "damages for the deprivation of civil rights,"rather than damages for the deprivation of good-time credits,we think this passage recognized a $ 1983 claim for using the512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT483Cite as: 512 U. S. 477 (1994)Opinion of the Courtwrong procedures, not for reaching the wrong result (i. e.,denying good-time credits). Nor is there any indication inthe opinion, or any reason to believe, that using the wrongprocedures necessarily vitiated the denial of good-time credits. Thus, the claim at issue in Wolff did not call into question the lawfulness of the plaintiff 's continuing confinement.SeeFulford v. Klein, 529 F. 2d 377, 381 (1976), adhered to,550 F. 2d 342 (CA5 1977) (en banc); Schwartz, The PreiserPuzzle: Continued Frustrating Conflict Between the CivilRights and Habeas Corpus Remedies for State Prisoners, 37DePaul L. Rev. 85, 120-121, 145-146 (1988).Thus, the question posed by $ 1983 damages claims that docall into question the lawfulness of conviction or confinementremains open. To answer that question correctly, we see noneed to abandon, as the Seventh Circuit and those courts inagreement with it have done, our teaching that $ 1983 contains no exhaustion requirement beyond what Congress hasprovided. Patsy, 457 U. S., at 501, 509. The issue with respect to monetary damages challenging conviction is not, itseems to us, exhaustion; but rather, the same as the issuewas with respect to injunctive relief challenging convictionin Preiser: whether the claim is cognizable under $ 1983 atall. We conclude that it is not."We have repeatedly noted that 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 createsa species of tort liability." Memphis Community SchoolDist. v. Stachura, 477 U. S. 299, 305 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted). "[O]ver the centuries the common lawof torts has developed a set of rules to implement the principle that a person should be compensated fairly for injuriescaused by the violation of his legal rights. These rules, defining the elements of damages and the prerequisites fortheir recovery, provide the appropriate starting point for theinquiry under $ 1983 as well." Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S.247, 257-258 (1978). Thus, to determine whether there isany bar to the present suit, we look first to the common lawof torts. Cf. Stachura, supra, at 306.512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT484 HECK v. HUMPHREYOpinion of the CourtThe common-law cause of action for malicious prosecutionprovides the closest analogy to claims of the type consideredhere because, unlike the related cause of action for falsearrest or imprisonment, it permits damages for confinementimposed pursuant to legal process. "If there is a false arrestclaim, damages for that claim cover the time of detentionup until issuance of process or arraignment, but not more."W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser andKeeton on Law of Torts 888 (5th ed. 1984). But a successfulmalicious prosecution plaintiff may recover, in addition togeneral damages, "compensation for any arrest or imprisonment, including damages for discomfort or injury to hishealth, or loss of time and deprivation of the society." Id.,at 887-888 (footnotes omitted). See also Roberts v. Thomas,135 Ky. 63, 121 S. W. 961 (1909).One element that must be alleged and proved in a malicious prosecution action is termination of the prior criminalproceeding in favor of the accused. Prosser and Keeton,supra, at 874; Carpenter v. Nutter, 127 Cal. 61, 59 P. 301(1899). This requirement "avoids parallel litigation overthe issues of probable cause and guilt . . . and it precludesthe possibility of the claimant [sic] succeeding in the tortaction after having been convicted in the underlying criminal prosecution, in contravention of a strong judicial policyagainst the creation of two conflicting resolutions arisingout of the same or identical transaction." 8 S. Speiser,C. Krause, & A. Gans, American Law of Torts $ 28:5, p. 24(1991). Furthermore, "to permit a convicted criminal defendant to proceed with a malicious prosecution claim wouldpermit a collateral attack on the conviction through the vehicle of a civil suit." Ibid.4 This Court has long expressed4 Justice Souter criticizes our reliance on malicious prosecution's favorable termination requirement as illustrative of the common-law principle barring tort plaintiffs from mounting collateral attacks on their out512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT485Cite as: 512 U. S. 477 (1994)Opinion of the Courtsimilar concerns for finality and consistency and has gener-ally declined to expand opportunities for collateral attack,see Parke v. Raley, 506 U. S. 20, 29-30 (1992); Teague v.Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 308 (1989); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co.,standing criminal convictions. Malicious prosecution is an inapt analogy,he says, because "[a] defendant's conviction, under Reconstruction-eracommon law, dissolved his claim for malicious prosecution because the conviction was regarded as irrebuttable evidence that the prosecution neverlacked probable cause." Post, at 496, citing T. Cooley, Law of Torts 185(1879). Chief Justice Cooley no doubt intended merely to set forth thegeneral rule that a conviction defeated the malicious prosecution plaintiff'sallegation (essential to his cause of action) that the prior proceeding waswithout probable cause. But this was not an absolute rule in all jurisdictions, see Goodrich v. Warner, 21 Conn. 432, 443 (1852); Richter v. Koster,45 Ind. 440, 441-442 (1874), and early on it was recognized that there mustbe exceptions to the rule in cases involving circumstances such as fraud,perjury, or mistake of law, see Burt v. Place, 4 Wend. 591 (N. Y. 1830);Witham v. Gowen, 14 Me. 362 (1837); Olson v. Neal, 63 Iowa 214, 18 N. W.863 (1884). Some cases even held that a "conviction, although it be afterwards reversed, is prima facie evidence--and that only--of the existenceof probable cause." Neher v. Dobbs, 41 Neb. 863, 868, 66 N. W. 864, 865(1896) (collecting cases). In Crescent City Live Stock Co. v. Butchers'Union Slaughter-House Co., 120 U. S. 141 (1887), we recognized that"[h]ow much weight as proof of probable cause shall be attributed to thejudgment of the court in the original action, when subsequently reversedfor error, may admit of some question." Id., at 149. We attempted to"reconcile the apparent contradiction in the authorities," id., at 151, byobserving that the presumption of probable cause arising from a convictioncan be rebutted only by showing that the conviction had been obtained bysome type of fraud, ibid. Although we ultimately held for the maliciousprosecution defendant, our discussion in that case well establishes that theabsolute rule Justice Souter contends for did not exist.Yet even if Justice Souter were correct in asserting that a prior conviction, although reversed, "dissolved [a] claim for malicious prosecution,"post, at 496, our analysis would be unaffected. It would simply demonstrate that no common-law action, not even malicious prosecution, wouldpermit a criminal proceeding to be impugned in a tort action, even afterthe conviction had been reversed. That would, if anything, strengthenour belief that $ 1983, which borrowed general tort principles, was notmeant to permit such collateral attack.512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT486 HECK v. HUMPHREYOpinion of the Court263 U. S. 413 (1923); Voorhees v. Jackson, 10 Pet. 449, 472-473 (1836). We think the hoary principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate vehicles for challenging the validityof outstanding criminal judgments applies to $ 1983 damagesactions that necessarily require the plaintiff to prove the un-lawfulness of his conviction or confinement, just as it hasalways applied to actions for malicious prosecution.5We hold that, in order to recover damages for allegedlyunconstitutional conviction or imprisonment, or for otherharm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render aconviction or sentence invalid,6 a $ 1983 plaintiff must prove5 Justice Souter's discussion of abuse of process, post, at 494-495, doesnot undermine this principle. It is true that favorable termination ofprior proceedings is not an element of that cause of action--but neither isan impugning of those proceedings one of its consequences. The gravamen of that tort is not the wrongfulness of the prosecution, but someextortionate perversion of lawfully initiated process to illegitimate ends.See, e. g., Donohoe Const. Co. v. Mount Vernon Associates, 235 Va. 531,539-540, 369 S. E. 2d 857, 862 (1988); see also 8 S. Speiser, C. Krause, &A. Gans, American Law of Torts $$ 28:32-28:34 (1991). Cognizable injuryfor abuse of process is limited to the harm caused by the misuse of process,and does not include harm (such as conviction and confinement) resultingfrom that process's being carried through to its lawful conclusion. Thus,one could no more seek compensatory damages for an outstanding criminalconviction in an action for abuse of process than in one for malicious prosecution. This limitation is illustrated by McGann v. Allen, 105 Conn. 177,191, 134 A. 810, 815 (1926), where the court held that expenses incurredby the plaintiff in defending herself against crimes charged against herwere not compensable in a suit for abuse of process, since "[d]amage[s] forabuse of process must be confined to the damage flowing from such abuse,and be confined to the period of time involved in taking plaintiff, after herarrest, to [defendant's] store, and the detention there."6 An example of this latter category--a $ 1983 action that does not seekdamages directly attributable to conviction or confinement but whose successful prosecution would necessarily imply that the plaintiff's criminalconviction was wrongful--would be the following: A state defendant isconvicted of and sentenced for the crime of resisting arrest, defined asintentionally preventing a peace officer from effecting a lawful arrest.(This is a common definition of that offense. See People v. Peacock, 68N. Y. 2d 675, 496 N. E. 2d 683 (1986); 4 C. Torcia, Wharton's Criminal Law$ 593, p. 307 (14th ed. 1981).) He then brings a $ 1983 action against the512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT487Cite as: 512 U. S. 477 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthat the conviction or sentence has been reversed on directappeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by astate tribunal authorized to make such determination, orcalled into question by a federal court's issuance of a writ ofhabeas corpus, 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. A claim for damages bear-ing that relationship to a conviction or sentence that hasnotbeen so invalidated is not cognizable under $ 1983. Thus,when a state prisoner seeks damages in a $ 1983 suit, thedistrict court must consider whether a judgment in favorof the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of hisconviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must bedismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the con-viction or sentence has already been invalidated. But if thedistrict court determines that the plaintiff 's action, even ifsuccessful, willnot demonstrate the invalidity of any out-standing criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the actionshould be allowed to proceed,7 in the absence of some otherbar to the suit.8arresting officer, seeking damages for violation of his Fourth Amendmentright to be free from unreasonable seizures. In order to prevail in this$ 1983 action, he would have to negate an element of the offense of whichhe has been convicted. Regardless of the state law concerning res judicata, see n. 2, supra, the $ 1983 action will not lie.7 For example, a suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search may lie even if the challenged search produced evidencethat was introduced in a state criminal trial resulting in the $ 1983 plaintiff's still-outstanding conviction. Because of doctrines like independentsource and inevitable discovery, see Murray v. United States, 487 U. S.533, 539 (1988), and especially harmless error, see Arizona v. Fulminante,499 U. S. 279, 307-308 (1991), such a $ 1983 action, even if successful, wouldnot necessarily imply that the plaintiff's conviction was unlawful. Inorder to recover compensatory damages, however, the $ 1983 plaintiff mustprove not only that the search was unlawful, but that it caused him actual,compensable injury, see Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,477 U. S. 299, 308 (1986), which, we hold today, does not encompass the"injury" of being convicted and imprisoned (until his conviction has beenoverturned).8 For example, if a state criminal defendant brings a federal civil-rightslawsuit during the pendency of his criminal trial, appeal, or state habeas action, abstention may be an appropriate response to the parallel512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT488 HECK v. HUMPHREYOpinion of the CourtRespondents had urged us to adopt a rule that was in onerespect broader than this: Exhaustion of state remediesshould be required, they contended, not just when successin the $ 1983 damages suit would necessarily show a conviction or sentence to be unlawful, but whenever "judgment ina $ 1983 action would resolve a necessary element to a likelychallenge to a conviction, even if the $ 1983 court [need] notdetermine that the conviction is invalid." Brief for Respondents 26, n. 10. Such a broad sweep was needed, re-spondents contended, lest a judgment in a prisoner's favorin a federal-court $ 1983 damages action claiming, for exam-ple, a Fourth Amendment violation, be given preclusiveeffect as to that subissue in a subsequent state-court post-conviction proceeding. Preclusion might result, they asserted, if the State exercised sufficient control over the offi-cials' defense in the $ 1983 action. See Montana v. UnitedStates, 440 U. S. 147, 154 (1979). While we have no occasionto rule on the matter at this time, it is at least plain thatpreclusion will not necessarily be an automatic, or even apermissible, effect.9state-court proceedings. See Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.v. United States, 424 U. S. 800 (1976).Moreover, we do not decide whether abstention might be appropriate incases where a state prisoner brings a $ 1983 damages suit raising an issuethat also could be grounds for relief in a state-court challenge to his conviction or sentence. Cf. Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 923 (1984).9 State courts are bound to apply federal rules in determining the preclusive effect of federal-court decisions on issues of federal law. SeeP. Bator, D. Meltzer, P. Mishkin, & D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler's TheFederal Courts and the Federal System 1604 (3d ed. 1988) ("It is clearthat where the federal court decided a federal question, federal res judicata rules govern"); Deposit Bank v. Frankfort, 191 U. S. 499, 514-518(1903); Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 170-171, 174-175 (1938). The federal rules on the subject of issue and claim preclusion, unlike those relatingto exhaustion of state remedies, are "almost entirely judge-made."Hart & Wechsler's, supra, at 1598; see also Burbank, InterjurisdictionalPreclusion, Full Faith and Credit and Federal Common Law: A GeneralApproach, 71 Cornell L. Rev. 733, 747-778 (1986). And in developing512us2$84K 01-08-98 12:35:21 PAGES OPINPGT489Cite as: 512 U. S. 477 (1994)Opinion of the CourtIn another respect, however, our holding sweeps morebroadly than the approach respondents had urged. We donot engraft an exhaustion requirement upon $ 1983, butrather deny the existence of a cause of action. Even a prisoner who has fully exhausted available state remedies hasno cause of action under $ 1983 unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed, expunged, invalidated, or im-pugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus. That makesit unnecessary for us to address the statute-of-limitationsissue wrestled with by the Court of Appeals, which concluded that a federal doctrine of equitable tolling wouldapply to the $ 1983 cause of action while state challenges tothe conviction or sentence were being exhausted. (Thecourt distinguished our cases holding that state, not federal,tolling provisions apply in $ 1983 actions, see Board of Re-gents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U. S. 478(1980); Hardin v. Straub, 490 U. S. 536 (1989), on the groundthat petitioner's claim was "in part one for habeas corpus."997 F. 2d, at 358.) Under our analysis the statute of limita-tions poses no difficulty while the state challenges are beingpursued, since the $ 1983 claim has not yet arisen. Just asa cause of action for malicious prosecution does not accrueuntil the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plain-tiff 's favor, 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions $ 7.4.1, p. 532(1991); Carnes v. Atkins Bros. Co., 123 La. 26, 31, 48 So. 572,574 (1909), so also a $ 1983 cause of action for damagesthem the courts can, and indeed should, be guided by the federal policiesreflected in congressional enactments. Cf. Moragne v. States MarineLines, Inc., 398 U. S. 375, 390-391 (1970). See also United States v. Mendoza, 464 U. S. 154 (1984) (recognizing exception to general principles ofres judicata in light of overriding federal policy concerns). Thus, thecourt-made preclusion rules may, as judicial application of the categoricalmandate of $ 1983 may not, see Patsy v. Board of Regents of Fla., 457U. S. 496, 509 (1982), take account of the policy embodied in $ 2254(b)'sexhaustion requirement, see Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.

The judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Seventh Circuit is
