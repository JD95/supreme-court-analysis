The issue in this case is whether a criminal defendant, ab-ducted to the United States from a nation with which it hasan extradition treaty, thereby acquires a defense to the juris-diction of this country's courts. We hold that he does not,and that he may be tried in federal district court for viola-tions of the criminal law of the United States.Respondent, Humberto Alvarez-Machain, is a citizen andresident of Mexico. He was indicted for participating in thekidnap and murder of United States Drug Enforcement Ad-ministration (DEA) special agent Enrique Camarena-Salazarand a Mexican pilot working with Camarena, Alfredo Zavala-Avelar.1 The DEA believes that respondent, a medical doctor, participated in the murder by prolonging Agent Camare-na's life so that others could further torture and interrogatehim. On April 2, 1990, respondent was forcibly kidnapedfrom his medical office in Guadalajara, Mexico, to be flownby private plane to El Paso, Texas, where he was arrestedby DEA officials. The District Court concluded that DEAagents were responsible for respondent's abduction, althoughthey were not personally involved in it. United States v.Caro-Quintero, 745 F. Supp. 599, 602-604, 609 (CD Cal.1990).21 Respondent is charged in a sixth superseding indictment with: conspiracy to commit violent acts in furtherance of racketeering activity (in violation of 18 U. S. C. $$ 371, 1959); committing violent acts in furtherance ofracketeering activity (in violation of $ 1959(a)(2)); conspiracy to kidnap afederal agent (in violation of $$ 1201(a)(5), (c)); kidnap of a federal agent(in violation of $ 1201(a)(5)); and felony murder of a federal agent (in violation of $$ 1111(a), 1114). App. 12-32.2 Apparently, DEA officials had attempted to gain respondent's presencein the United States through informal negotiations with Mexican officials,but were unsuccessful. DEA officials then, through a contact in Mexico,offered to pay a reward and expenses in return for the delivery of respondent to the United States. United States v. Caro-Quintero, 745 F.

The District Court rejected the outrageous governmental conduct claim, but held that it lackedjurisdiction to try respondent because his abduction violatedthe Extradition Treaty. The District Court discharged respondent and ordered that he be repatriated to Mexico. 745F. Supp., at 614.The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the indictment and the repatriation of respondent, relying on its decision in United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 939 F. 2d 1341(CA9 1991), cert. pending, No. 91-670. 946 F. 2d 1466 (1991).In Verdugo, the Court of Appeals held that the forcibleabduction of a Mexican national with the authorization orparticipation of the United States violated the ExtraditionTreaty between the United States and Mexico.3 Althoughthe Treaty does not expressly prohibit such abductions, theCourt of Appeals held that the "purpose" of the Treaty wasviolated by a forcible abduction, 939 F. 2d, at 1350, which,along with a formal protest by the offended nation, wouldgive a defendant the right to invoke the Treaty violation todefeat jurisdiction of the District Court to try him.4 TheCourt of Appeals further held that the proper remedy for3 Rene Martin Verdugo-Urquidez was also indicted for the murder ofAgent Camarena.

Therefore, theCourt of Appeals ordered that the indictment against respondent be dismissed and that respondent be repatriated toMexico. 946 F. 2d, at 1467. We granted certiorari, 502U. S. 1024 (1992), and now reverse.Although we have never before addressed the preciseissue raised in the present case, we have previously consid-ered proceedings in claimed violation of an extradition treatyand proceedings against a defendant brought before a courtby means of a forcible abduction. We addressed the formerissue in United States v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407 (1886); moreprecisely, the issue whether the Webster-Ashburton Treatyof 1842, 8 Stat. 576, which governed extraditions betweenEngland and the United States, prohibited the prosecutionof defendant Rauscher for a crime other than the crime forwhich he had been extradited. Whether this prohibition,known as the doctrine of specialty, was an intended part ofthe treaty had been disputed between the two nations forsome time. Rauscher, 119 U. S., at 411. Justice Miller de-livered the opinion of the Court, which carefully examinedthe terms and history of the treaty; the practice of nationsin regards to extradition treaties; the case law from theStates; and the writings of commentators, and reached thefollowing conclusion:"[A] person who has been brought within the jurisdic-tion of the court by virtue of proceedings under an extradition treaty, can only be tried for one of the offencesdescribed in that treaty, and for the offence with whichhe is charged in the proceedings for his extradition, untila reasonable time and opportunity have been given him,504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT660 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtafter his release or trial upon such charge, to return tothe country from whose asylum he had been forciblytaken under those proceedings." Id., at 430 (emphasisadded).In addition, Justice Miller's opinion noted that any doubt asto this interpretation was put to rest by two federal statuteswhich imposed the doctrine of specialty upon extraditiontreaties to which the United States was a party. Id., at 423.5Unlike the case before us today, the defendant in Rauscherhad been brought to the United States by way of an extradition treaty; there was no issue of a forcible abduction.InKer v. Illinois, 119 U. S. 436 (1886), also written byJustice Miller and decided the same day as Rauscher, weaddressed the issue of a defendant brought before the courtby way of a forcible abduction. Frederick Ker had beentried and convicted in an Illinois court for larceny; his pres-ence before the court was procured by means of forcible abduction from Peru. A messenger was sent to Lima with theproper warrant to demand Ker by virtue of the extraditiontreaty between Peru and the United States. The messen-ger, however, disdained reliance on the treaty processes, andinstead forcibly kidnaped Ker and brought him to the UnitedStates.6 We distinguished Ker's case from Rauscher, on thebasis that Ker was not brought into the United States byvirtue of the extradition treaty between the United Statesand Peru, and rejected Ker's argument that he had a right5 Justice Gray, concurring, would have rested the decision on the basisof these Acts of Congress alone. Rauscher, 119 U. S., at 433. Chief Justice Waite dissented, concluding that the treaty did not forbid trial on acharge other than that on which extradition was granted, and that theActs of Congress did not change the "effect of the treaty." Id., at 436.6 Although the opinion does not explain why the messenger failed topresent the warrant to the proper authorities, commentators have suggested that the seizure of Ker in the aftermath of a revolution in Peruprovided the messenger with no "proper authorities" to whom the warrantcould be presented. See Kester, Some Myths of United States Extradition Law, 76 Geo. L. J. 1441, 1451 (1988).504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT661Cite as: 504 U. S. 655 (1992)Opinion of the Courtunder the extradition treaty to be returned to this countryonly in accordance with its terms.7 We rejected Ker's dueprocess argument more broadly, holding in line with "thehighest authorities" that "such forcible abduction is no sufficient reason why the party should not answer when broughtwithin the jurisdiction of the court which has the right totry him for such an offence, and presents no valid objectionto his trial in such court."Ker, supra, at 444.In Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U. S. 519, rehearing denied, 343U. S. 937 (1952), we applied the rule in Ker to a case in whichthe defendant had been kidnaped in Chicago by Michiganofficers and brought to trial in Michigan. We upheld theconviction over objections based on the Due Process Clauseand the federal Kidnaping Act and stated:"This Court has never departed from the rule an-nounced in[Ker] that the power of a court to try a per-son for crime is not impaired by the fact that he hadbeen brought within the court's jurisdiction by reason ofa `forcible abduction.' No persuasive reasons are nowpresented to justify overruling this line of cases. They7 In the words of Justice Miller, the "treaty was not called into operation,was not relied upon, was not made the pretext of arrest, and the factsshow that it was a clear case of kidnapping within the dominions of Peru,without any pretence of authority under the treaty or from the government of the United States." Ker v. Illinois, 119 U. S., at 443.Two cases decided during the Prohibition Era in this country have dealtwith seizures claimed to have been in violation of a treaty entered intobetween the United States and Great Britain to assist the United Statesin offshore enforcement of its prohibition laws, and to allow British passenger ships to carry liquor while in the waters of the United States. 43Stat. 1761 (1924). The history of the negotiations leading to the treaty isset forth in Cook v. United States, 288 U. S. 102, 111-118 (1933). In thatcase we held that the treaty provision for seizure of British vessels operating beyond the 3-mile limit was intended to be exclusive, and that therefore liquor seized from a British vessel in violation of the treaty could notform the basis of a conviction.In Ford v. United States, 273 U. S. 593 (1927), the argument as to personal jurisdiction was deemed to have been waived.504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT662 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtrest on the sound basis that due process of law is satisfied when one present in court is convicted of crime afterhaving been fairly apprized of the charges against himand after a fair trial in accordance with constitutionalprocedural safeguards. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires a court to permit a guilty personrightfully convicted to escape justice because he wasbrought to trial against his will." Frisbie, supra, at 522(citation and footnote omitted).8The only differences between Ker and the present caseare that Ker was decided on the premise that there was nogovernmental involvement in the abduction, 119 U. S., at 443;and Peru, from which Ker was abducted, did not object tohis prosecution.9 Respondent finds these differences to bedispositive, as did the Court of Appeals in Verdugo, 939 F. 2d,at 1346, contending that they show that respondent's prosecution, like the prosecution of Rauscher, violates the impliedterms of a valid extradition treaty. The Government, on theother hand, argues that Rauscher stands as an "exception"to the rule in Ker only when an extradition treaty is invoked,and the terms of the treaty provide that its breach will limitthe jurisdiction of a court. Brief for United States 17.Therefore, our first inquiry must be whether the abductionof respondent from Mexico violated the Extradition Treatybetween the United States and Mexico. If we conclude thatthe Treaty does not prohibit respondent's abduction, the rulein Ker applies, and the court need not inquire as to how respondent came before it.8 We have applied Ker to numerous cases where the presence of thedefendant was obtained by an interstate abduction. See, e. g., Mahon v.Justice, 127 U. S. 700 (1888); Cook v. Hart, 146 U. S. 183 (1892); Pettibonev. Nichols, 203 U. S. 192, 215-216 (1906).9 Ker also was not a national of Peru, whereas respondent is a nationalof the country from which he was abducted. Respondent finds this difference to be immaterial.

S. 655 (1992)Opinion of the CourtIn construing a treaty, as in construing a statute, we firstlook to its terms to determine its meaning. Air France v.Saks, 470 U. S. 392, 397 (1985); Valentine v. United States exrel. Neidecker, 299 U. S. 5, 11 (1936). The Treaty says nothing about the obligations of the United States and Mexico torefrain from forcible abductions of people from the territoryof the other nation, or the consequences under the Treaty ifsuch an abduction occurs. Respondent submits that Article22(1) of the Treaty, which states that it "shall apply to offenses specified in Article 2 [including murder] committedbefore and after this Treaty enters into force," 31 U. S. T.,at 5073-5074, evidences an intent to make application of theTreaty mandatory for those offenses. However, the morenatural conclusion is that Article 22 was included to ensurethat the Treaty was applied to extraditions requested afterthe Treaty went into force, regardless of when the crime ofextradition occurred.10More critical to respondent's argument is Article 9 of theTreaty, which provides:"1. Neither Contracting Party shall be bound to deliverup its own nationals, but the executive authority of therequested Party shall, if not prevented by the laws ofthat Party, have the power to deliver them up if, in itsdiscretion, it be deemed proper to do so."2. If extradition is not granted pursuant to paragraph1 of this Article, the requested Party shall submit thecase to its competent authorities for the purpose ofprosecution, provided that Party has jurisdiction overthe offense." Id., at 5065.10 This interpretation is supported by the second clause of Article 22,which provides that "[r]equests for extradition that are under process onthe date of the entry into force of this Treaty, shall be resolved in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of 22 February, 1899, . . . ." Extradition Treaty, May 4, 1978, [1979] United States-United Mexican States,31 U. S. T. 5059, 5074, T. I. A. S. No. 9656.504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT664 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the CourtAccording to respondent, Article 9 embodies the terms of thebargain which the United States struck: If the United Stateswishes to prosecute a Mexican national, it may request thatindividual's extradition. Upon a request from the UnitedStates, Mexico may either extradite the individual or submitthe case to the proper authorities for prosecution in Mexico.In this way, respondent reasons, each nation preserved itsright to choose whether its nationals would be tried in itsown courts or by the courts of the other nation. This preservation of rights would be frustrated if either nation werefree to abduct nationals of the other nation for the purposesof prosecution. More broadly, respondent reasons, as didthe Court of Appeals, that all the processes and restrictionson the obligation to extradite established by the Treatywould make no sense if either nation were free to resort toforcible kidnaping to gain the presence of an individual forprosecution in a manner not contemplated by the Treaty.Verdugo, supra, at 1350.We do not read the Treaty in such a fashion. Article 9does not purport to specify the only way in which one country may gain custody of a national of the other country forthe purposes of prosecution. In the absence of an extradition treaty, nations are under no obligation to surrenderthose in their country to foreign authorities for prosecution.Rauscher, 119 U. S., at 411-412; Factor v. Laubenheimer, 290U. S. 276, 287 (1933); cf. Valentine v. United States ex rel.Neidecker, supra, at 8-9 (United States may not extraditea citizen in the absence of a statute or treaty obligation).Extradition treaties exist so as to impose mutual obligationsto surrender individuals in certain defined sets of circumstances, following established procedures. See 1 J. Moore, ATreatise on Extradition and Interstate Rendition $ 72 (1891).The Treaty thus provides a mechanism which would not otherwise exist, requiring, under certain circumstances, theUnited States and Mexico to extradite individuals to the504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT665Cite as: 504 U. S. 655 (1992)Opinion of the Courtother country, and establishing the procedures to be followedwhen the Treaty is invoked.The history of negotiation and practice under the Treatyalso fails to show that abductions outside of the Treaty constitute a violation of the Treaty. As the Solicitor Generalnotes, the Mexican Government was made aware, as early as1906, of theKer doctrine, and the United States' positionthat it applied to forcible abductions made outside of theterms of the United States-Mexico Extradition Treaty.11Nonetheless, the current version of the Treaty, signed in1978, does not attempt to establish a rule that would in anyway curtail the effect of Ker.12 Moreover, although lan-guage which would grant individuals exactly the rightsought by respondent had been considered and drafted as11 In correspondence between the United States and Mexico growing outof the 1905 Martinez incident, in which a Mexican national was abductedfrom Mexico and brought to the United States for trial, the MexicanCharge' wrote to the Secretary of State protesting that as Martinez' arrestwas made outside of the procedures established in the extradition treaty,"the action pending against the man can not rest [on] any legal foundation." Letter of Balbino Davalos to Secretary of State, reprinted in Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations of the United States, H. R. Doc.No. 1, 59th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 1121 (1906). The Secretary of Stateresponded that the exact issue raised by the Martinez incident had beendecided by Ker, and that the remedy open to the Mexican Government,namely, a request to the United States for extradition of Martinez' abductor, had been granted by the United States. Letter of Robert Bacon toMexican Charge', reprinted in Papers Relating to the Foreign Relations ofthe United States, H. R. Doc. No. 1, supra, at 1121-1122.Respondent and the Court of Appeals stress a statement made in 1881by Secretary of State James Blaine to the Governor of Texas to the effectthat the extradition treaty in its form at that time did not authorize unconsented to abductions from Mexico. Verdugo, 939 F. 2d, at 1354; Brief forRespondent 14. This misses the mark, however, for the Government'sargument is not that the Treaty authorizes the abduction of respondent,but that the Treaty does not prohibit the abduction.12 The parties did expressly include the doctrine of specialty in Article17 of the Treaty, notwithstanding the judicial recognition of it in UnitedStates v. Rauscher, 119 U. S. 407 (1886). 31 U. S. T., at 5071-5072.504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT666 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtearly as 1935 by a prominent group of legal scholars sponsored by the faculty of Harvard Law School, no such clauseappears in the current Treaty.13Thus, the language of the Treaty, in the context of its history, does not support the proposition that the Treaty prohibits abductions outside of its terms. The remaining question, therefore, is whether the Treaty should be interpretedso as to include an implied term prohibiting prosecutionwhere the defendant's presence is obtained by means otherthan those established by the Treaty. See Valentine, 299U. S., at 17 ("Strictly the question is not whether there hadbeen a uniform practical construction denying the power, butwhether the power had been so clearly recognized that thegrant should be implied").Respondent contends that the Treaty must be interpretedagainst the backdrop of customary international law, andthat international abductions are "so clearly prohibited ininternational law" that there was no reason to include sucha clause in the Treaty itself. Brief for Respondent 11. Theinternational censure of international abductions is furtherevidenced, according to respondent, by the United NationsCharter and the Charter of the Organization of AmericanStates. Id., at 17. Respondent does not argue that thesesources of international law provide an independent basis forthe right respondent asserts not to be tried in the UnitedStates, but rather that they should inform the interpretationof the Treaty terms.13 In Article 16 of the Draft Convention on Jurisdiction with Respect toCrime, the Advisory Committee of the Research in International Lawproposed:"In exercising jurisdiction under this Convention, no State shall prosecuteor punish any person who has been brought within its territory or a placesubject to its authority by recourse to measures in violation of international law or international convention without first obtaining the consentof the State or States whose rights have been violated by such measures."Harvard Research in International Law, 29 Am. J. Int'l L. 442 (Supp. 1935).504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT667Cite as: 504 U. S. 655 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals deemed it essential, in order for theindividual defendant to assert a right under the Treaty, thatthe affected foreign government had registered a protest.Verdugo, 939 F. 2d, at 1357 ("[I]n the kidnapping case theremust be a formal protest from the offended government afterthe kidnapping"). Respondent agrees that the right exer-cised by the individual is derivative of the nation's rightunder the Treaty, since nations are authorized, notwith-standing the terms of an extradition treaty, to voluntarilyrender an individual to the other country on terms com-pletely outside of those provided in the treaty. The formalprotest, therefore, ensures that the "offended" nation actually objects to the abduction and has not in some way voluntarily rendered the individual for prosecution. Thus theExtradition Treaty only prohibits gaining the defendant'spresence by means other than those set forth in the Treatywhen the nation from which the defendant was abductedobjects.This argument seems to us inconsistent with the remainder of respondent's argument. The Extradition Treaty hasthe force of law, and if, as respondent asserts, it is selfexecuting, it would appear that a court must enforce it onbehalf of an individual regardless of the offensiveness of thepractice of one nation to the other nation. In Rauscher, theCourt noted that Great Britain had taken the position inother cases that the Webster-Ashburton Treaty included thedoctrine of specialty, but no importance was attached towhether or not Great Britain had protested the prosecutionof Rauscher for the crime of cruel and unusual punishmentas opposed to murder.More fundamentally, the difficulty with the support respondent garners from international law is that none of itrelates to the practice of nations in relation to extraditiontreaties. In Rauscher, we implied a term in the WebsterAshburton Treaty because of the practice of nations withregard to extradition treaties. In the instant case, respond504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT668 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINOpinion of the Courtent would imply terms in the Extradition Treaty from thepractice of nations with regards to international law moregenerally.14 Respondent would have us find that the Treatyacts as a prohibition against a violation of the general principle of international law that one government may not "exercise its police power in the territory of another state." Brieffor Respondent 16. There are many actions which could betaken by a nation that would violate this principle, includingwaging war, but it cannot seriously be contended that aninvasion of the United States by Mexico would violate theterms of the Extradition Treaty between the two nations.15In sum, to infer from this Treaty and its terms that itprohibits all means of gaining the presence of an individual14 Similarly, the Court of Appeals in Verdugo reasoned that internationalabductions violate the "purpose" of the Treaty, stating that "[t]he requirements extradition treaties impose constitute a means of safeguarding thesovereignty of the signatory nations, as well as ensuring the fair treatmentof individuals." 939 F. 2d, at 1350. The ambitious purpose ascribed tothe Treaty by the Court of Appeals, we believe, places a greater burdenon its language and history than they can logically bear. In a broad sense,most international agreements have the common purpose of safeguardingthe sovereignty of signatory nations, in that they seek to further peacefulrelations between nations. This, however, does not mean that the violation of any principle of international law constitutes a violation of thisparticular treaty.15 In the same category are the examples cited by respondent in which,after a forcible international abduction, the offended nation protested theabduction and the abducting nation then returned the individual to theprotesting nation. Brief for Respondent 18, citing, inter alia, 1 Bassiouni,International Extradition: United States Law and Practice $ 5.4, pp. 235-237 (2d rev. ed. 1987). These may show the practice of nations undercustomary international law, but they are of little aid in construing theterms of an extradition treaty, or the authority of a court to later try anindividual who has been so abducted. More to the point for our purposesare cases such as The Richmond, 9 Cranch 102 (1815), and The Merino, 9Wheat. 391 (1824), both of which hold that a seizure of a vessel in violationof international law does not affect the jurisdiction of a United Statescourt to adjudicate rights in connection with the vessel. These cases arediscussed, and distinguished, in Cook v. United States, 288 U. S., at 122.504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT669Cite as: 504 U. S. 655 (1992)Opinion of the Courtoutside of its terms goes beyond established precedent andpractice. In Rauscher, the implication of a doctrine ofspecialty into the terms of the Webster-Ashburton Treaty,which, by its terms, required the presentation of evidenceestablishing probable cause of the crime of extradition beforeextradition was required, was a small step to take. By contrast, to imply from the terms of this Treaty that it prohibitsobtaining the presence of an individual by means outside ofthe procedures the Treaty establishes requires a much largerinferential leap, with only the most general of internationallaw principles to support it. The general principles cited byrespondent simply fail to persuade us that we should implyin the United States-Mexico Extradition Treaty a term pro-hibiting international abductions.Respondent and his amici may be correct that respond-ent's abduction was "shocking," Tr. of Oral Arg. 40, and thatit may be in violation of general international law principles.Mexico has protested the abduction of respondent throughdiplomatic notes, App. 33-38, and the decision of whetherrespondent should be returned to Mexico, as a matter outsideof the Treaty, is a matter for the Executive Branch.16 We16 The Mexican Government has also requested from the United Statesthe extradition of two individuals it suspects of having abducted respondent in Mexico, on charges of kidnaping. App. 39-66.The advantage of the diplomatic approach to the resolution of difficultiesbetween two sovereign nations, as opposed to unilateral action by thecourts of one nation, is illustrated by the history of the negotiations leading to the treaty discussed in Cook v. United States, supra. The UnitedStates was interested in being able to search British vessels that hoveredbeyond the 3-mile limit and served as supply ships for motor launches,which took intoxicating liquor from them into ports for further distribution in violation of prohibition laws. The United States initially proposedthat both nations agree to searches of the other's vessels beyond the 3-mile limit; Great Britain rejected such an approach, since it had no prohibition laws and therefore no problem with United States vessels hoveringjust beyond its territorial waters. The parties appeared to be at loggerheads; then this Court decided Cunard S. S. Co. v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 100(1923), holding that our prohibition laws applied to foreign merchant ves504us2$89I 04-08-96 07:14:11 PAGES OPINPGT670 UNITED STATES v. ALVAREZ-MACHAINStevens, J., dissentingconclude, however, that respondent's abduction was not inviolation of the Extradition Treaty between the UnitedStates and Mexico, and therefore the rule of Ker v. Illinoisis fully applicable to this case. The fact of respondent's forcible abduction does not therefore prohibit his trial in a courtin the United States for violations of the criminal laws of theUnited States.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsconsistent with this opinion.
