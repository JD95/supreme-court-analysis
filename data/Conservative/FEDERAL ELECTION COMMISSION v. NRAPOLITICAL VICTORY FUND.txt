We granted certiorari in this case to review a judgment ofthe Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitholding that the congressionally mandated composition ofpetitioner Federal Election Commission (FEC), including asit did representatives of the Senate and House as nonvotingmembers, violated the separation-of-powers principle embodied in the Constitution. 512 U. S. 1218 (1994). We donot reach the merits of the question, however, because weconclude that the FEC is not authorized to petition for cer-tiorari in this Court on its own, and that the effort of theSolicitor General to authorize the FEC's petition after thetime for filing it had expired did not breathe life into it.The Court of Appeals entered judgment in this case onOctober 22, 1993. 6 F. 3d 821. The FEC, in its own name,filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on January 18, 1994.The FEC neither sought nor obtained the authorization ofthe Solicitor General before filing its petition. By orderdated March 21, 1994, 510 U. S. 1190, we invited the UnitedStates to file a brief addressing the question "[w]hether the[FEC] has statutory authority to represent itself in this casein this Court." The United States filed a brief on May 27,1994, contending that the FEC lacks such statutory author-ity. The United States stated, however, that pursuant to 28U. S. C. $ 518(a) and its implementing regulation, the Solici-tor General had authorized the FEC's petition by letterdated May 26, 1994. See Brief for United States as AmicusCuriae 13. The FEC filed a brief in response on May 31,1994, asserting that it has independent statutory authorityto represent itself before this Court in this case.A petition for certiorari in a civil case must be filed within90 days of the entry of the judgment below. 28 U. S. C.$ 2101(c). This "90-day limit is mandatory and jurisdictional." Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 45 (1990). Here,the Court of Appeals entered judgment on October 22, 1993,513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT91Cite as: 513 U. S. 88 (1994)Opinion of the Courtand the FEC filed its petition for certiorari on January 18,1994, two days before the 90-day time period expired. TheFEC's petition would appear to be timely. However, if theFEC lacks statutory authority to represent itself in this casebefore this Court, it cannot independently file a petition forcertiorari, but must receive the Solicitor General's authoriza-tion. See 28 CFR $ 0.20(a) (1994). The question then becomes whether the Solicitor General's May 26, 1994, letterauthorizing the FEC's petition relates back to the date ofthe FEC's unauthorized filing so as to make it timely. Wefirst examine the scope of the FEC's independent litigating authority.The FEC is an independent agency established by Congress to "administer, seek to obtain compliance with, andformulate policy" with respect to the Federal ElectionCampaign Act of 1971 (FECA) and chapters 95 and 96 ofTitle 26. 86 Stat. 3, as amended, 2 U. S. C. $ 437c(b)(1). TheFECA governs various aspects of all federal elections, see2 U. S. C. $ 431 et seq., whereas chapters 95 and 96 specificallygovern the administration of funds for Presidential electioncampaigns and the payment of matching funds for Presidential primary campaigns, see 26 U. S. C. $ 9001 et seq. (Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act), 26 U. S. C. $ 9031 etseq. (Presidential Primary Matching Payment Account Act).The FEC has "exclusive jurisdiction with respect to the civilenforcement of such provisions." 2 U. S. C. $ 437c(b)(1); seeFederal Election Comm'n v. National Conservative Political Action Comm., 470 U. S. 480, 485, 489 (1985).Two separate statutory provisions provide the FEC withindependent litigating authority. The first provision, 2U. S. C. $ 437d(a)(6), applies to actions under both the FECAand chapters 95 and 96 of Title 26. It gives the FEC power"to initiate . . . , defend . . . or appeal any civil action . . . toenforce the provisions of [the FECA] and chapter 95 andchapter 96 of title 26, through its general counsel." The second provision, which is contained in 26 U. S. C. $$ 9010(d) and513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT92 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. NRAPOLITICAL VICTORY FUNDOpinion of the Court9040(d), applies only to actions under chapters 95 and 96 ofTitle 26. It authorizes the FEC "on behalf of the UnitedStates to appeal from, and to petition the Supreme Courtfor certiorari to review, judgments or decrees entered withrespect to actions in which it appears pursuant to the authority provided in this section."The FEC brought this civil enforcement action seeking toestablish a violation of 2 U. S. C. $ 441b(a), a provision of theFECA. As noted above, 2 U. S. C. $ 437d(a)(6) authorizesthe FEC to "initiate" and "appeal" an FECA enforcementaction such as the present one. Thus, no dispute exists asto the FEC's authority to litigate this case in the DistrictCourt or the Court of Appeals; 1 the question here concernsonly the FEC's independent litigating authority before thisCourt when it proceeds under $ 437d(a)(6).Title 28 U. S. C. $ 518(a) provides in pertinent part:"Except when the Attorney General in a particularcase directs otherwise, the Attorney General and theSolicitor General shall conduct and argue suits andappeals in the Supreme Court . . . in which the UnitedStates is interested."By regulation, the Attorney General has delegated authorityto the Solicitor General:"The following-described matters are assigned to, andshall be conducted, handled, or supervised by, the Solicitor General, in consultation with each agency or officialconcerned:"(a) Conducting, or assigning and supervising, allSupreme Court cases, including appeals, petitions for1 Under 28 U. S. C. $$ 516 and 519, the conduct of litigation on behalf ofthe United States and its agencies is subject to control of the AttorneyGeneral "[e]xcept as otherwise authorized by law." The FEC's "initiation" and "appeal" of this action fall within this "otherwise authorized bylaw" exception.513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT93Cite as: 513 U. S. 88 (1994)Opinion of the Courtand in opposition to certiorari, briefs and arguments,and . . . settlement thereof." 28 CFR $ 0.20 (1994).Thus, if a case is one "in which the United States is inter-ested," $ 518(a), "it must be conducted and argued in thisCourt by the Solicitor General or his designee." UnitedStates v. Providence Journal Co., 485 U. S. 693, 700 (1988);cf. United States v. Winston, 170 U. S. 522, 524-525 (1898);Confiscation Cases, 7 Wall. 454, 458 (1869).It is undisputed that this is a case "in which the UnitedStates is interested." 28 U. S. C. $ 518(a). We have recognized, however, that Congress may "exempt litigation fromthe otherwise blanket coverage of [$ 518(a)]."ProvidenceJournal, 485 U. S., at 705, n. 9. According to the FEC, onesuch exemption is found in 2 U. S. C. $ 437d(a)(6). Bearingin mind the Solicitor General's traditional role in conductingand controlling all Supreme Court litigation on behalf of theUnited States and its agencies--a role that is critical to theproper management of Government litigation brought beforethis Court, seeid., at 702, n. 7, 706; id., at 709, 713-714(Stevens, J., dissenting)--we "must . . . scrutiniz[e] and sub-jec[t] [$ 437d(a)(6)] to the ordinary tools of statutory construction to determine whether Congress intended to supersede$ 518(a)."Id., at 705, n. 9.Title 2 U. S. C. $ 437d(a)(6) gives the FEC power "to initiate . . . , defend . . . or appeal any civil action . . . to enforcethe provisions of [the FECA] and chapter 95 and chapter96 of title 26." The statute clearly authorizes the FEC to"appeal," but it omits any mention of authority to file a "petition for a writ of certiorari" or otherwise conduct litigationbefore the Supreme Court. The FEC argues that the term"appeal" is not defined in the FECA, and that in the absenceof such a definition in the statute the term is construed "inaccordance with its ordinary or natural meaning." FDICv. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 476 (1994). It then refers to thedefinition of "appeal" found in Black's Law Dictionary 96(6th ed. 1990), which includes, inter alia, the following:513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT94 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. NRAPOLITICAL VICTORY FUNDOpinion of the Court"There are two stages of appeal in the federal and manystate court systems; to wit, appeal from trial court tointermediate appellate court and then to SupremeCourt."This argument might carry considerable weight if it werenot for the cognate provision authorizing the FEC to enforcechapters 95 and 96 of Title 26. There, Congress has explic-itly provided that "[t]he [FEC] is authorized on behalf of theUnited States to appeal from, and to petition the SupremeCourt for certiorari to review," judgments or decrees. 26U. S. C. $$ 9010(d), 9040(d) (emphasis added). It is difficult,if not impossible, to place these sections alongside one an-other without concluding that Congress intended to restrictthe FEC's independent litigating authority in this Court toactions enforcing the provisions of the Presidential electionfunds under chapters 95 and 96 of Title 26. Such a differentiation by Congress would be quite understandable, sincePresidential influence through the Solicitor General might bethought more likely in cases involving Presidential electionfund controversies than in other litigation in which the FECis involved.2The FEC argues that 26 U. S. C. $$ 9010(d) and 9040(d)shed no light on the issue whether 2 U. S. C. $ 437d(a)(6)gives it independent litigating authority before this Courtbecause the provisions are found in different statutes, weredrafted by different Congresses in different years, and were2 The dissent says it is incongruous "to assume that Congress wantedthe FEC to have independent authority to invoke our mandatory [appellate] jurisdiction when proceeding under $ 437h, but not to have the authority to invoke our discretionary jurisdiction when proceeding underother sections of the same statute." Post, at 100, n. 1. But Congresscould have thought the Solicitor General would better represent the FEC'sinterests in cases involving our discretionary jurisdiction "because the traditional specialization of that office has led it to be keenly attuned to thisCourt's practice with respect to the granting or denying of petitions forcertiorari."

Brief for Petitioner in Response to Solicitor General 21. The FEC is only partially correct. Section 9010(d)was first enacted in 1971, and at that time it applied to theComptroller General. See Presidential Election CampaignFund Act, Pub. L. 92-178, 85 Stat. 497, 569-570. The Fed-eral Election Campaign Act Amendments of 1974 establishedthe FEC, see Pub. L. 93-443, 88 Stat. 1263, 1280, and enacted$ 437d(a)(6). Seeid., at 1282-1283. The 1974 statute transferred to the FEC the functions previously performed by theComptroller General under 26 U. S. C. $ 9010, seeid., at 1293,but it also added $ 9040 to Title 26. See id., at 1302. Thus,$ 9040(d) was originally enacted in 1974 as part of the samelegislation that created $ 437d(a)(6). Each of the two sections, with its contrasting language as to litigating authority,was before the Conference Committee whose report wasultimately adopted by both Houses. H. R. Conf. Rep. No.93-1438, pp. 967, 989 (1974). Section 9040(d) may havebeen modeled on $ 9010(d), but because both $$ 9040(d) and437d(a)(6) were designed to deal with the FEC's authorityto represent itself in civil enforcement actions, we find thecontrasting language to be particularly telling. See UnitedStates v. American Building Maintenance Industries, 422U. S. 271, 277 (1975); cf. Keene Corp. v. United States, 508U. S. 200, 208 (1993) ("Where Congress includes particularlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another. . . , it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion")(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).We recognize sound policy reasons may exist for providingthe FEC with independent litigating authority in this Courtfor actions enforcing the FECA. Congress' decision to create the FEC as an independent agency and to charge it withthe civil enforcement of the FECA was undoubtedly influenced by Congress' belief that the Justice Department,headed by a Presidential appointee, might choose to ignore513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT96 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. NRAPOLITICAL VICTORY FUNDOpinion of the Courtinfractions committed by members of the President's ownpolitical party. See,e. g., Federal Election Reform, 1973:Hearings before the Subcommittee on Priveleges [sic] andElections and the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., 17, 177, 186 (1973); FederalElection Campaign Act of 1973: Hearings before the Subcom-mittee on Communications of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., 70-71 (1973). The fact that Con-gress had these policies in mind when giving the FECindependent enforcement powers, however, does not demon-strate that it intended to alter the Solicitor General's statutory prerogative to conduct and argue the Federal Government's litigation in the Supreme Court. See 28 U. S. C.$ 518(a).That statutory authority, too, represents a policy choice byCongress to vest the conduct of litigation before this Courtin the Attorney General, an authority which has by rule andtradition been delegated to the Solicitor General. See 28CFR $ 0.20(a) (1994). This Court, of course, is well servedby such a practice, because the traditional specialization ofthat office has led it to be keenly attuned to this Court'spractice with respect to the granting or denying of petitionsfor certiorari. But the practice also serves the Governmentwell; an individual Government agency necessarily has amore parochial view of the interest of the Government inlitigation than does the Solicitor General's office, with itsbroader view of litigation in which the Government is involved throughout the state and federal court systems.Whether review of a decision adverse to the Government ina court of appeals should be sought depends on a number offactors which do not lend themselves to easy categorization.The Government as a whole is apt to fare better if thesedecisions are concentrated in a single official. See Providence Journal, 485 U. S., at 706.Congress could obviously choose, if it sought to do so,to sacrifice the policy favoring concentration of litigating513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT97Cite as: 513 U. S. 88 (1994)Opinion of the Courtauthority before this Court in the Solicitor General in favorof allowing the FEC to petition here on its own. See26 U. S. C. $$ 9010(d), 9040(d). But we do not think that$ 437d(a)(6) bespeaks such a choice. Nor are we impressedby the FEC's argument that it has represented itself beforethis Court on several occasions in the past without any ques-tion having been raised regarding its authority to do sounder $ 437d(a)(6). See, e. g., Federal Election Comm'n v.Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U. S. 238 (1986)(finding 2 U. S. C. $ 441b unconstitutional as applied); FederalElection Comm'n v. National Right to Work Comm., 459U. S. 197 (1982) ( involving interpretati on of 2 U. S. C.$ 441b(b)(4)(C)); Bread Political Action Comm. v. FederalElection Comm'n, 455 U. S. 577 (1982) (involving applicationof 2 U. S. C. $ 437h(a)); Federal Election Comm'n v. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U. S. 27 (1981) (involving application of 2 U. S. C. $ 441a(d)(3)); CaliforniaMedical Assn. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 453 U. S. 182(1981) (upholding constitutionality of certain campaign expenditure limitations imposed by 2 U. S. C. $ 431 et seq.).The jurisdiction of this Court was challenged in none of theseactions, and therefore the question is an open one before us.See, e. g., Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S.58, 63, n. 4 (1989) ("[T]his Court has never considered itselfbound [by prior sub silentio holdings] when a subsequentcase finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); United States v.L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U. S. 33, 38 (1952) (same).And we do not think that the provisions discussed above,authorizing the FEC to litigate in the federal courts, are thesort of provisions that can be said to be within the provinceof the agency to interpret. Federal Election Comm'n v.Democratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., supra, at 37, relied upon by the FEC, dealt with the FEC's interpretation ofa substantive provision of the FECA, not with the provisionsauthorizing independent litigation.513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT98 FEDERAL ELECTION COMM'N v. NRAPOLITICAL VICTORY FUNDOpinion of the CourtBecause the FEC lacks statutory authority to litigate thiscase in this Court, it necessarily follows that the FEC cannotindependently file a petition for certiorari, but must receivethe Solicitor General's authorization. See 28 CFR $ 0.20(a)(1994). By letter dated May 26, 1994, the Solicitor Generalauthorized the petition filed by the FEC. The Solicitor General's authorization, however, did not come until more than120 days after the deadline for filing a petition had passed.See 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(c). We must determine whether this"after-the-fact" authorization relates back to the date of theFEC's unauthorized filing so as to make it timely. We conclude that it does not.The question is at least presumptively governed by principles of agency law, and in particular the doctrine of ratification. "If an act to be effective in creating a right againstanother or to deprive him of a right must be performed before a specific time, an affirmance is not effective against theother unless made before such time." Restatement (Second) of Agency $ 90 (1958); see also id., Comment a ("Thebringing of an action, or of an appeal, by a purported agentcan not be ratified after the cause of action or right to appealhas been terminated by lapse of time"). Though in a different context, we have recognized the rationale behind thisrule: "The intervening rights of third persons cannot be defeated by the ratification. In other words, it is essential thatthe party ratifying should be able not merely to do the actratified at the time the act was done, but also at the time theratification was made." Cook v. Tullis, 18 Wall. 332, 338(1874) (emphasis added). Here, the Solicitor General attempted to ratify the FEC's filing on May 26, 1994, but hecould not himself have filed a petition for certiorari on thatdate because the 90-day time period for filing a petition hadexpired on January 20, 1994. His authorization simply cametoo late in the day to be effective. See, e. g., Nasewaupee v.Sturgeon Bay, 77 Wis. 2d 110, 116-119, 251 N. W. 2d 845,513us1$$7H 03-30-98 08:21:47 PAGES OPINPGT99Cite as: 513 U. S. 88 (1994)Opinion of the Court848-849 (1977) (refusing to uphold town board's ratificationof private attorney's unauthorized commencement of lawsuitwhere ratification came after the statute of limitations hadrun); Wagner v. Globe, 150 Ariz. 82, 87, 722 P. 2d 250, 255(1986) (holding invalid city council's attempt to ratify policechief 's dismissal of police officer after police officer commenced a wrongful discharge action). But see Trenton v.Fowler-Thorne Co., 57 N. J. Super. 196, 154 A. 2d 369 (1959)(upholding city's ratification of unauthorized lawsuit filed onits behalf even though ratification occurred after limitationsperiod had expired).The application of these principles of agency law here pro-duces a result entirely consistent with, and perhaps requiredby, 28 U. S. C. $ 2101(c), the statute governing the time forfiling petitions for certiorari. "We have no authority to extend the period for filing except as Congress permits." Jenkins, 495 U. S., at 45. If the Solicitor General were allowedto retroactively authorize otherwise unauthorized agencypetitions after the deadline had expired, he would have theunilateral power to extend the 90-day statutory period forfiling certiorari petitions by days, weeks, or, as in this case,even months. Such a practice would result in the blurringof the jurisdictional deadline. But "[t]he time of appealabil-ity, having jurisdictional consequences, should above all beclear." Budinich v. Becton Dickinson & Co., 486 U. S. 196,202 (1988).We hold that the FEC may not independently file a peti-tion for certiorari in this Court under 2 U. S. C. $ 437d(a)(6),and that the Solicitor General's "after-the-fact" authorizationdoes not relate back to the date of the FEC's unauthorizedfiling so as to make it timely. We therefore dismiss the peti-tion for certiorari for want of jurisdiction.
