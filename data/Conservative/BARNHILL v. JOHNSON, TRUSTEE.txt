Court.Under the Bankruptcy Code's preference avoidance section, 11 U. S. C. $ 547, the trustee is permitted to recover,with certain exceptions, transfers of property made by thedebtor within 90 days before the date the bankruptcy petition was filed. We granted certiorari to decide whether, indetermining if a transfer occurred within the 90-day preference period, a transfer made by check should be deemed tooccur on the date the check is presented to the recipient or503us2$53H 11-14-95 18:00:22 PAGES OPINPGT395Cite as: 503 U. S. 393 (1992)Opinion of the Courton the date the drawee bank honors it. We hold that thelatter date is determinative.The relevant facts in this case are not in dispute. Thedebtor 1 made payment for a bona fide debt to petitionerBarnhill. The check was delivered to petitioner on November 18. The check was dated November 19, and the checkwas honored by the drawee bank on November 20. Thedebtor later filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition. It isagreed by the parties that the 90th day before the bankruptcy filing was November 20.Respondent Johnson was appointed trustee for the bankruptcy estate. He filed an adversary proceeding againstpetitioner, claiming that the check payment was recoverableby the estate pursuant to 11 U. S. C. $ 547(b). That sectiongenerally permits the trustee to recover for benefit of thebankruptcy estate transfers of the debtor's property madewithin 90 days of the bankruptcy filing. Respondent asserted that the transfer occurred on November 20, the datethe check was honored by the drawee bank, and thereforewas within the 90-day period. Petitioner defended byclaiming that the transfer occurred on November 18, the datehe received the check (the so-called "date of delivery" rule),and that it therefore fell outside the 90-day period established by $ 547(b)(4)(A).The Bankruptcy Court concluded that a date of deliveryrule should govern and therefore denied the trustee recovery. The trustee appealed, and the District Court affirmed.The trustee then appealed to the Court of Appeals for theTenth Circuit.1 The debtor in this case is actually a collection of debtors whose simultaneous and related bankruptcy filings have been consolidated in a singleproceeding: Alan J. and Mary Frances Antweil, husband and wife, MorrisAntweil (deceased), and Hobbs Pipe & Supply, a general partnership.Nothing in our decision turns on this fact, and we therefore refer tothem collectively as "debtor."503us2$53H 11-14-95 18:00:22 PAGES OPINPGT396 BARNHILL v. JOHNSONOpinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed, concluding that a date of honor rule should govern actions under$ 547(b). In re Antweil, 931 F. 2d 689 (1991). It distinguished a prior decision, In re White River Corp., 799 F. 2d631 (1986), in which it held that, for purposes of $ 547(c), adate of delivery rule should govern when a transfer occurs.2The Tenth Circuit concluded that $$ 547(b) and 547(c) havedifferent purposes and functions, justifying different rulesfor each. It further concluded that a date of honor rule wasappropriate because such a rule was consistent with provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code (U. C.

C. $ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp. II) 4 defines "trans-fer" to mean"every mode, direct or indirect, absolute or conditional,voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or parting withproperty or with an interest in property, including re-tention of title as a security interest and foreclosure ofthe debtor's equity of redemption."Section 547(e) provides further guidance on the meaning anddating of a transfer. For purposes of $ 547, it provides"[(e)(1)](B) a transfer of a fixture or property other thanreal property is perfected when a creditor on a simplecontract cannot acquire a judicial lien that is superior tothe interest of the transferee."[(e)](2) For the purposes of this section, except as pro-vided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, a transfer ismade--"(A) at the time such transfer takes effect between thetransferor and the transferee, if such transfer is perfected at, or within 10 days after, such time;"(B) at the time such transfer is perfected, if such trans-fer is perfected after such 10 days . . . ."Our task, then, is to determine whether, under the definitionof transfer provided by $ 101(54), and supplemented by$ 547(e), the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid can besaid to have occurred before November 20."What constitutes a transfer and when it is complete" is amatter of federal law.McKenzie v. Irving Trust Co., 3234 The definition of transfer was codified in 1986 at 11 U. S. C. $ 101(50).In 1990, Congress added eight new definitions to $ 101 in two separateActs, Public Laws 101-311 and 101-647. The addition of the new definitions apparently has resulted in confusion in codifying those definitions,with the result that there are now in the United States Code, Chapter 11,two sections 101(54), one defining "stockbroker" and the second defining"transfer." We will refer to "transfer" as being codified at $ 101(54).503us2$53H 11-14-95 18:00:23 PAGES OPINPGT398 BARNHILL v. JOHNSONOpinion of the CourtU. S. 365, 369-370 (1945). This is unsurprising since, asnoted above, the statute itself provides a definition of "transfer." But that definition in turn includes references to part-ing with "property" and "interest[s] in property." In theabsence of any controlling federal law, "property" and "inter-ests in property" are creatures of state law.Id., at 370;Butner v. United States, 440 U. S. 48, 54 (1979) ("Congresshas generally left the determination of property rights in theassets of a bankrupt's estate to state law"). Thus it is helpful to sketch briefly the rights and duties enjoyed understate law by each party to a check transaction.5A person with an account at a bank enjoys a claim againstthe bank for funds in an amount equal to the account balance.Under the U. C. C., a check is simply an order to the draweebank to pay the sum stated, signed by the maker and payableon demand. U. C. C. $$ 3-104(1), (2)(b), 2 U. L. A. 224 (1991).Receipt of a check does not, however, give the recipient aright against the bank. The recipient may present thecheck, but, if the drawee bank refuses to honor it, the recipient has no recourse against the drawee. $ 3-409(1), 2AU. L. A. 189 (1991).6That is not to say, however, that the recipient of a checkis without any rights. Receipt of a check for an underlyingobligation suspends the obligation "pro tanto until the in-strument['s] . . . presentment[;] . . . discharge of the underlying obligor on the instrument also discharges him on the obli-gation." $ 3-802(1)(b), 2A U. L. A. 514 (1991). But should5 We discuss these issues under the rubric of the U. C. C. and, in particular, U. C. C. Article 3. New Mexico, the State in which the instant transaction occurred, has adopted the U. C. C., see N. M. Stat. Ann. $ 55-3-101et seq. (1978 and Supp. 1991), as have all other 49 States, the District ofColumbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. We are aware of no materialdifferences between the version adopted by each of these other jurisdictions and the one we consider today, that of New Mexico.6 "A check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment ofany funds in the hands of the drawee available for its payment, and thedrawee is not liable on the instrument until he accepts it."503us2$53H 11-14-95 18:00:23 PAGES OPINPGT399Cite as: 503 U. S. 393 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthe drawee bank refuse to honor a check, a cause of actionagainst the drawer of the check accrues to the recipient of acheck "upon demand following dishonor of the instrument."$ 3-122(3), 2 U. L. A. 407 (1991); see also $ 3- 413(2), 2AU. L. A. 208 (1991). And the recipient of a dishonored check,received in payment on an underlying obligation, may maintain an action on either the check or the obligation. $ 3-802(1)(b), 2A U. L. A. 514 (1991).With this background we turn to the issue at hand. Peti-tioner argues that the Court of Appeals erred in ignoringthe interest that passed from the debtor to the petitionerwhen the check was delivered on a date outside the 90-daypreference period. We disagree. We begin by noting thatthere can be no assertion that an unconditional transfer ofthe debtor's interest in property had occurred before No-vember 20. This is because, as just noted above, receipt ofa check gives the recipient no right in the funds held by thebank on the drawer's account. Myriad events can intervenebetween delivery and presentment of the check that wouldresult in the check being dishonored. The drawer couldchoose to close the account. A third party could obtain alien against the account by garnishment or other proceedings. The bank might mistakenly refuse to honor thecheck.7The import of the preceding discussion for the instant caseis that no transfer of any part of the debtor's claim againstthe bank occurred until the bank honored the check on No-vember 20. The drawee bank honored the check by payingit. U. C. C. $ 1-201(21), 1 U. L. A. 65 (1989) (defining honor);$ 4-215(a), 2B U. L. A. 45 (1991). At that time, the bank hada right to "charge" the debtor's account, $ 4-401, 2B U. L. A.307 (1991)--i. e., the debtor's claim against the bank was re-duced by the amount of the check--and petitioner no longer7 Admittedly, such behavior might create a cause of action for the debtordrawer, see U. C. C. $ 4-402, 2B U. L. A. 59 (1991), but the recipient wouldnot have any claim against the bank.503us2$53H 11-14-95 18:00:23 PAGES OPINPGT400 BARNHILL v. JOHNSONOpinion of the Courthad a claim against the debtor. Honoring the check, inshort, left the debtor in the position that it would have occupied if it had withdrawn cash from its account and handed itover to petitioner. We thus believe that when the debtorhas directed the drawee bank to honor the check and thebank has done so, the debtor has implemented a "mode, direct or indirect . . . of disposing . . . of property or . . . aninterest in property." 11 U. S. C. $ 101(54) (1988 ed., Supp.II) (emphasis added). For the purposes of payment by ordi-nary check, therefore, a "transfer" as defined by $ 101(54)occurs on the date of honor, and not before. And since it isundisputed that honor occurred within the 90-day preferenceperiod, the trustee presumptively may avoid this transfer.In the face of this argument, petitioner retreats to thedefinition of "transfer" contained in $ 101(54). Petitionerurges that rather than viewing the transaction as involvingtwo distinct actions--delivery of the check, with no interestin property thereby being transferred, and honoring of thecheck, with an interest being transferred--that we insteadshould view delivery of the check as a "conditional" transfer.We acknowledge that $ 101(54) adopts an expansive definitionof transfer, one that includes "every mode . . . absolute orconditional . . . of disposing of or parting with property orwith an interest in property." There is thus some force inpetitioner's claim that he did, in fact, gain something whenhe received the check. But at most, what petitioner gainedwas a chose in action against the debtor.8 Such a right, how-ever, cannot fairly be characterized as a conditional right to8 Petitioner asserts that upon the date of delivery, he held a cause ofaction against the debtor. Brief for Petitioner 18. We think that petitioner may overstate matters a bit; it appears under the U. C. C. that receipt of the check provides a contingent cause of action, the contingencybeing a subsequent dishonoring of the check and a demand to the drawerfor payment. See U. C. C. $ 3-122(3), 2 U. L. A. 407 (1991), and OfficialComment || 1. It is unnecessary to resolve this question, however, foreven on petitioner's more expansive assertion his claim under the Bankruptcy Code fails.503us2$53H 11-14-95 18:00:23 PAGES OPINPGT401Cite as: 503 U. S. 393 (1992)Opinion of the Court"property . . . or an interest in property," $ 101(54), wherethe property in this case is the account maintained with thedrawee bank. For as noted above, until the moment ofhonor the debtor retains full control over disposition of theaccount and the account remains subject to a variety of actions by third parties. To treat petitioner's nebulous rightto bring suit as a "conditional transfer" of the propertywould accomplish a near-limitless expansion of the term"conditional." In the absence of any right against the bankor the account, we think the fairer description is that peti-tioner had received no interest in debtor's property, not thathis interest was "conditional."Finally, we note that our conclusion that no transfer ofproperty occurs until the time of honor is consistent with$ 547(e)(2)(A). That section provides that a transfer occursat the time the transfer "takes effect between the transferorand the transferee . . . ." For the reasons given above, andin particular because the debtor in this case retained theability to stop payment on the check until the very last, wedo not think that the transfer of funds in this case can besaid to have "taken effect between the debtor and petitioner" until the moment of honor.Recognizing, perhaps, the difficulties in his position, petitioner places his heaviest reliance not on the statutory language but on accompanying legislative history. Specifically,he points to identical statements from Representative Edwards and Senator DeConcini that "payment of a debt bymeans of a check is equivalent to a cash payment, unless thecheck is dishonored. Payment is considered to be madewhen the check is delivered for purposes of sections 547(c)(1)and (2)." 124 Cong. Rec. 32400 (1978); id., at 34000. Wethink this appeal to legislative history unavailing.To begin, we note that appeals to statutory history arewell taken only to resolve "statutory ambiguity." Toibb v.Radloff, 501 U. S. 157, 162 (1991). We do not think this issuch a case. But even if it were, the statements on which503us2$53H 11-14-95 18:00:23 PAGES OPINPGT402 BARNHILL v. JOHNSONOpinion of the Courtpetitioner relies, by their own terms, apply only to $ 547(c),not to $ 547(b). Section 547(c), in turn, establishes variousexceptions to $ 547(b)'s general rule permitting recovery ofpreferential transfers. Subsection (c)(1) provides an exception for transfers that are part of a contemporaneous ex-change of new value between a debtor and creditor; subsection (c)(2) provides an exception for transfers made fromdebtor to creditor in the ordinary course of business. Thesesections are designed to encourage creditors to continue todeal with troubled debtors on normal business terms by obviating any worry that a subsequent bankruptcy filing mightrequire the creditor to disgorge as a preference an earlierreceived payment. But given this specialized purpose, wesee no basis for concluding that the legislative history, particularly legislative history explicitly confined by its own termsto $ 547(c), should cause us to adopt a "date of delivery" rulefor purposes of $ 547(b).99 Those Courts of Appeals to have considered the issue are unanimousin concluding that a "date of delivery" rule should apply to check paymentsfor purposes of $ 547(c). Braniff Airways, Inc. v. Midwest Corp., 873 F. 2d805 (CA5 1989); In re Continental Commodities, Inc., 841 F. 2d 527 (CA41988); In re Wolf & Vine, 825 F. 2d 197 (CA9 1987); In re Kenitra, Inc.,797 F. 2d 790 (CA9 1986); In re White River Corp., 799 F. 2d 631 (CA101986); and O'Neill v. Nestle Libbys P. R., Inc., 729 F. 2d 35 (CA1 1984). Afew Bankruptcy Courts and District Courts have disagreed. See, e. g., Inre Hartwig Poultry, Inc., 56 B. R. 332 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ohio 1985). We,of course, express no views on that issue, which is not properly before us.We do note, however, that $ 547(c)(2) has undergone significant changesince the time of Representative Edwards' and Senator DeConcini's comments. Section 547(c)(2) previously had a requirement that, in order fora payment by the debtor to qualify as a payment in the ordinary courseof business, the payment had to have been made within 45 days of whenthe underlying debt was first incurred. That requirement has since beeneliminated. See Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 156-157 (1991).This in turn may mean that, in the context of a check payment, there isnow less need to precisely date the time when a check transfer occurs forpurposes of $ 547(c)(2). That is, rather than inquiring whether a transferoccurred on the 45th day or the 46th, courts now need only focus onwhether the transfer was made in the ordinary course of business.
