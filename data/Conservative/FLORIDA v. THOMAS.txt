In New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981), we establisheda "bright-line" rule permitting a law enforcement officer whohas made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of a carto search the passenger compartment of that car as a contemporaneous incident of the arrest. We granted certiorarito consider whether that rule is limited to situations in whichthe officer initiates contact with the occupant of a vehiclewhile that person remains inside the vehicle. 531 U. S. 1069(2001). We find, however, that we lack jurisdiction to decidethe question.On the evening at issue, officers were present at a homein Polk County, Florida, investigating the sale of marijuanaand making arrests. Respondent Robert Thomas drove upto the residence, parked in the driveway, and walked towardthe back of his vehicle. Officer J. D. Maney met Thomasat the rear of Thomas' vehicle, and asked him his nameand whether he had a driver's license. After a check ofThomas' license revealed an outstanding warrant for hisarrest, Officer Maney arrested him, handcuffed him, and tookhim inside the residence. The officer then went back outside, alone, and searched Thomas' car. The search revealedseveral small bags containing a white substance that testedpositive for methamphetamine.Respondent was charged with possession of methamphetamine and related narcotics offenses. The trial courtgranted his motion to suppress the evidence of narcoticsand narcotic paraphernalia. The Second District Court ofAppeal reversed, 711 So. 2d 1241 (1998), finding the searchvalid under New York v. Belton, supra. The Supreme Courtof Florida in turn reversed, holding thatBelton did not apply.The court held that "Belton's bright-line rule is limitedto situations where the law enforcement officer initiatescontact with the defendant" while the defendant remains inthe car. 761 So. 2d 1010, 1014 (2000). The court concluded532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN777Cite as: 532 U. S. 774 (2001)Opinion of the Courtthat Belton was inapplicable, and directed that the trialcourt determine "whether the factors inChimel [v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969),] justify the search of Thomas'vehicle." 761 So. 2d, at 1014. The court explained that"[b]ased on the record . . . we are unable to ascertain whether[the officer's] safety was endangered or whether the preservation of the evidence was in jeopardy," as necessary tojustify the search under Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752(1969), and remanded for further proceedings.Although the parties did not raise the issue in their briefson the merits, we must first consider whether we have jurisdiction to decide this case. See Duquesne Light Co. v.Barasch, 488 U. S. 299, 306 (1989). Title 28 U. S. C. $ 1257(a)authorizes this Court to review "[f]inal judgments or decreesrendered by the highest court of a State in which a decisioncould be had . . . where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is specially set up or claimed under the Constitution."In a criminal prosecution, finality generally "is defined bya judgment of conviction and the imposition of a sentence."Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U. S. 46, 54 (1989).But we have not, in practice, interpreted the finality rule sostrictly. In certain circumstances, we have "treated statecourt judgments as final for jurisdictional purposes althoughthere were further proceedings to take place in the statecourt." Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S. 619, 620-621 (1981) (percuriam). In Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U. S. 469(1975), we divided cases of this kind into four categories.None fits the judgment of the Florida Supreme Court, however, and we therefore conclude that its judgment is not final.The first Cox category includes those cases in which "thereare further proceedings--even entire trials--yet to occur inthe state courts but where for one reason or another thefederal issue is conclusive or the outcome of further proceedings preordained." Id., at 479. The prototypical exampleof this category is Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 (1966).There the Supreme Court of Alabama held that a statute532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN778 FLORIDA v. THOMASOpinion of the Courtwhich prohibited the publication of an editorial endorse-ment on election day did not violate the First Amendment,and remanded the case for trial. Id., at 216-217. Millsconceded that his only defense to the state charge was hisconstitutional claim; he admitted that he did publish theeditorial. We held that this was a "final judgment" and tookjurisdiction, saying that a trial "would be no more than afew formal gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction,and then another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court forit formally to repeat its rejection of Mills' constitutionalcontentions whereupon the case could then once more windits weary way back to us as a judgment unquestionably finaland appealable. Such a roundabout process would not onlybe an inexcusable delay of the benefits Congress intendedto grant by providing for appeal to this Court, but it wouldalso result in a completely unnecessary waste of time andenergy in judicial systems already troubled by delays dueto congested dockets."Id., at 217-218.The decision of the Supreme Court of Florida here differs considerably from that of the state court in Mills. TheFlorida Supreme Court remanded the case not only for application of Chimel, but for further factfinding, and the Statehas not conceded that the search is invalid underChimel.In Cox's second category are those cases in which "thefederal issue, finally decided by the highest court in theState, will survive and require decision regardless of the outcome of future state-court proceedings." 420 U. S., at 480.InCox we used our decision in Radio Station WOW, Inc.v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120 (1945), to illustrate the secondcategory. We said:"In Radio Station WOW, the Nebraska Supreme Courtdirected the transfer of the properties of a federallylicensed radio station and ordered an accounting, reject-ing the claim that the transfer order would interferewith the federal license. . . . Nothing that could happen532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN779Cite as: 532 U. S. 774 (2001)Opinion of the Courtin the course of the accounting, short of settlement ofthe case, would foreclose or make unnecessary decisionon the federal question." Cox, supra, at 480.In this case, however, were the Florida courts to find thatChimel allows the search, a decision on the Belton issuewould no longer be necessary. We have also noted that wetreat state-court judgments in this category as final on theassumption that " `the federal questions that could come herehave been adjudicated by the State court,' " and the stateproceedings to take place on remand " `could not remotelygive rise to a federal question . . . that may later come here.' "Cox, 420 U. S., at 480. We cannot make that assumption inthis case.Cases where "the federal claim has been finally decided,with further proceedings on the merits in the state courts tocome, but in which later review of the federal issue cannotbe had, whatever the ultimate outcome of the case," fall intoCox's third category. Id., at 481. New York v. Quarles, 467U. S. 649 (1984), is such a case. Respondent was charged instate court with criminal possession of a weapon, and certainevidence was suppressed on federal constitutional grounds.We granted the petition for certiorari and reversed, explaining that the suppression ruling was a "final judgment"although respondent had yet to be tried. Id., at 651. Wesaid that this case fell within Cox's third category because"should the State convict respondent at trial, its claim thatcertain evidence was wrongfully suppressed will be moot.Should respondent be acquitted at trial, the State will beprecluded from pressing its federal claim again on appeal."467 U. S., at 651, and n. 1.To deny review here would not necessarily cause Floridato go to trial without the suppressed evidence, with furtherappeal barred in the event of an acquittal or the federal claimmooted in the event of a conviction. The state court has532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN780 FLORIDA v. THOMASOpinion of the Courtyet to decide whether the evidence should be suppressed;that will be resolved on remand. If the State prevails onremand and the evidence is admitted under Chimel, thentheBelton issue will be moot, and the State cannot seekreview of it. But if the State loses, and the evidence issuppressed, Florida law allows the State to appeal, as longas it does so prior to trial. Fla. Stat. $ 924.071(1) (1996)("The state may appeal from a pretrial order . . . suppressingevidence"); Fla. Rule App. Proc. 9.140(c)(1)(B) (2001) ("Thestate may appeal an order . . . suppressing before trial . . .evidence obtained by search and seizure"). Should the Supreme Court of Florida rule against the State on the Chimelissue, the question of suppression would be finally decidedby the Florida courts, and the State could then seek certiorari in this Court. At that time it could obtain review ofboth the Belton issue and the Chimel issue. See Jeffersonv. City of Tarrant, 522 U. S. 75, 83 (1997).The fourth Cox category includes those cases where "thefederal issue has been finally decided in the state courtswith further proceedings pending in which the party seeking review here might prevail on the merits on nonfederalgrounds, thus rendering unnecessary review of the federalissue by this Court, and where reversal of the state court onthe federal issue would be preclusive of any further litigationon the relevant cause of action rather than merely controllingthe nature and character of, or determining the admissibilityof evidence in, the state proceedings still to come. In thesecircumstances, if a refusal immediately to review the statecourt decision might seriously erode federal policy, the Courthas entertained and decided the federal issue, which itselfhas been finally determined by the state courts for purposesof the state litigation." 420 U. S., at 482-483.Here the State can make no claim of serious erosion offederal policy that is not common to all run-of-the-mine decisions suppressing evidence in criminal trials. The fourthCox exception does not apply here.532US3 Unit: $U63 [09-06-02 19:15:11] PAGES PGT: OPIN781Cite as: 532 U.
