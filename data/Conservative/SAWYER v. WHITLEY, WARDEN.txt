The issue before the Court is the standard for determiningwhether a petitioner bringing a successive, abusive, or defaulted federal habeas claim has shown he is "actually inno-cent" of the death penalty to which he has been sentencedso that the court may reach the merits of the claim.

WHITLEYOpinion of the Courtfederal habeas petition containing successive and abusiveclaims. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refusedto examine the merits of Sawyer's claims. It held that Saw-yer had not shown cause for failure to raise these claims inhis earlier petition, and that he had not shown that he was"actually innocent" of the crime of which he was convictedor the penalty which was imposed. 945 F. 2d 812 (1991).We affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that to show "actualinnocence" one must show by clear and convincing evidencethat, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable juror wouldhave found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty underthe applicable state law.In 1979--13 years ago--petitioner and his accomplice,Charles Lane, brutally murdered Frances Arwood, who wasa guest in the home petitioner shared with his girlfriend,Cynthia Shano, and Shano's two young children. As we recounted in our earlier review of this case, Sawyer v. Smith,497 U. S. 227 (1990), petitioner and Lane returned to petitioner's home after a night of drinking and argued with Ar-wood, accusing her of drugging one of the children. Petitioner and Lane then attacked Arwood, beat her with theirfists, kicked her repeatedly, submerged her in the bathtub,and poured scalding water on her before dragging her backinto the living room, pouring lighter fluid on her body andigniting it. Arwood lost consciousness sometime during theattack and remained in a coma until she died of her injuriesapproximately two months later. Shano and her childrenwere in the home during the attack, and Shano testified thatpetitioner prevented them from leaving.1At trial, the jury failed to credit petitioner's "toxic psychosis" defense, and convicted petitioner of first-degree mur-der. At the sentencing phase, petitioner testified that hewas intoxicated at the time of the murder and remembered1 The facts are more fully recounted in the opinion of the LouisianaSupreme Court affirming petitioner's conviction and sentence.

WHITLEYOpinion of the CourtPetitioner next filed a second motion for state postconvictionrelief. The state trial court summarily denied this petitionas repetitive and without merit, and the Louisiana SupremeCourt denied discretionary review. See 945 F. 2d, at 815.The present petition before this Court arises out of Sawyer's second petition for federal habeas relief. After granting a stay and holding an evidentiary hearing, the DistrictCourt denied one of Sawyer's claims on the merits and heldthat the others were barred as either abusive or successive.772 F. Supp. 297 (ED La. 1991). The Court of Appealsgranted a certificate of probable cause on the issue whetherpetitioner had shown that he is actually "innocent of thedeath penalty" such that a court should reach the merits ofthe claims contained in this successive petition. 945 F. 2d,at 814. The Court of Appeals held that petitioner had failedto show that he was actually innocent of the death penaltybecause the evidence he argued had been unconstitutionallykept from the jury failed to show that Sawyer was ineligiblefor the death penalty under Louisiana law. For the thirdtime we granted Sawyer's petition for certiorari, 502 U. S.965 (1991), and we now affirm.Unless a habeas petitioner shows cause and prejudice, seeWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), a court may notreach the merits of: (a) successive claims that raise groundsidentical to grounds heard and decided on the merits in aprevious petition, Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U. S. 436 (1986);(b) new claims, not previously raised, which constitute anabuse of the writ, McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991);or (c) procedurally defaulted claims in which the petitionerfailed to follow applicable state procedural rules in raisingthe claims, Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986). Thesecases are premised on our concerns for the finality of statejudgments of conviction and the "significant costs of federalhabeas review." McCleskey, supra, at 490-491; see, e. g.,Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 126-128 (1982).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT339Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)Opinion of the CourtWe have previously held that even if a state prisonercannot meet the cause and prejudice standard, a federalcourt may hear the merits of the successive claims if thefailure to hear the claims would constitute a "miscarriage ofjustice." In a trio of 1986 decisions, we elaborated on themiscarriage of justice, or "actual innocence," exception. Aswe explained inKuhlmann v. Wilson, supra, the exceptiondeveloped from the language of the federal habeas statute,which, prior to 1966, allowed successive claims to be deniedwithout a hearing if the judge were "satisfied that the endsof justice will not be served by such inquiry." Id., at 448.We held that despite the removal of this statutory languagefrom 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(b) in 1966, the miscarriage of justiceexception would allow successive claims to be heard if thepetitioner "establish[es] that under the probative evidencehe has a colorable claim of factual innocence."Kuhlmann,supra, at 454.5 In the second of these cases we held thatthe actual innocence exception also applies to procedurallydefaulted claims. Murray v. Carrier, supra.6In Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527 (1986), we found no miscarriage of justice in the failure to examine the merits ofprocedurally defaulted claims in the capital sentencing context. We emphasized that the miscarriage of justice exception is concerned with actual as compared to legal innocence,5 Our standard for determining actual innocence was articulated inKuhlmann as: "[T]he prisoner must `show a fair probability that, in lightof all the evidence, including that alleged to have been illegally admitted(but with due regard to any unreliability of it) and evidence tenablyclaimed to have been wrongly excluded or to have become available onlyafter the trial, the trier of the facts would have entertained a reasonabledoubt of his guilt.' " 477 U. S., at 455, n. 17, quoting Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments, 38 U. Chi.L. Rev. 142, 160 (1970).6 We stated that the merits of a defaulted claim could be reached "in anextraordinary case, where a constitutional violation has probably resultedin the conviction of one who is actually innocent . . . ." Murray v. Carrier,477 U. S., at 496.505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT340 SAWYER v. WHITLEYOpinion of the Courtand acknowledged that actual innocence "does not translateeasily into the context of an alleged error at the sentencingphase of a trial on a capital offense." Id., at 537. We de-cided that the habeas petitioner in that case had failed toshow actual innocence of the death penalty because the "alleged constitutional error neither precluded the developmentof true facts nor resulted in the admission of false ones."Id., at 538.In subsequent cases, we have emphasized the narrowscope of the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception.InDugger v. Adams, 489 U. S. 401 (1989), we rejected thepetitioner's claim that his procedural default should be excused because he had shown that he was actually innocent.Without endeavoring to define what it meant to be actuallyinnocent of the death penalty, we stated that "[d]emonstrating that an error is by its nature the kind of error that mighthave affected the accuracy of a death sentence is far fromdemonstrating that an individual defendant probably is `actually innocent' of the sentence he or she received." Id., at412, n. 6. Just last Term in McCleskey v. Zant, supra, at502, we held that the "narrow exception" for miscarriage ofjustice was of no avail to the petitioner because the constitutional violation, if it occurred, "resulted in the admission attrial of truthful inculpatory evidence which did not affect thereliability of the guilt determination."The present case requires us to further amplify the meaning of "actual innocence" in the setting of capital punishment.A prototypical example of "actual innocence" in a colloquialsense is the case where the State has convicted the wrongperson of the crime. Such claims are of course regularlymade on motions for new trial after conviction in both stateand federal courts, and quite regularly denied because theevidence adduced in support of them fails to meet the rigorous standards for granting such motions. But in rare instances it may turn out later, for example, that anotherperson has credibly confessed to the crime, and it is evident505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT341Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthat the law has made a mistake. In the context of a non-capital case, the concept of "actual innocence" is easy tograsp.It is more difficult to develop an analogous frameworkwhen dealing with a defendant who has been sentenced todeath. The phrase "innocent of death" is not a naturalusage of those words, but we must strive to construct ananalog to the simpler situation represented by the case of anoncapital defendant. In defining this analog, we bear inmind that the exception for "actual innocence" is a very narrow exception, and that to make it workable it must be sub-ject to determination by relatively objective standards. Inthe every day context of capital penalty proceedings, a fed-eral district judge typically will be presented with a successive or abusive habeas petition a few days before, or even onthe day of, a scheduled execution, and will have only a limited time to determine whether a petitioner has shown thathis case falls within the "actual innocence" exception if sucha claim is made.7Since our decision in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238(1972), our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence has requiredthose States imposing capital punishment to adopt procedural safeguards protecting against arbitrary and capriciousimpositions of the death sentence. See, e. g., Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153 (1976); Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242(1976);Jurek v. Texas, 428 U. S. 262 (1976). In response, theStates have adopted various narrowing factors that limit the7 While we recognize this as a fact on the basis of our own experiencewith applications for stays of execution in capital cases, we regard it as aregrettable fact. We of course do not in the least condone, but insteadcondemn, any efforts on the part of habeas petitioners to delay their filingsuntil the last minute with a view to obtaining a stay because the districtcourt will lack time to give them the necessary consideration before thescheduled execution. A court may resolve against such a petitionerdoubts and uncertainties as to the sufficiency of his submission. SeeGomez v. United States Dist. Court for Northern Dist. of Cal., 503 U. S.653 (1992) (per curiam).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT342 SAWYER v. WHITLEYOpinion of the Courtclass of offenders upon which the sentencer is authorized toimpose the death penalty. For example, the Louisiana statute under which petitioner was convicted defines first-degreemurder, a capital offense, as something more than intentionalkilling.8 In addition, after a defendant is found guilty inLouisiana of capital murder, the jury must also find at thesentencing phase beyond a reasonable doubt at least one ofa list of statutory aggravating factors before it may recom-mend that the death penalty be imposed.9But once eligibility for the death penalty has been estab-lished to the satisfaction of the jury, its deliberations assumea different tenor. In a series of cases beginning with Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978), we have held that the8 Louisiana Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 14:30 (West 1986 and Supp. 1992) definesfirst-degree murder:"First degree murder is the killing of a human being:"(1) When the offender has specific intent to kill or to inflict great bodilyharm and is engaged in the perpetration or attempted perpetration ofaggravated kidnapping, second degree kidnapping, aggravated escape,aggravated arson, aggravated rape, forcible rape, aggravated burglary,armed robbery, first degree robbery or simple robbery;"(2) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict greatbodily harm upon a fireman or peace officer engaged in the performanceof his lawful duties;"(3) When the offender has a specific intent to kill or to inflict greatbodily harm upon more than one person; or"(4) When the offender has specific intent to kill or inflict great bodilyharm and has offered, has been offered, has given, or has received anything of value for the killing.. . . . ."Whoever commits the crime of first degree murder shall be punishedby death or life imprisonment at hard labor without benefit of parole, probation, or suspension of sentence in accordance with the determination ofthe jury."9 At the time of petitioner's trial La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 905.3(West 1984), provided: "A sentence of death shall not be imposed unlessthe jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one statutory aggravating circumstance exists and, after consideration of any mitigating circumstances, recommends that the sentence of death be imposed."505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT343Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)Opinion of the Courtdefendant must be permitted to introduce a wide variety ofmitigating evidence pertaining to his character and background. The emphasis shifts from narrowing the class ofeligible defendants by objective factors to individualizedconsideration of a particular defendant. Consideration ofaggravating factors together with mitigating factors, in various combinations and methods dependent upon state law, results in the jury's or judge's ultimate decision as to whatpenalty shall be imposed.Considering Louisiana law as an example, then, there arethree possible ways in which "actual innocence" might bedefined. The strictest definition would be to limit any showing to the elements of the crime which the State has made acapital offense. The showing would have to negate an essential element of that offense. The Solicitor General, filingas amicus curiae in support of respondent, urges the Courtto adopt this standard. We reject this submission as toonarrow, because it is contrary to the statement in Smith thatthe concept of "actual innocence" could be applied to mean"innocent" of the death penalty. 477 U. S., at 537. Thisstatement suggested a more expansive meaning to the termof "actual innocence" in a capital case than simply innocenceof the capital offense itself.The most lenient of the three possibilities would be toallow the showing of "actual innocence" to extend not onlyto the elements of the crime, but also to the existence ofaggravating factors, and to mitigating evidence that bore noton the defendant's eligibility to receive the death penalty,but only on the ultimate discretionary decision between thedeath penalty and life imprisonment. This, in effect, is whatpetitioner urges upon us. He contends that actual innocenceof the death penalty exists where "there is a `fair probability'that the admission of false evidence, or the preclusion of truemitigating evidence, [caused by a constitutional error] resulted in a sentence of death." Brief for Petitioner 18 (cita505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT344 SAWYER v. WHITLEYOpinion of the Courttion and footnote omitted).10 Although petitioner describeshis standard as narrower than that adopted by the Eighthand Ninth Circuits,11 in reality it is only more closely relatedto the facts of his case in which he alleges that constitutionalerror kept true mitigating evidence from the jury. The cru-cial consideration, according to petitioner, is whether due toconstitutional error the sentencer was presented with " `afactually inaccurate sentencing profile' " of the petitioner.Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 21, quoting Johnson v. Singletary,938 F. 2d 1166, 1200 (CA11 1991) (en banc) (Anderson, J.,dissenting).Insofar as petitioner's standard would include not merelythe elements of the crime itself, but the existence of aggravating circumstances, it broadens the extent of the inquirybut not the type of inquiry. Both the elements of the crimeand statutory aggravating circumstances in Louisiana are10 Petitioner's standard derives from language in Smith v. Murray, 477U. S. 527 (1986). Petitioner maintains that Smith holds that if one canshow that the error precludes the development of true mitigating evidence, actual innocence has been shown. Brief for Petitioner 21. By emphasizing that in Smith the fundamental miscarriage of justice exceptionhad not been met because, inter alia, the constitutional error did not leadthe jury to consider any false evidence, we did not hold its converse, thatan error which leads to the consideration of "false" mitigating evidenceamounts to a miscarriage of justice.11 In Deutscher v. Whitley, 946 F. 2d 1443 (1991), the Ninth Circuitphrased its test as follows: "To establish a fundamental miscarriage ofjustice at sentencing, a defendant must establish that constitutional errorsubstantially undermined the accuracy of the capital sentencing determination. This requires a showing that constitutional error infected thesentencing process to such a degree that it is more probable than not that,but for constitutional error, the sentence of death would not have beenimposed." Id., at 1446 (citations omitted).The Eighth Circuit has adopted a similar test: " `In the penalty-phasecontext, this exception will be available if the federal constitutional erroralleged probably resulted in a verdict of death against one whom the jurywould otherwise have sentenced to life imprisonment.' " Stokes v. Armontrout, 893 F. 2d 152, 156 (1989), quoting Smith v. Armontrout, 888 F. 2d530, 545 (1989).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT345Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)Opinion of the Courtused to narrow the class of defendants eligible for the deathpenalty. And proof or disproof of aggravating circumstances, like proof of the elements of the crime, is confinedby the statutory definitions to a relatively obvious class ofrelevant evidence. Sensible meaning is given to the term"innocent of the death penalty" by allowing a showing inaddition to innocence of the capital crime itself a showingthat there was no aggravating circumstance or that someother condition of eligibility had not been met.12But we reject petitioner's submission that the showingshould extend beyond these elements of the capital sentenceto the existence of additional mitigating evidence. In thefirst place, such an extension would mean that "actual inno-cence" amounts to little more than what is already requiredto show "prejudice," a necessary showing for habeas relieffor many constitutional errors. See,e. g., United States v.Bagley, 473 U. S. 667, 682 (1985); Strickland v. Washington,466 U. S. 668, 694 (1984). If federal habeas review of capitalsentences is to be at all rational, petitioner must show some-thing more in order for a court to reach the merits of hisclaims on a successive habeas petition than he would havehad to show to obtain relief on his first habeas petition.13But, more importantly, petitioner's standard would sobroaden the inquiry as to make it anything but a "narrow"exception to the principle of finality that we have previouslydescribed it to be. A federal district judge confronted with12 Louisiana narrows the class of those eligible for the death penalty bylimiting the type of offense for which it may be imposed, and by requiringa finding of at least one aggravating circumstance. See supra, at 342.Statutory provisions for restricting eligibility may, of course, vary fromState to State.13 If a showing of actual innocence were reduced to actual prejudice, itwould allow the evasion of the cause and prejudice standard which wehave held also acts as an "exception" to a defaulted, abusive, or successiveclaim. In practical terms a petitioner would no longer have to showcause, contrary to our prior cases. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 494-495 (1991); Carrier, 477 U. S., at 493.505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT346 SAWYER v. WHITLEYOpinion of the Courta claim of actual innocence may with relative ease determinewhether a submission, for example, that a killing was notintentional, consists of credible, noncumulative, and admissi-ble evidence negating the element of intent. But it is a farmore difficult task to assess how jurors would have reactedto additional showings of mitigating factors, particularly considering the breadth of those factors that a jury under ourdecisions must be allowed to consider.14The Court of Appeals in this case took the middle groundamong these three possibilities for defining "actual innocence" of the death penalty, and adopted this test:"[W]e must require the petitioner to show, based on theevidence proffered plus all record evidence, a fair probability that a rational trier of fact would have entertaineda reasonable doubt as to the existence of those factswhich are prerequisites under state or federal law forthe imposition of the death penalty." 945 F. 2d, at 820(footnotes omitted).14 The "clearly-erroneous" standard suggested by Justice Stevens'opinion concurring in the judgment suffers from this weakness and othersas well. The term "clearly erroneous" derives from Federal Rule of CivilProcedure 52(a), which provides that "findings of fact [in actions triedwithout a jury] shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous." JusticeStevens wrenches the term out of this context--where it applies to written factual findings made by a trial judge--and would apply it to the imposition of the death sentence by a jury or judge. Not only is the latterdetermination different both quantitatively and qualitatively from a finding of fact in a bench trial, but Justice Stevens would not even bringwith the term its established meaning in reviewing factfindings in benchtrials. We held in United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U. S.364, 395 (1948), and reaffirmed in Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U. S.564, 573 (1985), that " `[a] finding is "clearly erroneous" when althoughthere is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidenceis left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.' " But Justice Stevens would apparently equate it with thestandard traditionally used for review of jury verdicts--that no reasonablesentencer could have imposed the death penalty. Post, at 371. Cf.

S. 333 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals standard therefore hones in on theobjective factors or conditions that must be shown to existbefore a defendant is eligible to have the death penalty im-posed. The Eleventh Circuit has adopted a similar "eligibility" test for determining actual innocence. Johnson v. Singletary, 938 F. 2d 1166 (1991), cert. pending, No. 91-6576.15We agree with the Courts of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits that the "actual innocence" requirement mustfocus on those elements that render a defendant eligible forthe death penalty, and not on additional mitigating evidencethat was prevented from being introduced as a result of aclaimed constitutional error.In the present petition, Sawyer advances two claims, arising from two distinct groups of evidentiary facts that werenot considered by the jury that convicted and sentencedSawyer. The first group of evidence relates to petitioner'srole in the offense and consists of affidavits attacking thecredibility of Cynthia Shano and an affidavit claiming thatone of Shano's sons told a police officer that Sawyer was notresponsible for pouring lighter fluid on Arwood and lightingit, and that in fact Sawyer tried to prevent Charles Lanefrom lighting Arwood on fire. Sawyer claims that the policefailed to produce this exculpatory evidence in violation of hisdue process rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83(1963). The second group consists of medical records fromSawyer's stays as a teenager in two different mental health15 The Eleventh Circuit articulated the following test:"Thus, a petitioner may make a colorable showing that he is actually innocent of the death penalty by presenting evidence that an alleged constitutional error implicates all of the aggravating factors found to be presentby the sentencing body. That is, but for the alleged constitutional error,the sentencing body could not have found any aggravating factors andthus the petitioner was ineligible for the death penalty. In other words,the petitioner must show that absent the alleged constitutional error, thejury would have lacked the discretion to impose the death penalty; that is,that he is ineligible for the death penalty." Johnson v. Singletary, 938F. 2d, at 1183 (emphasis in original).505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT348 SAWYER v. WHITLEYOpinion of the Courtinstitutions. Sawyer alleges ineffective assistance of counsel in trial counsel's failure to introduce these records in thesentencing phase of his trial.The Court of Appeals held that petitioner's failure to assert his Brady claim in his first petition constituted an abuseof the writ, and that he had not shown cause for failing toraise the claim earlier under McCleskey. 945 F. 2d, at 824.The ineffective-assistance claim was held by the Court of Appeals to be a successive claim because it was rejected on themerits in Sawyer's first petition, and petitioner failed toshow cause for not bringing all the evidence in support ofthis claim earlier. Id., at 823. Petitioner does not contestthese findings of the Court of Appeals. Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.Therefore, we must determine if petitioner has shown byclear and convincing evidence that but for constitutionalerror, no reasonable juror would find him eligible for thedeath penalty under Louisiana law.Under Louisiana law, petitioner is eligible for the deathpenalty because he was convicted of first-degree murder--that is, an intentional killing while in the process of committing an aggravated arson--and because at the sentencingphase the jury found two valid aggravating circumstances:that the murder was committed in the course of an aggravated arson, and that the murder was especially cruel, atrocious, and heinous. The psychological evidence petitioneralleges was kept from the jury due to the ineffective assistance of counsel does not relate to petitioner's guilt or innocence of the crime.16 Neither does it relate to either of theaggravating factors found by the jury that made petitionereligible for the death penalty. Even if this evidence hadbeen before the jury, it cannot be said that a reasonable jurorwould not have found both of the aggravating factors that16 Petitioner does not allege that his mental condition was such that hecould not form criminal intent under Louisiana law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 10.505US2104I 07-09-96 15:22:16 PAGES OPINPGT349Cite as: 505 U. S. 333 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmake petitioner eligible for the death penalty.17 Therefore,as to this evidence, petitioner has not shown that therewould be a fundamental miscarriage of justice for the Courtto fail to reexamine the merits of this successive claim.We are convinced that the evidence allegedly kept fromthe jury due to an allegedBrady violation also fails to showthat the petitioner is actually innocent of the death penaltyto which he has been sentenced. Much of the evidence goesto the credibility of Shano, suggesting, e. g., that contrary toher testimony at trial she knew Charles Lane prior to theday of the murder; that she was drinking the day before themurder; and that she testified under a grant of immunityfrom the prosecutor. 2 App. 589-608. This sort of latterday evidence brought forward to impeach a prosecution wit-ness will seldom, if ever, make a clear and convincing showing that no reasonable juror would have believed the heartof Shano's account of petitioner's actions.The final bit of evidence petitioner alleges was unconstitu-tionally kept from the jury due to aBrady violation was astatement made by Shano's then 4-year-old son, Wayne, to apolice officer the day after the murder. Petitioner has sub-mitted an affidavit from one Diane Thibodeaux stating thatshe was present when Wayne told a police detective whoasked who had lit Arwood on fire that "Daddy [Sawyer] triedto help the lady" and that the "other man" had pushed Saw-yer back into a chair. 2 App. 587. The affidavit also statesthat Wayne showed the officer where to find a cigarettelighter and a can of lighter fluid in the trash. Ibid. Because this evidence goes to the jury's finding of aggravatedarson, it goes both to petitioner's guilt or innocence of thecrime of first-degree murder and the aggravating circum-stance of a murder committed in the course of an aggravatedarson.
