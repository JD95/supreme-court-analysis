Twoof the officers caught up with him, stopped him, and conducted a protective patdown search for weapons. Discovering a .38-caliber handgun, the officers arrested Wardlow.We hold that the officers' stop did not violate the FourthAmendment to the United States Constitution.On September 9, 1995, Officers Nolan and Harvey wereworking as uniformed officers in the special operations section of the Chicago Police Department. The officers weredriving the last car of a four-car caravan converging on anarea known for heavy narcotics trafficking in order to investigate drug transactions. The officers were traveling together because they expected to find a crowd of people inthe area, including lookouts and customers.As the caravan passed 4035 West Van Buren, Officer Nolanobserved respondent Wardlow standing next to the buildingAlan G.

Respondent looked in the directionof the officers and fled. Nolan and Harvey turned their carsouthbound, watched him as he ran through the gangwayand an alley, and eventually cornered him on the street.Nolan then exited his car and stopped respondent. He immediately conducted a protective patdown search for weapons because in his experience it was common for there to beweapons in the near vicinity of narcotics transactions. During the frisk, Officer Nolan squeezed the bag respondent wascarrying and felt a heavy, hard object similar to the shape ofa gun. The officer then opened the bag and discovered a.38-caliber handgun with five live rounds of ammunition.The officers arrested Wardlow.The Illinois trial court denied respondent's motion to suppress, finding the gun was recovered during a lawful stopand frisk. App. 14. Following a stipulated bench trial,Wardlow was convicted of unlawful use of a weapon by afelon. The Illinois Appellate Court reversed Wardlow's conviction, concluding that the gun should have been suppressedbecause Officer Nolan did not have reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify an investigative stop pursuant to Terry v.Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968). 287 Ill. App. 3d 367, 678 N. E. 2d65 (1997).The Illinois Supreme Court agreed. 183 Ill. 2d 306, 701N. E. 2d 484 (1998). While rejecting the Appellate Court'sconclusion that Wardlow was not in a high crime area, theIllinois Supreme Court determined that sudden flight in suchan area does not create a reasonable suspicion justifying aTerry stop. 183 Ill. 2d, at 310, 701 N. E. 2d, at 486. Relyingon Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491 (1983), the court explainedthat although police have the right to approach individualsand ask questions, the individual has no obligation to respond. The person may decline to answer and simply go onhis or her way, and the refusal to respond, alone, does notprovide a legitimate basis for an investigative stop. 183 Ill.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN123Cite as: 528 U. S. 119 (2000)Opinion of the Court2d, at 311-312, 701 N. E. 2d, at 486-487. The court thendetermined that flight may simply be an exercise of thisright to "go on one's way," and, thus, could not constitutereasonable suspicion justifying a Terry stop. 183 Ill. 2d, at312, 701 N. E. 2d, at 487.The Illinois Supreme Court also rejected the argumentthat flight combined with the fact that it occurred in a highcrime area supported a finding of reasonable suspicion because the "high crime area" factor was not sufficient standing alone to justify a Terry stop. Finding no independentlysuspicious circumstances to support an investigatory detention, the court held that the stop and subsequent arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. We granted certiorari, 526U. S. 1097 (1999), and now reverse.1This case, involving a brief encounter between a citizenand a police officer on a public street, is governed by theanalysis we first applied in Terry. In Terry, we held thatan officer may, consistent with the Fourth Amendment, conduct a brief, investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.392 U. S., at 30. While "reasonable suspicion" is a less demanding standard than probable cause and requires a showing considerably less than preponderance of the evidence,the Fourth Amendment requires at least a minimal level ofobjective justification for making the stop. United Statesv. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7 (1989). The officer must be able1 The state courts have differed on whether unprovoked flight is sufficient grounds to constitute reasonable suspicion. See, e. g., State v. Anderson, 155 Wis. 2d 77, 454 N. W. 2d 763 (1990) (flight alone is sufficient);Platt v. State, 589 N. E. 2d 222 (Ind. 1992) (same); Harris v. State, 205 Ga.App. 813, 423 S. E. 2d 723 (1992) (flight in high crime area sufficient); Statev. Hicks, 241 Neb. 357, 488 N. W. 2d 359 (1992) (flight is not enough); Statev. Tucker, 136 N.

WARDLOWOpinion of the Courtto articulate more than an "inchoate and unparticularizedsuspicion or `hunch' " of criminal activity. Terry, supra,at 27.2Nolan and Harvey were among eight officers in a four-carcaravan that was converging on an area known for heavynarcotics trafficking, and the officers anticipated encountering a large number of people in the area, including drug cus-tomers and individuals serving as lookouts. App. 8. It wasin this context that Officer Nolan decided to investigateWardlow after observing him flee. An individual's presencein an area of expected criminal activity, standing alone, isnot enough to support a reasonable, particularized suspicionthat the person is committing a crime. Brown v. Texas, 443U. S. 47 (1979). But officers are not required to ignore therelevant characteristics of a location in determining whetherthe circumstances are sufficiently suspicious to warrant further investigation. Accordingly, we have previously notedthe fact that the stop occurred in a "high crime area" amongthe relevant contextual considerations in a Terry analysis.Adams v. Williams, 407 U. S. 143, 144, 147-148 (1972).In this case, moreover, it was not merely respondent'spresence in an area of heavy narcotics trafficking thataroused the officers' suspicion, but his unprovoked flight uponnoticing the police. Our cases have also recognized that nervous, evasive behavior is a pertinent factor in determiningreasonable suspicion. United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422U. S. 873, 885 (1975); Florida v. Rodriguez, 469 U. S. 1, 6(1984) (per curiam); United States v. Sokolow, supra, at 8-9.Headlong flight--wherever it occurs--is the consummate actof evasion: It is not necessarily indicative of wrongdoing, butit is certainly suggestive of such. In reviewing the propri-ety of an officer's conduct, courts do not have available empirical studies dealing with inferences drawn from suspicious2 We granted certiorari solely on the question whether the initial stopwas supported by reasonable suspicion. Therefore, we express no opinionas to the lawfulness of the frisk independently of the stop.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN125Cite as: 528 U. S. 119 (2000)Opinion of the Courtbehavior, and we cannot reasonably demand scientific cer-tainty from judges or law enforcement officers where noneexists. Thus, the determination of reasonable suspicionmust be based on commonsense judgments and inferencesabout human behavior. See United States v. Cortez, 449U. S. 411, 418 (1981). We conclude Officer Nolan was justified in suspecting that Wardlow was involved in criminalactivity, and, therefore, in investigating further.Such a holding is entirely consistent with our decision inFlorida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491 (1983), where we held thatwhen an officer, without reasonable suspicion or probablecause, approaches an individual, the individual has a right toignore the police and go about his business. Id., at 498.And any "refusal to cooperate, without more, does not furnish the minimal level of objective justification needed for adetention or seizure." Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 437(1991). But unprovoked flight is simply not a mere refusalto cooperate. Flight, by its very nature, is not "going aboutone's business"; in fact, it is just the opposite. Allowing officers confronted with such flight to stop the fugitive andinvestigate further is quite consistent with the individual'sright to go about his business or to stay put and remainsilent in the face of police questioning.Respondent and amici also argue that there are innocentreasons for flight from police and that, therefore, flight is notnecessarily indicative of ongoing criminal activity. This factis undoubtedly true, but does not establish a violation of theFourth Amendment. Even in Terry, the conduct justifyingthe stop was ambiguous and susceptible of an innocent explanation. The officer observed two individuals pacing backand forth in front of a store, peering into the window andperiodically conferring. 392 U. S., at 5-6. All of this conduct was by itself lawful, but it also suggested that the individuals were casing the store for a planned robbery. Terryrecognized that the officers could detain the individuals toresolve the ambiguity. Id., at 30.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN126 ILLINOIS v. WARDLOWOpinion of Stevens, J.In allowing such detentions, Terry accepts the risk thatofficers may stop innocent people. Indeed, the FourthAmendment accepts that risk in connection with more dras-tic police action; persons arrested and detained on probablecause to believe they have committed a crime may turn outto be innocent. TheTerry stop is a far more minimal intrusion, simply allowing the officer to briefly investigate further. If the officer does not learn facts rising to the level ofprobable cause, the individual must be allowed to go on hisway. But in this case the officers found respondent in pos-session of a handgun, and arrested him for violation of anIllinois firearms statute. No question of the propriety of thearrest itself is before us.The judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois is reversed,and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, JusticeGinsburg, and Justice Breyer join, concurring in part anddissenting in part.The State of Illinois asks this Court to announce a"bright-line rule" authorizing the temporary detention ofanyone who flees at the mere sight of a police officer. Brieffor Petitioner 7-36. Respondent counters by asking us toadopt the oppositeper se rule--that the fact that a personflees upon seeing the police can never, by itself, be sufficientto justify a temporary investigative stop of the kind authorized by Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968). Brief for Respond-ent 6-31.The Court today wisely endorses neither per se rule. In-stead, it rejects the proposition that "flight is . . . necessarilyindicative of ongoing criminal activity," ante, at 125, adher-ing to the view that "[t]he concept of reasonable suspicion. . . is not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat setof legal rules," but must be determined by looking to "the528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN127Cite as: 528 U. S. 119 (2000)Opinion of Stevens, J.totality of the circumstances--the whole picture," UnitedStates v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7-8 (1989) (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted). Abiding by this framework,the Court concludes that "Officer Nolan was justified in suspecting that Wardlow was involved in criminal activity."Ante, at 125.Although I agree with the Court's rejection of the per serules proffered by the parties, unlike the Court, I am persuaded that in this case the brief testimony of the officer whoseized respondent does not justify the conclusion that he hadreasonable suspicion to make the stop. Before discussingthe specific facts of this case, I shall comment on the parties'requests for a per se rule. IIn Terry v. Ohio, we first recognized "that a police officermay in appropriate circumstances and in an appropriatemanner approach a person for purposes of investigating pos-sibly criminal behavior even though there is no probablecause to make an arrest," 392 U. S., at 22, an authority per-mitting the officer to "stop and briefly detain a person forinvestigative purposes," Sokolow, 490 U. S., at 7. We ap-proved as well "a reasonable search for weapons for the protection of the police officer, where he has reason to believethat he is dealing with an armed and dangerous individual,regardless of whether he has probable cause to arrest theindividual for a crime." Terry, 392 U. S., at 27. Cognizantthat such police intrusion had never before received constitu-tional imprimatur on less than probable cause, id., at 11-12,20, we reflected upon the magnitude of the departure wewere endorsing. "Even a limited search," we said, "constitutes a severe, though brief, intrusion upon cherished per-sonal security, and it must be an annoying, frightening, andperhaps humiliating experience." Id., at 24-25.11 We added that a Terry frisk "is a serious intrusion upon the sanctityof the person, which may inflict great indignity and arouse strong resentment, and is not to be undertaken lightly." 392 U. S., at 17. The resent528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN128 ILLINOIS v. WARDLOWOpinion of Stevens, J.Accordingly, we recognized only a "narrowly drawn au-thority" that is "limited to that which is necessary for thediscovery of weapons." Id., at 27, 26. An officer conduct-ing an investigatory stop, we further explained, must articulate "a particularized and objective basis for suspecting theparticular person stopped of criminal activity." UnitedStates v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 417-418 (1981). That deter-mination, we admonished, "becomes meaningful only when itis assured that at some point the conduct of those chargedwith enforcing the laws can be subjected to the more detached, neutral scrutiny of a judge who must evaluate thereasonableness of a particular search or seizure in light ofthe particular circumstances." Terry, 392 U. S., at 21. Inundertaking that neutral scrutiny "based on all of the circumstances," a court relies on "certain commonsense conclu-sions about human behavior."Cortez, 449 U. S., at 418; seealso ante, at 125. "[T]he relevant inquiry" concerning theinferences and conclusions a court draws "is not whetherparticular conduct is `innocent' or `guilty,' but the degree ofsuspicion that attaches to particular types of noncriminalacts."Sokolow, 490 U. S., at 10.The question in this case concerns "the degree of suspicionthat attaches to" a person's flight--or, more precisely, what"commonsense conclusions" can be drawn respecting the motives behind that flight. A pedestrian may break into a runfor a variety of reasons--to catch up with a friend a block ortwo away, to seek shelter from an impending storm, to arriveat a bus stop before the bus leaves, to get home in time forment engendered by that intrusion is aggravated, not mitigated, if theofficer's entire justification for the stop is the belief that the individual issimply trying to avoid contact with the police or move from one place toanother--as he or she has a right to do (and do rapidly). See Chicago v.Morales, 527 U. S. 41, 53 (1999) (plurality opinion) ("We have expresslyidentified this `right to remove from one place to another according toinclination' as `an attribute of personal liberty' protected by the Constitution" (citation omitted)); Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, 437 (1991); Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 497-498 (1983) (plurality opinion); Terry, 392U. S., at 32-33 (Harlan, J., concurring); see also ante, at 125.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN129Cite as: 528 U. S. 119 (2000)Opinion of Stevens, J.dinner, to resume jogging after a pause for rest, to avoidcontact with a bore or a bully, or simply to answer the callof nature--any of which might coincide with the arrival ofan officer in the vicinity. A pedestrian might also run because he or she has just sighted one or more police officers.In the latter instance, the State properly points out "thatthe fleeing person may be, inter alia, (1) an escapee fromjail; (2) wanted on a warrant; (3) in possession of contraband,(i. e. drugs, weapons, stolen goods, etc.); or (4) someone whohas just committed another type of crime." Brief for Petitioner 9, n. 4.2 In short, there are unquestionably circum-stances in which a person's flight is suspicious, and undeniably instances in which a person runs for entirely innocentreasons.3Given the diversity and frequency of possible motivationsfor flight, it would be profoundly unwise to endorse eitherper se rule. The inference we can reasonably draw aboutthe motivation for a person's flight, rather, will depend on anumber of different circumstances. Factors such as thetime of day, the number of people in the area, the characterof the neighborhood, whether the officer was in uniform, theway the runner was dressed, the direction and speed of the2 If the fleeing person exercises his or her right to remain silent afterbeing stopped, only in the third of the State's four hypothetical categoriesis the stop likely to lead to probable cause to make an arrest. And evenin the third category, flight does not necessarily indicate that the officer is"dealing with an armed and dangerous individual." Terry v. Ohio, 392U. S. 1, 27 (1968).3 Compare, e. g., Proverbs 28:1 ("The wicked flee when no man pursueth:but the righteous are as bold as a lion") with Proverbs 22:3 ("A shrewdman sees trouble coming and lies low; the simple walk into it and paythe penalty").I have rejected reliance on the former proverb in the past, becauseits "ivory-towered analysis of the real world" fails to account for the experiences of many citizens of this country, particularly those who areminorities. See California v. Hodari D., 499 U. S. 621, 630, n. 4 (1991)(Stevens, J., dissenting). That this pithy expression fails to capture thetotal reality of our world, however, does not mean it is inaccurate in allinstances.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN130 ILLINOIS v. WARDLOWOpinion of Stevens, J.flight, and whether the person's behavior was otherwise un-usual might be relevant in specific cases. This number ofvariables is surely sufficient to preclude either a bright-linerule that always justifies, or that never justifies, an investigative stop based on the sole fact that flight began after apolice officer appeared nearby.4Still, Illinois presses for a per se rule regarding "unpro-voked flight upon seeing a clearly identifiable police officer."Id., at 7. The phrase "upon seeing," as used by Illinois, ap-parently assumes that the flight is motivated by the presenceof the police officer.5 Illinois contends that unprovokedflight is "an extreme reaction,"id., at 8, because innocentpeople simply do not "flee at the mere sight of the police,"id., at 24. To be sure, Illinois concedes, an innocent per-son--even one distrustful of the police--might "avoid eyecontact or even sneer at the sight of an officer," and that4 Of course, Terry itself recognized that sometimes behavior giving riseto reasonable suspicion is entirely innocent, but it accepted the risk thatofficers may stop innocent people. 392 U. S., at 30. And as the Courtcorrectly observes, it is "undoubtedly true" that innocent explanations forflight exist, but they do not "establish a violation of the Fourth Amendment." Ante, at 125. It is equally true, however, that the innocent explanations make the single act of flight sufficiently ambiguous to precludethe adoption of a per se rule.In Terry, furthermore, reasonable suspicion was supported by a concatenation of acts, each innocent when viewed in isolation, that when considered collectively amounted to extremely suspicious behavior. See 392U. S., at 5-7, 22-23. Flight alone, however, is not at all like a "series ofacts, each of them perhaps innocent in itself, but which taken togetherwarran[t] further investigation." Id., at 22. Nor is flight similar to evidence which in the aggregate provides "fact on fact and clue on clue afford[ing] a basis for the deductions and inferences," supporting reasonablesuspicion. United States v. Cortez, 449 U. S. 411, 419 (1981).5 Nowhere in Illinois' briefs does it specify what it means by "unprovoked." At oral argument, Illinois explained that if officers precipitate aflight by threats of violence, that flight is "provoked." But if police officers in a patrol car--with lights flashing and siren sounding--descendupon an individual for the sole purpose of seeing if he or she will run, theensuing flight is "unprovoked." Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18, 20.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN131Cite as: 528 U. S. 119 (2000)Opinion of Stevens, J.would not justify a Terry stop or any sort of per se inference.Id., at 8-9. But, Illinois insists, unprovoked flight is altogether different. Such behavior is so "aberrant" and "ab-normal" that a per se inference is justified. Id., at 8-9, andn. 4.Even assuming we know that a person runs because hesees the police, the inference to be drawn may still vary fromcase to case. Flight to escape police detection, we have said,may have an entirely innocent motivation:"[I]t is a matter of common knowledge that men who areentirely innocent do sometimes fly from the scene of acrime through fear of being apprehended as the guiltyparties, or from an unwillingness to appear as witnesses.Nor is it true as an accepted axiom of criminal law that`the wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.' Innocent men sometimeshesitate to confront a jury--not necessarily becausethey fear that the jury will not protect them, but be-cause they do not wish their names to appear in connection with criminal acts, are humiliated at being obligedto incur the popular odium of an arrest and trial, or because they do not wish to be put to the annoyance orexpense of defending themselves."Alberty v. UnitedStates, 162 U. S. 499, 511 (1896).In addition to these concerns, a reasonable person may con-clude that an officer's sudden appearance indicates nearbycriminal activity. And where there is criminal activitythere is also a substantial element of danger--either fromthe criminal or from a confrontation between the criminaland the police. These considerations can lead to an innocent and understandable desire to quit the vicinity with allspeed.66 Statistical studies of bystander victimization are rare. One study attributes this to incomplete recordkeeping and a lack of officially compileddata. See Sherman, Steele, Laufersweiler, Hooper, & Julian, Stray Bul528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN132 ILLINOIS v. WARDLOWOpinion of Stevens, J.Among some citizens, particularly minorities and those residing in high crime areas, there is also the possibility thatthe fleeing person is entirely innocent, but, with or withoutjustification, believes that contact with the police can itselfbe dangerous, apart from any criminal activity associatedwith the officer's sudden presence.7 For such a person,lets and "Mushrooms": Random Shootings of Bystanders in Four Cities,1977-1988, 5 J. of Quantitative Criminology 297, 303 (1989). Nonetheless,that study, culling data from newspaper reports in four large cities overan 11-year period, found "substantial increases in reported bystanderkillings and woundings in all four cities." Id., at 306. From 1986 to 1988,for example, the study identified 250 people who were killed or woundedin bystander shootings in the four survey cities. Id., at 306-311. Mostsignificantly for the purposes of the present case, the study found thatsuch incidents "rank at the top of public outrage." Id., at 299.

A2, col. 1 ("Black leaders complained that innocent people were pickedup in the drug sweeps . . . . Some teen-agers were so scared of the taskforce they ran even if they weren't selling drugs").Many stops never lead to an arrest, which further exacerbates the perceptions of discrimination felt by racial minorities and people living inhigh crime areas.

TimesMagazine, June 20, 1999, p. 85 (reporting that in 2-year period, New YorkCity Police Department Street Crimes Unit made 45,000 stops, only 9,500,or 20%, of which resulted in arrest); Casimir, supra n. 7 (reporting thatin 1997, New York City's Street Crimes Unit conducted 27,061 stop-andfrisks, only 4,647 of which, 17%, resulted in arrest).

Recently, the United States Department of Justice,citing this very evidence, announced that it would appoint an outside monitor to oversee the actions of the New Jersey State Police and ensure thatit enacts policy changes advocated by the Interim Report, and keeps records on racial statistics and traffic stops. See Kocieniewski, U. S. WillMonitor New Jersey Police on Race Profiling, N. Y. Times, Dec. 23, 1999,p. A1, col. 6.Likewise, the Massachusetts Attorney General investigated similar allegations of egregious police conduct toward minorities. The report stated:"We conclude that Boston police officers engaged in improper, and unconstitutional, conduct in the 1989-90 period with respect to stops andsearches of minority individuals . . . . Although we cannot say with precision how widespread this illegal conduct was, we believe that it was sufficiently common to justify changes in certain Department practices."Perhaps the most disturbing evidence was that the scope of a numberof Terry searches went far beyond anything authorized by that case andindeed, beyond anything that we believe would be acceptable under thefederal and state constitutions even where probable cause existed to conduct a full search incident to an arrest. Forcing young men to lower theirtrousers, or otherwise searching inside their underwear, on public streetsor in public hallways, is so demeaning and invasive of fundamental precepts of privacy that it can only be condemned in the strongest terms.The fact that not only the young men themselves, but independent witnesses complained of strip searches, should be deeply alarming to all members of this community." J. Shannon, Attorney General of Massachusetts,Report of the Attorney General's Civil Rights Division on Boston PoliceDepartment Practices 60-61 (Dec. 18, 1990).11 Taking into account these and other innocent motivations for unprovoked flight leads me to reject Illinois' requested per se rule in favor ofadhering to a totality-of-the-circumstances test. This conclusion does not,as Illinois suggests, "establish a separate Terry analysis based on the individual characteristics of the person seized." Reply Brief for Petitioner14. My rejection of a per se rule, of course, applies to members of allraces.It is true, as Illinois points out, that Terry approved of the stop andfrisk procedure notwithstanding "[t]he wholesale harassment by certain528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN135Cite as: 528 U.

Sometimes those inferences are entirely consistentwith the presumption of innocence, sometimes they justifyfurther investigation, and sometimes they justify an immediate stop and search for weapons. These considerations haveled us to avoid categorical rules concerning a person's flightand the presumptions to be drawn therefrom:"Few things . . . distinguish an enlightened system ofjudicature from a rude and barbarous one more than themanner in which they deal with evidence. The formerweighs testimony, whilst the latter, conscious perhaps ofits inability to do so or careless of the consequences oferror, at times rejects whole portions en masse, and atothers converts pieces of evidence into rules of law byinvesting with conclusive effect some whose probativeforce has been found to be in general considerable. . . .Our ancestors, observing that guilty persons usually fledfrom justice, adopted the hasty conclusion that it wasonly the guilty who did so . . . so that under the old law,a man who fled to avoid being tried for felony forfeitedelements of the police community, of which minority groups, particularlyNegroes, frequently complain." 392 U. S., at 14. But in this passage,Terry simply held that such concerns would not preclude the use of thestop and frisk procedure altogether. See id., at 17, n. 14. Nowhere didTerry suggest that such concerns cannot inform a court's assessment ofwhether reasonable suspicion sufficient to justify a particular stop existed.12 As a general matter, local courts often have a keener and more informed sense of local police practices and events that may heighten theseconcerns at particular times or locations. Thus, a reviewing court mayaccord substantial deference to a local court's determination that fear ofthe police is especially acute in a specific location or at a particular time.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN136 ILLINOIS v.

Inmodern times more correct views have prevailed, andthe evasion of or flight from justice seems now nearlyreduced to its true place in the administration of thecriminal law, namely, that of a circumstance--a factwhich it is always of importance to take into consideration, and combined with others may afford strong evi-dence of guilt, but which, like any other piece of presumptive evidence, it is equally absurd and dangerousto invest with infallibility."Hickory v. United States,160 U. S. 408, 419-420 (1896) (internal quotation marksomitted)."Unprovoked flight," in short, describes a category of ac-tivity too broad and varied to permit aper se reasonableinference regarding the motivation for the activity. Whilethe innocent explanations surely do not establish that theFourth Amendment is always violated whenever someone isstopped solely on the basis of an unprovoked flight, neitherdo the suspicious motivations establish that the FourthAmendment is never violated when a Terry stop is predi-cated on that fact alone. For these reasons, the Court issurely correct in refusing to embrace either per se rule advo-cated by the parties. The totality of the circumstances, asalways, must dictate the result.1313 Illinois' reliance on the common law as a conclusive answer to the issueat hand is mistaken.

In this respect, my viewdiffers from the Court's. The entire justification for the stopis articulated in the brief testimony of Officer Nolan. Somefacts are perfectly clear; others are not. This factual insufficiency leads me to conclude that the Court's judgment ismistaken.Respondent Wardlow was arrested a few minutes afternoon on September 9, 1995. 183 Ill. 2d 306, 308, n. 1, 701N. E. 2d 484, 485, n. 1 (1998).14 Nolan was part of an eight-officer, four-car caravan patrol team. The officers wereheaded for "one of the areas in the 11th District [of Chicago]that's high [in] narcotics traffic." App. 8.15 The reason whyfour cars were in the caravan was that "[n]ormally in thesedifferent areas there's an enormous amount of people, sometimes lookouts, customers." Ibid. Officer Nolan testifiedthat he was in uniform on that day, but he did not recallwhether he was driving a marked or an unmarked car.Id., at 4.Officer Nolan and his partner were in the last of the fourpatrol cars that "were all caravaning eastbound down VanBuren." Id., at 8. Nolan first observed respondent "infront of 4035 West Van Buren."Id., at 7. Wardlow "lookedin our direction and began fleeing." Id., at 9. Nolan then"began driving southbound down the street observing [re-spondent] running through the gangway and the alley southbound," and observed that Wardlow was carrying a white,14 At the suppression hearing, the State failed to present testimony asto the time of respondent's arrest.

After the carturned south and intercepted respondent as he "ran righttowards us," Officer Nolan stopped him and conducted a"protective search," which revealed that the bag under respondent's arm contained a loaded handgun. Id., at 9-11.This terse testimony is most noticeable for what it failsto reveal. Though asked whether he was in a marked orunmarked car, Officer Nolan could not recall the answer.Id., at 4. He was not asked whether any of the other threecars in the caravan were marked, or whether any of the otherseven officers were in uniform. Though he explained thatthe size of the caravan was because "[n]ormally in these different areas there's an enormous amount of people, some-times lookouts, customers," Officer Nolan did not testify asto whether anyone besides Wardlow was nearby 4035 WestVan Buren. Nor is it clear that that address was the intended destination of the caravan. As the Appellate Courtof Illinois interpreted the record, "it appears that the officerswere simply driving by, on their way to some unidentifiedlocation, when they noticed defendant standing at 4035 WestVan Buren." 287 Ill. App. 3d 367, 370-371, 678 N. E. 2d 65,67 (1997).16 Officer Nolan's testimony also does not revealhow fast the officers were driving. It does not indicatewhether he saw respondent notice the other patrol cars.And it does not say whether the caravan, or any part of it,had already passed Wardlow by before he began to run.Indeed, the Appellate Court thought the record was even"too vague to support the inference that . . . defendant'sflight was related to his expectation of police focus on him."Id., at 371, 678 N. E. 2d, at 67. Presumably, respondent didnot react to the first three cars, and we cannot even be surethat he recognized the occupants of the fourth as police offi-cers. The adverse inference is based entirely on the officer's16 Of course, it would be a different case if the officers had credible information respecting that specific street address which reasonably led themto believe that criminal activity was afoot in that narrowly defined area.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN139Cite as: 528 U.

Though respondent was carrying a white,opaque bag under his arm, there is nothing at all suspiciousabout that. Certainly the time of day--shortly after noon--does not support Illinois' argument. Nor were the officers"responding to any call or report of suspicious activity in thearea." 183 Ill. 2d, at 315, 701 N. E. 2d, at 488. OfficerNolan did testify that he expected to find "an enormousamount of people," including drug customers or lookouts,App. 8, and the Court points out that "[i]t was in this contextthat Officer Nolan decided to investigate Wardlow after observing him flee," ante, at 124. This observation, in myview, lends insufficient weight to the reasonable suspicionanalysis; indeed, in light of the absence of testimony thatanyone else was nearby when respondent began to run, thisobservation points in the opposite direction.The State, along with the majority of the Court, relies aswell on the assumption that this flight occurred in a highcrime area. Even if that assumption is accurate, it is insufficient because even in a high crime neighborhood unprovoked flight does not invariably lead to reasonable suspicion.On the contrary, because many factors providing innocentmotivations for unprovoked flight are concentrated in highcrime areas, the character of the neighborhood arguablymakes an inference of guilt less appropriate, rather thanmore so. Like unprovoked flight itself, presence in a highcrime neighborhood is a fact too generic and susceptible toinnocent explanation to satisfy the reasonable suspicion inquiry. See Brown v. Texas, 443 U. S. 47, 52 (1979); see alson. 15, supra.17 Officer Nolan also testified that respondent "was looking at us," App.5 (emphasis added), though this minor clarification hardly seems sufficientto support the adverse inference.528US1 Unit: $U14 [06-14-01 18:51:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN140 ILLINOIS v.

CONDON, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF SOUTH CAROLINA, et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuitNo. 98-1464. Argued November 10, 1999--Decided January 12, 2000State departments of motor vehicles (DMVs) require drivers and automobile owners to provide personal information, which may include aperson's name, address, telephone number, vehicle description, Social Security number, medical information, and photograph, as a condition ofobtaining a driver's license or registering an automobile. Finding thatmany States sell this information to individuals and businesses for significant revenues, Congress enacted the Driver's Privacy Protection Actof 1994 (DPPA), which establishes a regulatory scheme that restrictsthe States' ability to disclose a driver's personal information withoutthe driver's consent. South Carolina law conflicts with the DPPA's provisions. Following the DPPA's enactment, South Carolina and its Attorney General filed this suit, alleging that the DPPA violates the Tenthand Eleventh Amendments to the United States Constitution. Concluding that the DPPA is incompatible with the principles of federalisminherent in the Constitution's division of power between the States andthe Federal Government, the District Court granted summary judgment for the State and permanently enjoined the DPPA's enforcementagainst the State and its officers. The Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that the DPPA violates constitutional principles of federalism.Held: In enacting the DPPA, Congress did not run afoul of the federalism principles enunciated in New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144,and Printz v. United States, 521 U. S. 898. The Federal Governmentcorrectly asserts that the DPPA is a proper exercise of Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause,U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 3. The motor vehicle information, which theStates have historically sold, is used by insurers, manufacturers, directmarketers, and others engaged in interstate commerce to contact drivers with customized solicitations. The information is also used in thestream of interstate commerce by various public and private entitiesfor matters related to interstate motoring. Because drivers' personal,identifying information is, in this context, an article of commerce, itssale or release into the interstate stream of business is sufficient to528US1 Unit: $U15 [06-14-01 19:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN142 RENO v. CONDONSyllabussupport congressional regulation. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S.549, 558-559. This does not conclusively resolve the DPPA's constitutionality because in New York and Printz the Court held that federalstatutes were invalid, not because Congress lacked legislative authorityover the subject matter, but because those statutes violated TenthAmendment federalism principles. However, the DPPA does not violate those principles. This case is instead governed by South Carolinav. Baker, 485 U. S. 505, in which a statute prohibiting States from issuing unregistered bonds was upheld because it regulated state activities,rather than seeking to control or influence the manner in which Statesregulated private parties, id., at 514-515. Like that statute, the DPPAdoes not require the States in their sovereign capacity to regulate theirown citizens; rather, it regulates the States as the owners of data bases.It does not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws orregulations, as did the statute at issue in New York, and it does notrequire state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutesregulating private individuals, as did the law considered in Printz.Thus, the DPPA is consistent with the principles set forth in those cases.The Court need not address South Carolina's argument that the DPPAunconstitutionally regulates the States exclusively rather than bymeans of a generally applicable law. The DPPA is generally applicablebecause it regulates the universe of entities that participate as suppliers to the market for motor vehicle information--the States as initialsuppliers of the information in interstate commerce and private resellers or redisclosers of that information in commerce.

The DPPA generally prohib-its any state DMV, or officer, employee, or contractor thereof,from "knowingly disclos[ing] or otherwise mak[ing] availableto any person or entity personal information about any individual obtained by the department in connection with amotor vehicle record." 18 U. S. C. $ 2721(a). The DPPA defines "personal information" as any information "that identifies an individual, including an individual's photograph, socialsecurity number, driver identification number, name, address(but not the 5-digit zip code), telephone number, and medicalor disability information," but not including "information onvehicular accidents, driving violations, and driver's status."$ 2725(3). A "motor vehicle record" is defined as "any record that pertains to a motor vehicle operator's permit, motorvehicle title, motor vehicle registration, or identification cardissued by a department of motor vehicles." $ 2725(1).The DPPA's ban on disclosure of personal information doesnot apply if drivers have consented to the release of theirdata. When we granted certiorari in this case, the DPPAprovided that a DMV could obtain that consent either on acase-by-case basis or could imply consent if the State provided drivers with an opportunity to block disclosure of theirpersonal information when they received or renewed theirlicenses and drivers did not avail themselves of that opportunity. $$ 2721(b)(11), (13), and (d). However, Public Law106-69, 113 Stat. 986, which was signed into law on October9, 1999, changed this "opt-out" alternative to an "opt-in"requirement.

The information is also usedin the stream of interstate commerce by various public andprivate entities for matters related to interstate motoring.Because drivers' information is, in this context, an article ofcommerce, its sale or release into the interstate stream ofbusiness is sufficient to support congressional regulation.We therefore need not address the Government's alternativeargument that the States' individual, intrastate activities ingathering, maintaining, and distributing drivers' personal2 In the lower courts, the United States also asserted that the DPPA waslawfully enacted pursuant to Congress' power under $ 5 of the FourteenthAmendment. See 155 F. 3d 453, 463-465 (1998); 972 F. Supp. 977-979,986-992 (1997). The District Court and Court of Appeals rejected thatargument. See 155 F. 3d, at 465; 972 F. Supp., at 992. The United States'petition for certiorari and briefs to this Court do not address the $ 5 issueand, at oral argument, the Solicitor General expressly disavowed any reliance on it.528US1 Unit: $U15 [06-14-01 19:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN149Cite as: 528 U. S. 141 (2000)Opinion of the Courtinformation have a sufficiently substantial impact on inter-state commerce to create a constitutional base for federallegislation.But the fact that drivers' personal information is, in thecontext of this case, an article in interstate commerce doesnot conclusively resolve the constitutionality of the DPPA.In New York and Printz, we held federal statutes invalid,not because Congress lacked legislative authority over thesubject matter, but because those statutes violated the prin-ciples of federalism contained in the Tenth Amendment. InNew York, Congress commandeered the state legislativeprocess by requiring a state legislature to enact a particularkind of law. We said:"While Congress has substantial powers to govern theNation directly, including in areas of intimate concernto the States, the Constitution has never been under-stood to confer upon Congress the ability to require theStates to govern according to Congress' instructions.See Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911)." 505 U. S.,at 162.In Printz, we invalidated a provision of the Brady Actwhich commanded "state and local enforcement officers toconduct background checks on prospective handgun pur-chasers." 521 U. S., at 902. We said:"We held in New York that Congress cannot compelthe States to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program. Today we hold that Congress cannot circumventthat prohibition by conscripting the States' officers directly. The Federal Government may neither issue di-rectives requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States' officers, or those of theirpolitical subdivisions, to administer or enforce a federalregulatory program." Id., at 935.South Carolina contends that the DPPA violates the TenthAmendment because it "thrusts upon the States all of the528US1 Unit: $U15 [06-14-01 19:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN150 RENO v. CONDONOpinion of the Courtday-to-day responsibility for administering its complex pro-visions," Brief for Respondents 10, and thereby makes "stateofficials the unwilling implementors of federal policy," id., at11.3 South Carolina emphasizes that the DPPA requires theState's employees to learn and apply the Act's substantiverestrictions, which are summarized above, and notes thatthese activities will consume the employees' time and thusthe State's resources. South Carolina further notes that theDPPA's penalty provisions hang over the States as a potential punishment should they fail to comply with the Act.We agree with South Carolina's assertion that the DPPA'sprovisions will require time and effort on the part of stateemployees, but reject the State's argument that the DPPAviolates the principles laid down in either New York orPrintz. We think, instead, that this case is governed by ourdecision in South Carolina v. Baker, 485 U. S. 505 (1988).In Baker, we upheld a statute that prohibited States fromissuing unregistered bonds because the law "regulate[d]state activities," rather than "seek[ing] to control or influence the manner in which States regulate private parties."Id., at 514-515. We further noted:"The [National Governor's Association] nonetheless contends that $ 310 has commandeered the state legislativeand administrative process because many state legislatures had to amend a substantial number of statutes inorder to issue bonds in registered form and becausestate officials had to devote substantial effort to determine how best to implement a registered bond system.Such `commandeering' is, however, an inevitable consequence of regulating a state activity. Any federal regulation demands compliance. That a State wishing to en3 South Carolina has not asserted that it does not participate in the interstate market for personal information. Rather, South Carolina asksthat the DPPA be invalidated in its entirety, even as it is applied to theStates acting purely as commercial sellers.528US1 Unit: $U15 [06-14-01 19:02:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN151Cite as: 528 U. S. 141 (2000)Opinion of the Courtgage in certain activity must take administrative andsometimes legislative action to comply with federalstandards regulating that activity is a commonplace thatpresents no constitutional defect." Ibid.Like the statute at issue in Baker, the DPPA does notrequire the States in their sovereign capacity to regulatetheir own citizens. The DPPA regulates the States as theowners of data bases. It does not require the South Carolina Legislature to enact any laws or regulations, and it doesnot require state officials to assist in the enforcement of federal statutes regulating private individuals. We accord-ingly conclude that the DPPA is consistent with the constitutional principles enunciated in New York and Printz.As a final matter, we turn to South Carolina's argumentthat the DPPA is unconstitutional because it regulates theStates exclusively. The essence of South Carolina's argument is that Congress may only regulate the States bymeans of "generally applicable" laws, or laws that apply toindividuals as well as States. But we need not address thequestion whether general applicability is a constitutional requirement for federal regulation of the States, because theDPPA is generally applicable. The DPPA regulates the universe of entities that participate as suppliers to the marketfor motor vehicle information--the States as initial suppliersof the information in interstate commerce and private resell-ers or redisclosers of that information in commerce.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore
