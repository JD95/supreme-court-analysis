Petitioner Josue Leocal, a Haitian citizen who is a lawfulpermanent resident of the United States, was convicted in2000 of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and caus-ing serious bodily injury, in violation of Florida law. SeeFla. Stat. $ 316.193(3)(c)(2) (2003). Classifying this convic-tion as a "crime of violence" under 18 U. S.

We disagree and hold that petitioner'sDUI conviction is not a crime of violence under 18 U. S. C.$ 16.Petitioner immigrated to the United States in 1980 andbecame a lawful permanent resident in 1987. In January2000, he was charged with two counts of DUI causing seriousbodily injury under Fla. Stat. $ 316.193(3)(c)(2), after hecaused an accident resulting in injury to two people. Hepleaded guilty to both counts and was sentenced to 21/2 yearsin prison.In November 2000, while he was serving his sentence, theImmigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal proceedings against him pursuant to $ 237(a) of theINA. Under that provision, "[a]ny alien who is convicted ofan aggravated felony . . . is deportable" and may be removedupon an order of the Attorney General. 66 Stat. 201, 8U. S. C. $ 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Section 101(a)(43) of the INAdefines "aggravated felony" to include, inter alia, "a crimeof violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year." 1 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(43)(F)(footnote omitted). Title 18 U. S. C. $ 16, in turn, defines theterm "crime of violence" to mean:1 Congress first made commission of an aggravated felony grounds foran alien's removal in 1988, and it defined the term to include offenses suchas murder, drug trafficking crimes, and firearm trafficking offenses. SeeAnti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, $$ 7342, 7344, 102 Stat. 4469, 4470. Sincethen, Congress has frequently amended the definition of aggravated felony,broadening the scope of offenses which render an alien deportable. See,e. g., Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, $ 440(e), 110Stat. 1277 (adding a number of offenses to $ 101(a)(43) of the INA); IllegalImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA),$ 321, 110 Stat. 3009-627 (same).

See Matter of Ramos, 23 I. & N.Dec. 336, 346 (BIA 2002) (en banc). However, because the BIA held inRamos that it would "follow the law of the circuit in those circuits thathave addressed the question whether driving under the influence is acrime of violence," id., at 346-347, and because it found the Eleventh Circuit's ruling in Le controlling, it affirmed the Immigration Judge's removalorder.

Compare Le, supra,at 1354; and Omar v. INS, 298 F. 3d 710, 715-718 (CA8 2002),withUnited States v. Trinidad-Aquino, 259 F. 3d 1140, 1145-1146 (CA9 2001); Dalton v.

S. 1 (2004)Opinion of the Court98 Stat. 2136. Section 16 has since been incorporated intoa variety of statutory provisions, both criminal andnoncriminal.4Here, pursuant to $ 237(a) of the INA, the Court of Appeals applied $ 16 to find that petitioner's DUI convictionrendered him deportable. In determining whether petitioner's conviction falls within the ambit of $ 16, the statute di-rects our focus to the "offense" of conviction. See $ 16(a)(defining a crime of violence as "an offense that has as anelement the use . . . of physical force against the person orproperty of another" (emphasis added)); $ 16(b) (defining theterm as "any other offense that is a felony and that, by itsnature, involves a substantial risk that physical force againstthe person or property of another may be used in the courseof committing the offense" (emphasis added)). This language requires us to look to the elements and the nature ofthe offense of conviction, rather than to the particular factsrelating to petitioner's crime.Florida Stat. $ 316.193(3)(c)(2) makes it a third-degree felony for a person to operate a vehicle while under the influ-ence and, "by reason of such operation, caus[e] . . . [s]eriousbodily injury to another." The Florida statute, while it re-quires proof of causation of injury, does not require proof ofany particular mental state. See State v. Hubbard, 751So. 2d 552, 562-564 (Fla. 1999) (holding, in the context of aDUI manslaughter conviction under $ 316.193, that the stat4 For instance, a number of statutes criminalize conduct that has as anelement the commission of a crime of violence under $ 16. See, e. g., 18U. S. C. $ 842(p) (prohibiting the distribution of information relating to explosives, destructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction in relationto a crime of violence). Other statutory provisions make classification ofan offense as a crime of violence consequential for purposes of, inter alia,extradition and restitution. See $$ 3181(b), 3663A(c). And the term"crime of violence" under $ 16 has been incorporated into a number ofnoncriminal enactments. See, e. g., 8 U. S.

Many Stateshave enacted similar statutes, criminalizing DUI causing serious bodily injury or death without requiring proof of anymental state,5 or, in some States, appearing to require onlyproof that the person acted negligently in operating the vehicle.6 The question here is whether $ 16 can be interpretedto include such offenses.Our analysis begins with the language of the statute. SeeBailey v. United States, 516 U. S. 137, 144 (1995).

Petitioner contends thathis conviction did not require the "use" of force against another person because the most common employment of theword "use" connotes theintentional availment of force,which is not required under the Florida DUI statute. TheGovernment counters that the "use" of force does not incorporate any mens rea component, and that petitioner's DUIconviction necessarily includes the use of force. To supportits position, the Government dissects the meaning of theword "use," employing dictionaries, legislation, and our owncase law in contending that a use of force may be negligentor even inadvertent.Whether or not the word "use" alone supplies a mens reaelement, the parties' primary focus on that word is too narrow. Particularly when interpreting a statute that featuresas elastic a word as "use," we construe language in its context and in light of the terms surrounding it. See Smith v.United States, 508 U. S. 223, 229 (1993); Bailey, supra, at 143.The critical aspect of $ 16(a) is that a crime of violence is oneinvolving the "use . . . of physical force against the personor property of another." (Emphasis added.) As we said ina similar context in Bailey, "use" requires active employment. 516 U. S., at 145. While one may, in theory, activelyemploy something in an accidental manner, it is much lessnatural to say that a person actively employs physical forceagainst another person by accident. Thus, a person would"use . . . physical force against" another when pushing him;however, we would not ordinarily say a person "use[s] . . .physical force against" another by stumbling and falling intohim. When interpreting a statute, we must give wordstheir "ordinary or natural" meaning. Smith, supra, at 228.The key phrase in $ 16(a)--the "use . . . of physical forceagainst the person or property of another"--most naturallysuggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merelyaccidental conduct. See United States v. Trinidad-Aquino,259 F. 3d, at 1145; Bazan-Reyes v. INS, 256 F. 3d, at 609.543US1 Unit: $$U1 [09-29-05 16:50:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN10 LEOCAL v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the CourtPetitioner's DUI offense therefore is not a crime of violenceunder $ 16(a).Neither is petitioner's DUI conviction a crime of violenceunder $ 16(b). Section 16(b) sweeps more broadly than$ 16(a), defining a crime of violence as including "any otheroffense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves asubstantial risk that physical force against the person orproperty of another may be used in the course of committingthe offense." But $ 16(b) does not thereby encompass allnegligent misconduct, such as the negligent operation of avehicle. It simply covers offenses that naturally involve aperson acting in disregard of the risk that physical forcemight be used against another in committing an offense.The reckless disregard in $ 16 relates not to the general conduct or to the possibility that harm will result from a person's conduct, but to the risk that the use of physical forceagainst another might be required in committing a crime.7The classic example is burglary. A burglary would be covered under $ 16(b) not because the offense can be committedin a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured, but because burglary, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victimin completing the crime.7 Thus, $ 16(b) plainly does not encompass all offenses which create a"substantial risk" that injury will result from a person's conduct. The"substantial risk" in $ 16(b) relates to the use of force, not to the possibleeffect of a person's conduct. Compare $ 16(b) (requiring a "substantialrisk that physical force against the person or property of another maybe used") with United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual$ 4B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2003) (in the context of a career-offender sentencingenhancement, defining "crime of violence" as meaning, inter alia, "conductthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another"). Therisk that an accident may occur when an individual drives while intoxicated is simply not the same thing as the risk that the individual may"use" physical force against another in committing the DUI offense. See,e. g., United States v. Lucio-Lucio, 347 F. 3d 1202, 1205-1207 (CA10 2003);Bazan-Reyes v. INS, 256 F. 3d 600, 609-610 (CA7 2001).543US1 Unit: $$U1 [09-29-05 16:50:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN11Cite as: 543 U. S. 1 (2004)Opinion of the CourtThus, while $ 16(b) is broader than $ 16(a) in the sense thatphysical force need not actually be applied, it contains thesame formulation we found to be determinative in $ 16(a):the use of physical force against the person or property ofanother. Accordingly, we must give the language in $ 16(b)an identical construction, requiring a higher mens rea thanthe merely accidental or negligent conduct involved in a DUIoffense. This is particularly true in light of $ 16(b)'s requirement that the "substantial risk" be a risk of using physicalforce against another person "in the course of committingthe offense." In no "ordinary or natural" sense can it besaid that a person risks having to "use" physical force againstanother person in the course of operating a vehicle whileintoxicated and causing injury.In construing both parts of $ 16, we cannot forget that weultimately are determining the meaning of the term "crimeof violence." The ordinary meaning of this term, combinedwith $ 16's emphasis on the use of physical force against another person (or the risk of having to use such force in com-mitting a crime), suggests a category of violent, activecrimes that cannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses.Cf. United States v. Doe, 960 F. 2d 221, 225 (CA1 1992)(Breyer, C. J.) (observing that the term "violent felony" in 18U. S. C. $ 924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) "calls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closelyrelated, active violence"). Interpreting $ 16 to encompassaccidental or negligent conduct would blur the distinctionbetween the "violent" crimes Congress sought to distinguishfor heightened punishment and other crimes. See UnitedStates v. Lucio-Lucio, 347 F. 3d 1202, 1205-1206 (CA10 2003).Section 16 therefore cannot be read to include petitioner'sconviction for DUI causing serious bodily injury under Florida law.8 This construction is reinforced by Congress' use8 Even if $ 16 lacked clarity on this point, we would be constrained tointerpret any ambiguity in the statute in petitioner's favor. Althoughhere we deal with $ 16 in the deportation context, $ 16 is a criminal statute,543US1 Unit: $$U1 [09-29-05 16:50:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN12 LEOCAL v. ASHCROFTOpinion of the Courtof the term "crime of violence" in $ 101(h) of the INA, whichwas enacted in 1990. See Foreign Relations AuthorizationAct, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, $ 131, 104 Stat. 31 (herein-after FRAA). Section 212(a)(2)(E) of the INA renders inadmissible any alien who has previously exercised diplomaticimmunity from criminal jurisdiction in the United Statesafter committing a "serious criminal offense." 8 U. S. C.$ 1182(a)(2)(E). Section 101(h) defines the term "seriouscriminal offense" to mean:"(1) any felony;"(2) any crime of violence, as defined in section 16 oftitle 18; or"(3) any crime of reckless driving or of driving whileintoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or of prohibited substances if such crime involves personal injury toanother." 8 U. S. C. $ 1101(h) (emphasis added).Congress' separate listing of the DUI-causing-injury offensefrom the definition of "crime of violence" in $ 16 is revealing.Interpreting $ 16 to include DUI offenses, as the Govern-ment urges, would leave $ 101(h)(3) practically devoid of significance. As we must give effect to every word of a statutewherever possible, seeDuncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 174(2001), the distinct provision for these offenses under $ 101(h)bolsters our conclusion that $ 16 does not itself encompassDUI offenses.9and it has both criminal and noncriminal applications. Because we mustinterpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its application ina criminal or noncriminal context, the rule of lenity applies. Cf. UnitedStates v. Thompson/Center Arms Co., 504 U. S. 505, 517-518 (1992) (plurality opinion) (applying the rule of lenity to a tax statute, in a civil setting,because the statute had criminal applications and thus had to be interpreted consistently with its criminal applications).9 This point carries significant weight in the particular context of thiscase. Congress incorporated $ 16 as an aggravated felony under$ 101(a)(43)(F) of the INA in 1990. See Immigration Act of 1990, $ 501,104 Stat. 5048 (Nov. 29, 1990).

S. C. $ 16. DUI statutes such as Florida's do not require any mental state withrespect to the use of force against another person, thusreaching individuals who were negligent or less. Drunkdriving is a nationwide problem, as evidenced by the effortsof legislatures to prohibit such conduct and impose appro-priate penalties. But this fact does not warrant our shoehorning it into statutory sections where it does not fit. Thejudgment of the United States Court of Appeals for theEleventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is re-manded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
