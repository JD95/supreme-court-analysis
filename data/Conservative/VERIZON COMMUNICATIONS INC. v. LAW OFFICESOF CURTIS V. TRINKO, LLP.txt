LAW OFFICESOF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLPOpinion of the CourtIPetitioner Verizon Communications Inc. is the incumbentlocal exchange carrier (LEC) serving New York State. Before the 1996 Act, Verizon,1 like other incumbent LECs, en-joyed an exclusive franchise within its local service area.The 1996 Act sought to "uproo[t]" the incumbent LECs' mo-nopoly and to introduce competition in its place.VerizonCommunications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S. 467, 488 (2002).Central to the scheme of the Act is the incumbent LEC'sobligation under 47 U. S. C. $ 251(c) to share its network withcompetitors, see AT&T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd., 525U. S. 366, 371 (1999), including provision of access to individual elements of the network on an "unbundled" basis.$ 251(c)(3). New entrants, so-called competitive LECs, resell these unbundled network elements (UNEs), recombinedwith each other or with elements belonging to the LECs.Verizon, like other incumbent LECs, has taken two sig-nificant steps within the Act's framework in the directionof increased competition. First, Verizon has signed inter-connection agreements with rivals such as AT&T, as it isobliged to do under $ 252, detailing the terms on which it willmake its network elements available. (Because Verizon andAT&T could not agree upon terms, the open issues were sub-jected to compulsory arbitration under $$ 252(b) and (c).) In1997, the state regulator, New York's Public Service Com-mission (PSC), approved Verizon's interconnection agreement with AT&T.Second, Verizon has taken advantage of the opportunityprovided by the 1996 Act for incumbent LECs to enterthe long-distance market (from which they had long beenexcluded). That required Verizon to satisfy, among otherthings, a 14-item checklist of statutory requirements, which1 In 1996, NYNEX was the incumbent LEC for New York State.NYNEX subsequently merged with Bell Atlantic Corporation, and themerged entity retained the Bell Atlantic name; a further merger producedVerizon. We use "Verizon" to refer to NYNEX and Bell Atlantic as well.540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN403Cite as: 540 U. S. 398 (2004)Opinion of the Courtincludes compliance with the Act's network-sharing duties.$$ 271(d)(3)(A) and (c)(2)(B). Checklist item two, for example, includes "[n]ondiscriminatory access to network ele-ments in accordance with the requirements" of $ 251(c)(3).$ 271(c)(2)(B)(ii). Whereas the state regulator approves aninterconnection agreement, for long-distance approval the incumbent LEC applies to the Federal Communications Com-mission (FCC). In December 1999, the FCC approved Verizon's $ 271 application for New York.Part of Verizon's UNE obligation under $ 251(c)(3) is theprovision of access to operations support systems (OSS), aset of systems used by incumbent LECs to provide servicesto customers and ensure quality. Verizon's interconnectionagreement and long-distance authorization each specified themechanics by which its OSS obligation would be met. Asrelevant here, a competitive LEC sends orders for servicethrough an electronic interface with Verizon's ordering sys-tem, and as Verizon completes certain steps in filling theorder, it sends confirmation back through the same interface.Without OSS access a rival cannot fill its customers' orders.In late 1999, competitive LECs complained to regulatorsthat many orders were going unfilled, in violation of Verizon's obligation to provide access to OSS functions. ThePSC and FCC opened parallel investigations, which led to aseries of orders by the PSC and a consent decree with theFCC.2 Under the FCC consent decree, Verizon undertook2 Order Directing Improvements To Wholesale Service Performance,MCI WorldCom, Inc. v.

Trinko, LLP, a NewYork City law firm, was a local telephone service customerof AT&T. The day after Verizon entered its consent decreewith the FCC, respondent filed a complaint in the DistrictCourt for the Southern District of New York, on behalf ofitself and a class of similarly situated customers. See App.12-33. The complaint, as later amended, id., at 34-50, alleged that Verizon had filled rivals' orders on a discriminatory basis as part of an anticompetitive scheme to discouragecustomers from becoming or remaining customers of competitive LECs, thus impeding the competitive LECs' ability toenter and compete in the market for local telephone service.See, e. g., id., at 34-35, 46-47, |||| 1, 2, 52, 54. Accordingto the complaint, Verizon "has filled orders of [competitive LEC] customers after filling those for its own localphone service, has failed to fill in a timely manner, or not atall, a substantial number of orders for [competitive LEC]customers . . . , and has systematically failed to inform [com540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN405Cite as: 540 U.

The complaint set forth a single example ofthe alleged "failure to provide adequate access to [competi-tive LECs]," namely, the OSS failure that resulted in theFCC consent decree and PSC orders. Id., at 40, || 22. Itasserted that the result of Verizon's improper "behavior withrespect to providing access to its local loop" was to "deterpotential customers [of rivals] from switching."Id., at 35,47, |||| 2, 57. The complaint sought damages and injunctiverelief for violation of $ 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 2,pursuant to the remedy provisions of $$ 4 and 16 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 15, 26.

C. $ 151 et seq., and state law.The District Court dismissed the complaint in its entirety.As to the antitrust portion, it concluded that respondent'sallegations of deficient assistance to rivals failed to satisfythe requirements of $ 2. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated the complaint in part, including theantitrust claim. 305 F. 3d 89, 113 (2002). We granted certiorari, limited to the question whether the Court of Appealserred in reversing the District Court's dismissal of respondent's antitrust claims. 538 U. S. 905 (2003).IITo decide this case, we must first determine what effect(if any) the 1996 Act has upon the application of traditionalantitrust principles. The Act imposes a large number of du-ties upon incumbent LECs--above and beyond those basicresponsibilities it imposes upon all carriers, such as assuringnumber portability and providing access to rights-of-way, see47 U. S. C. $$ 251(b)(2), (4). Under the sharing duties of$ 251(c), incumbent LECs are required to offer three kindsof access. Already noted, and perhaps most intrusive, is theduty to offer access to UNEs on "just, reasonable, and non540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN406 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. LAW OFFICESOF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLPOpinion of the Courtdiscriminatory" terms, $ 251(c)(3), a phrase that the FCC hasinterpreted to mean a price reflecting long-run incrementalcost. See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S.,at 495-496. A rival can interconnect its own facilities withthose of the incumbent LEC, or it can simply purchase serv-ices at wholesale from the incumbent and resell them to consumers. See $$ 251(c)(2), (4). The Act also imposes uponincumbents the duty to allow physical "collocation"--that is,to permit a competitor to locate and install its equipment onthe incumbent's premises--which makes feasible intercon-nection and access to UNEs. See $ 251(c)(6).That Congress created these duties, however, does not automatically lead to the conclusion that they can be enforcedby means of an antitrust claim. Indeed, a detailed regulatory scheme such as that created by the 1996 Act ordinarilyraises the question whether the regulated entities are notshielded from antitrust scrutiny altogether by the doctrineof implied immunity. See, e. g., United States v. NationalAssn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 422 U. S. 694 (1975); Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, Inc., 422 U. S. 659 (1975).In some respects the enforcement scheme set up by the 1996Act is a good candidate for implication of antitrust immunity,to avoid the real possibility of judgments conflicting with theagency's regulatory scheme "that might be voiced by courtsexercising jurisdiction under the antitrust laws." UnitedStates v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., supra,at 734.Congress, however, precluded that interpretation. Section 601(b)(1) of the 1996 Act is an antitrust-specific savingclause providing that "nothing in this Act or the amendmentsmade by this Act shall be construed to modify, impair, orsupersede the applicability of any of the antitrust laws."110 Stat. 143, 47 U. S. C. $ 152, note. This bars a finding ofimplied immunity. As the FCC has put the point, the savingclause preserves those "claims that satisfy established antitrust standards." Brief for United States and the Federal540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN407Cite as: 540 U. S. 398 (2004)Opinion of the CourtCommunications Commission as Amici Curiae SupportingNeither Party in No. 02-7057, Covad Communications Co.v. Bell Atlantic Corp. (CADC), p. 8.But just as the 1996 Act preserves claims that satisfyexisting antitrust standards, it does not create new claimsthat go beyond existing antitrust standards; that would beequally inconsistent with the saving clause's mandate thatnothing in the Act "modify, impair, or supersede the applicability" of the antitrust laws. We turn, then, to whether theactivity of which respondent complains violates pre-existingantitrust standards. IIIThe complaint alleges that Verizon denied interconnectionservices to rivals in order to limit entry. If that allegationstates an antitrust claim at all, it does so under $ 2 of theSherman Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 2, which declares that a firm shallnot "monopolize" or "attempt to monopolize." Ibid. It issettled law that this offense requires, in addition to the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, "the will-ful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguishedfrom growth or development as a consequence of a superiorproduct, business acumen, or historic accident."UnitedStates v. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S. 563, 570-571 (1966). Themere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitantcharging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is animportant element of the free-market system. The opportu-nity to charge monopoly prices--at least for a short period--is what attracts "business acumen" in the first place; it in-duces risk taking that produces innovation and economicgrowth. To safeguard the incentive to innovate, the posses-sion of monopoly power will not be found unlawful unlessit is accompanied by an element of anticompetitive conduct.Firms may acquire monopoly power by establishing an infrastructure that renders them uniquely suited to serve theircustomers. Compelling such firms to share the source oftheir advantage is in some tension with the underlying pur540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN408 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. LAW OFFICESOF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLPOpinion of the Courtpose of antitrust law, since it may lessen the incentive for themonopolist, the rival, or both to invest in those economicallybeneficial facilities. Enforced sharing also requires anti-trust courts to act as central planners, identifying the properprice, quantity, and other terms of dealing--a role for whichthey are ill suited. Moreover, compelling negotiation between competitors may facilitate the supreme evil of antitrust: collusion. Thus, as a general matter, the Sherman Act"does not restrict the long recognized right of [a] trader ormanufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freelyto exercise his own independent discretion as to parties withwhom he will deal." United States v. Colgate & Co., 250U. S. 300, 307 (1919).However, "[t]he high value that we have placed on theright to refuse to deal with other firms does not mean thatthe right is unqualified." Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp., 472 U. S. 585, 601 (1985). Under certaincircumstances, a refusal to cooperate with rivals can constitute anticompetitive conduct and violate $ 2. We have beenvery cautious in recognizing such exceptions, because of theuncertain virtue of forced sharing and the difficulty of identifying and remedying anticompetitive conduct by a singlefirm. The question before us today is whether the allegations of respondent's complaint fit within existing exceptionsor provide a basis, under traditional antitrust principles, forrecognizing a new one.The leading case for $ 2 liability based on refusal to cooperate with a rival, and the case upon which respondent understandably places greatest reliance, is Aspen Skiing, supra.The Aspen ski area consisted of four mountain areas. Thedefendant, who owned three of those areas, and the plaintiff,who owned the fourth, had cooperated for years in the issuance of a joint, multiple-day, all-area ski ticket. After repeatedly demanding an increased share of the proceeds, thedefendant canceled the joint ticket. The plaintiff, concernedthat skiers would bypass its mountain without some joint540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN409Cite as: 540 U. S. 398 (2004)Opinion of the Courtoffering, tried a variety of increasingly desperate measuresto re-create the joint ticket, even to the point of in effectoffering to buy the defendant's tickets at retail price. Id.,at 593-594. The defendant refused even that. We uphelda jury verdict for the plaintiff, reasoning that "[t]he jury maywell have concluded that [the defendant] elected to forgothese short-run benefits because it was more interested inreducing competition . . . over the long run by harming itssmaller competitor."Id., at 608.Aspen Skiing is at or near the outer boundary of $ 2 liabil-ity. The Court there found significance in the defendant'sdecision to cease participation in a cooperative venture. Seeid., at 608, 610-611. The unilateral termination of a voluntary (and thus presumably profitable) course of dealingsuggested a willingness to forsake short-term profits toachieve an anticompetitive end. Ibid. Similarly, the defendant's unwillingness to renew the ticket even if compensated at retail price revealed a distinctly anticompetitivebent.The refusal to deal alleged in the present case does not fitwithin the limited exception recognized in Aspen Skiing.The complaint does not allege that Verizon voluntarily engaged in a course of dealing with its rivals, or would everhave done so absent statutory compulsion. Here, therefore,the defendant's prior conduct sheds no light upon the motivation of its refusal to deal--upon whether its regulatory lapses were prompted not by competitive zeal but byanticompetitive malice. The contrast between the cases isheightened by the difference in pricing behavior. In AspenSkiing, the defendant turned down a proposal to sell at itsown retail price, suggesting a calculation that its future monopoly retail price would be higher. Verizon's reluctance tointerconnect at the cost-based rate of compensation availableunder $ 251(c)(3) tells us nothing about dreams of monopoly.The specific nature of what the 1996 Act compels makesthis case different from Aspen Skiing in a more fundamental540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN410 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. LAW OFFICESOF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLPOpinion of the Courtway. In Aspen Skiing, what the defendant refused to pro-vide to its competitor was a product that it already sold atretail--to oversimplify slightly, lift tickets representing abundle of services to skiers. Similarly, in Otter Tail PowerCo. v. United States, 410 U. S. 366 (1973), another case reliedupon by respondent, the defendant was already in the business of providing a service to certain customers (powertransmission over its network), and refused to provide thesame service to certain other customers. Id., at 370-371,377-378. In the present case, by contrast, the services allegedly withheld are not otherwise marketed or available tothe public. The sharing obligation imposed by the 1996 Actcreated "something brand new"--"the wholesale market forleasing network elements." Verizon Communications Inc.v.FCC, 535 U. S., at 528. The unbundled elements offeredpursuant to $ 251(c)(3) exist only deep within the bowels ofVerizon; they are brought out on compulsion of the 1996 Actand offered not to consumers but to rivals, and at consider-able expense and effort. New systems must be designedand implemented simply to make that access possible--indeed, it is the failure of one of those systems that promptedthe present complaint.3We conclude that Verizon's alleged insufficient assistancein the provision of service to rivals is not a recognized antitrust claim under this Court's existing refusal-to-deal prec-edents. This conclusion would be unchanged even if weconsidered to be established law the "essential facilities" doc-trine crafted by some lower courts, under which the Courtof Appeals concluded respondent's allegations might state aclaim. See generally Areeda, Essential Facilities: An Epi3 Respondent also relies upon United States v. Terminal Railroad Assn.of St. Louis, 224 U. S. 383 (1912), and Associated Press v. United States,326 U. S. 1 (1945). These cases involved concerted action, which presentsgreater anticompetitive concerns and is amenable to a remedy that doesnot require judicial estimation of free-market forces: simply requiring thatthe outsider be granted nondiscriminatory admission to the club.540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN411Cite as: 540 U. S. 398 (2004)Opinion of the Courtthet in Need of Limiting Principles, 58 Antitrust L. J. 841(1989). We have never recognized such a doctrine, seeAspen Skiing Co., 472 U. S., at 611, n. 44; AT&T Corp. v.Iowa Utilities Bd., 525 U. S., at 428 (opinion ofBreyer, J.),and we find no need either to recognize it or to repudiateit here. It suffices for present purposes to note that theindispensable requirement for invoking the doctrine is theunavailability of access to the "essential facilities"; where ac-cess exists, the doctrine serves no purpose. Thus, it is saidthat "essential facility claims should . . . be denied where astate or federal agency has effective power to compel sharingand to regulate its scope and terms." P. Areeda & H. Ho-venkamp, Antitrust Law, p. 150, || 773e (2003 Supp.). Respondent believes that the existence of sharing duties underthe 1996 Act supports its case. We think the opposite: The1996 Act's extensive provision for access makes it unneces-sary to impose a judicial doctrine of forced access. To theextent respondent's "essential facilities" argument is distinctfrom its general $ 2 argument, we reject it.IVFinally, we do not believe that traditional antitrust princi-ples justify adding the present case to the few existing exceptions from the proposition that there is no duty to aidcompetitors. Antitrust analysis must always be attuned tothe particular structure and circumstances of the industryat issue. Part of that attention to economic context is anawareness of the significance of regulation. As we havenoted, "careful account must be taken of the pervasive federal and state regulation characteristic of the industry."United States v. Citizens & Southern Nat. Bank, 422 U. S.86, 91 (1975); see also IA P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law, p. 12, || 240c3 (2d ed. 2000). "[A]ntitrust analysismust sensitively recognize and reflect the distinctive economic and legal setting of the regulated industry to whichit applies."Concord v. Boston Edison Co., 915 F. 2d 17,540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN412 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. LAW OFFICESOF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLPOpinion of the Court22 (CA1 1990) (Breyer, C. J.) (internal quotation marksomitted).One factor of particular importance is the existence of aregulatory structure designed to deter and remedy anticompetitive harm. Where such a structure exists, the addi-tional benefit to competition provided by antitrust enforcement will tend to be small, and it will be less plausiblethat the antitrust laws contemplate such additional scrutiny.Where, by contrast, "[t]here is nothing built into the regulatory scheme which performs the antitrust function," Silverv.New York Stock Exchange, 373 U. S. 341, 358 (1963), thebenefits of antitrust are worth its sometimes considerabledisadvantages. Just as regulatory context may in othercases serve as a basis for implied immunity, see, e. g., UnitedStates v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 422U. S., at 730-735, it may also be a consideration in decidingwhether to recognize an expansion of the contours of $ 2.The regulatory framework that exists in this case dem-onstrates how, in certain circumstances, "regulation significantly diminishes the likelihood of major antitrust harm."Concord v. Boston Edison Co., supra, at 25. Consider, forexample, the statutory restrictions upon Verizon's entry intothe potentially lucrative market for long-distance service.To be allowed to enter the long-distance market in the firstplace, an incumbent LEC must be on good behavior in itslocal market. Authorization by the FCC requires state-bystate satisfaction of $ 271's competitive checklist, which aswe have noted includes the nondiscriminatory provision ofaccess to UNEs. Section 271 applications to provide longdistance service have now been approved for incumbentLECs in 47 States and the District of Columbia. See FCCAuthorizes SBC to Provide Long Distance Service in Illinois,Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin (Oct. 15, 2003), http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_ public/attachmatch/DOC-239978A1.pdf.The FCC's $ 271 authorization order for Verizon to providelong-distance service in New York discussed at great lengthVerizon's commitments to provide access to UNEs, including540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN413Cite as: 540 U.

Those commitments are enforceable by the FCC through continuing oversight; a failure tomeet an authorization condition can result in an order thatthe deficiency be corrected, in the imposition of penalties, orin the suspension or revocation of long-distance approval.See 47 U. S. C. $ 271(d)(6)(A). Verizon also subjected itselfto oversight by the PSC under a so-called "PerformanceAssurance Plan" (PAP). See In re New York TelephoneCo., 197 P. U. R. 4th 266, 280-281 (N. Y. PSC, 1999) (OrderAdopting the Amended PAP). The PAP, which by its termsbecame binding upon FCC approval, provides specific financial penalties in the event of Verizon's failure to achieve detailed performance requirements. The FCC described Verizon's having entered into a PAP as a significant factor in its$ 271 authorization, because that provided "a strong financialincentive for post-entry compliance with the section 271checklist," and prevented " `backsliding.' " In re Application 3958-3959, |||| 8, 12.The regulatory response to the OSS failure complained ofin respondent's suit provides a vivid example of how the regulatory regime operates. When several competitive LECscomplained about deficiencies in Verizon's servicing of orders, the FCC and PSC responded. The FCC soon concluded that Verizon was in breach of its sharing duties under$ 251(c), imposed a substantial fine, and set up sophisticatedmeasurements to gauge remediation, with weekly reportingrequirements and specific penalties for failure. The PSCfound Verizon in violation of the PAP even earlier, and imposed additional financial penalties and measurements withdaily reporting requirements. In short, the regime was aneffective steward of the antitrust function.540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN414 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v. LAW OFFICESOF CURTIS V. TRINKO, LLPOpinion of the CourtAgainst the slight benefits of antitrust intervention here,we must weigh a realistic assessment of its costs. Underthe best of circumstances, applying the requirements of $ 2"can be difficult" because "the means of illicit exclusion, likethe means of legitimate competition, are myriad." UnitedStates v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F. 3d 34, 58 (CADC 2001) (enbanc) (per curiam). Mistaken inferences and the resultingfalse condemnations "are especially costly, because they chillthe very conduct the antitrust laws are designed to protect."Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475U. S. 574, 594 (1986). The cost of false positives counselsagainst an undue expansion of $ 2 liability. One falsepositive risk is that an incumbent LEC's failure to provide aservice with sufficient alacrity might have nothing to do withexclusion. Allegations of violations of $ 251(c)(3) duties aredifficult for antitrust courts to evaluate, not only becausethey are highly technical, but also because they are likely tobe extremely numerous, given the incessant, complex, andconstantly changing interaction of competitive and incumbent LECs implementing the sharing and interconnectionobligations. Amici States have filed a brief asserting thatcompetitive LECs are threatened with "death by a thousandcuts," Brief for New York et al. as Amici Curiae 10 (internalquotation marks omitted)--the identification of which wouldsurely be a daunting task for a generalist antitrust court.Judicial oversight under the Sherman Act would seem destined to distort investment and lead to a new layer of interminable litigation, atop the variety of litigation routesalready available to and actively pursued by competitiveLECs.Even if the problem of false positives did not exist, conductconsisting of anticompetitive violations of $ 251 may be, aswe have concluded with respect to above-cost predatorypricing schemes, "beyond the practical ability of a judicialtribunal to control."

S. 398 (2004)Opinion of the Courtremediation of violations of regulatory sharing requirementswill ordinarily require continuing supervision of a highly detailed decree. We think that Professor Areeda got it ex-actly right: "No court should impose a duty to deal that itcannot explain or adequately and reasonably supervise. Theproblem should be deemed irremedia[ble] by antitrust lawwhen compulsory access requires the court to assume theday-to-day controls characteristic of a regulatory agency."Areeda, 58 Antitrust L. J., at 853. In this case, respondenthas requested an equitable decree to "[p]reliminarily andpermanently enjoi[n] [Verizon] from providing access to thelocal loop market . . . to [rivals] on terms and conditions thatare not as favorable" as those that Verizon enjoys. App.49-50. An antitrust court is unlikely to be an effective dayto-day enforcer of these detailed sharing obligations.4* * *The 1996 Act is, in an important respect, much more ambi-tious than the antitrust laws. It attempts "to eliminate themonopolies enjoyed by the inheritors of AT&T's local fran-chises." Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 U. S.,at 476 (emphasis added). Section 2 of the Sherman Act, bycontrast, seeks merely to preventunlawful monopolization.It would be a serious mistake to conflate the two goals. TheSherman Act is indeed the "Magna Carta of free enterprise,"United States v. Topco Associates, Inc., 405 U. S. 596, 610(1972), but it does not give judges carte blanche to insist thata monopolist alter its way of doing business whenever some4 The Court of Appeals also thought that respondent's complaint mightstate a claim under a "monopoly leveraging" theory (a theory barely discussed by respondent, see Brief for Respondent 24, n. 10). We disagree.To the extent the Court of Appeals dispensed with a requirement thatthere be a "dangerous probability of success" in monopolizing a secondmarket, it erred, Spectrum Sports, Inc. v. McQuillan, 506 U. S. 447, 459(1993). In any event, leveraging presupposes anticompetitive conduct,which in this case could only be the refusal-to-deal claim we have rejected.540US2 Unit: $U11 [11-07-05 13:02:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN416 VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. v.
