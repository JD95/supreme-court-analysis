Section 2244(d)(2) of Title 28 U. S. C. (1994 ed., Supp. IV)provides that "[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral reviewwith respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pendingshall not be counted toward any period of limitation underthis subsection." This case presents the question whetheran application for state postconviction relief containingclaims that are procedurally barred is "properly filed" withinthe meaning of this provision.IAfter a 1984 jury trial in the Supreme Court of New York,Queens County, respondent was convicted of attempted mur531US1 Unit: $$U2 [03-28-01 16:53:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN6 ARTUZ v. BENNETTOpinion of the Courtder, criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment,criminal possession of stolen property, and unauthorized useof a motor vehicle. The Appellate Division affirmed, and theNew York Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal. Afterunsuccessfully pursuing state postconviction relief in 1991,respondent in 1995 moved pro se to vacate his judgment ofconviction. On November 30, 1995, the state trial court denied the motion in an oral decision on the record; no reasonswere given. Respondent claims never to have received acopy of a written order reflecting the denial, despite severalwritten requests.In February 1998, respondent filed a petition for writ ofhabeas corpus in the United States District Court for theEastern District of New York, alleging, inter alia, that thestate trial court's refusal to allow a defense witness to testifydeprived him of his right to a fair trial and his right to present witnesses in his own defense, that his absence from apretrial hearing violated due process, and that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to object to allegedly improper remarks made by the prosecutor in summation. The District Court summarily dismissed the petitionas untimely, noting that it had been filed more than one yearand nine months after the effective date of the Antiterrorismand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110Stat. 1214.The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuitreversed and remanded. 199 F. 3d 116 (1999). The panelfirst concluded that 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2) (1994 ed., Supp.IV), which tolls AEDPA's 1-year period of limitation on habeas corpus applications by state prisoners, should also tollthe 1-year grace period (commencing on AEDPA's effectivedate of April 24, 1996), which the Second Circuit has allowedfor the filing of habeas corpus applications challenging preAEDPA convictions. See Ross v. Artuz, 150 F. 3d 97, 98(CA2 1998). The panel assumed, for purposes of the appeal,531US1 Unit: $$U2 [03-28-01 16:53:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN7Cite as: 531 U. S. 4 (2000)Opinion of the Courtthat respondent had not yet received a written order deny-ing his 1995 motion to vacate the conviction. Since respondent could not appeal the denial absent such written order;and since, in the panel's view, "a state-court petition is `pending' from the time it is first filed until finally disposed of andfurther appellate review is unavailable under the particularstate's procedures," 199 F. 3d, at 120; the panel concludedthat respondent's 1995 motion was still "pending" for purposes of $ 2244(d)(2). Finally (and this is the sole point onwhich we granted certiorari), the panel held that respondent's 1995 motion was "properly filed" within the meaning of$ 2244(d)(2) because it complied with those rules "governing"whether "an application for state post-conviction relief [is]recognized as such" under state law.Id., at 123. It re-jected petitioner's contention that the application was notproperly filed because the claims it contained were subjectto two procedural bars under New York law: a bar againstraising an issue that had been "previously determined onthe merits upon an appeal from the judgment," N. Y. Crim.Proc. Law $ 440.10(2)(a) (McKinney 1994), and a bar againstraising a claim that was available on direct appeal but wasnot raised because of the defendant's "unjustifiable failure,"$ 440.10(2)(c).1 199 F. 3d, at 123. We granted certiorari.529 U. S. 1065 (2000).1 The cited provisions read in full as follows:"Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision one [which sets forth various grounds upon which a court may vacate its earlier judgment], thecourt must deny a motion to vacate a judgment when:"(a) The ground or issue raised upon the motion was previously determined on the merits upon an appeal from the judgment, unless since thetime of such appellate determination there has been a retroactively effective change in the law controlling such issue; or. . . . ."(c) Although sufficient facts appear on the record of the proceedingsunderlying the judgment to have permitted, upon appeal from such judgment, adequate review of the ground or issue raised upon the motion, no531US1 Unit: $$U2 [03-28-01 16:53:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN8 ARTUZ v.

Wedisagree.An application is "filed," as that term is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appro-priate court officer for placement into the official record.See, e. g., United States v. Lombardo, 241 U. S. 73, 76 (1916)("A paper is filed when it is delivered to the proper officialand by him received and filed"); Black's Law Dictionary 642(7th ed. 1999) (defining "file" as "[t]o deliver a legal documentto the court clerk or record custodian for placement into theofficial record"). And an application is "properly filed" whenits delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings. These usually pre-scribe, for example, the form of the document, the time limitsupon its delivery,2 the court and office in which it must belodged, and the requisite filing fee. See,e. g., Habteselassiev. Novak, 209 F. 3d 1208, 1210-1211 (CA10 2000); 199 F. 3d,at 121 (case below);Villegas v. Johnson, 184 F. 3d 467, 469-470 (CA5 1999); Lovasz v. Vaughn, 134 F. 3d 146, 148 (CA31998). In some jurisdictions the filing requirements alsoinclude, for example, preconditions imposed on particularabusive filers, cf. Martin v. District of Columbia Court ofsuch appellate review or determination occurred owing to the defendant'sunjustifiable failure to take or perfect an appeal during the prescribedperiod or to his unjustifiable failure to raise such ground or issue uponan appeal actually perfected by him; . . . ." N. Y. Crim. Proc. Law$$ 440.10(2)(a) and (c) (McKinney 1994).2 We express no view on the question whether the existence of certainexceptions to a timely filing requirement can prevent a late applicationfrom being considered improperly filed. See, e. g., Smith v. Ward, 209F. 3d 383, 385 (CA5 2000).531US1 Unit: $$U2 [03-28-01 16:53:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN9Cite as: 531 U. S. 4 (2000)Opinion of the CourtAppeals, 506 U. S. 1 (1992) (per curiam), or on all filersgenerally, cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2253(c) (1994 ed., Supp. IV) (conditioning the taking of an appeal on the issuance of a "certifi-cate of appealability"). But in common usage, the questionwhether an application has been "properly filed" is quite sep-arate from the question whether the claimscontained in theapplication are meritorious and free of procedural bar.Petitioner contends that such an interpretation of the stat-utory phrase renders the word "properly," and possibly bothwords ("properly filed"), surplusage, since if the provisionomitted those words, and tolled simply for "[t]he time duringwhich a[n] . . . application for State post-conviction [relief] ispending," it would necessarily condition tolling on compliance with filing requirements of the sort described above.That is not so. If, for example, an application is erroneouslyaccepted by the clerk of a court lacking jurisdiction, or iserroneously accepted without the requisite filing fee, it willbe pending, but not properly filed.Petitioner's interpretation is flawed for a more fundamental reason. By construing "properly filed application" tomean "application raising claims that are not mandatorilyprocedurally barred," petitioner elides the difference between an "application" and a "claim." Only individualclaims, and not the application containing those claims, canbe procedurally defaulted under state law pursuant to ourholdings in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), andWainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), which establish thesort of procedural bar on which petitioner relies. Compare$ 2244(b)(1) ("A claim presented in a second or successivehabeas corpus application under section 2254 that was presented in a prior application shall be dismissed") with$ 2244(b)(3)(A) ("Before a second or successive applicationpermitted by this section is filed in the district court, theapplicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals foran order authorizing the district court to consider the application" (emphases added)). See also O'Sullivan v. Boerckel,531US1 Unit: $$U2 [03-28-01 16:53:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN10 ARTUZ v. BENNETTOpinion of the Court526 U. S. 838, 839-840 (1999) ("In this case, we are asked todecide whether a state prisoner must present his claims toa state supreme court in a petition for discretionary reviewin order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement" (emphasesadded)). Ignoring this distinction would require judges toengage in verbal gymnastics when an application containssome claims that are procedurally barred and some that arenot. Presumably a court would have to say that the application is "properly filed" as to the nonbarred claims, and not"properly filed"as to the rest. The statute, however, refersonly to "properly filed" applications and does not contain thepeculiar suggestion that a single application can be both"properly filed" and not "properly filed." Ordinary Englishwould refer to certain claims as having been properly pre-sented or raised, irrespective of whether the application containing those claims was properly filed.Petitioner's remaining arguments are beside the point.He argues, for example, that tolling for applications thatraise procedurally barred claims does nothing to enable theexhaustion of available state remedies--which is the objectof $ 2244(d)(2). Respondent counters that petitioner's viewwould trigger a flood of protective filings in federal courts,absorbing their resources in threshold interpretations ofstate procedural rules. Whatever merits these and otherpolicy arguments may have, it is not the province of thisCourt to rewrite the statute to accommodate them. Wehold as we do because respondent's view seems to us theonly permissible interpretation of the text--which may, forall we know, have slighted policy concerns on one or theother side of the issue as part of the legislative compromisethat enabled the law to be enacted.IIIThe state procedural bars at issue in this case--N. Y.Crim. Proc. Law $$ 440.10(2)(a) and (c) (McKinney 1994)--simply prescribe a rule of decision for a court confronted531US1 Unit: $$U2 [03-28-01 16:53:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN11Cite as: 531 U. S. 4 (2000)Opinion of the Courtwith claims that were "previously determined on the meritsupon an appeal from the judgment" of conviction or thatcould have been raised on direct appeal but were not: "[T]hecourt must deny" such claims for relief. Neither provisionpurports to set forth a condition to filing, as opposed to acondition to obtaining relief. Motions to vacate that violatethese provisions will not be successful, but they have beenproperly delivered and accepted so long as the filing conditions have been met. Consequently, the alleged failure ofrespondent's application to comply with $$ 440.10(2)(a) and(c) does not render it "[im]properly filed" for purposes of$ 2244(d)(2). The judgment of the Court of Appeals musttherefore be affirmed.
