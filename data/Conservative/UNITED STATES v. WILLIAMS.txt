WILLIAMSOpinion of the CourtGovernment failed to disclose to the grand jury "substantialexculpatory evidence" in its possession.IOn May 4, 1988, respondent John H. Williams, Jr., a Tulsa,Oklahoma, investor, was indicted by a federal grand jury onseven counts of "knowingly mak[ing] [a] false statement orreport . . . for the purpose of influencing . . . the action [of afederally insured financial institution]," in violation of 18U. S. C. $ 1014 (1988 ed., Supp. II). According to the indictment, between September 1984 and November 1985 Williamssupplied four Oklahoma banks with "materially false" statements that variously overstated the value of his currentassets and interest income in order to influence the banks'actions on his loan requests.Williams' misrepresentation was allegedly effectedthrough two financial statements provided to the banks, a"Market Value Balance Sheet" and a "Statement of ProjectedIncome and Expense." The former included as "currentassets" approximately $6 million in notes receivable fromthree venture capital companies. Though it contained a disclaimer that these assets were carried at cost rather than atmarket value, the Government asserted that listing them as"current assets"--i. e., assets quickly reducible to cash--wasmisleading, since Williams knew that none of the venturecapital companies could afford to satisfy the notes in theshort term. The second document--the Statement of Projected Income and Expense--allegedly misrepresented Williams' interest income, since it failed to reflect that the interest payments received on the notes of the venture capitalcompanies were funded entirely by Williams' own loans tothose companies. The Statement thus falsely implied, according to the Government, that Williams was deriving interest income from "an independent outside source."

S. 36 (1992)Opinion of the CourtShortly after arraignment, the District Court granted Wil-liams' motion for disclosure of all exculpatory portions of thegrand jury transcripts. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S.83 (1963). Upon reviewing this material, Williams demanded that the District Court dismiss the indictment, alleging that the Government had failed to fulfill its obligationunder the Tenth Circuit's prior decision inUnited States v.Page, 808 F. 2d 723, 728 (1987), to present "substantial excul-patory evidence" to the grand jury (emphasis omitted). Hiscontention was that evidence which the Government hadchosen not to present to the grand jury--in particular, Williams' general ledgers and tax returns, and Williams' testimony in his contemporaneous Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding--disclosed that, for tax purposes and otherwise, hehad regularly accounted for the "notes receivable" (and theinterest on them) in a manner consistent with the BalanceSheet and the Income Statement. This, he contended, belied an intent to mislead the banks, and thus directly negatedan essential element of the charged offense.The District Court initially denied Williams' motion, butupon reconsideration ordered the indictment dismissed without prejudice. It found, after a hearing, that the withheldevidence was "relevant to an essential element of the crimecharged," created " `a reasonable doubt about [respondent's]guilt,' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a-24a (quoting United Statesv. Gray, 502 F. Supp. 150, 152 (DC 1980)), and thus "render[ed] the grand jury's decision to indict gravely suspect,"App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a. Upon the Government's appeal,the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's order, following its earlier decision in Page, supra. It first sustainedas not "clearly erroneous" the District Court's determinationthat the Government had withheld "substantial exculpatoryevidence" from the grand jury. See 899 F. 2d 898, 900-903(CA10 1990). It then found that the Government's behavior" `substantially influence[d]' " the grand jury's decision to indict, or at the very least raised a " `grave doubt that the504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT40 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtdecision to indict was free from such substantial influence.' "Id., at 903 (quoting Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,487 U. S. 250, 263 (1988)); see 899 F. 2d, at 903-904. Underthese circumstances, the Tenth Circuit concluded, it was notan abuse of discretion for the District Court to require theGovernment to begin anew before the grand jury.1 Wegranted certiorari. 502 U. S. 905 (1991).IIBefore proceeding to the merits of this matter, it is neces-sary to discuss the propriety of reaching them. Certiorariwas sought and granted in this case on the following ques-tion: "Whether an indictment may be dismissed because thegovernment failed to present exculpatory evidence to thegrand jury." The first point discussed in respondent's briefopposing the petition was captioned "The `Question Pre-sented' in the Petition Was Never Raised Below." Brief inOpposition 3. In granting certiorari, we necessarily consid-ered and rejected that contention as a basis for denyingreview.Justice Stevens' dissent, however, revisits that issue,and proposes that--after briefing, argument, and full consideration of the issue by all the Justices of this Court--wenow decline to entertain this petition for the same reason weoriginally rejected, and that we dismiss it as improvidentlygranted. That would be improvident indeed. Our grant ofcertiorari was entirely in accord with our traditional prac-tice, though even if it were not it would be imprudent (sincethere is no doubt that we have jurisdiction to entertain thecase) to reverse course at this late stage. See, e. g., Ferguson v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., 352 U. S. 521, 560(1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part);Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U. S. 637, 648 (1974) (Stew1 The Tenth Circuit also rejected Williams' cross-appeal, which contended that the District Court's dismissal should have been with prejudice.See 899 F. 2d, at 904.504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT41Cite as: 504 U. S. 36 (1992)Opinion of the Courtart, J., concurring, joined by White, J.). Cf. Oklahoma Cityv. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985).Our traditional rule, as the dissent correctly notes, pre-cludes a grant of certiorari only when "the question presented was not pressed or passed upon below." Post, at 58(internal quotation marks omitted). That this rule operates(as it is phrased) in the disjunctive, permitting review of anissue not pressed so long as it has been passed upon, is illustrated by some of our more recent dispositions. As recentlyas last Term, in fact (in an opinion joined byJustice Stevens), we entertained review in circumstances far more sug-gestive of the petitioner's "sleeping on its rights" than thosewe face today. We responded as follows to the argument ofthe Solicitor General that tracks today's dissent:"The Solicitor General . . . submits that the petitionfor certiorari should be dismissed as having been improvidently granted. He rests this submission on theargument that petitioner did not properly present themerits of the timeliness issue to the Court of Appeals,and that this Court should not address that question forthe first time. He made the same argument in his oppo-sition to the petition for certiorari. We rejected thatargument in granting certiorari and we reject it againnow because the Court of Appeals, like the DistrictCourt before it, decided the substantive issue pre-sented."Stevens v. Department of Treasury, 500 U. S.1, 8 (1991) (Blackmun, J.) (citations omitted).And in another case decided last Term, we said the following:"Respondents argue that this issue was not raisedbelow. The appeals court, however, addressed theavailability of a right of action to minority shareholdersin respondents' circumstances and concluded that respondents were entitled to sue. It suffices for our pur-poses that the court below passed on the issue presented, particularly where the issue is, we believe, in a504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT42 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtstate of evolving definition and uncertainty, and one ofimportance to the administration of federal law." Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U. S. 1083, 1099,n. 8 (1991) (citations omitted; internal quotation marksomitted).(Justice Stevens' separate concurrence and dissent in Virginia Bankshares also reached the merits. Id., at 1110-1112.)2 As Justice O'Connor has written:"The standard we previously have employed is that wewill not review a question not pressed or passed on bythe courts below. Here, the Court of Appeals expresslyruled on the question, in an appropriate exercise of its2 The dissent purports to distinguish Stevens and Virginia Bankshareson the ground that, "[a]lthough the parties may not have raised the questions presented in the petitions . . . before the Courts of Appeals in thosecases, the courts treated the questions as open questions that they neededto resolve in order to decide the cases." Post, at 58, n. 4. The significance of this distinction completely eludes us. While there is much to besaid for a rule (to which the Court has never adhered) limiting review toquestions pressed by the litigants below, the rule implicitly proposed bythe dissent--under which issues not pressed, but nevertheless passedupon, may be reviewed only if the court below thought the issue an "open"one--makes no sense except as a device to distinguish Stevens and Virginia Bankshares. It does nothing to further "the adversary process"that is the object of the dissent's concern, post, at 59, n. 5; if a questionis not disputed by the parties, "the adversary process" is compromisedwhether the court thinks the question open or not. Indeed, if anything,it is compromised more when the lower court believes it is confronting aquestion of first impression, for it is in those circumstances that the needfor an adversary presentation is most acute.The dissent observes that where a court disposes of a case on the basisof a "new rule that had not been debated by the parties, our review maybe appropriate to give the losing party an opportunity it would not otherwise have to challenge the rule." Ibid. That is true enough, but thesuggestion that this principle has something to do with Stevens and Virginia Bankshares is wholly unfounded: In neither case could--or did--thelosing party claim to have been ambushed by the lower court's summarytreatment of the undisputed issues which we later subjected to plenaryreview.504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT43Cite as: 504 U.

Springfieldv. Kibbe, 480 U. S. 257, 266 (1987) (dissenting opinion)(emphasis in original; citations omitted).3There is no doubt in the present case that the Tenth Cir-cuit decided the crucial issue of the prosecutor's duty to present exculpatory evidence.4 Moreover, this is not, as the dis-sent paints it, a case in which, "[a]fter losing in the Court ofAppeals, the Government reversed its position," post, at 57.3 The Court's per curiam dismissal of the writ in Kibbe was based principally upon two considerations: (1) that the crucial issue was not raised inthe District Court because of failure to object to a jury instruction, thusinvoking Rule 51 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which providesthat "[n]o party may assign as error the giving . . . [of] an instructionunless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,"and (2) that the crucial issue had in addition not explicitly been raisedin the petition for certiorari. 480 U. S., at 259, 260. Of course, neithercircumstance exists here.4 Relying upon, and to some extent repeating, the reasoning of its earlierholding in United States v. Page, 808 F. 2d 723 (1981), the Court of Appealssaid the following:"We have previously held that a prosecutor has the duty to presentsubstantial exculpatory evidence to the grand jury. Although we do notrequire the prosecutor to `ferret out and present every bit of potentiallyexculpatory evidence,' we do require that substantial exculpatory evidencediscovered during the course of an investigation be revealed to the grandjury. Other courts have also recognized that such a duty exists. Thisrequirement promotes judicial economy because `if a fully informed grandjury cannot find probable cause to indict, there is little chance the prosecution could have proved guilt beyond a reasonable doubt to a fully informedpetit jury.' " 899 F. 2d 898, 900 (1990) (citations omitted).This excerpt from the opinion below should make abundantly clear that,contrary to the dissent's mystifying assertion, see post, at 58, and n. 3, wepremise our grant of certiorari not upon the Tenth Circuit's having "passedon" the issue in its prior Page decision, but rather upon its having doneso in this case. We discuss Page only to point out that, had the Government not disputed the creation of the binding Tenth Circuit precedent inthat case, a different exercise of discretion might be appropriate.504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT44 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the CourtThe dissent describes the Government as having "expresslyacknowledged [in the Court of Appeals] the responsibilitiesdescribed in Page," post, at 56 (emphasis added). It did nosuch thing. Rather, the Government acknowledged "thatit has certain responsibilities under . . . Page." Brief forUnited States in Response to Appellee's Brief in Nos. 88-2827, 88-2843 (CA10), p. 9 (emphasis added). It conceded,in other words, not that the responsibilitiesPage had im-posed were proper, but merely that Page had imposedthem--over the protests of the Government, but in a judg-ment that was nonetheless binding precedent for the panelbelow. The dissent would apparently impose, as an absolutecondition to our granting certiorari upon an issue decided bya lower court, that a party demand overruling of a squarelyapplicable, recent circuit precedent, even though that precedent was established in a case to which the party itself wasprivy and over the party's vigorous objection, seePage, 808F. 2d, at 727 ("The government counters that a prosecutorhas no duty to disclose exculpatory evidence [to a grandjury]"), and even though no "intervening developments inthe law," post, at 59, n. 5, had occurred. That seems to usunreasonable.In short, having reconsidered the precise question we re-solved when this petition for review was granted, we againanswer it the same way. It is a permissible exercise of ourdiscretion to undertake review of an important issue expressly decided by a federal court 5 where, although the peti5 Where certiorari is sought to a state court, "due regard for the appropriate relationship of this Court to state courts," McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430, 434-435 (1940), may suggestgreater restraint in applying our "pressed or passed upon" rule. In thatcontext, the absence of challenge to a seemingly settled federal rule deprives the state court of an opportunity to rest its decision on an adequateand independent state ground. See Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 222(1983), cited by the dissent post, at 59; see also Bankers Life & CasualtyCo. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S. 71, 79-80 (1988). But cf. Cohen v.

Undoubtedly the United States benefits fromthis rule more often than other parties; but that is inevitablytrue of most desirable rules of procedure or jurisdiction thatwe announce, the United States being the most frequent litigant in our courts. Since we announce the rule to be appli-cable to all parties; since we have recently applied a similarrule (indeed, a rule even more broadly cast) to the disadvantage of the United States, see Stevens v. Department ofTreasury, 500 U. S. 1 (1991); and since the dissenters them-selves have approved the application of this rule (or abroader one) in circumstances rationally indistinguishablefrom those before us, see n. 2, supra; the dissent's suggestionthat in deciding this case "the Court appears to favor theGovernment over the ordinary litigant," post, at 59, andcompromises its "obligation to administer justice impar-tially,"ibid., needs no response.IIIRespondent does not contend that the Fifth Amendmentitself obliges the prosecutor to disclose substantial exculpatory evidence in his possession to the grand jury. Instead,building on our statement that the federal courts "may,within limits, formulate procedural rules not specifically re-quired by the Constitution or the Congress,"United Statesv.Hasting, 461 U. S. 499, 505 (1983), he argues that imposi-tion of the Tenth Circuit's disclosure rule is supported by thecourts' "supervisory power." We think not. Hasting, andthe cases that rely upon the principle it expresses, dealstrictly with the courts' power to control their own proce-dures. See, e. g., Jencks v. United States, 353 U. S. 657, 667-diction whether a party raised below and argued a federal-law issue thatthe state supreme court actually considered and decided").504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT46 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Court668 (1957); McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943).That power has been applied not only to improve the truthfinding process of the trial, see, e. g., Mesarosh v. UnitedStates, 352 U. S. 1, 9-14 (1956), but also to prevent partiesfrom reaping benefit or incurring harm from violations ofsubstantive or procedural rules (imposed by the Constitutionor laws) governing matters apart from the trial itself, see,e. g., Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914). Thus,Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States, 487 U. S. 250 (1988),makes clear that the supervisory power can be used to dis-miss an indictment because of misconduct before the grandjury, at least where that misconduct amounts to a violationof one of those "few, clear rules which were carefully draftedand approved by this Court and by Congress to ensure theintegrity of the grand jury's functions,"United States v.Mechanik, 475 U. S. 66, 74 (1986) (O'Connor, J., concurringin judgment).6We did not hold in Bank of Nova Scotia, however, that thecourts' supervisory power could be used, not merely as ameans of enforcing or vindicating legally compelled stand6 Rule 6 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure contains a numberof such rules, providing, for example, that "no person other than the jurorsmay be present while the grand jury is deliberating or voting," Rule 6(d),and placing strict controls on disclosure of "matters occurring before thegrand jury," Rule 6(e); see generally United States v. Sells Engineering,Inc., 463 U. S. 418 (1983). Additional standards of behavior for prosecutors (and others) are set forth in the United States Code. See 18 U. S. C.$$ 6002, 6003 (setting forth procedures for granting a witness immunityfrom prosecution); $ 1623 (criminalizing false declarations before grandjury); $ 2515 (prohibiting grand jury use of unlawfully intercepted wire ororal communications); $ 1622 (criminalizing subornation of perjury). Thatsome of the misconduct alleged in Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,487 U. S. 250 (1988), was not specifically proscribed by Rule, statute, orthe Constitution does not make the case stand for a judicially prescribablegrand jury code, as the dissent suggests, see post, at 64-65. All of theallegations of violation were dismissed by the Court--without consideringtheir validity in law--for failure to meet Nova Scotia's dismissal standard.See Bank of Nova Scotia, supra, at 261.504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT47Cite as: 504 U.

It is this latter exercise that respondentdemands. Because the grand jury is an institution separatefrom the courts, over whose functioning the courts do notpreside, we think it clear that, as a general matter at least,no such "supervisory" judicial authority exists, and that thedisclosure rule applied here exceeded the Tenth Circuit'sauthority.A"[R]ooted in long centuries of Anglo-American history,"Hannah v. Larche, 363 U. S. 420, 490 (1960) (Frankfurter, J.,concurring in result), the grand jury is mentioned in the Billof Rights, but not in the body of the Constitution. It hasnot been textually assigned, therefore, to any of the branchesdescribed in the first three Articles. It " `is a constitutionalfixture in its own right.' " United States v. Chanen, 549F. 2d 1306, 1312 (CA9) (quoting Nixon v. Sirica, 159 U. S.App. D. C. 58, 70, n. 54, 487 F. 2d 700, 712, n. 54 (1973)), cert.denied, 434 U. S. 825 (1977). In fact the whole theory of itsfunction is that it belongs to no branch of the institutionalGovernment, serving as a kind of buffer or referee betweenthe Government and the people. See Stirone v. UnitedStates, 361 U. S. 212, 218 (1960); Hale v. Henkel, 201 U. S. 43,61 (1906); G. Edwards, The Grand Jury 28-32 (1906). Although the grand jury normally operates, of course, in thecourthouse and under judicial auspices, its institutional relationship with the Judicial Branch has traditionally been, soto speak, at arm's length. Judges' direct involvement in thefunctioning of the grand jury has generally been confined tothe constitutive one of calling the grand jurors together andadministering their oaths of office. See United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 343 (1974); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 6(a).504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT48 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the CourtThe grand jury's functional independence from the JudicialBranch is evident both in the scope of its power to investigate criminal wrongdoing and in the manner in which thatpower is exercised. "Unlike [a] [c]ourt, whose jurisdiction ispredicated upon a specific case or controversy, the grand jury`can investigate merely on suspicion that the law is beingviolated, or even because it wants assurance that it is not.' "United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U. S. 292, 297(1991) (quotingUnited States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U. S.632, 642-643 (1950)). It need not identify the offender itsuspects, or even "the precise nature of the offense" it isinvestigating. Blair v. United States, 250 U. S. 273, 282(1919). The grand jury requires no authorization from itsconstituting court to initiate an investigation, see Hale,supra, at 59-60, 65, nor does the prosecutor require leave ofcourt to seek a grand jury indictment. And in its day-today functioning, the grand jury generally operates withoutthe interference of a presiding judge. See Calandra, supra,at 343. It swears in its own witnesses, Fed. Rule Crim.Proc. 6(c), and deliberates in total secrecy, see United Statesv. Sells Engineering, Inc., 463 U. S. 418, 424-425 (1983).True, the grand jury cannot compel the appearance ofwitnesses and the production of evidence, and must appealto the court when such compulsion is required. See, e. g.,Brown v. United States, 359 U. S. 41, 49 (1959). And thecourt will refuse to lend its assistance when the compulsionthe grand jury seeks would override rights accorded by theConstitution, see, e. g., Gravel v. United States, 408 U. S. 606(1972) (grand jury subpoena effectively qualified by orderlimiting questioning so as to preserve Speech or DebateClause immunity), or even testimonial privileges recognizedby the common law, see In re Grand Jury Investigation ofHugle, 754 F. 2d 863 (CA9 1985) (opinion of Kennedy, J.)(same with respect to privilege for confidential marital communications). Even in this setting, however, we have insisted that the grand jury remain "free to pursue its investi504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT49Cite as: 504 U. S. 36 (1992)Opinion of the Courtgations unhindered by external influence or supervision solong as it does not trench upon the legitimate rights of anywitness called before it." United States v. Dionisio, 410U. S. 1, 17-18 (1973). Recognizing this tradition of independence, we have said that the Fifth Amendment's "constitutional guarantee presupposes an investigative body `actingindependently of either prosecuting attorneyor judge'. . . ."Id., at 16 (emphasis added) (quoting Stirone, supra, at 218).No doubt in view of the grand jury proceeding's status asother than a constituent element of a "criminal prosecu-tio[n]," U. S. Const., Amdt. 6, we have said that certain constitutional protections afforded defendants in criminal proceedings have no application before that body. The DoubleJeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not bar agrand jury from returning an indictment when a prior grandjury has refused to do so. See Ex parte United States, 287U. S. 241, 250-251 (1932); United States v. Thompson, 251U. S. 407, 413-415 (1920). We have twice suggested, thoughnot held, that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel doesnot attach when an individual is summoned to appear beforea grand jury, even if he is the subject of the investigation.See United States v. Mandujano, 425 U. S. 564, 581 (1976)(plurality opinion); In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, 333 (1957);see also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 6(d). And although "thegrand jury may not force a witness to answer questions inviolation of [the Fifth Amendment's] constitutional guarantee" against self-incrimination, Calandra, supra, at 346 (citing Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441 (1972)), our casessuggest that an indictment obtained through the use ofevidence previously obtained in violation of the privilegeagainst self-incrimination "is nevertheless valid." Calandra, supra, at 346; see Lawn v. United States, 355 U. S. 339,348-350 (1958); United States v. Blue, 384 U. S. 251, 255,n. 3 (1966).Given the grand jury's operational separateness from itsconstituting court, it should come as no surprise that we504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT50 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courthave been reluctant to invoke the judicial supervisory poweras a basis for prescribing modes of grand jury procedure.Over the years, we have received many requests to exercisesupervision over the grand jury's evidence-taking process,but we have refused them all, including some more appealingthan the one presented today. In United States v. Calandra, supra, a grand jury witness faced questions that wereallegedly based upon physical evidence the Government hadobtained through a violation of the Fourth Amendment; werejected the proposal that the exclusionary rule be extendedto grand jury proceedings, because of "the potential injuryto the historic role and functions of the grand jury." 414U. S., at 349. In Costello v. United States, 350 U. S. 359(1956), we declined to enforce the hearsay rule in grand juryproceedings, since that "would run counter to the wholehistory of the grand jury institution, in which laymen conduct their inquiries unfettered by technical rules." Id., at364.These authorities suggest that any power federal courtsmay have to fashion, on their own initiative, rules of grandjury procedure is a very limited one, not remotely comparable to the power they maintain over their own proceedings.See United States v. Chanen, 549 F. 2d, at 1313. It certainlywould not permit judicial reshaping of the grand jury institution, substantially altering the traditional relationships between the prosecutor, the constituting court, and the grandjury itself. Cf., e. g., United States v. Payner, 447 U. S. 727,736 (1980) (supervisory power may not be applied to permitdefendant to invoke third party's Fourth Amendmentrights); see generally Beale, Reconsidering SupervisoryPower in Criminal Cases: Constitutional and Statutory Limits on the Authority of the Federal Courts, 84 Colum. L. Rev.1433, 1490-1494, 1522 (1984). As we proceed to discuss, thatwould be the consequence of the proposed rule here.504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT51Cite as: 504 U.

Respondent makes a generalized appeal tofunctional notions: Judicial supervision of the quantity andquality of the evidence relied upon by the grand jury plainlyfacilitates, he says, the grand jury's performance of its twinhistorical responsibilities, i. e., bringing to trial those whomay be justly accused and shielding the innocent from un-founded accusation and prosecution. See, e. g., Stirone v.United States, 361 U. S., at 218, n. 3. We do not agree. Therule would neither preserve nor enhance the traditional functioning of the institution that the Fifth Amendment de-mands. To the contrary, requiring the prosecutor to presentexculpatory as well as inculpatory evidence would alter thegrand jury's historical role, transforming it from an accusatory to an adjudicatory body.It is axiomatic that the grand jury sits not to determineguilt or innocence, but to assess whether there is adequatebasis for bringing a criminal charge. SeeUnited States v.Calandra, 414 U. S., at 343. That has always been so; andto make the assessment it has always been thought sufficientto hear only the prosecutor's side. As Blackstone describedthe prevailing practice in 18th-century England, the grandjury was "only to hear evidence on behalf of the prosecu-tion[,] for the finding of an indictment is only in the natureof an enquiry or accusation, which is afterwards to be triedand determined." 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 300(1769); see also 2 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 157 (1st Am.ed. 1847). So also in the United States. According to thedescription of an early American court, three years beforethe Fifth Amendment was ratified, it is the grand jury's function not "to enquire . . . upon what foundation [the charge504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT52 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Courtmay be] denied," or otherwise to try the suspect's defenses,but only to examine "upon what foundation [the charge] ismade" by the prosecutor. Respublica v. Shaffer, 1 Dall. 236(O. T. Phila. 1788); see also F. Wharton, Criminal Pleadingand Practice $ 360, pp. 248-249 (8th ed. 1880). As a consequence, neither in this country nor in England has the suspect under investigation by the grand jury ever been thoughtto have a right to testify or to have exculpatory evidencepresented. See 2 Hale, supra, at 157; United States ex rel.McCann v. Thompson, 144 F. 2d 604, 605-606 (CA2), cert.denied, 323 U. S. 790 (1944).Imposing upon the prosecutor a legal obligation to presentexculpatory evidence in his possession would be incompatiblewith this system. If a "balanced" assessment of the entirematter is the objective, surely the first thing to be done--rather than requiring the prosecutor to say what he knowsin defense of the target of the investigation--is to entitle thetarget to tender his own defense. To require the formerwhile denying (as we do) the latter would be quite absurd.It would also be quite pointless, since it would merely invitethe target to circumnavigate the system by delivering hisexculpatory evidence to the prosecutor, whereupon it wouldhave to be passed on to the grand jury--unless the prosecutor is willing to take the chance that a court will not deemthe evidence important enough to qualify for mandatory disclosure.7 See, e. g., United States v. Law Firm of Zimmerman & Schwartz, P. C., 738 F. Supp. 407, 411 (Colo. 1990)(duty to disclose exculpatory evidence held satisfied when7 How much of a gamble that is is illustrated by the Court of Appeals'opinion in the present case. Though the court purported to be applyingthe "substantial exculpatory" standard set forth in its prior Page decision,see 899 F. 2d, at 900, portions of the opinion recite a much more inclusivestandard. See id., at 902 ("[T]he grand jury must receive any informationthat is relevant to any reasonable [exculpatory] theory it may adopt"); ibid.("We conclude, therefore, that the district court was not clearly in errorwhen it found that the deposition testimony was exculpatory").504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT53Cite as: 504 U.

Brown, 943 F. 2d 1246, 1257(CA10 1991).Respondent acknowledges (as he must) that the "commonlaw" of the grand jury is not violated if the grand jury itselfchooses to hear no more evidence than that which suffices toconvince it an indictment is proper. Cf. Thompson, supra,at 607. Thus, had the Government offered to familiarize thegrand jury in this case with the five boxes of financial state-ments and deposition testimony alleged to contain exculpatory information, and had the grand jury rejected the offeras pointless, respondent would presumably agree that theresulting indictment would have been valid. Respondentinsists, however, that courts must require the modern prosecutor to alert the grand jury to the nature and extent of theavailable exculpatory evidence, because otherwise the grandjury "merely functions as an arm of the prosecution." Brieffor Respondent 27. We reject the attempt to convert a nonexistent duty of the grand jury itself into an obligation ofthe prosecutor. The authority of the prosecutor to seek anindictment has long been understood to be "coterminous withthe authority of the grand jury to entertain [the prosecutor's]charges." United States v. Thompson, 251 U. S., at 414. Ifthe grand jury has no obligation to consider all "substantialexculpatory" evidence, we do not understand how the prosecutor can be said to have a binding obligation to present it.There is yet another respect in which respondent's proposal not only fails to comport with, but positively contradicts, the "common law" of the Fifth Amendment grand jury.Motions to quash indictments based upon the sufficiency ofthe evidence relied upon by the grand jury were unheard ofat common law in England, see, e. g., People v. Restenblatt,1 Abb. Pr. 268, 269 (Ct. Gen. Sess. N. Y. 1855). And thetraditional American practice was described by Justice Nelson, riding circuit in 1852, as follows:504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT54 UNITED STATES v. WILLIAMSOpinion of the Court"No case has been cited, nor have we been able to findany, furnishing an authority for looking into and revisingthe judgment of the grand jury upon the evidence, forthe purpose of determining whether or not the findingwas founded upon sufficient proof, or whether there wasa deficiency in respect to any part of the complaint . . . ."United States v. Reed, 27 F. Cas. 727, 738 (No. 16,134)(CC NDNY 1852).We accepted Justice Nelson's description in Costello v.United States, where we held that "[i]t would run counterto the whole history of the grand jury institution" to permitan indictment to be challenged "on the ground that therewas inadequate or incompetent evidence before the grandjury." 350 U. S., at 363-364. And we reaffirmed this prin-ciple recently in Bank of Nova Scotia, where we held that"the mere fact that evidence itself is unreliable is not suffi-cient to require a dismissal of the indictment," and that "achallenge to the reliability or competence of the evidencepresented to the grand jury" will not be heard. 487 U. S.,at 261. It would make little sense, we think, to abstain fromreviewing the evidentiary support for the grand jury's judgment while scrutinizing the sufficiency of the prosecutor'spresentation. A complaint about the quality or adequacy ofthe evidence can always be recast as a complaint that theprosecutor's presentation was "incomplete" or "misleading."8Our words in Costello bear repeating: Review of facially8 In Costello, for example, instead of complaining about the grand jury'sreliance upon hearsay evidence the petitioner could have complainedabout the prosecutor's introduction of it. See, e. g., United States v. Estepa, 471 F. 2d 1132, 1136-1137 (CA2 1972) (prosecutor should not introduce hearsay evidence before grand jury when direct evidence is available); see also Arenella, Reforming the Federal Grand Jury and the StatePreliminary Hearing to Prevent Conviction Without Adjudication, 78Mich. L. Rev. 463, 540 (1980) ("[S]ome federal courts have cautiously begunto . . . us[e] a revitalized prosecutorial misconduct doctrine to circumventCostello's prohibition against directly evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence presented to the grand jury").504us1$68I 04-04-96 20:08:25 PAGES OPINPGT55Cite as: 504 U.

S.,at 364.* * *Echoing the reasoning of the Tenth Circuit in UnitedStates v. Page, 808 F. 2d, at 728, respondent argues that arule requiring the prosecutor to disclose exculpatory evidence to the grand jury would, by removing from the docketunjustified prosecutions, save valuable judicial time. Thatdepends, we suppose, upon what the ratio would turn out tobe between unjustified prosecutions eliminated and grandjury indictments challenged--for the latter as well as theformer consume "valuable judicial time." We need notpursue the matter; if there is an advantage to the proposal,Congress is free to prescribe it. For the reasons set forthabove, however, we conclude that courts have no authority toprescribe such a duty pursuant to their inherent supervisoryauthority over their own proceedings. The judgment of theCourt of Appeals is accordingly reversed, and the causeis remanded for further proceedings consistent with thisopinion.
