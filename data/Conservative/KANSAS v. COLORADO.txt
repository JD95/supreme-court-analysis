This original action involves a dispute between Kansas,Colorado, and the United States over alleged violations ofthe Arkansas River Compact. The Special Master has fileda report (Report) detailing his findings and recommendations concerning the liability phase of the trial. Both Kan-sas and Colorado have filed exceptions to those findings andrecommendations. We agree with the Special Master's dis-position of the liability issues. Accordingly, we overrule theparties' exceptions. IThe Continental Divide in the United States begins at theCanadian border in the mountains of northwestern Montana.From there, it angles southeast through Montana and Wyo-ming until it enters Colorado. It then runs roughly duesouth through Colorado, following first the crest of the FrontRange of the Rocky Mountains, and then shifting slightlywest to follow the crest of the Sawatch Range. The Arkan-sas River rises on the east side of the Continental Divide,*Joseph B. Meyer, Attorney General of Wyoming, Donald M. Gerstein,Assistant Attorney General, and Dennis C. Cook, Special Assistant Attorney General, filed a brief for the State of Wyoming as amicus curiae.514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:32 PAGES OPINPGT676 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtbetween Climax and Leadville, Colorado. Thence it flowssouth and east through Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas, emptying into the Mississippi River, which in turnflows into the Gulf of Mexico. As if to prove that the ridgethat separates them is indeed the Continental Divide, a shortdistance away from the source of the Arkansas, the ColoradoRiver rises and thence flows southwest through Colorado,Utah, and Arizona, and finally empties into the Gulf ofBaja, California.The Arkansas River flows at a steep gradient from itssource south to Canon City, Colorado, whence it turns eastand enters the Royal Gorge. As it flows through the RoyalGorge, the Arkansas River is at some points half a milebelow the summit of the bordering cliffs. The ArkansasRiver thence descends gradually through the high plains ofeastern Colorado and western Kansas; its elevation at theColorado-Kansas border is 3,350 feet. It then makes itsgreat bend northward through Kansas, and from there flowssoutheasterly through northeastern Oklahoma and acrossArkansas. The Arkansas River covers about 1,450 milesfrom its source in the Colorado Rockies to the point in southeastern Arkansas where it flows into the Mississippi River.It is the fourth longest river in the United States, and itdrains in an area of 185,000 square miles.The first Europeans to see the Arkansas River were members of the expedition of Francisco Coronado, in the courseof their search for the fabled Seven Golden Cities of Cibola.In 1541, they crossed the Arkansas River near what is nowthe Colorado-Kansas border. One year later, those in theexpedition of Hernando DeSoto would see the ArkansasRiver 1,000 miles downstream at its mouth. The westernborders of the Louisiana Purchase, acquired from France in1803, included within them most, if not all, of the ArkansasRiver drainage basin. Zebulon Pike, in his expedition of1805-1806, in the course of which he sighted the mountainpeak named after him, traveled up the Arkansas River.514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:32 PAGES OPINPGT677Cite as: 514 U.

This region has been developed in Colorado by 23 major canal companies and in Kansasby 6 canal companies, which divert the surface flows of theArkansas River and distribute them to individual farmers.Report 35-38. Also relevant to this dispute, the UnitedStates has constructed three large water storage projects inthe Arkansas River basin. Id., at 43-48. The John MartinReservoir, located on the Arkansas River about 60 mileswest of the Kansas border, was authorized by Congress in1936, 49 Stat. 1570, and was completed in 1948. It is thelargest of the federal reservoirs, and initially it had a storage capacity of about 700,000 acre-feet.1 Report 45. ThePueblo Reservoir, located on the Arkansas River about 150miles west of the Kansas border, was authorized by Congressin 1962, and was substantially completed in 1975. Id., at 44.In 1977, the storage capacity of the Pueblo Reservoir wasestimated to be about 357,000 acre-feet.Ibid. Finally, theTrinidad Reservoir, located on the Purgatoire River (a majortributary of the Arkansas River) was approved by Congressin 1958, and was completed in 1977. Id., at 43. The totalcapacity of the Trinidad Reservoir is about 114,000 acre-feet. Ibid.1 An acre-foot is equivalent to 325,900 gallons of water; it represents thevolume of water necessary to cover one acre of land with one foot of water.Report xvii.514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT678 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the CourtTwice before in this century, the States of Kansas and Col-orado have litigated in this Court regarding their respectiverights to the waters of the Arkansas River. See Kansas v.Colorado, 206 U. S. 46 (1907); Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S.383 (1943). In the first suit, the Court denied Kansas' request to enjoin diversions of the Arkansas River by Coloradobecause the depletions alleged by Kansas were insufficientto warrant injunctive relief. Kansas v. Colorado, supra, at114-117. In the second suit, Colorado sought to enjoinlower court litigation brought against Colorado water users,while Kansas sought an equitable apportionment of the Arkansas River. Colorado v. Kansas, supra, at 388-389. TheCourt granted Colorado an injunction, but concluded thatKansas was not entitled to an equitable apportionment. 320U. S., at 400. The Court suggested that the States resolvetheir differences by negotiation and agreement, pursuant tothe Compact Clause of the Constitution. Id., at 392. SeeU. S. Const., Art. I, $ 10, cl. 3.In 1949, after three years of negotiations, Kansas and Colorado approved, and Congress ratified, the Arkansas RiverCompact (Compact). See 63 Stat. 145; see also Report 5-6;App. to Report 1-17 (reprinting text of Compact). ArticleVIII of the Compact creates the Arkansas River CompactAdministration (Administration) and vests it with the powerand responsibility for administering the Compact. Id., at11-15. The Administration is composed of a nonvoting presiding officer designated by the President of the UnitedStates, and three voting representatives from each State.Each State has one vote, and every decision, authorization,or other action by the Administration requires a unanimousvote. Id., at 12-13 (Article VIII-D).The Compact's primary purposes are to "[s]ettle existingdisputes and remove causes of future controversy . . . concerning the waters of the Arkansas River" and to "[e]quitably divide and apportion" the waters of the Arkansas River,"as well as the benefits arising from the construction, opera514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT679Cite as: 514 U.

Article IV-D,the provision of the Compact most relevant to this dispute,states:"This Compact is not intended to impede or preventfuture beneficial development of the Arkansas Riverbasin in Colorado and Kansas by Federal or State agen-cies, by private enterprise, or by combinations thereof,which may involve construction of dams, reservoir, andother works for the purposes of water utilization andcontrol, as well as the improved or prolonged functioning of existing works: Provided, that the waters of theArkansas River . . . shall not be materially depleted inusable quantity or availability for use to the water usersin Colorado and Kansas under this Compact by such future development or construction." Id., at 5 (emphasisadded).In 1983, Kansas conducted an independent investigation ofpossible violations of the Compact arising from the impactof increases in post-Compact well pumping in Colorado andthe operation of two of the federal reservoirs. Report 9-10.In December 1985, Kansas brought this original actionagainst the State of Colorado to resolve disputes arisingunder the Compact. Id., at 10. The Court granted Kansasleave to file its complaint, Kansas v. Colorado, 475 U. S. 1079(1986), and appointed Judge Wade H. McCree, Jr., to serveas Special Master, Kansas v. Colorado, 478 U. S. 1018 (1986).Upon Judge McCree's death, the Court appointed Arthur L.Littleworth as Special Master. Kansas v. Colorado, 484U. S. 910 (1987).Kansas advanced three principal claims, each involving analleged Compact violation. See Report 58. First, Kansasalleged that increases in groundwater well pumping in Colorado in the years following adoption of the Compact havecaused a significant decline in the Arkansas River's surface514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT680 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtflow in violation of Article IV-D of the Compact. Second,Kansas claimed that Colorado's Winter Water Storage Program (WWSP)--a program whereby the Bureau of Recla-mation of the Department of the Interior (Bureau of Reclamation) and Colorado use excess capacity at the PuebloReservoir to store a portion of the winter flow of the Arkansas River--violates the Compact. Third, Kansas claimedthat Colorado's failure to abide by the Trinidad ReservoirOperating Principles (Operating Principles) constituted aviolation of the Compact.Ibid.The Special Master bifurcated the trial into a liabilityphase and a remedy phase. At the conclusion of the liabilityphase, the Special Master filed his Report, outlining his findings and recommendations. In his Report, the Special Mas-ter recommended, among other things, that the Court: (1)find that post-Compact well pumping in Colorado has "mate-rially depleted" the "usable" flow at the Colorado-Kansasborder (stateline) in violation of Article IV-D of the Com-pact, Report 336; (2) find that "Kansas has failed to provethat operation of the [WWSP] program has violated the[C]ompact," ibid.; and (3) "dismiss the Kansas claim arisingfrom the operation of Trinidad Reservoir," ibid.2Both Kansas and Colorado have filed exceptions to theSpecial Master's Report. Kansas excepts to the SpecialMaster's rejection of its (1) Trinidad Reservoir claim, seeid., at 373-433; (2) WWSP claim, see id., at 306-335; and (3)preferred method for determining the usability of depletionsof stateline flows, see id., at 291-305. Colorado excepts tothe Special Master's determination that: (1) Kansas was notguilty of inexcusable delay in making its post-Compact well-pumping claim and that Colorado was not prejudiced by this2 Colorado presented two counterclaims against Kansas. The SpecialMaster recommended that the Court grant Kansas' motions to dismissthose counterclaims. Report 337. Colorado has not filed exceptions tothose recommendations. We adopt the Special Master's recommendationson Colorado's counterclaims.514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT681Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)Opinion of the Courtdelay, see id., at 147-170; (2) pre-Compact wells in Coloradoare limited to pumping the highest amount pumped in theyears during which the Compact was negotiated and that thehighest amount of such pumping was 15,000 acre-feet peryear, see id., at 182-200; (3) increases in usable state lineflows resulting from the operating plan for the John MartinReservoir adopted by the Administration in 1980 (1980 Operating Plan) were "separately bargained for" and, therefore,should not offset depletions caused by post-Compact wellpumping in Colorado, see id., at 171-181; and (4) Kansas needonly meet the "preponderance of the evidence" standard toprove a breach of Article IV-D of the Compact, see id., at65-70.We turn to the parties' exceptions.IIAIn 1958, Congress authorized construction of the TrinidadProject, a dam and a reservoir system on the PurgatoireRiver slightly upstream from the city of Trinidad, Colorado.See id., at 382-388. Recognizing that Article IV-D of theCompact prohibited any development of the Arkansas Riverbasin that resulted in a material depletion of usable riverflow, the Bureau of Reclamation conducted studies regardingthe future operation of the Trinidad Project. Id., at 388-390. The Bureau of Reclamation established OperatingPrinciples whereby the Trinidad Project could be administered "without adverse effect on downstream water usersand the inflow to John Martin Reservoir." Id., at 390 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Governor of Kansas reviewed the Bureau of Reclamation's proposed OperatingPrinciples and indicated that if five additional conditionswere accepted, then "Kansas would be in a position to approve the amended Operating Principles and to support completion of the project." Id., at 392-393. In June 1967, the514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT682 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the CourtAdministration approved the Operating Principles as well asKansas' five additional conditions.Id., at 395.In 1979, Colorado began storage of water at the TrinidadReservoir.Id., at 396. Kansas immediately complainedthat the Operating Principles were being violated. Id., at397. In 1988, at the request of the Administration, theBureau of Reclamation conducted a study of the TrinidadReservoir. It concluded that two storage practices at theTrinidad Reservoir constituted a " `departure from theintent of the operating principles.' " Ibid.At trial, Kansas argued that the Operating Principles werebinding on the State of Colorado and that any departurefrom them constituted a violation of the Compact "regardlessof injury." Id., at 408 (internal quotation marks omitted).Kansas, however, "offered no evidence, apart from theBureau studies, to show that the actual operation of theTrinidad project caused it to receive less water than underhistorical, without-project conditions." Id., at 412. Instead, Kansas sought to quantify depletions by "comparingthe flows into John Martin Reservoir `as they would haveoccurred under the Operating Principles with the flows thatoccurred under actual operations.' " Id., at 409. The Special Master concluded that in order to prove a violation ofthe Compact, Kansas was required to demonstrate that "theTrinidad operations caused a material depletion within themeaning of Article IV-D." Id., at 431. The Special Masterrecommends that we dismiss Kansas' Trinidad claim because"Kansas has not established, and did not attempt to establish, such injury." Ibid.Kansas argues that "[d]eparture from the Operating Principles is ipso facto a violation of the Compact, and it [is] entirely sufficient, for purposes of quantifying the effects ofthe violation, to compare the actual operation with simulatedoperation as it should have been under the Operating Principles." Kansas' Exceptions to Special Master's Report 12.But, it must be recalled, this is an original action to enforce514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT683Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthe terms of the Compact.3 Article IV-D provides that theCompact is not intended to prevent future beneficial development of the Arkansas River basin--including dams and res-ervoirs--provided that the river flow shall not be materiallydepleted. The Compact thus permits the development ofprojects such as Pueblo Reservoir so long as their operationdoes not result in a material depletion of usable flow to Kan-sas users. For Kansas to prevail in its contention, it wouldhave to show that the Operating Principles had the effect ofamending the Compact by granting either party the right tosue the other for violation of the Operating Principles eventhough the violation resulted in no material depletion of usable flow at stateline. Although the Administration is em-powered to "[p]rescribe procedures for the administration ofth[e] Compact," App. to Report 11 (Article VIII-B(2)), itmust do so "consistent with the provisions of th[e] Compact," ibid. (Article VIII-B(1)) (emphasis added); see alsoReport 416 ("[T]he Compact Administration was not delegated power to change the Compact"). The theory advo-cated by Kansas is inconsistent with Article IV-D, whichallows for the development and operation of dams and reservoirs so long as there is no resultant material depletion ofusable flows at stateline.Thus Kansas, in order to establish a Compact violationbased upon failure to obey the Operating Principles, was required to demonstrate that this failure resulted in a materialdepletion under Article IV-D. Kansas "has not established,and did not attempt to establish, such injury." Id., at 431.We overrule Kansas' exception to the Special Master's dismissal of its Trinidad Reservoir claim.3 The Special Master did "not address the possible question of whetherKansas has a claim for violation of the Operating Principles that is independent of the Compact, that is, a cause of action based upon a separateagreement with Colorado, or as a third party beneficiary under the repayment contract, or otherwise." Report 408, n. 6. We express no view asto that question.514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT684 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the CourtBIn 1964, the Bureau of Reclamation and Colorado beganplanning a program to use excess capacity at Pueblo Reservoir in order to store a portion of the winter-time flow of theArkansas River for beneficial use at other times. Under theWWSP, winter-time flow--much of which was used pre-viously to flood uncultivated cropland--is instead stored atthe Pueblo Reservoir. Kansas contends that the SpecialMaster erred in finding that it had failed to prove that theWWSP had "materially depleted" usable stateline flows.We disagree.In his Report, the Special Master concluded:"Kansas has not proved that the WWSP has caused ma-terial Stateline depletions. Kansas' case has not beenhelped by its own contradictions in quantifying impactsto usable flow--ranging during this trial from 255,000acre-feet initially, to 44,000 to 40,000; nor by the fact thatdepletions are essentially eliminated if accretions aretaken into account." Report 335.The Special Master examined the computer models submit-ted by Kansas and Colorado and determined that "the depletions shown by the Kansas model are well within the model'srange of error."Id., at 334-335. As a result, "[o]ne [couldnot] be sure whether impact or error [was] being shown."Id., at 335.We believe that the Special Master gave Kansas every reasonable opportunity to meet its burden of proving its WWSPclaim. Kansas, however, failed to prove that operation ofthe WWSP program resulted in material depletions of usableflows in violation of Article IV-D. Seeibid. Therefore, weoverrule Kansas' exception to the Special Master's conclusion that Kansas had failed to prove its WWSP claim.CArticle IV-D of the Compact permits future developmentand construction along the Arkansas River Basin provided514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT685Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthat it does not materially deplete stateline flows "in usablequantity or availability." App. to Report 5 (Article IV-D)(emphasis added). In order to establish a violation of Article IV-D, Kansas was required to establish that developmentin Colorado resulted in material depletions of "usable" riverflow. The Compact does not define the term "usable." Cf.Colorado v. Kansas, 320 U. S., at 396-397 ("The critical matter is the amount of divertible flow at times when water ismost needed for irrigation. Calculations of average annualflow, which include flood flows, are, therefore, not helpful inascertaining the dependable supply of water usable forirrigation"). At trial, Kansas presented three methods fordetermining depletions of "usable" flow.Kansas' first expert, Timothy J. Durbin, analyzed flow datafor the period between 1951 and 1985 by plotting actual riverdiversions in Kansas against actual stateline flows. Report293-294. Using these data, Durbin developed criteria todetermine what river flows were usable. Durbin concludedthat during the summer months, April through October, (1)78% of the stateline flows were diverted; (2) flows greaterthan 40,000 acre-feet per month were not usable; and (3)flows greater than 140,000 acre-feet for the whole periodwere not usable. Id., at 293. With respect to the wintermonths, November through March, Durbin concluded that (1)24% of the winter flow was diverted; (2) flows greater than7,500 acre-feet per month were not usable; and (3) flowsgreater than 40,000 acre-feet for the whole period were notusable. Id., at 293-294.After Colorado isolated errors in Durbin's analysis, Kansaspresented a replacement case. Kansas' second group of experts, led by Stephen P. Larson, adopted the same methodology but revised certain exhibits and made minor correctionsin data. As a result, Larson modified Durbin's coefficients,using 72% for the summer months and 25% for the wintermonths. Id., at 295.514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT686 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the CourtLater, well after trial had begun, Kansas enlisted the aidof Brent Spronk, who proposed yet another method to quantify depletions of "usable" stateline flow. Id., at 300-305.Spronk attempted to determine the "percentage of days ineach month when flows were being fully used in Kansas."Id., at 301. Instead of seasonal averages, the Spronk ap-proach yielded coefficients that varied from month to month.Spronk then multiplied these monthly coefficients by the es-timated depletions in flow predicted by Kansas' hydrologicalmodel. Id., at 301-302.The Special Master concluded that "the Durbin approach,using Larson's coefficients, is the best of the several methodspresented for determining usable flow" and that it provided"a reasonable way in which to determine depletions of usableflow." Id., at 305. We agree. Each of the three methodsthat Kansas proposed for calculating usable depletions required two steps: (1) a calculation of total depletions usingthe Kansas hydrological model, and (2) an application of "usability" criteria. See Brief for United States in Response toExeptions of Kansas and Colorado 30. Each of the threemethods proposed by Kansas was dependent on the Kansas hydrological model to estimate total depletions. TheSpronk method required the Kansas hydrological modelto predict accurately depletions for each and every month.Report 303. But as Durbin, Kansas' first expert, testified,Kansas' hydrological model was only a " `good predictor'when `looking at long periods of time.' " Id., at 303, n. 130(quoting Durbin's testimony). Thus, the Spronk method required the Kansas hydrological model to do something it wasnot designed to do, i. e., predict accurately depletions on amonthly basis. Id., at 303 ("The Spronk analysis assumesthat the H-I model can accurately predict changes of Stateline flow on a monthly basis"). Because the Spronk methodfor determining "usable" river flows was less compatiblewith Kansas' hydrological model than the other methods proposed, we conclude that the Special Master properly rejected514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT687Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)Opinion of the Courtthe Spronk method in favor of the Durbin approach, as modi-fied by the Larson coefficients.IIIAThe Special Master concluded that Kansas was not guiltyof inexcusable delay in making its well-pumping claim, andthat Colorado had not been prejudiced by Kansas' failure topress its claim earlier.Id., at 170. Colorado has exceptedto this determination. Colorado argues that the equitabledoctrine of laches should bar Kansas' claim for relief. SeeColorado's Exceptions to Special Master's Report (Colorado'sExceptions) 24-64. We overrule Colorado's exception.The defense of laches "requires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and(2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense."Costello v.United States, 365 U. S. 265, 282 (1961); see also Black's LawDictionary 875 (6th ed. 1990) (" `Doctrine of laches,' is basedupon maxim that equity aids the vigilant and not those whoslumber on their rights. It is defined as neglect to assert aright or claim which, taken together with lapse of time andother circumstances causing prejudice to the adverse party,operates as bar in court of equity"). This Court has yet todecide whether the doctrine of laches applies in a case involving the enforcement of an interstate compact. Cf. Illinoisv.Kentucky, 500 U. S. 380, 388 (1991) (in the context of aninterstate boundary dispute, "the laches defense is generallyinapplicable against a State"); Block v. North Dakota ex rel.Board of Univ. and School Lands, 461 U. S. 273, 294 (1983)(O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("The common law has long ac-cepted the principle `nullum tempus occurrit regi'--neitherlaches nor statutes of limitations will bar the sovereign");Colorado v. Kansas, supra, at 394 (In the context of a suitseeking an equitable apportionment of river flows, facts demonstrating a delay in filing a complaint "might well precludethe award of the relief [requested]. But, in any event, they514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT688 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtgravely add to the burden [the plaintiff] would otherwisebear"). We need not, however, foreclose the applicability oflaches in such cases, because we conclude that Colorado hasfailed to prove an element necessary to the recognition ofthat defense. See Costello, supra, at 282.Colorado argues that Kansas knew or should have knownby 1956, or at the latest, before 1968, that both the numberof post-Compact wells and the amount of post-Compactpumping in Colorado had increased substantially. Colora-do's Exceptions 37, 39. Colorado argues that by 1956 Kansas had sufficient information about increased well pumpingin Colorado and its potential impact on usable stateline flowsto call for an investigation to determine if a Compact viola-tion existed. Id., at 46.The Special Master concluded that prior to 1984, Kansashad made no formal complaint to the Administration regarding post-Compact well pumping in Colorado. Report 155-156. Nevertheless, the Special Master concluded that Colorado's evidence did not "deal with the issue of impact onusable flow at the Stateline,"id., at 161, and did "not demon-strate that [the Kansas officials] were aware of the numberof wells, the extent of Colorado's pumping, or the impact oreven potential impact of pumping on usable Stateline flows,"id., at 164. The Special Master explained the difficulty ofassessing the impact of increases in post-Compact wellpumping on usable stateline flows because of changing condi-tions during the 1970's and early 1980's:"The 1970s were generally dry years and some reductionin flow was to have been expected. Pueblo Dam cameon line in 1976 and began to reregulate native flows.Transmountain imports increased, which to some extentprovided an offset to pumping. The 1980 OperatingPlan was placed into effect, which Colorado alleges offset the impacts of increased pumping downstream fromJohn Martin Reservoir. The Winter Water StorageProgram was instituted. Moreover, there was no quan514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT689Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)Opinion of the Courttitative or specific entitlement against which depletionsto usable flow could be judged. Nor were there anyagreed upon criteria for establishing what flows wereusable." Id., at 162-163.As late as 1985, Colorado officials refused to permit an inves-tigation by the Administration of well development in Colorado because they claimed that the evidence produced byKansas did not " `suggest that well development in Coloradohas had an impact on usable stateline flows.' " Id., at 163(quoting memorandum of J. William McDonald, chief of theColorado delegation to the Administration). In light of thevague and conflicting evidence available to Kansas, we conclude that Colorado has failed to demonstrate lack of dili-gence,i. e., inexcusable delay, on the part of Kansas.Accordingly, we overrule Colorado's exception to the Special Master's conclusion that the defense of laches should notbar Kansas' well-pumping claim.BThe Compact prohibits "future beneficial development ofthe Arkansas River basin" that "materially deplete[s]" theusable flows of the Arkansas River. App. to Report 5 (Arti-cle IV-D) (emphasis added). Because some wells in Colorado were in existence prior to the Compact, both partiesagree that a certain amount of post-Compact well pumpingis allowable under the Compact. Report 182. Kansas andColorado, however, dispute the extent of this allowance.The Special Master determined that the "highest annualamount shown to have been pumped during the negotiations,namely 15,000 acre-feet, should be allowed under the [C]om-pact." Id., at 200. Colorado makes both a legal and a factual challenge to this determination. Colorado's Exceptions66-73, 73-84.Colorado argues as a legal matter that the Compact doesnot limit the pumping by pre-Compact wells to the highestamount actually pumped in pre-Compact years; rather, Colo514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT690 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtrado claims that the limit on its pre-Compact pumping is themaximum amount that Colorado law permitted or the maximum amount of pumping possible using wells existing priorto the Compact. Id., at 69-70. In support of its position,Colorado argues that the Special Master failed to considerthe subsequent practice of the parties, i. e., Kansas' failureto object to replacement of centrifugal pumps with turbinepumps or increased pumping by pre-Compact wells, and thatArticle VI-A(2) of the Compact supports its position.4We conclude that the clear language of Article IV-D refutes Colorado's legal challenge. Article IV-D permits "future beneficial development of the Arkansas River basin . . .which may involve construction of dams, reservoir, and otherworks for the purposes of water utilization and control, aswell as the improved or prolonged functioning of existingworks: Provided, that the waters of the Arkansas River . . .shall not be materially depleted in usable quantity or availability . . . ." App. to Report 5 (emphasis added). Regardless of subsequent practice by the parties, improved and increased pumping by existing wells clearly falls within ArticleIV-D's prohibition against "improved or prolonged functioning of existing works," if such action results in "materia[l]deplet[ions] in usable" river flows. Ibid.; see Texas v. NewMexico, 462 U. S. 554, 564 (1983) ("[U]nless the compact towhich Congress has consented is somehow unconstitutional,no court may order relief inconsistent with its expressterms"). Article VI-A(2) of the Compact, which beginswith the phrase, "Except as otherwise provided," App. to4 Article VI-A(2) provides: "Except as otherwise provided, nothing inthis Compact shall be construed as supplanting the administration by Colorado of the rights of appropriators of waters of the Arkansas River insaid State as decreed to said appropriators by the courts of Colorado, noras interfering with the distribution among said appropriators by Colorado,nor as curtailing the diversion and use for irrigation and other beneficialpurposes in Colorado of the waters of the Arkansas River."

S. 673 (1995)Opinion of the CourtReport 10, must be read in conjunction with and as limitedby Article IV-D. We agree with the Special Master that"new wells, the replacement of centrifugal with turbinepumps, and increased pumping from [pre-Compact] wells allcome within [Article IV-D]." Report 194.Second, Colorado argues as a factual matter that the Special Master unreasonably relied upon faulty reports by theUnited States Geological Survey (USGS) and the ColoradoLegislature to conclude that the greatest amount of annualpre-Compact pumping in Colorado was 15,000 acre-feet.Colorado's Exceptions 73-74. The Special Master concluded:"There is no precise answer to the amount of [pre-Compact] pumping. . . . That amount must simply remainas an estimate of water use that affected the generalallocation of water between the states when the [C]ompact was being negotiated. Two responsible reports,one published by the USGS and one prepared forthe Colorado legislature, reached similar conclusionsas to the amounts of Colorado pumping during the1940s. . . . They have since been used by the ColoradoState Engineer. I have relied on these reports andrecommend that the highest annual amount shown tohave been pumped during the negotiations, namely15,000 acre-feet, should be allowed under the [C]ompact."Report 199-200.Although the ultimate responsibility for deciding what arecorrect findings of fact remains with the Court,Colorado v.New Mexico, 467 U. S. 310, 317 (1984), in this instance, weare in full agreement with the Special Master. Accordingly,we overrule Colorado's exception.CIn April 1980, the Administration adopted a resolution con-cerning the method for operating John Martin Reservoir(1980 Operating Plan). Report 47. The 1980 Operating514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT692 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the CourtPlan divides the water conserved in John Martin Reservoirinto separate accounts. Kansas is allocated 40% of the conservation storage, with the remaining 60% being divided inspecified percentages among the nine canal companies in Colorado Water District 67. Id., at 173. The Special Masterconcluded that the 1980 Operating Plan for the John MartinReservoir was "separately bargained for" and thereforeshould not offset depletions caused by post-Compact wellpumping in Colorado.Id., at 180-181. Colorado takes exception to this ruling.Colorado argues that increases in usable stateline flowsresulting from the 1980 Operating Plan should offset depletions to usable stateline flows. Colorado's Exceptions 85.Colorado maintains that the Administration adopted the 1980Operating Plan "for more efficient utilization of water underits control because of changes in the regime of the ArkansasRiver," id., at 91, "including [post-Compact] well pumping inColorado and Kansas," ibid.; see also App. to Report 107(Resolution Concerning an Operating Plan for John MartinReservoir) ("WHEREAS, the Arkansas River Compact Administration . . . recognizes that, because of changes in theregime of the Arkansas River, the present operation of theconservation features of John Martin Reservoir does not result in the most efficient utilization possible of the waterunder its control"). We disagree.As Colorado acknowledges, the resolution adopting the1980 Operating Plan "does not state that [post-Compact] wellpumping in Colorado or Kansas was a cause of changes inthe regime of the Arkansas River." Colorado's Exceptions88. In fact, Colorado argues in a separate part of its briefthat "Kansas had made no complaint about well pumping inColorado to the Compact Administration . . . before 1984."Id., at 32. The 1980 Operating Plan expressly reserves theparties' rights under the Compact, stating that "[a]doptionof this resolution does not prejudice the ability of Kansas orof any Colorado ditch to object or to otherwise represent its514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT693Cite as: 514 U. S. 673 (1995)Opinion of the Courtinterest in present or future cases or controversies beforethe Administration or in a court of competent jurisdiction."App. to Report 116. The Special Master concluded:"The 1980 Operating Plan provided benefits to bothKansas and Colorado which were separately bargainedfor. There is no evidence to support the claim that ben-efits to Kansas were in settlement of its well claims.Colorado received ample consideration under the agree-ment for the 1980 plan without a waiver of Kansas' wellclaims. The benefits received by Kansas under the planshould not be offset against compact violations, andshould not be a bar to any of the Kansas claims in thiscase." Report 180-181.We agree with the Special Master's resolution of Colorado'sclaim. Accordingly, we overrule Colorado's exception.DFinally, Colorado argues that Kansas is required to proveits well-pumping claim by clear and convincing evidence.Colorado's Exceptions 91. The Special Master, relying uponNebraska v. Wyoming, 507 U. S. 584 (1993), concluded thatthe proper burden of proof for enforcing an interstate compact is the preponderance of the evidence standard. Report70. The Special Master noted that theNebraska Court haddrawn a distinction between actions seeking to "modify" ajudicial decree and actions seeking to "enforce" a judicial de-cree. See Nebraska, supra, at 592 ("[W]e find merit in [the]contention that, to the extent that Nebraska seeks modifica-tion of the decree rather than enforcement, a higher standard of proof applies"). The Special Master concluded thatan action seeking to enforce an interstate compact stood onthe same footing as an action enforcing a judicial decree, andtherefore was subject to the "preponderance of the evidence"standard. Report 70.We need not, however, resolve this issue. The SpecialMaster concluded that "regardless of which burden of proof514us3$55H 05-27-98 17:32:33 PAGES OPINPGT694 KANSAS v. COLORADOOpinion of the Courtapplies" he had "no difficulty in concluding that [post-Compact] pumping in Colorado ha[d] caused material depletions of the usable Stateline flows of the Arkansas River, inviolation of the Arkansas River Compact." Id., at 263. Weagree with this determination, and thus overrule Colorado'sexception.IVFor these reasons, we overrule the exceptions filed by theStates of Kansas and Colorado. We remand the case to theSpecial Master for determination of the unresolved issues ina manner not inconsistent with this opinion.
