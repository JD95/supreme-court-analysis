PRINGLEOpinion of the Courtofficer, upon searching the car, seized $763 of rolled-up cashfrom the glove compartment and five glassine baggies of cocaine from between the back-seat armrest and the back seat.After all three men denied ownership of the cocaine andmoney, the officer arrested each of them. We hold that theofficer had probable cause to arrest Pringle--one of thethree men.At 3:16 a.m. on August 7, 1999, a Baltimore County Policeofficer stopped a Nissan Maxima for speeding. There werethree occupants in the car: Donte Partlow, the driver andowner, respondent Pringle, the front-seat passenger, andOtis Smith, the back-seat passenger. The officer askedPartlow for his license and registration. When Partlowopened the glove compartment to retrieve the vehicle registration, the officer observed a large amount of rolled-upmoney in the glove compartment. The officer returned tohis patrol car with Partlow's license and registration to checkthe computer system for outstanding violations. The computer check did not reveal any violations. The officer returned to the stopped car, had Partlow get out, and issuedhim an oral warning.After a second patrol car arrived, the officer asked Partlowif he had any weapons or narcotics in the vehicle. Partlowindicated that he did not. Partlow then consented to asearch of the vehicle. The search yielded $763 from theglove compartment and five plastic glassine baggies containing cocaine from behind the back-seat armrest. When theofficer began the search the armrest was in the upright position flat against the rear seat. The officer pulled down thearmrest and found the drugs, which had been placed betweenthe armrest and the back seat of the car.The officer questioned all three men about the ownershipof the drugs and money, and told them that if no one admitted to ownership of the drugs he was going to arrest themall. The men offered no information regarding the owner540US2 Unit: $$U8 [09-10-04 10:29:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN369Cite as: 540 U. S. 366 (2003)Opinion of the Courtship of the drugs or money. All three were placed underarrest and transported to the police station.Later that morning, Pringle waived his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966), and gave an oral andwritten confession in which he acknowledged that the co-caine belonged to him, that he and his friends were going toa party, and that he intended to sell the cocaine or "[u]se itfor sex." App. 26. Pringle maintained that the other occu-pants of the car did not know about the drugs, and theywere released.The trial court denied Pringle's motion to suppress hisconfession as the fruit of an illegal arrest, holding that theofficer had probable cause to arrest Pringle. A jury convicted Pringle of possession with intent to distribute cocaineand possession of cocaine. He was sentenced to 10 years'incarceration without the possibility of parole. The Courtof Special Appeals of Maryland affirmed. 141 Md. App. 292,785 A. 2d 790 (2001).The Court of Appeals of Maryland, by divided vote, reversed, holding that, absent specific facts tending to showPringle's knowledge and dominion or control over the drugs,"the mere finding of cocaine in the back armrest when [Pringle] was a front seat passenger in a car being driven by itsowner is insufficient to establish probable cause for an arrestfor possession." 370 Md. 525, 545, 805 A. 2d 1016, 1027(2002). We granted certiorari, 538 U. S. 921 (2003), andnow reverse.Under the Fourth Amendment, made applicable to theStates by the Fourteenth Amendment, Mapp v. Ohio, 367U. S. 643 (1961), the people are "to be secure in their persons,houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searchesand seizures, . . . and no Warrants shall issue, but uponprobable cause . . . ." U. S. Const., Amdt. 4. Maryland lawauthorizes police officers to execute warrantless arrests,inter alia, for felonies committed in an officer's presence orwhere an officer has probable cause to believe that a felony540US2 Unit: $$U8 [09-10-04 10:29:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN370 MARYLAND v. PRINGLEOpinion of the Courthas been committed or is being committed in the officer'spresence. Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, $ 594B (1996) (repealed2001). A warrantless arrest of an individual in a publicplace for a felony, or a misdemeanor committed in the officer's presence, is consistent with the Fourth Amendmentif the arrest is supported by probable cause. United Statesv. Watson, 423 U. S. 411, 424 (1976); see Atwater v. LagoVista, 532 U. S. 318, 354 (2001) (stating that "[i]f an officerhas probable cause to believe that an individual has committed even a very minor criminal offense in his presence,he may, without violating the Fourth Amendment, arrestthe offender").It is uncontested in the present case that the officer, uponrecovering the five plastic glassine baggies containing sus-pected cocaine, had probable cause to believe a felony hadbeen committed. Md. Ann. Code, Art. 27, $ 287 (1996) (re-pealed 2002) (prohibiting possession of controlled dangeroussubstances). The sole question is whether the officer hadprobable cause to believe that Pringle committed that crime.1The long-prevailing standard of probable cause protects"citizens from rash and unreasonable interferences with privacy and from unfounded charges of crime," while giving"fair leeway for enforcing the law in the community's protection." Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176 (1949).On many occasions, we have reiterated that the probablecause standard is a " `practical, nontechnical conception' "that deals with " `the factual and practical considerations ofeveryday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legaltechnicians, act.' "Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 231 (1983)(quotingBrinegar, supra, at 175-176); see, e. g., Ornelas v.United States, 517 U. S. 690, 695 (1996); United States v. Sokolow, 490 U. S. 1, 7-8 (1989). "[P]robable cause is a fluid1 Maryland law defines "possession" as "the exercise of actual or constructive dominion or control over a thing by one or more persons." Md.Ann. Code, Art. 27, $ 277(s) (1996) (repealed 2002).540US2 Unit: $$U8 [09-10-04 10:29:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN371Cite as: 540 U. S. 366 (2003)Opinion of the Courtconcept--turning on the assessment of probabilities in par-ticular factual contexts--not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules." Gates, 462 U. S., at 232.The probable-cause standard is incapable of precise definition or quantification into percentages because it deals withprobabilities and depends on the totality of the circumstances. See ibid.; Brinegar, 338 U. S., at 175. We havestated, however, that "[t]he substance of all the definitions ofprobable cause is a reasonable ground for belief of guilt,"ibid. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), andthat the belief of guilt must be particularized with respectto the person to be searched or seized, Ybarra v. Illinois,444 U. S. 85, 91 (1979). InIllinois v. Gates, we noted:"As early as Locke v. United States, 7 Cranch 339, 348(1813), Chief Justice Marshall observed, in a closely related context: `[T]he term "probable cause," according toits usual acceptation, means less than evidence whichwould justify condemnation . . . . It imports a seizuremade under circumstances which warrant suspicion.'More recently, we said that `the quanta . . . of proof 'appropriate in ordinary judicial proceedings are inapplicable to the decision to issue a warrant. Brinegar, 338U. S., at 173. Finely tuned standards such as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or by a preponderance of theevidence, useful in formal trials, have no place in the[probable-cause] decision." 462 U. S., at 235.To determine whether an officer had probable cause to arrest an individual, we examine the events leading up to thearrest, and then decide "whether these historical facts,viewed from the standpoint of an objectively reasonablepolice officer, amount to" probable cause, Ornelas, supra,at 696.In this case, Pringle was one of three men riding in a Nissan Maxima at 3:16 a.m. There was $763 of rolled-up cash540US2 Unit: $$U8 [09-10-04 10:29:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN372 MARYLAND v. PRINGLEOpinion of the Courtin the glove compartment directly in front of Pringle.2 Fiveplastic glassine baggies of cocaine were behind the back-seatarmrest and accessible to all three men. Upon questioning,the three men failed to offer any information with respect tothe ownership of the cocaine or the money.We think it an entirely reasonable inference from thesefacts that any or all three of the occupants had knowledgeof, and exercised dominion and control over, the cocaine.Thus, a reasonable officer could conclude that there wasprobable cause to believe Pringle committed the crime ofpossession of cocaine, either solely or jointly.Pringle's attempt to characterize this case as a guilt-byassociation case is unavailing. His reliance on Ybarra v. Illinois, supra, and United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581(1948), is misplaced. In Ybarra, police officers obtained awarrant to search a tavern and its bartender for evidenceof possession of a controlled substance. Upon entering thetavern, the officers conducted patdown searches of the cus-tomers present in the tavern, including Ybarra. Inside acigarette pack retrieved from Ybarra's pocket, an officerfound six tinfoil packets containing heroin. We stated:"[A] person's mere propinquity to others independentlysuspected of criminal activity does not, without more,2 The Court of Appeals of Maryland dismissed the $763 seized from theglove compartment as a factor in the probable-cause determination, stating that "[m]oney, without more, is innocuous." 370 Md. 524, 546, 805A. 2d 1016, 1028 (2002). The court's consideration of the money in isolation, rather than as a factor in the totality of the circumstances, is mistaken in light of our precedents. See, e. g., Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213,230-231 (1983) (opining that the totality of the circumstances approach isconsistent with our prior treatment of probable cause); Brinegar v. UnitedStates, 338 U. S. 160, 175-176 (1949) ("Probable cause exists where `thefacts and circumstances within their [the officers'] knowledge and of whichthey had reasonably trustworthy information [are] sufficient in themselvesto warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that' an offense hasbeen or is being committed"). We think it is abundantly clear from thefacts that this case involves more than money alone.540US2 Unit: $$U8 [09-10-04 10:29:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN373Cite as: 540 U. S. 366 (2003)Opinion of the Courtgive rise to probable cause to search that person. Sib-ron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 62-63 (1968). Where thestandard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a per-son must be supported by probable cause particularizedwith respect to that person. This requirement cannotbe undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the factthat coincidentally there exists probable cause to searchor seize another or to search the premises where theperson may happen to be." 444 U. S., at 91.We held that the search warrant did not permit bodysearches of all of the tavern's patrons and that the policecould not pat down the patrons for weapons, absent individu-alized suspicion. Id., at 92.This case is quite different from Ybarra. Pringle and histwo companions were in a relatively small automobile, not apublic tavern. In Wyoming v. Houghton, 526 U. S. 295(1999), we noted that "a car passenger--unlike the unwittingtavern patron in Ybarra--will often be engaged in a commonenterprise with the driver, and have the same interest inconcealing the fruits or the evidence of their wrongdoing."Id., at 304-305. Here we think it was reasonable for theofficer to infer a common enterprise among the three men.The quantity of drugs and cash in the car indicated the likelihood of drug dealing, an enterprise to which a dealer wouldbe unlikely to admit an innocent person with the potentialto furnish evidence against him. In Di Re, a federal investi-gator had been told by an informant, Reed, that he was toreceive counterfeit gasoline ration coupons from a certainButtitta at a particular place. The investigator went to theappointed place and saw Reed, the sole occupant of the rearseat of the car, holding gasoline ration coupons. There weretwo other occupants in the car: Buttitta in the driver's seatand Di Re in the front passenger's seat. Reed informed theinvestigator that Buttitta had given him counterfeit coupons.Thereupon, all three men were arrested and searched.After noting that the officers had no information implicating540US2 Unit: $$U8 [09-10-04 10:29:38] PAGES PGT: OPIN374 MARYLAND v. PRINGLEOpinion of the CourtDi Re and no information pointing to Di Re's possession ofcoupons, unless presence in the car warranted that inference,we concluded that the officer lacked probable cause to believethat Di Re was involved in the crime. 332 U. S., at 592-594.We said "[a]ny inference that everyone on the scene of acrime is a party to it must disappear if the Government informer singles out the guilty person." Id., at 594. No suchsingling out occurred in this case; none of the three menprovided information with respect to the ownership of thecocaine or money.We hold that the officer had probable cause to believe thatPringle had committed the crime of possession of a controlled substance. Pringle's arrest therefore did not contra-vene the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion.
