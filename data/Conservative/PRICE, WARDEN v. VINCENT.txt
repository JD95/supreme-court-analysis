The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitgranted habeas relief to respondent Duyonn Andre Vincentafter concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause of theFifth Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, barred his conviction for first-degreemurder.Vincent v.

Respondent was arrested in connection with theshooting and was charged with open murder. At the closeof the prosecution's case in chief and outside the hearing ofthe jury, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict of acquittal as to first-degree murder, arguing that there was in-sufficient evidence of premeditation and deliberation. Thetrial judge stated:" `[M]y impression at this time is that there's not beenshown premeditation or planning in the, in the allegedslaying. That what we have at the very best is SecondDegree Murder. . . . I think that Second Degree Murderis an appropriate charge as to the defendants. Okay.' "292 F. 3d, at 508.Before court adjourned, the prosecutor asked to make a briefstatement regarding first-degree murder the following morn-ing.Ibid. The trial judge agreed to hear it.When the prosecution made the statement, however, de-fense counsel objected. The defense argued that the courthad granted its motion for a directed verdict as to first-degree murder the previous day, and that further prosecution on that charge would violate the Double JeopardyClause. Ibid. The judge responded, " `Oh, I granted a mo-tion but I have not directed a verdict.' "Id., at 509. Henoted that the jury had not been informed of his statements,and said that he would reserve a ruling on the matter. Subsequently, he decided to permit the charge of first-degreemurder to be submitted to the jury.Ibid.The jury convicted respondent of first-degree murder, andrespondent appealed.Ibid. The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the trial judge had directeda verdict on the charge and that the Double Jeopardy Clauseprevented respondent's prosecution for first-degree murder.People v. Vincent, 215 Mich. App. 458, 546 N. W. 2d 662(1996). The Michigan Supreme Court reversed. It notedthat "a judge's characterization of a ruling and the form of538US2 Unit: $U51 [10-27-04 14:49:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN638 PRICE v. VINCENTOpinion of the Courtthe ruling may not be controlling" for purposes of determin-ing whether a ruling terminated jeopardy. People v. Vincent, 455 Mich. 110, 119, 565 N. W. 2d 629, 632 (1997) (citingUnited States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 571,n. 9 (1977)). The State Supreme Court then reviewed thecontext and substance of the trial judge's comments, and concluded that the comments were not sufficiently final to con-stitute a judgment of acquittal terminating jeopardy. Afterthe Michigan Supreme Court's decision, respondent discov-ered that the Clerk had made the following entry on thedocket sheet: " `Motions by all atts for directed verdict.Court amended c[oun]t: 1 open murder to 2nd degree murder.' " 292 F. 3d, at 512; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 7. Re-spondent moved the State Supreme Court to reconsider itsjudgment in light of this statement. The motion was deniedwithout opinion. Judgt. order reported at 456 Mich. 1201,568 N. W. 2d 670 (1997).Respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus from theUnited States District Court for the Eastern District ofMichigan. That court determined that respondent's prosecution for first-degree murder violated the Double JeopardyClause, and it granted his petition. App. to Pet. for Cert.78a. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Cir-cuit affirmed, 292 F. 3d 506 (2002), and this petition ensued.IIA habeas petitioner whose claim was adjudicated on themerits in state court is not entitled to relief in federal courtunless he meets the requirements of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d).The double jeopardy claim in respondent's habeas petitionarises out of the same set of facts upon which he based hisdirect appeal, and the State Supreme Court's holding thatno double jeopardy violation occurred therefore constitutedan adjudication of this claim on the merits. Thus, under$ 2254(d), respondent is not entitled to relief unless he candemonstrate that the state court's adjudication of his claim:538US2 Unit: $U51 [10-27-04 14:49:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN639Cite as: 538 U. S. 634 (2003)Opinion of the Court"(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, orinvolved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Courtof the United States; or"(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unrea-sonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding."Although the Court of Appeals recited this standard, 292F. 3d, at 510, it proceeded to evaluate respondent's claimdenovo rather than through the lens of $ 2254(d), apparentlybecause it "agree[d] with the district court that whether thestate trial judge acquitted [respondent] of first-degree murder is a question of law and not one of fact." Id., at 511.The Court of Appeals did not consider whether the MichiganSupreme Court's decision was "contrary to" or an "unreason-able application of " our clearly established precedents, orwhether it was "based on an unreasonable determination ofthe facts." Instead, the Court of Appeals declared:" `[W]e are not bound by the holding of the MichiganSupreme Court that the trial judge's statements didnot constitute a directed verdict under Michigan law.Instead, we must examine the state trial judge's comments to determine whether he made a ruling whichresolved the factual elements of the first-degree murdercharge.' " Ibid.The Court of Appeals then concluded that, in its judgment,the state trial court's actions "constituted a grant of an acquittal on the first-degree murder charge such that jeopardyattached," id., at 512, and affirmed.This was error. As noted above, under $ 2254(d) it mustbe shown that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision waseither contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, thisCourt's clearly established precedents, or was based upon anunreasonable determination of the facts. The parties do notdispute the underlying facts, and respondent is therefore538US2 Unit: $U51 [10-27-04 14:49:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN640 PRICE v. VINCENTOpinion of the Courtentitled to habeas relief only if he can meet one of the twobases for relief provided in $ 2254(d)(1). We will addressthese bases in turn.First, we have explained that a decision by a state courtis "contrary to" our clearly established law if it "applies arule that contradicts the governing law set forth in ourcases" or if it "confronts a set of facts that are materiallyindistinguishable from a decision of this Court and nevertheless arrives at a result different from our precedent." Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, 405-406 (2000). See alsoEarly v. Packer, 537 U. S. 3, 7-8 (2002) (per curiam). Here,the Michigan Supreme Court identified the applicable Supreme Court precedents, United States v. Martin LinenSupply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977), and Smalis v. Pennsylvania, 476 U. S. 140 (1986), and "reaffirm[ed] the principles articulated" in those decisions. People v. Vincent, 455 Mich.,at 121, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633. Moreover, the Michigan Supreme Court properly followed Martin Linen by recognizingthat the trial judge's characterization of his own ruling is notcontrolling for purposes of double jeopardy, and by inquiringinto " `whether the ruling of the [trial] judge, whatever itslabel, actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of someor all of the factual elements of the offense charged.' " 455Mich., at 119, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633 (citing Martin Linen,supra, at 571). Nowhere did the Michigan Supreme Courtapply a legal standard contrary to those set forth in ourcases. Nor did that court confront a set of facts materiallyindistinguishable from those presented in any of this Court'sclearly established precedents. In Smalis and MartinLinen, unlike in the present case, the trial courts not onlyrendered statements of clarity and finality but also enteredformal orders from which appeals were taken. 476 U. S., at142; 430 U. S., at 566.Second, respondent can satisfy $ 2254(d) if he can demonstrate that the Michigan Supreme Court's decision involved538US2 Unit: $U51 [10-27-04 14:49:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN641Cite as: 538 U. S. 634 (2003)Opinion of the Courtan "unreasonable application" of clearly established law. Aswe have explained:"[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ simplybecause that court concludes in its independent judgment that the state-court decision applied [a SupremeCourt case] incorrectly. See Bell v. Cone, 535 U. S. 685,698-699 (2002); Williams, supra, at 411. Rather, it isthe habeas applicant's burden to show that the statecourt applied [that case] to the facts of his case in anobjectively unreasonable manner." Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24-25 (2002) (per curiam).Here, having recognized that, under Martin Linen, the trialjudge's characterization of his own ruling was not controllingfor purposes of double jeopardy, the court went on to examine the substance of the judge's actions, to determinewhether "further proceedings would violate the defendant'sdouble jeopardy rights." People v. Vincent, 455 Mich., at119, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633. In doing so, the court noted thegoal of the Double Jeopardy Clause to prevent against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. Id., at120, n. 5, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633, n. 5; see also Martin Linen,supra, at 569 (noting controlling constitutional principle motivating Double Jeopardy Clause is prohibition against multiple trials and corresponding prevention of oppression by theGovernment); Lockhart v. Nelson, 488 U. S. 33, 42 (1988).The Michigan Supreme Court also considered Smalis, inwhich this Court stated:"[T]he Double Jeopardy Clause bars a postacquittal appeal by the prosecution not only when it might resultin a second trial, but also if reversal would translateinto `further proceedings of some sort, devoted to theresolution of factual issues going to the elements of theoffense charged.' " 476 U. S., at 145-146 (quoting Martin Linen, supra, at 570).538US2 Unit: $U51 [10-27-04 14:49:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN642 PRICE v. VINCENTOpinion of the CourtApplying Martin Linen and Smalis, the State SupremeCourt concluded that the judge's comments simply were notsufficiently final as to terminate jeopardy. People v. Vincent, 455 Mich., at 120, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633 ("[F]urther proceedings were not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause");id., at 120, n. 5, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633, n. 5 ("[T]he principlesembodied within [double jeopardy] protections were not violated"); id., at 127, 565 N. W. 2d, at 636 (Because "the judge'scomments . . . lacked the requisite degree of clarity and specificity," "the continuation of the trial . . . did not prejudice orviolate the defendant's constitutional rights").In reaching this conclusion, in addition to reviewing thecontext and substance of the trial judge's comments atlength, the Michigan Supreme Court observed that "therewas no formal judgment or order entered on the record."Ibid.1 The Michigan Supreme Court noted that formal motions or rulings were not required to demonstrate finality asa matter of Michigan law, but cautioned that "the judgmentmust bear sufficient indicia of finality to survive an appeal."Id., at 126, n. 9, 565 N. W. 2d, at 636, n. 9. The court listedfactors that might be considered in evaluating finality as including "a clear statement in the record or a signed order,""an instruction to the jury that a charge or element of thecharge has been dismissed by the judge," or "a docket entry."Ibid. "[E]ach case," the court said, "will turn on its ownparticular circumstances." Ibid. Even after the docketentry was brought to its attention, the State Supreme Courtadhered to its original decision that, in this case, the trial1 The Michigan Supreme Court noted that the comments at issue werenever discussed in front of the jury, People v. Vincent, 455 Mich., at 114-115, n. 1, 565 N. W. 2d, at 631, n. 1, and that the jury was never discharged,id., at 121, n. 6, 565 N. W. 2d, at 633, n. 6. Moreover, the State SupremeCourt noted, no trial proceedings took place with respondent laboringunder the mistaken impression that he was not facing the possibility ofconviction for first-degree murder. Id., at 114-115, n. 1, 565 N. W. 2d, at631, n. 1.538US2 Unit: $U51 [10-27-04 14:49:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN643Cite as: 538 U. S. 634 (2003)Opinion of the Courtjudge's comments were not sufficiently final to terminatejeopardy. This was not an objectively unreasonable application of clearly established law as defined by this Court. In-deed, numerous other courts have refused to find doublejeopardy violations under similar circumstances.2 Even ifwe agreed with the Court of Appeals that the Double Jeopardy Clause should be read to prevent continued prosecutionof a defendant under these circumstances, it was at least reasonable for the state court to conclude otherwise.Because respondent did not meet the statutory requirements for habeas relief, the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals is reversed.
