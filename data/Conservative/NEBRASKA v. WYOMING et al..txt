We decide here whether the implied damages action firstrecognized in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,403 U.

We decline toso extend Bivens.Petitioner Correctional Services Corporation (CSC), undercontract with the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), operates Community Corrections Centers and other facilitiesthat house federal prisoners and detainees.1 Since the late*Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the AmericanCivil Liberties Union by Elizabeth Alexander, Margaret Winter, DavidFathi, and Steven R. Shapiro; and for the Legal Aid Society of the Cityof New York by Daniel L. Greenberg and John Boston.1 CSC is hardly unique in this regard. The BOP has since 1981 relied exclusively on contracts with private institutions and state andlocal governments for the operation of halfway house facilities to helpfederal prisoners reintegrate into society. The BOP contracts not onlywith for-profit entities like CSC, but also with charitable organizations likeVolunteers for America (which operates facilities in Indiana, Louisiana,Maryland, Minnesota, New York, and Texas), the Salvation Army (Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas), Progress534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN64 CORRECTIONAL SERVICES CORP. v. MALESKOOpinion of the Court1980's, CSC has operated Le Marquis Community Correc-tional Center (Le Marquis), a halfway house located in NewYork City. Respondent John E. Malesko is a former federalinmate who, having been convicted of federal securities fraudin December 1992, was sentenced to a term of 18 months'imprisonment under the supervision of the BOP. Duringhis imprisonment, respondent was diagnosed with a heartcondition and treated with prescription medication. Respondent's condition limited his ability to engage in physicalactivity, such as climbing stairs.In February 1993, the BOP transferred respondent to LeMarquis where he was to serve the remainder of his sentence. Respondent was assigned to living quarters on thefifth floor. On or about March 1, 1994, CSC instituted a policy at Le Marquis requiring inmates residing below the sixthfloor to use the staircase rather than the elevator to travelfrom the first-floor lobby to their rooms. There is no disputethat respondent was exempted from this policy on account ofhis heart condition. Respondent alleges that on March 28,1994, however, Jorge Urena, an employee of CSC, forbadehim to use the elevator to reach his fifth-floor bedroom. Re-spondent protested that he was specially permitted elevatoraccess, but Urena was adamant. Respondent then climbedthe stairs, suffered a heart attack, and fell, injuring his leftear.Three years after this incident occurred, respondent fileda pro se action against CSC and unnamed CSC employees inthe United States District Court for the Southern Districtof New York. Two years later, now acting with counsel, re-spondent filed an amended complaint which named Urena as1 of the 10 John Doe defendants. The amended complaintalleged that CSC, Urena, and unnamed defendants were"negligent in failing to obtain requisite medication for [re-spondent's] condition and were further negligent by refusingHouse Association (Oregon), Triangle Center (Illinois), and Catholic SocialServices (Pennsylvania).534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN65Cite as: 534 U.

It furtheralleged that respondent injured his left ear and aggravateda pre-existing condition "[a]s a result of the negligence ofthe Defendants." Ibid. Respondent demanded judgmentin the sum of $1 million in compensatory damages, $3 millionin anticipated future damages, and punitive damages "forsuch sum as the Court and/or [ j]ury may determine." Id.,at 13.The District Court treated the amended complaint as raising claims under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. NarcoticsAgents, supra, and dismissed respondent's cause of actionin its entirety. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a. Relying on ourdecision in FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471 (1994), the DistrictCourt reasoned that "a Bivens action may only be maintained against an individual," and thus was not availableagainst CSC, a corporate entity. App. to Pet. for Cert. 20a.With respect to Urena and the unnamed individual defendants, the complaint was dismissed on statute of limitationsgrounds.The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed inpart, reversed in part, and remanded. 229 F. 3d 374 (2000).That court affirmed dismissal of respondent's claims againstindividual defendants as barred by the statute of limitations. Respondent has not challenged that ruling, and theparties agree that the question whether a Bivens actionmight lie against a private individual is not presented here.With respect to CSC, the Court of Appeals remarked thatMeyer expressly declined " `to expand the category of defendants against whom Bivens-type actions may be broughtto include not only federal agents, but federal agenciesas well.' " 229 F. 3d, at 378 (quoting Meyer, supra, at 484(emphasis deleted)). But the court reasoned that privateentities like CSC should be held liable under Bivens to "accomplish the . . . important Bivens goal of providing a remedy for constitutional violations." 229 F. 3d, at 380.534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN66 CORRECTIONAL SERVICES CORP. v.

S. 388 (1971), we recognized for the first time an impliedprivate action for damages against federal officers alleged tohave violated a citizen's constitutional rights. Respondentnow asks that we extend this limited holding to confer aright of action for damages against private entities actingunder color of federal law. He contends that the Court mustrecognize a federal remedy at law wherever there has beenan alleged constitutional deprivation, no matter that thevictim of the alleged deprivation might have alternativeremedies elsewhere, and that the proposed remedy wouldnot significantly deter the principal wrongdoer, an individual private employee. We have heretofore refused to implynew substantive liabilities under such circumstances, and wedecline to do so here.Our authority to imply a new constitutional tort, notexpressly authorized by statute, is anchored in our generaljurisdiction to decide all cases "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." 28 U. S. C.$ 1331. See, e. g., Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412, 420-421 (1988); Bush v. Lucas, 462 U. S. 367, 373-374 (1983).

Anglo-AmericanSchool of Sofia, 28 F. 3d 1223, 1227 (CADC 1994) ("[Under] Meyer's conclusion that public federal agencies are not subject to Bivens liability,it follows that equivalent private entities should not be liable either").We hold today that it does.534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN67Cite as: 534 U.

S.,at 396. Nonetheless, relying largely on earlier decisionsimplying private damages actions into federal statutes, seeid., at 397 (citing J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426, 433(1964)); 403 U. S., at 402-403, n. 4 (Harlan, J., concurring injudgment) ("TheBorak case is an especially clear exampleof the exercise of federal judicial power to accord damagesas an appropriate remedy in the absence of any express stat-utory authorization of a federal cause of action"), and finding "no special factors counseling hesitation in the absenceof affirmative action by Congress," id., at 395-396, we foundan implied damages remedy available under the FourthAmendment.3In the decade following Bivens, we recognized an implieddamages remedy under the Due Process Clause of the FifthAmendment, Davis v. Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), and theCruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment, Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980). In both DavisandCarlson, we applied the core holding of Bivens, recogniz-ing in limited circumstances a claim for money damagesagainst federal officers who abuse their constitutional au-thority. In Davis, we inferred a new right of action chieflybecause the plaintiff lacked any other remedy for the allegedconstitutional deprivation. 442 U. S., at 245 ("For Davis, asfor Bivens, it is damages or nothing"). In Carlson, we in3 Since our decision in Borak, we have retreated from our previous willingness to imply a cause of action where Congress has not provided one.See, e. g., Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 188 (1994); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors,Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U. S. 11, 15-16 (1979); Cannon v. University of Chicago,441 U.

Justlast Term it was noted that we "abandoned" the view of Borak decadesago, and have repeatedly declined to "revert" to "the understanding ofprivate causes of action that held sway 40 years ago." Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 287 (2001).534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN68 CORRECTIONAL SERVICES CORP. v. MALESKOOpinion of the Courtferred a right of action against individual prison officialswhere the plaintiff 's only alternative was a Federal TortClaims Act (FTCA) claim against the United States. 446U. S., at 18-23. We reasoned that the threat of suit againstthe United States was insufficient to deter the unconstitu-tional acts of individuals.Id., at 21 ("Because the Bivensremedy is recoverable against individuals, it is a more effective deterrent than the FTCA remedy"). We also found it"crystal clear" that Congress intended the FTCA andBivensto serve as "parallel" and "complementary" sources of liabil-ity. 446 U. S., at 19-20.Since Carlson we have consistently refused to extendBivens liability to any new context or new category of defendants. In Bush v. Lucas, supra, we declined to create aBivens remedy against individual Government officials for aFirst Amendment violation arising in the context of federalemployment. Although the plaintiff had no opportunity tofully remedy the constitutional violation, we held that administrative review mechanisms crafted by Congress providedmeaningful redress and thereby foreclosed the need to fashion a new, judicially crafted cause of action. 462 U. S., at378, n. 14, 386-388. We further recognized Congress' institutional competence in crafting appropriate relief for aggrieved federal employees as a "special factor counselinghesitation in the creation of a new remedy." Id., at 380.See also id., at 389 (noting that "Congress is in a far betterposition than a court to evaluate the impact of a new speciesof litigation between federal employees"). We have reacheda similar result in the military context, Chappell v. Wallace,462 U. S. 296, 304 (1983), even where the defendants werealleged to have been civilian personnel, United States v.Stanley, 483 U. S. 669, 681 (1987).In Schweiker v. Chilicky, we declined to infer a damagesaction against individual Government employees alleged tohave violated due process in their handling of Social Security applications. We observed that our "decisions have re534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN69Cite as: 534 U. S. 61 (2001)Opinion of the Courtsponded cautiously to suggestions that Bivens remedies beextended into new contexts." 487 U. S., at 421. In light ofthese decisions, we noted that "[t]he absence of statutoryrelief for a constitutional violation . . . does not by anymeans necessarily imply that courts should award moneydamages against the officers responsible for the violation."Id., at 421-422. We therefore rejected the claim that aBivens remedy should be implied simply for want of anyother means for challenging a constitutional deprivation infederal court. It did not matter, for example, that "[t]he cre-ation of aBivens remedy would obviously offer the prospectof relief for injuries that must now go unredressed." 487U. S., at 425. See also Bush, supra, at 388 (noting that "existing remedies do not provide complete relief for the plaintiff "); Stanley, supra, at 683 ("[I]t is irrelevant to a specialfactors analysis whether the laws currently on the booksafford Stanley . . . an adequate federal remedy for his injuries" (internal quotation marks omitted)). So long as theplaintiff had an avenue for some redress, bedrock principlesof separation of powers foreclosed judicial imposition of anew substantive liability. Chilicky, supra, at 425-427.Most recently, in FDIC v. Meyer, we unanimously declined an invitation to extend Bivens to permit suit againsta federal agency, even though the agency--because Congresshad waived sovereign immunity--was otherwise amenable to suit. 510 U. S., at 484-486. Our opinion emphasizedthat "the purpose of Bivens is to deter the officer," not theagency. Id., at 485 (emphasis in original) (citing Carlson v.Green, supra, at 21). We reasoned that if given the choice,plaintiffs would sue a federal agency instead of an individual who could assert qualified immunity as an affirmativedefense. To the extent aggrieved parties had less incentiveto bring a damages claim against individuals, "the deterrenteffects of the Bivens remedy would be lost." 510 U. S., at485. Accordingly, to allow a Bivens claim against federalagencies "would mean the evisceration of the Bivens remedy,534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN70 CORRECTIONAL SERVICES CORP. v. MALESKOOpinion of the Courtrather than its extension." 510 U. S., at 485. We noted fur-ther that "special factors" counseled hesitation in light of the"potentially enormous financial burden" that agency liabilitywould entail.Id., at 486.From this discussion, it is clear that the claim urged byrespondent is fundamentally different from anything recognized in Bivens or subsequent cases. In 30 years of Bivensjurisprudence we have extended its holding only twice, toprovide an otherwise nonexistent cause of action againstindividual officers alleged to have acted unconstitutionally, orto provide a cause of action for a plaintiff who lackedanyalternative remedy for harms caused by an individual offi-cer's unconstitutional conduct. Where such circumstancesare not present, we have consistently rejected invitations toextendBivens, often for reasons that foreclose its extension here.4The purpose ofBivens is to deter individual federal officers from committing constitutional violations. Meyer madeclear that the threat of litigation and liability will adequatelydeter federal officers for Bivens purposes no matter thatthey may enjoy qualified immunity, 510 U. S., at 474, 485, areindemnified by the employing agency or entity,id., at 486,or are acting pursuant to an entity's policy, id., at 473-474.Meyer also made clear that the threat of suit against an individual's employer was not the kind of deterrence con-templated byBivens. See 510 U. S., at 485 ("If we were toimply a damages action directly against federal agencies . . .there would be no reason for aggrieved parties to bringdamages actions against individual officers. [T]he deterrent4 Justice Stevens' claim that this case does not implicate an "extension" of Bivens, post, at 76-77, 82 (dissenting opinion), might come as somesurprise to the Court of Appeals which twice characterized its own holding as "extending Bivens liability to reach private corporations." 229F. 3d 374, 381 (CA2 2000). See also ibid. ("Bivens liability should extendto private corporations").534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN71Cite as: 534 U. S. 61 (2001)Opinion of the Courteffects of the Bivens remedy would be lost"). This case is,in every meaningful sense, the same. For if a corporate defendant is available for suit, claimants will focus their collection efforts on it, and not the individual directly responsible for the alleged injury. See, e. g., TXO Production Corp.v. Alliance Resources Corp., 509 U. S. 443, 464 (1993) (plurality opinion) (recognizing that corporations fare much worsebefore juries than do individuals); id., at 490-492 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (same) (citing authorities). On the logicof Meyer, inferring a constitutional tort remedy against aprivate entity like CSC is therefore foreclosed.Respondent claims that even under Meyer's deterrence rationale, implying a suit against private corporations actingunder color of federal law is still necessary to advance thecore deterrence purpose of Bivens. He argues that becausecorporations respond to market pressures and make decisions without regard to constitutional obligations, requiringpayment for the constitutional harms they commit is the bestway to discourage future harms. That may be so, but it hasno relevance to Bivens, which is concerned solely with deterring the unconstitutional acts of individual officers. If deterring the conduct of a policymaking entity was the purposeof Bivens, then Meyer would have implied a damages remedyagainst the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; it wasafter all an agency policy that led to Meyer's constitutionaldeprivation. Meyer, supra, at 473-474. But Bivens fromits inception has been based not on that premise, but on thedeterrence of individual officers who commit unconstitutional acts.There is no reason for us to consider extending Bivensbeyond this core premise here.5 To begin with, no federal5 Justice Stevens claims that our holding in favor of CSC portends"tragic consequence[s]," post, at 81, and "jeopardize[s] the constitutionalrights of . . . tens of thousands of inmates," ibid. He refers to examples534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN72 CORRECTIONAL SERVICES CORP. v. MALESKOOpinion of the Courtprisoners enjoy respondent's contemplated remedy. If afederal prisoner in a BOP facility alleges a constitutionaldeprivation, he may bring a Bivens claim against the offend-ing individual officer, subject to the defense of qualified immunity. The prisoner may not bring a Bivens claim againstthe officer's employer, the United States, or the BOP. Withrespect to the alleged constitutional deprivation, his onlyremedy lies against the individual; a remedyMeyer foundsufficient, and which respondent did not timely pursue.Whether it makes sense to impose asymmetrical liabilitycosts on private prison facilities alone is a question for Congress, not us, to decide.Nor are we confronted with a situation in which claimantsin respondent's shoes lack effective remedies. Cf. Bivens,403 U. S., at 410 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment) ("Forpeople in Bivens' shoes, it is damages or nothing"); Davis,442 U. S., at 245 ("For Davis, as for Bivens, it is damages ornothing" (internal quotaton marks omitted)). It was con-ceded at oral argument that alternative remedies are at leastas great, and in many respects greater, than anything thatcould be had underBivens. Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42, 43. Forexample, federal prisoners in private facilities enjoy a parof cases suggesting that private correctional providers routinely abuse andtake advantage of inmates under their control. Post, at 81, n. 9 (citingBrief for Legal Aid Society of City of New York as Amicus Curiae 8-25).See also Brief for American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 14-16, and n. 6 (citing and discussing "abundant" examples of such abuse).In all but one of these examples, however, the private facility in questionhoused state prisoners--prisoners who already enjoy a right of actionagainst private correctional providers under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. If it istrue that the imperatives for deterring the unconstitutional conduct ofprivate correctional providers are so strong as to demand that we imply anew right of action directly from the Constitution, then abuses of authorityshould be less prevalent in state facilities, where Congress already provides for such liability. That the trend appears to be just the opposite isnot surprising given the BOP's oversight and monitoring of its privatecontract facilities, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 4-5, 24-26, which Justice Stevens does not mention.534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN73Cite as: 534 U. S. 61 (2001)Opinion of the Courtallel tort remedy that is unavailable to prisoners housedin Government facilities. See Brief in Opposition 13. Thiscase demonstrates as much, since respondent's complaint inthe District Court arguably alleged no more than a quintessential claim of negligence. It maintained that namedand unnamed defendants were "negligent in failing to obtainrequisite medication . . . and were further negligent by refusing . . . use of the elevator." App. 12 (emphasis added).It further maintained that respondent suffered injuries "[a]sa result of the negligence of the Defendants." Ibid. (emphasis added). The District Court, however, construed thecomplaint as raising a Bivens claim, presumably underthe Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the EighthAmendment. Respondent accepted this theory of liability,and he has never sought relief on any other ground. This issomewhat ironic, because the heightened "deliberate indifference" standard of Eighth Amendment liability, Estelle v.Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 104 (1976), would make it considerablymore difficult for respondent to prevail than on a theory ofordinary negligence, see, e. g., Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S.825, 835 (1994) ("[D]eliberate indifference describes a stateof mind more blameworthy than negligence").This also makes respondent's situation altogether differentfrom Bivens, in which we found alternative state tort remedies to be "inconsistent or even hostile" to a remedy inferredfrom the Fourth Amendment. 403 U. S., at 393-394. Whena federal officer appears at the door and requests entry, onecannot always be expected to resist. See id., at 394 ("[A]claim of authority to enter is likely to unlock the door"). Yetlack of resistance alone might foreclose a cause of action intrespass or privacy. Ibid. Therefore, we reasoned inBivens that other than an implied constitutional tort remedy,"there remain[ed] . . . but the alternative of resistance, whichmay amount to a crime." Id., at 395 (internal quotationmarks and citation omitted). Such logic does not apply to534US1 Unit: $$U4 [04-21-03 13:40:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN74 CORRECTIONAL SERVICES CORP. v. MALESKOOpinion of the Courtrespondent, whose claim of negligence or deliberate indif-ference requires no resistance to official action, and whoselack of alternative tort remedies was due solely to strategicchoice.6Inmates in respondent's position also have full access toremedial mechanisms established by the BOP, including suitsin federal court for injunctive relief and grievances filedthrough the BOP's Administrative Remedy Program (ARP).See 28 CFR $ 542.10 (2001) (explaining ARP as providing"a process through which inmates may seek formal reviewof an issue which relates to any aspect of their confinement").This program provides yet another means through which allegedly unconstitutional actions and policies can be broughtto the attention of the BOP and prevented from recurring.And unlike the Bivens remedy, which we have never consid-ered a proper vehicle for altering an entity's policy, injunctive relief has long been recognized as the proper means forpreventing entities from acting unconstitutionally.In sum, respondent is not a plaintiff in search of a rem-edy as in Bivens and Davis. Nor does he seek a cause ofaction against an individual officer, otherwise lacking, as inCarlson. Respondent instead seeks a marked extension ofBivens, to contexts that would not advance Bivens' corepurpose of deterring individual officers from engaging in unconstitutional wrongdoing. The caution toward extendingBivens remedies into any new context, a caution consistentlyand repeatedly recognized for three decades, forecloses suchan extension here.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
