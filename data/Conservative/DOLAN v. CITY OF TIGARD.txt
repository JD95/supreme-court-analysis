Petitioner challenges the decision of the Oregon SupremeCourt which held that the city of Tigard could condition theapproval of her building permit on the dedication of a portionof her property for flood control and traffic improvements.317 Ore. 110, 854 P. 2d 437 (1993). We granted certiorarito resolve a question left open by our decision inNollan v.California Coastal Comm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), of whatis the required degree of connection between the exactionsimposed by the city and the projected impacts of the proposed development. IThe State of Oregon enacted a comprehensive land usemanagement program in 1973. Ore. Rev. Stat. $$ 197.005-197.860 (1991). The program required all Oregon citiesand counties to adopt new comprehensive land use plansthat were consistent with the statewide planning goals.$$ 197.175(1), 197.250. The plans are implemented by landuse regulations which are part of an integrated hierarchyof legally binding goals, plans, and regulations. $$ 197.175,197.175(2)(b). Pursuant to the State's requirements, the cityof Tigard, a community of some 30,000 residents on thesouthwest edge of Portland, developed a comprehensive planand codified it in its Community Development Code (CDC).The CDC requires property owners in the area zoned Central Business District to comply with a 15% open space andlandscaping requirement, which limits total site coverage, in-cluding all structures and paved parking, to 85% of the parcel.

The CDC requires that newdevelopment facilitate this plan by dedicating land for pedes-trian pathways where provided for in the pedestrian/ bicyclepathway plan.1The city also adopted a Master Drainage Plan (DrainagePlan). The Drainage Plan noted that flooding occurred inseveral areas along Fanno Creek, including areas near petitioner's property. Record, Doc. No. F, ch. 2, pp. 2-5 to 2-8;4-2 to 4-6; Figure 4-1. The Drainage Plan also establishedthat the increase in impervious surfaces associated with con-tinued urbanization would exacerbate these flooding problems. To combat these risks, the Drainage Plan suggested aseries of improvements to the Fanno Creek Basin, includingchannel excavation in the area next to petitioner's property.App. to Pet. for Cert. G-13, G-38. Other recommendationsincluded ensuring that the floodplain remains free of struc-tures and that it be preserved as greenways to minimizeflood damage to structures. Record, Doc. No. F, ch. 5,pp. 5-16 to 5-21. The Drainage Plan concluded that the costof these improvements should be shared based on both directand indirect benefits, with property owners along the waterways paying more due to the direct benefit that they wouldreceive.Id., ch. 8, p. 8-11. CDC Chapters 18.84 and 18.861 CDC $ 18.86.040.A.1.b provides: "The development shall facilitatepedestrian/ bicycle circulation if the site is located on a street with designated bikepaths or adjacent to a designated greenway/open space/park.Specific items to be addressed [include]: (i) Provision of efficient, convenient and continuous pedestrian and bicycle transit circulation systems,linking developments by requiring dedication and construction of pedestrian and bikepaths identified in the comprehensive plan.

The store covers approximately 9,700square feet on the eastern side of a 1.67-acre parcel, whichincludes a gravel parking lot. Fanno Creek flows throughthe southwestern corner of the lot and along its westernboundary. The year-round flow of the creek renders thearea within the creek's 100-year floodplain virtually unusablefor commercial development. The city's comprehensive planincludes the Fanno Creek floodplain as part of the city'sgreenway system.Petitioner applied to the city for a permit to redevelop thesite. Her proposed plans called for nearly doubling the sizeof the store to 17,600 square feet and paving a 39-space parking lot. The existing store, located on the opposite side ofthe parcel, would be razed in sections as construction progressed on the new building. In the second phase of theproject, petitioner proposed to build an additional structureon the northeast side of the site for complementary busi-nesses and to provide more parking. The proposed expansion and intensified use are consistent with the city's zoningscheme in the Central Business District. CDC $ 18.66.030,App. to Brief for Petitioner C-1 to C-3.The City Planning Commission (Commission) granted petitioner's permit application subject to conditions imposed bythe city's CDC. The CDC establishes the following standard for site development review approval:"Where landfill and/or development is allowed withinand adjacent to the 100-year floodplain, the City shallrequire the dedication of sufficient open land area forgreenway adjoining and within the floodplain. Thisarea shall include portions at a suitable elevation for theconstruction of a pedestrian/ bicycle pathway within the512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT380 DOLAN v.

CDC $ 18.120.180.A.8, App. to Brief forRespondent B-45 to B-46.Thus, the Commission required that petitioner dedicate theportion of her property lying within the 100-year floodplainfor improvement of a storm drainage system along FannoCreek and that she dedicate an additional 15-foot strip ofland adjacent to the floodplain as a pedestrian/ bicycle pathway.2 The dedication required by that condition encom-passes approximately 7,000 square feet, or roughly 10% ofthe property. In accordance with city practice, petitionercould rely on the dedicated property to meet the 15% openspace and landscaping requirement mandated by the city'szoning scheme. App. to Pet. for Cert.

Id.,at E-4. The Commission denied the request.The Commission made a series of findings concerning therelationship between the dedicated conditions and the pro-jected impacts of petitioner's project. First, the Commission noted that "[i]t is reasonable to assume that customersand employees of the future uses of this site could utilize apedestrian/ bicycle pathway adjacent to this development fortheir transportation and recreational needs." City of Tigard Planning Commission Final Order No. 91-09 PC, App.to Pet. for Cert. G-24. The Commission noted that the siteplan has provided for bicycle parking in a rack in front of theproposed building and "[i]t is reasonable to expect that someof the users of the bicycle parking provided for by the siteplan will use the pathway adjacent to Fanno Creek if it isconstructed." Ibid. In addition, the Commission foundthat creation of a convenient, safe pedestrian/ bicycle pathway system as an alternative means of transportation "couldplan, to any other applicable policies and standards, and to other properties in the same zoning district or vicinity;"(2) There are special circumstances that exist which are peculiar to thelot size or shape, topography or other circumstances over which the applicant has no control, and which are not applicable to other properties inthe same zoning district;"(3) The use proposed will be the same as permitted under this title andCity standards will be maintained to the greatest extent possible, whilepermitting some economic use of the land;"(4) Existing physical and natural systems, such as but not limited to traffic, drainage, dramatic land forms, or parks will not be adversely affectedany more than would occur if the development were located as specifiedin the title; and"(5) The hardship is not self-imposed and the variance requested is theminimum variance which would alleviate the hardship."

CITY OF TIGARDOpinion of the Courtoffset some of the traffic demand on [nearby] streets andlessen the increase in traffic congestion."Ibid.The Commission went on to note that the required flood-plain dedication would be reasonably related to petitioner'srequest to intensify the use of the site given the increasein the impervious surface. The Commission stated that the"anticipated increased storm water flow from the subjectproperty to an already strained creek and drainage basin canonly add to the public need to manage the stream channeland floodplain for drainage purposes." Id., at G-37. Basedon this anticipated increased storm water flow, the Commission concluded that "the requirement of dedication of thefloodplain area on the site is related to the applicant's plan tointensify development on the site." Ibid. The Tigard CityCouncil approved the Commission's final order, subject toone minor modification; the city council reassigned the responsibility for surveying and marking the floodplain areafrom petitioner to the city's engineering department. Id.,at G-7.Petitioner appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals(LUBA) on the ground that the city's dedication requirements were not related to the proposed development, and,therefore, those requirements constituted an uncompensatedtaking of her property under the Fifth Amendment. Inevaluating the federal taking claim, LUBA assumed that thecity's findings about the impacts of the proposed development were supported by substantial evidence. Dolan v. Tigard, LUBA 91-161 (Jan. 7, 1992), reprinted at App. to Pet.for Cert. D-15, n. 9. Given the undisputed fact that the proposed larger building and paved parking area would increasethe amount of impervious surfaces and the runoff into FannoCreek, LUBA concluded that "there is a `reasonable relationship' between the proposed development and the requirement to dedicate land along Fanno Creek for a greenway."Id., at D-16. With respect to the pedestrian/ bicycle pathway, LUBA noted the Commission's finding that a signifi512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT383Cite as: 512 U. S. 374 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcantly larger retail sales building and parking lot would at-tract larger numbers of customers and employees and theirvehicles. It again found a "reasonable relationship" be-tween alleviating the impacts of increased traffic from thedevelopment and facilitating the provision of a pedestrian/bicycle pathway as an alternative means of transportation.Ibid.The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting petitioner's contention that in Nollan v. California CoastalComm'n, 483 U. S. 825 (1987), we had abandoned the "reason-able relationship" test in favor of a stricter "essential nexus"test. 113 Ore. App. 162, 832 P. 2d 853 (1992). The OregonSupreme Court affirmed. 317 Ore. 110, 854 P. 2d 437 (1993).The court also disagreed with petitioner's contention thattheNollan Court abandoned the "reasonably related" test.317 Ore., at 118, 854 P. 2d, at 442. Instead, the court readNollan to mean that an "exaction is reasonably related to animpact if the exaction serves the same purpose that a denialof the permit would serve." 317 Ore., at 120, 854 P. 2d, at443. The court decided that both the pedestrian/ bicyclepathway condition and the storm drainage dedication had anessential nexus to the development of the proposed site.Id.,at 121, 854 P. 2d, at 443. Therefore, the court found theconditions to be reasonably related to the impact of theexpansion of petitioner's business. Ibid.4 We granted certiorari, 510 U.

Accordingly, wedo not pass on the constitutionality of the city's variance provisions.512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT384 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARDOpinion of the Courtcago, 166 U. S. 226, 239 (1897), provides: "[N]or shall privateproperty be taken for public use, without just compensation." 5 One of the principal purposes of the Takings Clauseis "to bar Government from forcing some people alone tobear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, shouldbe borne by the public as a whole."Armstrong v. UnitedStates, 364 U. S. 40, 49 (1960). Without question, had thecity simply required petitioner to dedicate a strip of landalong Fanno Creek for public use, rather than conditioningthe grant of her permit to redevelop her property on such adedication, a taking would have occurred. Nollan, supra,at 831. Such public access would deprive petitioner of theright to exclude others, "one of the most essential sticks inthe bundle of rights that are commonly characterized asproperty."Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U. S. 164,176 (1979).On the other side of the ledger, the authority of state andlocal governments to engage in land use planning has beensustained against constitutional challenge as long ago as ourdecision inVillage of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S.365 (1926). "Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished5 Justice Stevens' dissent suggests that this case is actually groundedin "substantive" due process, rather than in the view that the TakingsClause of the Fifth Amendment was made applicable to the States by theFourteenth Amendment. But there is no doubt that later cases have heldthat the Fourteenth Amendment does make the Takings Clause of theFifth Amendment applicable to the States, see Penn Central Transp. Co.v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 122 (1978); Nollan v. California CoastalComm'n, 483 U. S. 825, 827 (1987). Nor is there any doubt that thesecases have relied upon Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U. S. 226(1897), to reach that result. See, e. g., Penn Central, supra, at 122 ("Theissu[e] presented . . .

S. 374 (1994)Opinion of the Courtwithout paying for every such change in the general law."Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 413 (1922).A land use regulation does not effect a taking if it "substan-tially advance[s] legitimate state interests" and does not"den[y] an owner economically viable use of his land."Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255, 260 (1980).6The sort of land use regulations discussed in the cases justcited, however, differ in two relevant particulars from thepresent case. First, they involved essentially legislative determinations classifying entire areas of the city, whereashere the city made an adjudicative decision to condition petitioner's application for a building permit on an individualparcel. Second, the conditions imposed were not simply alimitation on the use petitioner might make of her own par-cel, but a requirement that she deed portions of the propertyto the city. In Nollan, supra, we held that governmentalauthority to exact such a condition was circumscribed by theFifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Under the well-settleddoctrine of "unconstitutional conditions," the governmentmay not require a person to give up a constitutional right--here the right to receive just compensation when propertyis taken for a public use--in exchange for a discretionarybenefit conferred by the government where the benefitsought has little or no relationship to the property. SeePerry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593 (1972); Pickering v.Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty.,391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968).Petitioner contends that the city has forced her to choosebetween the building permit and her right under the Fifth6 There can be no argument that the permit conditions would deprivepetitioner of "economically beneficial us[e]" of her property as she currently operates a retail store on the lot. Petitioner assuredly is able toderive some economic use from her property. See, e. g., Lucas v. SouthCarolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1019 (1992); Kaiser Aetna v.United States, 444 U. S. 164, 175 (1979); Penn Central Transp. Co. v. NewYork City, supra, at 124.512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT386 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARDOpinion of the CourtAmendment to just compensation for the public easements.Petitioner does not quarrel with the city's authority to exactsome forms of dedication as a condition for the grant of abuilding permit, but challenges the showing made by the cityto justify these exactions. She argues that the city hasidentified "no special benefits" conferred on her, and has notidentified any "special quantifiable burdens" created by hernew store that would justify the particular dedications required from her which are not required from the public atlarge.IIIIn evaluating petitioner's claim, we must first determinewhether the "essential nexus" exists between the "legitimatestate interest" and the permit condition exacted by the city.Nollan, 483 U. S., at 837. If we find that a nexus exists, wemust then decide the required degree of connection betweenthe exactions and the projected impact of the proposed de-velopment. We were not required to reach this question inNollan, because we concluded that the connection did notmeet even the loosest standard. Id., at 838. Here, however, we must decide this question.AWe addressed the essential nexus question in Nollan.The California Coastal Commission demanded a lateral public easement across the Nollans' beachfront lot in exchangefor a permit to demolish an existing bungalow and replace itwith a three-bedroom house. Id., at 828. The public ease-ment was designed to connect two public beaches that wereseparated by the Nollans' property. The Coastal Commis-sion had asserted that the public easement condition was imposed to promote the legitimate state interest of diminishingthe "blockage of the view of the ocean" caused by construction of the larger house.We agreed that the Coastal Commission's concern withprotecting visual access to the ocean constituted a legitimate512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT387Cite as: 512 U. S. 374 (1994)Opinion of the Courtpublic interest. Id., at 835. We also agreed that the permitcondition would have been constitutional "even if it consistedof the requirement that the Nollans provide a viewing spoton their property for passersby with whose sighting of theocean their new house would interfere." Id., at 836. Weresolved, however, that the Coastal Commission's regulatoryauthority was set completely adrift from its constitutionalmoorings when it claimed that a nexus existed between vis-ual access to the ocean and a permit condition requiring lateral public access along the Nollans' beachfront lot. Id., at837. How enhancing the public's ability to "traverse to andalong the shorefront" served the same governmental purpose of "visual access to the ocean" from the roadway wasbeyond our ability to countenance. The absence of a nexusleft the Coastal Commission in the position of simply tryingto obtain an easement through gimmickry, which converteda valid regulation of land use into " `an out-and-out plan ofextortion.' " Ibid., quoting J. E. D. Associates, Inc. v. Atkinson, 121 N. H. 581, 584, 432 A. 2d 12, 14-15 (1981).No such gimmicks are associated with the permit conditions imposed by the city in this case. Undoubtedly, theprevention of flooding along Fanno Creek and the reductionof traffic congestion in the Central Business District qualifyas the type of legitimate public purposes we have upheld.Agins, 447 U. S., at 260-262. It seems equally obvious thata nexus exists between preventing flooding along FannoCreek and limiting development within the creek's 100-yearfloodplain. Petitioner proposes to double the size of her retail store and to pave her now-gravel parking lot, therebyexpanding the impervious surface on the property and increasing the amount of storm water runoff into Fanno Creek.The same may be said for the city's attempt to reduce traffic congestion by providing for alternative means of transportation. In theory, a pedestrian/ bicycle pathway provides auseful alternative means of transportation for workers andshoppers: "Pedestrians and bicyclists occupying dedicated512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT388 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARDOpinion of the Courtspaces for walking and/or bicycling . . . remove potential ve-hicles from streets, resulting in an overall improvement intotal transportation system flow." A. Nelson, Public Provi-sion of Pedestrian and Bicycle Access Ways: Public PolicyRationale and the Nature of Private Benefits 11, Center forPlanning Development, Georgia Institute of Technology,Working Paper Series (Jan. 1994). See also Intermodal Sur-face Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-240,105 Stat. 1914 (recognizing pedestrian and bicycle facilitiesas necessary components of any strategy to reduce trafficcongestion). BThe second part of our analysis requires us to determinewhether the degree of the exactions demanded by the city'spermit conditions bears the required relationship to the pro-jected impact of petitioner's proposed development.Nollan, supra, at 834, quoting Penn Central Transp. Co. v. NewYork City, 438 U. S. 104, 127 (1978) (" `[A] use restriction mayconstitute a "taking" if not reasonably necessary to the effec-tuation of a substantial government purpose' "). Here theOregon Supreme Court deferred to what it termed the "city'sunchallenged factual findings" supporting the dedication conditions and found them to be reasonably related to the im-pact of the expansion of petitioner's business. 317 Ore., at120-121, 854 P. 2d, at 443.The city required that petitioner dedicate "to the City asGreenway all portions of the site that fall within the existing100-year floodplain [of Fanno Creek] . . . and all property 15feet above [the floodplain] boundary." Id., at 113, n. 3, 854P. 2d, at 439, n. 3. In addition, the city demanded that theretail store be designed so as not to intrude into the green-way area. The city relies on the Commission's rather tentative findings that increased storm water flow from petition-er's property "can only add to the public need to manage the[floodplain] for drainage purposes" to support its conclusionthat the "requirement of dedication of the floodplain area on512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT389Cite as: 512 U. S. 374 (1994)Opinion of the Courtthe site is related to the applicant's plan to intensify develop-ment on the site." City of Tigard Planning CommissionFinal Order No. 91-09 PC, App. to Pet. for Cert. G-37.The city made the following specific findings relevant tothe pedestrian/ bicycle pathway:"In addition, the proposed expanded use of this site isanticipated to generate additional vehicular trafficthereby increasing congestion on nearby collectorand arterial streets. Creation of a convenient, safepedestrian/ bicycle pathway system as an alternativemeans of transportation could offset some of the trafficdemand on these nearby streets and lessen the increasein traffic congestion." Id., at G-24.The question for us is whether these findings are constitu-tionally sufficient to justify the conditions imposed by thecity on petitioner's building permit. Since state courts havebeen dealing with this question a good deal longer than wehave, we turn to representative decisions made by them.In some States, very generalized statements as to the necessary connection between the required dedication and theproposed development seem to suffice. See,e. g., BillingsProperties, Inc. v. Yellowstone County, 144 Mont. 25, 394P. 2d 182 (1964); Jenad, Inc. v. Scarsdale, 18 N. Y. 2d 78, 218N. E. 2d 673 (1966). We think this standard is too lax toadequately protect petitioner's right to just compensation ifher property is taken for a public purpose.Other state courts require a very exacting correspondence,described as the "specifi[c] and uniquely attributable" test.The Supreme Court of Illinois first developed this test inPioneer Trust & Savings Bank v. Mount Prospect, 22 Ill. 2d375, 380, 176 N. E. 2d 799, 802 (1961).7 Under this standard,7 The "specifically and uniquely attributable" test has now been adoptedby a minority of other courts. See, e. g., J. E. D. Associates, Inc. v. Atkinson, 121 N. H. 581, 585, 432 A. 2d 12, 15 (1981); Divan Builders, Inc. v.Planning Bd. of Twp. of Wayne, 66 N. J. 582, 600-601, 334 A. 2d 30, 40512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT390 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARDOpinion of the Courtif the local government cannot demonstrate that its exactionis directly proportional to the specifically created need, theexaction becomes "a veiled exercise of the power of eminentdomain and a confiscation of private property behind the defense of police regulations." Id., at 381, 176 N. E. 2d, at 802.We do not think the Federal Constitution requires such exacting scrutiny, given the nature of the interests involved.A number of state courts have taken an intermediate position, requiring the municipality to show a "reasonable rela-tionship" between the required dedication and the impact ofthe proposed development. Typical is the Supreme Courtof Nebraska's opinion inSimpson v. North Platte, 206 Neb.240, 245, 292 N. W. 2d 297, 301 (1980), where that courtstated:"The distinction, therefore, which must be made be-tween an appropriate exercise of the police power andan improper exercise of eminent domain is whether therequirement has some reasonable relationship or nexusto the use to which the property is being made or ismerely being used as an excuse for taking property simply because at that particular moment the landowner isasking the city for some license or permit."Thus, the court held that a city may not require a propertyowner to dedicate private property for some future publicuse as a condition of obtaining a building permit when suchfuture use is not "occasioned by the construction sought tobe permitted." Id., at 248, 292 N. W. 2d, at 302.Some form of the reasonable relationship test has beenadopted in many other jurisdictions. See, e. g., Jordan v.Menomonee Falls, 28 Wis. 2d 608, 137 N. W. 2d 442 (1965);Collis v. Bloomington, 310 Minn. 5, 246 N. W. 2d 19 (1976)(requiring a showing of a reasonable relationship between(1975); McKain v.

Watson, 716F. 2d 646, 651-653 (CA9 1983).We think the "reasonable relationship" test adopted by amajority of the state courts is closer to the federal constitu-tional norm than either of those previously discussed. Butwe do not adopt it as such, partly because the term "rea-sonable relationship" seems confusingly similar to the term"rational basis" which describes the minimal level of scru-tiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the FourteenthAmendment. We think a term such as "rough proportional-ity" best encapsulates what we hold to be the requirementof the Fifth Amendment. No precise mathematical calcula-tion is required, but the city must make some sort of individualized determination that the required dedication is relatedboth in nature and extent to the impact of the proposeddevelopment.88 Justice Stevens' dissent takes us to task for placing the burden onthe city to justify the required dedication. He is correct in arguing thatin evaluating most generally applicable zoning regulations, the burdenproperly rests on the party challenging the regulation to prove that itconstitutes an arbitrary regulation of property rights. See, e. g., Villageof Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 (1926). Here, by contrast,the city made an adjudicative decision to condition petitioner's applicationfor a building permit on an individual parcel. In this situation, the burdenproperly rests on the city. See Nollan, 483 U. S., at 836. This conclusionis not, as he suggests, undermined by our decision in Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977), in which we struck down a housing ordinance512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT392 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARDOpinion of the CourtJustice Stevens' dissent relies upon a law review articlefor the proposition that the city's conditional demands forpart of petitioner's property are "a species of business regu-lation that heretofore warranted a strong presumption ofconstitutional validity." Post, at 402. But simply denomi-nating a governmental measure as a "business regulation"does not immunize it from constitutional challenge on theground that it violates a provision of the Bill of Rights. InMarshall v. Barlow's, Inc., 436 U. S. 307 (1978), we held thata statute authorizing a warrantless search of business premises in order to detect OSHA violations violated the FourthAmendment. See alsoAir Pollution Variance Bd. of Colo.v.Western Alfalfa Corp., 416 U. S. 861 (1974); New York v.Burger, 482 U. S. 691 (1987). And in Central Hudson Gas &Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557(1980), we held that an order of the New York Public ServiceCommission, designed to cut down the use of electricitybecause of a fuel shortage, violated the First Amendmentinsofar as it prohibited advertising by a utility company topromote the use of electricity. We see no reason why theTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a part ofthe Bill of Rights as the First Amendment or Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the status of a poor relation inthese comparable circumstances. We turn now to analysis of whether the findings relied upon by the city here,first with respect to the floodplain easement, and secondwith respect to the pedestrian/ bicycle path, satisfied theserequirements.It is axiomatic that increasing the amount of impervioussurface will increase the quantity and rate of storm waterflow from petitioner's property. Record, Doc. No. F, ch. 4,that limited occupancy of a dwelling unit to members of a single family asviolating the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Theordinance at issue in Moore intruded on choices concerning family livingarrangements, an area in which the usual deference to the legislature wasfound to be inappropriate.

Therefore, keeping the floodplain open and freefrom development would likely confine the pressures onFanno Creek created by petitioner's development. In fact,because petitioner's property lies within the Central Business District, the CDC already required that petitioner leave15% of it as open space and the undeveloped floodplain wouldhave nearly satisfied that requirement. App. to Pet. forCert. G-16 to G-17. But the city demanded more--it notonly wanted petitioner not to build in the floodplain, but italso wanted petitioner's property along Fanno Creek for itsgreenway system. The city has never said why a publicgreenway, as opposed to a private one, was required in theinterest of flood control.The difference to petitioner, of course, is the loss of herability to exclude others. As we have noted, this right toexclude others is "one of the most essential sticks in the bundle of rights that are commonly characterized as property."Kaiser Aetna, 444 U. S., at 176. It is difficult to see whyrecreational visitors trampling along petitioner's floodplaineasement are sufficiently related to the city's legitimate interest in reducing flooding problems along Fanno Creek, andthe city has not attempted to make any individualized determination to support this part of its request.The city contends that the recreational easement along thegreenway is only ancillary to the city's chief purpose in controlling flood hazards. It further asserts that unlike the residential property at issue in Nollan, petitioner's property iscommercial in character and, therefore, her right to excludeothers is compromised. Brief for Respondent 41, quotingUnited States v. Orito, 413 U. S. 139, 142 (1973) (" `The Constitution extends special safeguards to the privacy of thehome' "). The city maintains that "[t]here is nothing to suggest that preventing [petitioner] from prohibiting [the easements] will unreasonably impair the value of [her] propertyas a [retail store]." PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins,447 U. S. 74, 83 (1980).512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT394 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARDOpinion of the CourtAdmittedly, petitioner wants to build a bigger store toattract members of the public to her property. She alsowants, however, to be able to control the time and mannerin which they enter. The recreational easement on thegreenway is different in character from the exercise ofstate-protected rights of free expression and petition thatwe permitted inPruneYard. In PruneYard, we held that amajor private shopping center that attracted more than25,000 daily patrons had to provide access to persons exercising their state constitutional rights to distribute pamphletsand ask passers-by to sign their petitions.Id., at 85. Webased our decision, in part, on the fact that the shoppingcenter "may restrict expressive activity by adopting time,place, and manner regulations that will minimize any interference with its commercial functions." Id., at 83. Bycontrast, the city wants to impose a permanent recreationaleasement upon petitioner's property that borders FannoCreek. Petitioner would lose all rights to regulate the timein which the public entered onto the greenway, regardless ofany interference it might pose with her retail store. Herright to exclude would not be regulated, it would beeviscerated.If petitioner's proposed development had somehow encroached on existing greenway space in the city, it wouldhave been reasonable to require petitioner to provide somealternative greenway space for the public either on her property or elsewhere. See Nollan, 483 U. S., at 836 ("Althoughsuch a requirement, constituting a permanent grant of continuous access to the property, would have to be considereda taking if it were not attached to a development permit, theCommission's assumed power to forbid construction of thehouse in order to protect the public's view of the beach mustsurely include the power to condition construction upon someconcession by the owner, even a concession of propertyrights, that serves the same end"). But that is not the casehere. We conclude that the findings upon which the city re512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT395Cite as: 512 U. S. 374 (1994)Opinion of the Courtlies do not show the required reasonable relationship be-tween the floodplain easement and the petitioner's proposednew building.With respect to the pedestrian/ bicycle pathway, we haveno doubt that the city was correct in finding that the largerretail sales facility proposed by petitioner will increase traffic on the streets of the Central Business District. The cityestimates that the proposed development would generateroughly 435 additional trips per day.9 Dedications forstreets, sidewalks, and other public ways are generally reasonable exactions to avoid excessive congestion from a pro-posed property use. But on the record before us, the cityhas not met its burden of demonstrating that the additionalnumber of vehicle and bicycle trips generated by petitioner'sdevelopment reasonably relate to the city's requirement fora dedication of the pedestrian/ bicycle pathway easement.The city simply found that the creation of the pathway "couldoffset some of the traffic demand . . . and lessen the increasein traffic congestion." 10As Justice Peterson of the Supreme Court of Oregon explained in his dissenting opinion, however, "[t]he findings offact that the bicycle pathway system `could offset some ofthe traffic demand' is a far cry from a finding that the bicyclepathway system will, or is likely to, offset some of the trafficdemand." 317 Ore., at 127, 854 P. 2d, at 447 (emphasis inoriginal). No precise mathematical calculation is required,but the city must make some effort to quantify its findings in9 The city uses a weekday average trip rate of 53.21 trips per 1,000square feet. Additional Trips Generated = 53.21 @ (17,600 !9,720).App. to Pet. for Cert. G-15.10 In rejecting petitioner's request for a variance from the pathway dedication condition, the city stated that omitting the planned section of thepathway across petitioner's property would conflict with its adopted policyof providing a continuous pathway system. But the Takings Clause requires the city to implement its policy by condemnation unless the required relationship between petitioner's development and added traffic isshown.512us2$81H 01-08-98 12:34:37 PAGES OPINPGT396 DOLAN v. CITY OF TIGARDStevens, J., dissentingsupport of the dedication for the pedestrian/ bicycle pathwaybeyond the conclusory statement that it could offset some ofthe traffic demand generated.IVCities have long engaged in the commendable task of landuse planning, made necessary by increasing urbanization,particularly in metropolitan areas such as Portland. Thecity's goals of reducing flooding hazards and traffic congestion, and providing for public greenways, are laudable, butthere are outer limits to how this may be done.
