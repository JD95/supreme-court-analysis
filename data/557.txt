2  POLAR  TANKERS,  INC.  v.  CITY  OF  VALDEZ 

Syllabus 
(a)  This  Court has  consistently interpreted  the  language  of the  Ton-
nage  Clause  in  light  of  its  purpose,  which  mirrors  the  intent  of  other 
constitutional provisions that seek to restrain the States from exercising 
the  taxing  power  in  a  way  that  is  injurious  to  the  interests  of  other 
States.  The Clause seeks to prevent States from nullifying Art. I, $ 10, 
cl. 2's  prohibition against import  and export  duties by taxing "the ves-
sels transporting the merchandise."  Clyde Mallory Lines v.  Alabama 
ex rel. State Docks Comm'n, 296 U. S. 261, 265.  It also reflects an effort 
to diminish a State's ability to obtain tax advantages based on its favor-
able  geographic  position.  Because  the  Clause  forbids  a  State  to  "do 
that  indirectly  which  she  is  forbidden  . . . to  do  directly,"  Passenger 
Cases, 7 How. 283, 458, the "prohibition against tonnage duties has been 
deemed  to  embrace  all  taxes  and  duties  regardless  of  their  name  or 
form, and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel, which 
operate to  impose a  charge for  the privilege of  entering, trading  in, or 
lying in a port," Clyde Mallory Lines, supra, at 265-266.  Pp. 6-9. 

(b)  This  case  lies  at  the  heart  of  what  the  Tonnage  Clause  forbids. 
The ordinance  seems  designed  to impose "a  charge for the  privilege of 
entering, trading in, or lying in a port."  The tax applies almost exclu-
sively to oil tankers, but to no other form of personal property.  An oil 
tanker  can  be subject  to  the  tax based  on  a  single  entry into  the  port. 
Moreover,  the  tax  is  closely  correlated  with  cargo  capacity.  Contrary 
to Valdez's argument, the fact that the tax is designed to raise revenue 
for general municipal services argues for, not against, application of the 
Clause.  Pp. 9-11.

Syllabus 
oil-related  property  provided  by  state law.  But  Valdez's  tax,  a  purely 
municipal tax,  differs from  the tax on other  oil-related property, which 
is  primarily  a  state-level  tax,  in  several  ways.  As  a  result  of  these 
differences, an ordinary oil-related business finding the tax on its mov-
able  property  too  burdensome  must  complain  to  the  State,  which  is  in 
charge of setting the manner of assessment and valuation.  At the same 
time, an oil tanker finding its vessel tax too burdensome must complain 
to Valdez, for the State has nothing to do with that tax's rate, valuation, 
or  assessment.  There  is  also  no  effective  electorate-related  check  on 
Valdez's vessel-taxing power comparable to the check available when a 
property tax is more broadly imposed.  Valdez's property tax hits only 
ships; it is not constrained by any need to treat ships and other business 
property alike.  Thus, Valdez's tax lacks the safeguards implied by this 
Court's  statements  that  a  property  tax  on  ships  escapes  the  Tonnage 
Clause's  scope  only  when  that  tax  is  imposed  upon  ships  "in  the  same 
manner" as it is imposed on other forms of property.  Pp. 11-16.

In  1999,  the 

Opinion of the Court 

I 
city  of  Valdez,  Alaska  (City  or  Valdez), adopted an ordinance imposing a personal property tax upon 

"[b]oats  and  vessels  of  at  least  95  feet  in  length"  that  regu-larly  travel  to  the  City,  are  kept  or  used  within  the  City,  or 
which annually take on at least $1 million worth of cargo  or engage  in  other  business  transactions  of  comparable  value 
in  the  City.  Valdez  Ordinance  No.  99-17  (1999)  (codified  as Valdez  Municipal  Code  $ 3.12.020  (2008)).  The  ordinance 
contains  exceptions  that,  in  effect,  limit  the  tax's  applicabil-ity  primarily  to  large  oil  tankers.  Ibid.  And  the  City  ap-
plies  the  tax  in  accordance  with  a  value-allocation  system that  adjusts  the  amount  owed  downwards  insofar  as  the 
tankers spend  time in other  ports.  Valdez,  Alaska,  Resolu-tion No. 00-15, App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a-56a. 

Polar  Tankers,  Inc.,  a  subsidiary  of  ConocoPhillips,  owns vessels  that  transport  crude  oil  from  a  terminal  in  the  Port 
of  Valdez  (located  at  the  southern  end  of  the  Trans  Alaska Pipeline  System)  to  refineries  in  California,  Hawaii,  and 
Washington.  In  August  2000,  Polar  Tankers  filed  a  lawsuit in  Alaska Superior Court challenging the  tax as unconstitu-
tional.  Polar  Tankers  argued  that  the  tax  effectively  im-posed  a  fee  on  certain  vessels  for  the  privilege  of  entering 
the  port;  hence  it  amounted  to  a  constitutionally  forbidden "Duty  of  Tonnage."  It  also  argued  that  the  tax  calculation 
method  (as  applied  to  vessels  with  a  tax  situs  elsewhere) violated  the  Commerce  and  Due  Process  Clauses  by  fail-
ing  to  take  account  of  the  time  a  ship  spent  at  sea  or  being serviced  or  repaired.  Polar  Tankers  said  that  the  method 
thereby overstated the percentage of the ship's total earning capacity  reasonably  allocated  to  time  spent  in  the  Port  of 
Valdez. The  Alaska  Superior  Court  rejected  the  Tonnage  Clause 
claim, but it accepted the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause claim.  And, for that reason, it held the tax unconsti-
tutional.  On  appeal,  the  Alaska  Supreme  Court,  rejecting

Opinion of the Court 
both  claims,  upheld  the  tax.  In  respect  to  the  Tonnage 
Clause claim, the Supreme Court noted that Valdez's tax was 
a  value-based  property  tax  designed  to  pay  for  "services 
available  to  all taxpayers  in  the  city," including  Polar  Tank-
ers;  and  it  concluded  that  "a  charge  based  on  the  value  of 
property is not a duty of tonnage."  182 P. 3d 614, 623 (2008) 
(citing  Transportation  Co.  v.  Wheeling,  99  U. S.  273  (1879)). 
In respect to the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause 
claim,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  Valdez's  allocation 
method was fair, hence constitutional.  182 P. 3d, at 617-622. 

Polar  Tankers  asked  us  to  review  the  Alaska  Supreme 
Court's determination.  And we granted its petition in order 
to do so. 

II  

A  

We  begin,  and  end,  with  Polar  Tankers'  Tonnage  Clause 
claim.  We hold that Valdez's tax is unconstitutional because 
it violates that Clause.  And we consequently need not con-
sider  Polar  Tankers'  alternative  Commerce  Clause  and  Due 
Process Clause argument. 

When  the  Framers  originally  wrote  the  Tonnage  Clause, 
the words it uses, "Duty of Tonnage," referred in commercial 
parlance to "a duty" imposed upon a ship, which duty varies 
according to "the internal cubic capacity of a vessel," i. e., its 
tons of carrying capacity.  Clyde Mallory Lines v.  Alabama 
ex rel.  State Docks Comm'n, 296  U. S. 261, 265  (1935) (citing 
Inman  S. S.  Co.  v.  Tinker,  94  U. S.  238, 243  (1877)); see  also 
T.  Cooley,  Constitutional  Limitations  596  (6th  ed.  1890). 
Over  a  century  ago,  however,  this  Court  found  that  the 
Framers intended those words to refer to more than "a duty" 
that sets a "certain rate on each ton" of capacity.  Steamship 
Co.  v.  Portwardens, 6 Wall. 31, 34 (1867). 

The Court over the course of many years has consistently 
interpreted the language of the Clause in light of its purpose, 
a purpose that mirrors the intent of other constitutional pro-

Opinion of the Court 
visions  which,  like  the  Tonnage  Clause  itself,  seek  to  "re-strai[n]  the  states  themselves  from  the  exercise"  of  the  tax-

ing  power  "injuriously  to  the  interests  of  each  other."  J. Story,  Commentaries  on  the  Constitution  of  the  United 
States $ 497, p. 354 (1833) (abridged version).  Article I, $ 10, cl. 2,  for example,  forbids States to "lay  any Imposts  or Du-
ties  on  Imports  or  Exports."  It  thereby  seeks  to  prevent 
States  with  "convenient  ports"  from  placing  other  States  at an economic  disadvantage by laying  levies that  would "ta[x] 

the  consumption  of  their  neighbours."  3  Records  of  the Federal  Convention  of  1787,  pp.  542,  519  (M.  Farrand  ed. 
1966)  (reprinting  James  Madison,  Preface  to  Debates  in  the 
Convention of 1787 and letter from James Madison to Profes-
sor  Davis,  1832).  The  coastal  States  were  not  to  "take  ad-
vantage  of  their  favorable  geographical  position  in  order  to 
exact  a  price  for  the  use  of  their  ports  from  the  consumers 
dwelling  in  less  advantageously  situated  parts  of  the  coun-
try."  Youngstown  Sheet  &  Tube  Co.  v.  Bowers,  358  U. S. 
534, 556-557 (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part). 

In  writing  the  Tonnage  Clause,  the  Framers  recognized 
that,  if  "the  states had  been  left  free  to  tax  the  privilege  of 
access by vessels to their harbors the prohibition against du-
ties on imports and exports could have been nullified by tax-
ing the vessels transporting the merchandise."  Clyde Mal-
lory  Lines,  supra,  at  265.  And  the  Court  has  understood 
the  Tonnage  Clause  as  seeking  to  prevent  that  nullification. 
See  Steamship  Co.,  supra,  at  34-35;  see  also  Packet  Co.  v. 
Keokuk, 95 U. S. 80, 87 (1877); Gibbons v.  Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 
202  (1824).  It  has  also  understood  the  Clause  as  reflecting 
an  effort  to  diminish  a  State's  ability  to  obtain  certain  geo-
graphical  vessel-related  tax  advantages  whether  the  vessel 
in question transports goods between States and foreign na-
tions or, as here, only between the States.  Compare Inman, 
supra (invalidating a fee applied to ships engaged in foreign 
commerce),  with  Steamship  Co.,  supra  (invalidating  a  tax 
applied to ships engaged in interstate commerce).

8  POLAR  TANKERS,  INC.  v.  CITY  OF  VALDEZ 

Opinion of the Court 
Interpreting  the  Clause  in  light  of  its  "intent,"  id.,  at  34, 
we  have  read  its  language  as  forbidding  a  State  to  "do  that 
indirectly  which  she  is  forbidden  .  .  .  to  do  directly,"  Pas-
senger  Cases,  7  How.  283,  458  (1849)  (opinion  of  Grier,  J.). 
Thus, we have said that the Clause, which literally forbids a 
State  to  "levy  a  duty  or  tax .  . . graduated  on the  tonnage," 
must  also  forbid  a  State  to  "effect  the  same  purpose  by 
merely  changing the  ratio,  and graduating  it  on the  number 
of  masts,  or  of  mariners,  the  size  and  power  of  the  steam-
engine,  or  the  number  of  passengers  which  she  carries." 
Id., at 458-459.  A State cannot take what would otherwise 
amount to a  tax  on the  ship's  capacity and evade  the  Clause 
by  calling  that  tax  "a  charge  on  the  owner  or  supercargo," 
thereby "justify[ing] this evasion of a great principle by pro-
ducing  a dictionary  or a  dictum  to prove  that  a  ship-captain 
is not a vessel, nor a supercargo an import."  Id., at 459. 

The  Court  has  consequently  stated  that  the  Tonnage 
Clause prohibits, "not only a pro rata tax . . . , but any duty 
on the  ship,  whether a fixed sum upon its  whole tonnage, or 
a sum to be ascertained by comparing the amount of tonnage 
with  the  rate  of  duty."  Steamship  Co.,  supra,  at  35.  And, 
summarizing  earlier  cases  while  speaking  for  a  unanimous 
Court, Justice  Stone concluded that  the "prohibition against 
tonnage  duties  has  been  deemed  to  embrace  all  taxes  and 
duties regardless of their name or form, and even though not 
measured by the tonnage of the vessel, which operate to im-
pose  a  charge  for  the  privilege  of  entering,  trading  in,  or 
lying  in  a  port."  Clyde  Mallory  Lines,  supra,  at  265-266. 
Cf. Cannon v.  New Orleans, 20 Wall. 577 (1874) (invalidating 
a tax imposed on ships entering a port, which tax was gradu-
ated based on the ships' capacity and length of stay); Inman, 
supra (invalidating a fee imposed on ships of a certain capac-
ity  that  entered  a  port);  Steamship  Co.,  supra  (invalidating 
a flat tax imposed on every ship that entered a port, regard-
less of the ship's capacity).

Opinion of the Court 
Although  the  Clause  forbids  all  charges,  whatever  their form,  that  impose  "a  charge  for  the  privilege  of  entering, 

trading  in,  or  lying  in  a  port,"  nothing  in  the  history  of  the adoption  of  the  Clause,  the  purpose  of  the  Clause,  or  this 
Court's interpretation of the Clause suggests that it operates as a ban on 

any and all  taxes which  fall on  vessels that use a  State's  port,  harbor,  or  other  waterways.  See  post,  at  17

Opinion of the Court 
Moreover,  the  tax's  application  and  its  amount  depend upon the ship's capacity.  That is to say, the tax applies only 

to large ships (those at least 95 feet in length), while exempt-ing small ones.  See $ 3.12.020(A)(1). 

Nor can  Valdez escape application  of the  Clause  by claim-ing  that  the  ordinance  imposes,  not  a  duty  or  a  tax,  but  a 
fee  or  a  charge  for  "services  rendered"  to  a  "vessel,"  such 
as  "pilotage,"  "wharfage,"  "medical  inspection,"  the  "use of  locks,"  or  the  like. 

Clyde  Mallory  Lines,  296  U. S.,  at 
266;  see  also  Inman,  94  U. S.,  at  243.  To  the  contrary,  the ordinance  creates  a  tax  designed  to  raise  revenue  used  for 

general  municipal  services.  See  182  P.  3d,  at  623;  Valdez, 
Alaska, Resolution No. 00-15, App. to Pet. for Cert. 53a-56a. 
Tonnage Clause precedent makes clear that, where a tax oth-
erwise  qualifies  as  a  duty  of  tonnage,  a  general,  revenue-
raising purpose argues in favor of, not against, application of 
the Clause.  See Steamship Co., 6 Wall., at 34. 

This  case  lies  at  the  heart  of  what  the  Tonnage  Clause 
forbids.  The  ordinance  applies  almost  exclusively  to  oil 
tankers.  And  a  tax  on  the  value  of  such  vessels  is  closely 
correlated  with  cargo  capacity.  Because  the  imposition  of 
the  tax  depends  on  a  factor  related  to  tonnage  and  that 
tonnage-based tax is not for services provided to the vessel, 
it is unconstitutional. 

The  dissent  contends  that  the  tax  does  not  operate  as 
"a  charge  for  the  privilege  of  entering,  trading  in,  or  lying 
in a port," Clyde Mallory Lines, supra, at 265-266--that is, 
as an impermissible tonnage duty--because Valdez levies its 
tax  only  upon  vessels  that  meet  a  "tax  situs"  requirement.

Syllabus 
(b)  Contrary  to  petitioner's  arguments,  the  "$10,000  loss"  provision 
at issue calls for a "circumstance-specific" interpretation, not a "categor-
ical" one.  The "aggravated felony" statute of which it is a part differs 
from  ACCA  in  general,  and  the  "$10,000  loss"  provision  differs  specifi-
cally from ACCA's provisions.  Pp. 36-40. 

(1)  The "aggravated felony" statute at issue resembles ACCA when 
it lists several "offenses" in language that must refer to generic crimes. 
But other "offenses" are listed using language that almost certainly re-
fers  to  specific  circumstances.  Title  8  U. S. C.  $ 1101(a)(43)(P),  for  ex-
ample, after  referring  to  "an offense" that  amounts  to  "falsely  making, 
forging, counterfeiting, mutilating, or altering a passport," adds, "except 
in the case of a first offense for which . . . the alien committed the offense 
for  the  purpose  of  assisting . . . the  alien's  spouse,  child,  or  parent . . .  
to violate a provision of this chapter."  The language about "forging . . . 
passport[s]" may well refer to a generic crime, but the exception cannot 
possibly  refer  to  a  generic  crime,  because  there  is  no  criminal  statute 
that  contains  any  such  exception.  Subparagraph  (M)(ii),  which  refers 
to  an  offense "described  in  [26  U. S. C.  $ 7201]  (relating  to  tax  evasion) 
in which the revenue loss to the Government exceeds $10,000," provides 
another example.  Because no $ 7201 offense has a specific loss amount 
as an  element, the  tax-evasion provision would  be pointless, unless the 
"revenue  loss"  language  calls  for  circumstance-specific  application. 
Here,  the  question  is  to  which  category  subparagraph  (M)(i)  belongs. 
Pp. 36-38. 

(2)  Subparagraph  (M)(i)'s  language  is  consistent  with  a 
circumstance-specific  approach.  The  words  "in  which"  (modifying  "of-
fense")  can  refer  to  the  conduct  involved  "in"  the  commission  of  the 
offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense.  More-
over,  subparagraph  (M)(i)  appears  just  prior  to  subparagraph  (M)(ii), 
the  tax-evasion  provision,  and  their  structures  are  identical.  Where, 
as here, Congress uses similar statutory language and similar statutory 
structure in two adjoining provisions, it normally intends similar inter-
pretations.  IBP, Inc. v.  Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34.  Additionally, apply-
ing  a  categorical approach  would  leave  subparagraph (M)(i)  with  little, 
if any, meaningful application.  Only three federal fraud statutes appear 
to  contain  a  relevant  monetary  loss  threshold.  And  at  the  time  the 
$10,000  threshold  was  added,  only  eight  States  had  fraud  and  deceit 
statutes in respect to which that threshold, as categorically interpreted, 
would have full effect.  Congress is unlikely to have intended subpara-
graph  (M)(i)  to  apply  in  such  a  limited  and  haphazard  manner. 
Pp. 38-40. 

(c)  This  Court  rejects  petitioner's  alternative  position  that  fairness 
calls for a "modified categorical approach" requiring a jury verdict or a

Syllabus 
judge-approved equivalent to embody a loss-amount determination, and 
permitting  the  subsequent  immigration  court  applying  subparagraph 
(M)(i)  to  examine  only  charging  documents,  jury  instructions,  and  any 
special jury finding, or their equivalents.  The Court's cases developed 
the evidentiary  list to  which petitioner  points for a  very  different  pur-
pose,  namely,  to  determine  which  statutory  phrase  (contained  within  a 
statutory  provision  covering  several  different  generic  crimes)  covered 
a  prior  conviction.  Additionally,  petitioner's  proposal  can  prove  im-
practical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special verdict on 
a  fact  that  is  not  an  element  of  the  offense.  Further,  evidence  of  loss 
offered by the Government must meet a "clear and convincing" standard 
and  the  loss  must  be  tied  to  the  specific  counts  covered  by  the  convic-
tion.  These  considerations  mean  that  petitioner  and  others  in  similar 
circumstances  have  at  least  one  and  possibly  two  opportunities  to  con-
test the  loss amount,  the first  at  the  earlier sentencing  and the  second 
at the deportation hearing.  There was nothing unfair about the Immi-
gration  Judge's  reliance  on  earlier  sentencing-related  material  here. 
The defendant's sentencing stipulation and the court's restitution order 
show  that  the  conviction  involved  losses  considerably  greater  than 
$10,000.  Absent any conflicting evidence, this evidence is clear and con-
vincing.  Pp. 41-43. 

523 F. 3d 387, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court 
In 2005 the Government, claiming that petitioner had been convicted  of  an  "aggravated  felony,"  sought  to  remove 

him from the United States.  The Immigration Judge found that  petitioner's  conviction  was  for  crimes  of  fraud  and  de-
ceit;  that  the  sentencing  stipulation  and  restitution  order showed that the victims' loss exceeded $10,000; and that peti-
tioner's  conviction  consequently  fell  within  the  immigration statute's "aggravated felony" definition.  See 8  U. S. C. 

$$ 1101(a)(43)(M)(i),  (U)  (including  within  the  definition  of "aggravated  felony"  any  "attempt  or  conspiracy  to  commit" 
a listed "offense").  The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  44a-51a.  So  did  the  Third 
Circuit.  523 F. 3d 387 (2008).  The Third Circuit noted that the  statutes  of  conviction  were  silent  as  to  amounts,  but,  in 
its  view,  the  determination  of  loss  amounts  for  "aggravated felony"  purposes  "requires  an  inquiry  into  the  underlying 
facts  of  the  case."  Id.,  at  396  (internal  quotation  marks omitted). 

The Courts  of Appeals  have  come  to different conclusions as  to  whether  the  $10,000  threshold  in  subparagraph  (M)(i) 
refers  to  an  element  of  a  fraud  statute  or  to  the  factual  cir-cumstances  surrounding  commission  of  the  crime  on  a  spe-
cific occasion.  Compare Conteh v.  Gonzales, 461 F. 3d 45, 55 (CA1  2006) (fact-based approach);  523  F. 3d 387  (case below) 
(same);  Arguelles-Olivares  v.  Mukasey,  526  F.  3d  171,  178 (CA5  2008)  (same),  with  Dulal-Whiteway  v.  United  States 
Dept.  of  Homeland  Security,  501  F.  3d  116,  131  (CA2  2007) (definitional  approach); 

Kawashima  v.  Mukasey,  530  F.  3d 1111,  1117  (CA9  2008)  (same);  Obasohan  v.  United  States 

Atty.  Gen.,  479  F.  3d  785,  791  (CA11  2007)  (same).  We granted certiorari to decide the question. 

II 
The interpretive  difficulty before  us  reflects the linguistic fact that in ordinary speech words such as "crime," "felony," 

"offense,"  and  the  like  sometimes  refer  to  a  generic  crime,

Opinion of the Court 
say,  the  crime  of  fraud  or  theft  in  general,  and  sometimes refer  to  the  specific  acts  in  which  an  offender  engaged  on  a 

specific  occasion,  say,  the  fraud  that  the  defendant  planned and  executed  last  month.  See  Chambers  v.  United  States, 
555  U. S.  122,  125  (2009).  The  question  here,  as  we  have said,  is  whether  the  italicized  statutory  words  "offense  that 
involves  fraud  or deceit  in  which the  loss  to  the . .  . victims 
exceeds  $10,000"  should  be  interpreted  in  the  first  sense (which  we  shall  call  "categorical"),  i. e., as  referring  to  a ge-

neric  crime,  or  in  the  second  sense  (which  we  shall  call "circumstance-specific"),  as  referring  to  the  specific  way  in 
which an offender committed the crime on a specific occasion. If  the  first,  we  must  look  to  the  statute  defining  the  offense 
to determine whether it has an appropriate monetary thresh-old;  if  the  second,  we  must  look  to  the  facts  and  circum-
stances underlying an offender's conviction. 

A 
The basic argument  favoring the  first--i. e., the  "generic" or  "categorical"--interpretation  rests  upon 

Taylor,  Cham-bers,  and  James  v.  United  States,  550  U. S.  192  (2007). 

Those  cases  concerned  the  Armed  Career  Criminal  Act (ACCA), a statute that enhances the sentence imposed upon 
certain firearm-law offenders who also have three prior con-victions for "a violent felony."  18 U. S. C. $ 924(e).  See Ap-
pendix  B,  infra.  ACCA  defines  "violent  felony"  to  include, first,  felonies  with  elements  that  involve  the  use  of  physical 
force  against  another;  second,  felonies  that  amount  to  "bur-glary,  arson,  or  extortion"  or  that  involve  the  use  of  explo-
sives;  and  third,  felonies  that  "otherwise  involv[e]  conduct that  presents  a  serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to 
another."  $ 924(e)(2)(B). In  Taylor and  James  we  held  that  ACCA's  language  read 
naturally  uses  the  word  "felony"  to  refer  to  a  generic  crime as 

generally  committed.  Chambers,  supra,  at  125  (discuss-ing 

Taylor,  supra,  at  602);  James,  supra,  at  201-202.  The

Opinion of the Court 
Court noted that such an interpretation of the statute avoids "the practical difficulty of trying to ascertain" in a later pro-

ceeding,  "perhaps  from  a  paper  record"  containing  only  a citation  (say,  by  number)  to  a  statute  and  a  guilty  plea, 
"whether  the  [offender's]  prior  crime  .  .  .  did  or  did  not  in-volve," say, violence. 

Chambers, supra, at 125. 
Thus  in  James,  referring  to  Taylor,  we  made  clear  that 
courts  must  use  the  "categorical  method"  to  determine whether a conviction for "attempted burglary" was a convic-

tion  for  a  crime  that,  in  ACCA's  language,  "involve[d]  con-duct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury 
to  another."  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  That  method  required  the 
court to "examine, not the unsuccessful burglary the defend-
ant attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime 
of  attempted  burglary."  Chambers,  supra,  at  125  (discuss-
ing James, supra, at 204-206). 

We  also  noted  that  the  categorical  method  is  not  always 
easy to apply.  That is because sometimes a separately num-
bered  subsection  of  a  criminal  statute  will  refer  to  several 
different crimes, each described separately.  And it can hap-
pen  that  some  of  these  crimes  involve  violence  while  others 
do  not.  A  single  Massachusetts  statute  section  entitled 
"Breaking and Entering at Night," for example, criminalizes 
breaking  into  a  "building,  ship,  vessel  or  vehicle."  Mass. 
Gen.  Laws,  ch.  266,  $ 16  (West  2006).  In  such  an  instance, 
we have said, a court must determine whether an offender's 
prior conviction was for the violent,  rather  than the  nonvio-
lent,  break-ins  that  this  single  five-word  phrase  describes 
(e. g.,  breaking  into  a  building  rather  than  into  a  vessel),  by 
examining  "the  indictment  or  information  and  jury  instruc-
tions," Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602, or, if a guilty plea is at issue, 
by  examining  the  plea  agreement,  plea  colloquy,  or  "some 
comparable  judicial  record"  of  the  factual  basis  for  the  plea, 
Shepard v.  United States, 544 U. S. 13, 26 (2005). 

Petitioner  argues  that  we should  interpret  the  subsection 
of the "aggravated felony" statute before us as requiring use 

557US1 Unit: $U70 [07-07-14 13:10:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
36  NIJHAWAN  v.  HOLDER 

Opinion of the Court 
of  this  same  "categorical"  approach.  He  says  that  the  stat-
ute's  language,  read  naturally  as  in  Taylor,  refers  to  a  ge-
neric kind of crime, not a crime as committed on a particular 
occasion.  He  adds  that  here,  as  in  Taylor,  such  a  reading 
avoids  the  practical  difficulty  of  determining  the  nature  of 
prior  conduct  from  what  may  be  a  brief  paper  record,  per-
haps  noting  only  a  statutory  section  number  and  a  guilty 
plea; or, if there is a more extensive record, combing through 
that  record  for  evidence  of  underlying  conduct.  Also,  the 
categorical  approach,  since  it  covers  only  criminal  statutes 
with a relevant monetary threshold, not only provides assur-
ance  of  a  finding  on  the  point,  but  also  assures  that  the  de-
fendant  had  an  opportunity  to  present  evidence  about  the 
amount of loss. 

B 

Despite  petitioner's  arguments,  we  conclude  that  the 
"fraud  and  deceit"  provisi on  before  us  calls  for  a 
"circumstance-specific,"  not  a  "categorical,"  interpretation. 
The  "aggravated  felony"  statute of  which  it is  a  part  differs 
in general from ACCA, the statute at issue in Taylor.  And 
the  "fraud  and  deceit"  provision  differs  specifically  from 
ACCA's provisions. 

1 

Consider,  first,  ACCA  in  general.  That  statute  defines 
the "violent" felonies it covers to include "burglary, arson, or 
extortion"  and  "crime[s]"  that  have  "as  an  element"  the  use 
or  threatened  use  of force.  18  U. S. C. $$ 924(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). 
This  language  refers  directly  to  generic  crimes.  The  stat-
ute, however, contains other, more ambiguous language, cov-
ering  "crime[s]"  that  "involv[e]  conduct  that  presents  a 
serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to  another."  Ibid. 
(emphasis added).  While this language poses greater inter-
pretive difficulty,  the  Court  held  that it  too  refers  to crimes 
as generically defined.  James, supra, at 202.

Opinion of the Court 
Now  compare  the  "aggravated  felony"  statute  before  us. 
8 U. S. C. $ 1101(a)(43).  We concede that it resembles ACCA 
in  certain  respects.  The  "aggravated  felony"  statute  lists 
several  of  its  "offenses"  in  language  that  must  refer  to 
generic crimes.  Subparagraph (A), for example, lists "mur-
der,  rape,  or  sexual  abuse  of  a  minor."  See,  e. g.,  EstradaEspinoza  v.  Mukasey,  546  F.  3d  1147,  1152  (CA9  2008)  (en 
banc)  (applying  the  categorical  approach  to  "sexual  abuse"); 
Singh v.  Ashcroft, 383 F. 3d 144, 164 (CA3 2004) (same); San-
tos v.  Gonzales,  436  F.  3d  323,  324  (CA2  2005)  (per  curiam) 
(same).  Subparagraph  (B)  lists  "illicit  trafficking  in  a  con-
trolled  substance."  See  Gousse  v.  Ashcroft,  339  F.  3d  91, 
95-96  (CA2  2003)  (applying  categorical  approach);  Fernan-
dez  v.  Mukasey,  544  F.  3d  862,  871-872  (CA7  2008)  (same); 
Steele  v.  Blackman,  236  F.  3d  130,  136  (CA3  2001)  (same). 
And  subparagraph  (C)  lists  "illicit  trafficking  in  firearms 
or destructive devices."  Other sections refer specifically to 
an  "offense  described  in"  a  particular  section  of  the  Fed-
eral  Criminal  Code.  See,  e. g.,  subparagraphs  (E),  (H),  (I), 
(J), (L). 

More  importantly,  however,  the  "aggravated  felony"  stat-
ute differs from ACCA in that it lists certain other "offenses" 
using  language  that  almost  certainly  does  not  refer  to  ge-
neric crimes but refers to specific circumstances.  For exam-
ple,  subparagraph  (P),  after  referring  to  "an  offense"  that 
amounts to "falsely making, forging, counterfeiting, mutilat-
ing,  or  altering  a  passport,"  adds,  "except  in  the  case  of  a 
first  offense  for  which  the  alien  .  .  .  committed  the  offense 
for the  purpose of assisting .  .  . the alien's  spouse, child, or 
parent . . . to  violate a provision of this chapter."  (Empha-
sis  added.)  The  language  about  (for  example)  "forging  .  .  . 
passport[s]"  may well  refer to a  generic crime, but the  itali-
cized  exception  cannot  possibly  refer  to  a  generic  crime. 
That  is  because  there  is  no  such  generic  crime;  there  is  no 
criminal  statute  that  contains  any  such  exception.  Thus  if 

557US1 Unit: $U70 [07-07-14 13:10:33] PAGES PGT: OPIN
38  NIJHAWAN  v.  HOLDER 

Opinion of the Court 
the  provision  is  to  have  any  meaning  at  all,  the  exception must  refer  to  the  particular  circumstances  in  which  an  of-

fender  committed  the  crime  on  a  particular  occasion.  See also subparagraph (N) (similar exception). 

The  statute  has  other  provisions  that  contain  qualify-ing  language  that  certainly  seems  to  call  for  circumstance-
specific application.  Subparagraph (K)(ii), for example, lists "offense[s] . . . described in section 2421, 2422, or 2423 of title 
18  (relating  to  transportation  for  the  purpose  of  prostitu-tion) 

if  committed  for  commercial  advantage."  (Emphasis added.)  Of  the  three  specifically  listed  criminal  statutory 

sections  only  one  subsection  (namely,  $ 2423(d))  says  any-thing about commercial advantage.  Thus, unless the "com-
mercial  advantage"  language  calls  for  circumstance-specific application,  the  statute's  explicit  references  to  $$ 2421  and 
2422  would  be  pointless.  But  see  Gertsenshteyn  v.  United 
States  Dept.  of  Justice,  544  F.  3d  137,  144-145  (CA2  2008). Subparagraph  (M)(ii)  provides  yet  another  example.  It 

refers to an offense "described in section 7201 of title 26 (re-lating  to  tax  evasion) 

in  which  the  revenue  loss  to  the  Gov-
ernment exceeds $10,000."  (Emphasis added.)  There is no offense "described in section 7201 of title 26" that has a spe-

cific loss amount as an element.  Again, unless the "revenue loss" language calls for circumstance-specific application, the 
tax-evasion provision would be pointless. The upshot  is that the "aggravated felony" statute, unlike 
ACCA, contains some language that refers to generic crimes and  some  language  that  almost  certainly  refers  to  the  spe-
cific  circumstances  in  which  a  crime  was  committed.  The question  before  us  then  is  to  which  category  subparagraph 
(M)(i) belongs.  2 

Subparagraph (M)(i) refers to "an offense that . . . involves fraud  or  deceit  in  which  the  loss  to  the  victim  or  victims 
exceeds  $10,000."  (Emphasis  added.)  The  language  of  the provision is consistent with a circumstance-specific approach.

Opinion of the Court 
The  words  "in  which"  (which  modify  "offense")  can  refer  to 
the  conduct  involved  "in"  the  commission  of  the  offense  of 
conviction,  rather  than  to  the  elements  of  the  offense. 
Moreover, subparagraph (M)(i) appears just prior to subpar-
agraph  (M)(ii),  the  internal  revenue  provision  we  have  just 
discussed,  and  it  is  identical  in  structure  to  that  provision. 
Where,  as  here,  Congress  uses  similar  statutory  language 
and  similar  statutory  structure  in  two  adjoining  provisions, 
it  normally  intends  similar  interpretations.  IBP,  Inc.  v. 
Alvarez, 546 U. S. 21, 34 (2005). 

Moreover,  to  apply  a  categorical  approach  here  would 
leave  subparagraph  (M)(i)  with  little,  if  any,  meaningful  ap-
plication.  We have found no widely applicable federal fraud 
statute  that  contains  a  relevant  monetary  loss  threshold. 
See,  e. g.,  18  U. S. C.  $$ 1341  (mail  fraud),  1343  (wire  fraud), 
1344  (bank  fraud),  371  (conspiracy  to  defraud  the  United 
States), 666 (theft in federally funded programs), 1028 (fraud 
in  connection  with  identification  documents),  1029  (fraud  in 
connection  with  access  devices),  1030  (fraud  in  connection 
with  computers),  1347  (health  care  fraud),  and  1348  (securi-
ties  fraud).  Petitioner  has  found  only  three  federal  fraud 
statutes that do so, and those three contain thresholds not of 
$10,000, but of $100,000 or $1 million, $$ 668 (theft by fraud of 
an  artwork  worth  $100,000  or  more),  1031(a) (contract  fraud 
against  the  United  States  where  the  contract  is  worth  at 
least  $1  million),  and  1039(d)  (providing  enhanced  penalties 
for  fraud  in  obtaining  telephone  records,  where  the  scheme 
involves  more  than  $100,000).  Why  would  Congress  intend 
subparagraph (M)(i) to apply to only these three federal stat-
utes, and then choose a monetary threshold that, on its face, 
would apply to other, nonexistent statutes as well? 

We  recognize,  as  petitioner  argues,  that  Congress  might 
have  intended  subparagraph  (M)(i)  to  apply  almost  exclu-
sively  to  those  who  violate  certain  state  fraud  and  deceit 
statutes.  So  we  have  examined  state  law.  See  Appendix

Opinion of the Court 
C,  infra.  We have found, however, that in 1996, when Con-gress added the $10,000 threshold in subparagraph (M)(i), see 

Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant  Responsibility Act  $ 321(a)(7),  110  Stat.  3009-628,  29  States  had  no  major 
fraud  or  deceit  statute  with  any  relevant  monetary  thresh-old.  In 13 of the remaining 21 States, fraud and deceit stat-
utes contain relevant monetary thresholds but with amounts 
significantly  higher  than  $10,000,  leaving  only  8  States  with statutes  in  respect  to  which  subparagraph  (M)(i)'s  $10,000 

threshold,  as  categorically  interpreted,  would  have  full  ef-fect.  We  do  not  believe  Congress  would  have  intended 
(M)(i)  to  apply  in  so  limited  and  so  haphazard  a  manner. 
Cf. United States v.  Hayes, 555 U. S. 415, 427 (2009) (reaching 
similar  conclusion  for  similar  reason  in  respect  to  a  statute 
referring to crimes involving "domestic violence"). 

Petitioner next  points  to 8 U. S. C. $ 1326, which  criminal-
izes  illegal  entry  after  removal  and  imposes  a  higher  maxi-
mum  sentence  when  an  alien's  removal  was  "subsequent 
to  a  conviction  for  commission  of  an  aggravated  felony." 

$ 1326(b)(2).  Petitioner says that a circumstance-specific ap-
proach  to  subparagraph  (M)(i)  could  create  potential  consti-
tutional  problems  in  a  subsequent  criminal  prosecution 
under that statute, because loss amount would not have been 
found  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt  in  the  prior  criminal  pro-
ceeding.  The  Government,  however,  stated  in  its  brief  and 
at oral argument that the later jury, during the illegal reen-
try trial, would have to find loss amount beyond a reasonable 
doubt,  Brief  for  Respondent  49-50;  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  39-40, 
eliminating  any  constitutional  concern.  Cf.  Hayes,  supra, 
at 426. 

We  conclude  that  Congress  did  not  intend  subparagraph 
(M)(i)'s  monetary  threshold  to  be  applied  categorically,  i. e., 
to  only  those  fraud  and  deceit  crimes  generically  defined  to 
include that threshold.  Rather, the monetary  threshold ap-
plies to the  specific  circumstances surrounding  an offender's 
commission of a fraud and deceit crime on a specific occasion.

alternative  argument,  says  that  we should nonetheless borrow from 

Taylor what that case called a "modified categorical approach."  He says that, for reasons 

of  fairness,  we  should  insist  that  a  jury  verdict,  or  a  judge-approved  equivalent,  embody  a  determination  that  the  loss 
involved in a prior fraud or deceit conviction amounted to at least  $10,000.  To  determine  whether  that  is  so,  petitioner 
says,  the  subsequent  immigration  court  applying  subpara-graph  (M)(i)  should  examine  only  charging  documents,  jury 
instructions,  and  any  special  jury  finding  (if  one  has  been requested).  If there was a trial but no jury, the subsequent 
court  should  examine  the  equivalent  judge-made  findings. If there was a guilty plea (and no trial), the subsequent court 
should  examine  the  written  plea  documents  or  the  plea  col-loquy.  To  authorize  any  broader  examination  of  the  prior 

proceedings,  petitioner  says,  would  impose  an  unreasonable administrative  burden  on  immigration  judges  and  would 
unfairly  permit  him  to  be  deported  on  the  basis  of  circum-stances  that  were  not  before  judicially  determined  to  have 
been present and which he may not have had an opportunity, prior to conviction, to dispute. 

We agree with petitioner that the statute foresees the use of  fundamentally  fair  procedures,  including  procedures  that 
give  an  alien  a  fair  opportunity  to  dispute  a  Government claim  that  a  prior  conviction  involved  a  fraud  with  the  rele-
vant  loss  to  victims.  But  we  do  not  agree  that  fairness  re-quires the evidentiary limitations he proposes. 

For one thing, we have found nothing in prior law that so limits  the  immigration  court.  Taylor,  James,  and  Shepard, 
the  cases  that  developed  the  evidentiary  list  to  which  peti-tioner  points,  developed  that  list  for  a  very  different  pur-
pose,  namely,  that  of  determining  which  statutory  phrase (contained  within  a  statutory  provision  that  covers  several 
different  generic  crimes)  covered  a  prior  conviction.  See 
supra, at 34-35; Taylor, 495 U. S., at 602; Shepard, 544 U. S.,

at 26.  For another, petitioner's proposal itself can prove im-practical insofar as it requires obtaining from a jury a special 

verdict  on  a  fact  that  (given  our  Part  II  determination)  is not an element of the offense. 

Further,  a  deportation  proceeding  is  a  civil  proceeding  in which the Government does not have to prove its claim "be-
yond  a  reasonable  doubt."  At  the  same  time  the  evidence 
that the Government offers must meet a "clear and convinc-ing" standard.  8 U. S. C. $ 1229a(c)(3)(A).  And, as the Gov-

ernment  points  out,  the  "loss"  must  "be  tied  to  the  specific counts covered by the conviction."  Brief for Respondent 44; 
see,  e. g.,  Alaka  v.  Attorney  General  of  United  States,  456 F.  3d  88,  107  (CA3  2006)  (loss  amount  must  be  tethered  to 
offense  of  conviction;  amount  cannot  be  based  on  acquitted or  dismissed  counts  or  general  conduct); 

Knutsen  v.  Gonza-
les, 429 F. 3d 733, 739-740 (CA7 2005) (same).  And the Gov-ernment adds that the "sole purpose" of the "aggravated fel-

ony" inquiry "is to ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; 
it  is  not  an  invitation  to  relitigate  the  conviction  itself." Brief for Respondent 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). 

Finally,  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals,  too,  has  recog-nized  that  immigration  judges  must  assess  findings  made  at 
sentencing  "with  an  eye  to  what  losses  are  covered  and  to 
the  burden  of  proof  employed."  In  re  Babaisakov,  24  I.  & 
N. Dec. 306, 319 (2007). 

These considerations, taken together, mean that petitioner 
and those in similar circumstances have at least one and pos-
sibly two opportunities to contest the amount of loss, the first 
at  the  earlier  sentencing  and  the  second  at  the  deportation 
hearing  itself.  They  also  mean  that,  since  the  Government 
must  show  the  amount  of  loss  by  clear  and  convincing  evi-
dence, uncertainties caused by the passage of time are likely 
to count in the alien's favor. 

We can find nothing unfair about the Immigration Judge's 
having  here  relied  upon  earlier  sentencing-related  material. 
Petitioner's  own  stipulation,  produced  for  sentencing  pur-
poses, shows that the conviction involved losses considerably

greater  than  $10,000.  The  court's  restitution  order  shows 
the  same.  In  the  absence  of  any  conflicting  evidence  (and 
petitioner  menti ons  none),  this  evidence  is  clear  and 
convincing. 

The Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner's prior fed-
eral conviction consequently falls within the scope of subpar-
agraph (M)(i).  And we affirm its judgment. 

It is so ordered.

We  examined  state  statutes  involving  fraud  or  deceit  in effect in 1996, when Congress added the $10,000 threshold in 
subparagraph  (M)(i).  See  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and Immigrant  Responsibility  Act  of  1996,  $ 321(a)(7),  110  Stat. 
3009-628.  While  perhaps  questions  could  be  raised  about 
whether  certain  of  the  statutes  listed  below  involve  "fraud or deceit" as required by  subparagraph (M)(i), we give  peti-

tioner  the  benefit  of  any  doubt  and  treat  the  statute  as relevant.

In  29  States  plus  the  District  of  Columbia,  the  main  stat-utes  in  effect  in  1996  involving  fraud  and  deceit  either  did 

not  have  any  monetary  threshold  or  set  a  threshold  lower 
than  $10,000  even  for  the  most  serious  grade  of  the  offense.

In  13  States,  conviction  under  the  main  fraud  and  deceit statutes  in  effect  in  1996  could  categorically  qualify  under 

subparagraph (M)(i).  But the relevant monetary thresholds for  these  offenses--that  is,  the  thresholds  such  that  convic-
tion categorically would satisfy the monetary requirement of subparagraph (M)(i)--were significantly higher than $10,000.

(b)  The  Court  assumes  without  deciding  that  the  Ninth  Circuit  was 
correct  that  Heck  does  not  bar  Osborne's  $ 1983  claim.  That  claim 
can  be  rejected  without  resolving  the  proper  application  of  Heck. 
P. 67. 

(c)  The  Ninth  Circuit  erred  in  finding  a  due  process  violation. 
Pp. 67-75. 

(1)  While Osborne does have a liberty interest in pursuing the post-
conviction relief granted by the State, the Ninth Circuit erred in extend-
ing the Brady right of pretrial disclosure to the postconviction context. 
Osborne has already been found guilty and therefore has only a limited 
liberty  interest  in  postconviction  relief.  See,  e. g.,  Herrera  v.  Collins, 
506  U. S.  390,  399.  Instead  of  the  Brady  inquiry,  the  question  is 
whether  consideration  of  Osborne's  claim  within  the  framework  of  the 
State's  postconviction  relief  procedures  "offends  some  [fundamental] 
principle  of  justice"  or  "transgresses  any  recognized  principle  of  fun-
damental  fairness  in  operation."  Medina  v.  California, 505  U. S.  437, 
446,  448.  Federal  courts  may  upset  a  State's  postconviction  relief 
procedures  only  if  they  are  fundamentally  inadequate  to  vindicate  the 
substantive rights provided. 

There is nothing inadequate about Alaska's postconviction relief pro-
cedures in general or its methods for applying those procedures to per-
sons  seeking  access  to  evidence for  DNA  testing.  The  State  provides 
a  substantive right  to  be  released  on a  sufficiently  compelling  showing 
of new evidence that establishes innocence.  It also provides for discov-
ery in postconviction proceedings, and has--through judicial decision-- 
specified that such discovery is available to those seeking access to evi-
dence for DNA testing.  These procedures are similar to those provided 
by federal law and the laws of other States, and they satisfy due process. 
The same is true for Osborne's reliance on a claimed federal right to be 
released upon proof of "actual innocence."  Even assuming such a right 
exists, which the Court has not decided and does not decide, there is no 
due process problem, given the procedures available to access evidence 
for DNA testing.  Pp. 67-72. 

(2)  The Court rejects Osborne's invitation to recognize a freestand-
ing,  substantive  due  process  right  to  DNA  evidence  untethered  from 
the liberty interests he hopes to vindicate with it.  In the circumstances 
of  this  case,  there  is  no  such  right.  Generally,  the  Court  is  "reluctant 
to  expand  the  concept  of  substantive  due  process  because  guideposts 
for responsible  decisionmaking  in  this  unchartered area  are scarce  and 
open-ended."  Collins  v.  Harker  Heights, 503  U. S.  115,  125.  There  is 
no  long  history  of  a  right  of  access  to  state  evidence  for  DNA  testing 
that might prove innocence.  "The mere novelty of such a claim is rea-
son enough  to doubt  that  `substantive  due process'  sustains  it."  Reno

Federal  Judiciary  responsibility  for  devising  rules  governing  DNA  ac-

myriad questions that would arise.  There is no reason to suppose that 
federal courts' answers to those questions will be any better than those

ognition  of  a  freestanding  and  far-reaching  constitutional right  of access  to  this  new  type  of  evidence.  The  nature  of 

what he seeks is confirmed by his decision to file this lawsuit in federal court under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, not within the state 
criminal  justice  system.  This  approach  would  take  the  de-velopment  of  rules  and  procedures  in  this  area  out  of  the 
hands of legislatures and state courts shaping policy in a fo-cused manner and turn it over to federal courts applying the 
broad  parameters  of  the  Due  Process  Clause.  There  is  no reason  to  constitutionalize  the  issue  in  this  way.  Because 
the decision below would do just that, we reverse. 

I 
A 

This  lawsuit  arose  out  of  a  violent  crime  committed  16 years ago, which has resulted in a long string of litigation in 

the  state  and  federal  courts.  On  the  evening  of  March  22, 1993,  two  men  driving  through  Anchorage,  Alaska,  solicited 
sex  from  a  female  prostitute,  K.  G.  She  agreed  to  perform fellatio on both men for $100 and got in their car.  The three 
spent some  time looking  for  a  place to  stop and ended  up  in a  deserted  area  near  Earthquake  Park.  When  K.  G.  de-
manded  payment  in  advance,  the  two  men  pulled  out  a  gun and  forced  her  to  perform  fellatio  on  the  driver  while  the 
passenger penetrated her vaginally, using a blue condom she had  brought.  The  passenger  then  ordered  K.  G.  out  of  the 
car  and  told  her  to  lie  face-down  in  the  snow.  Fearing  for her  life,  she  refused,  and  the  two  men  choked  her  and  beat 
her  with  the  gun.  When  K.  G.  tried  to  flee,  the  passenger beat her with a wooden axe handle and shot her in the head 
while she lay on the ground.  They kicked some snow on top of her and left her for dead.  521 F. 3d 1118, 1122 (CA9 2008)

Once  the  two  men  left,  she  found  her  way  back  to  the  road,

and  flagged  down  a  passing  car  to  take  her  home.  Ulti-mately,  she  received  medical  care  and  spoke  to  the  police. 

At the scene of the  crime, the police recovered a spent shell casing, the axe handle, some of K. G.'s clothing  stained with 
blood,  and  the  blue  condom.  Jackson  v.  State,  No.  A-5276 etc.  (Alaska  App.,  Feb.  7,  1996),  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  117a. 

Six days later, two military police officers at Fort Richard-son 

pulled over Dexter Jackson for flashing his headlights at another  vehicle.  In  his  car  they  discovered  a  gun  (which 

matched the shell casing), as well as several items K. G. had been  carrying  the  night  of  the  attack. 

Id.,  at  116a,  118a- 
119a.  The car also matched the description K. G. had given 
to the police.  Jackson admitted that he had been the driver 
during the rape and assault, and told the police that William 
Osborne  had  been  his  passenger.  521  F.  3d,  at  1122-1123; 
423  F.  3d  1050,  1051-1052  (CA9  2005);  Osborne  v.  State,  110 
P.  3d  986,  990  (Alaska  App.  2005)  (Osborne  I ).  Other  evi-
dence  also  implicated  Osborne.  K.  G.  picked  out  his  pho-
tograph  (with  some  uncertainty)  and  at  trial  she  identified 
Osborne  as  her  attacker.  Other  witnesses  testified  that 
shortly  before  the  crime,  Osborne  had  called  Jackson  from 
an arcade, and then driven off with him.  An axe handle sim-
ilar  to  the  one  at  the  scene  of  the  crime  was  found  in  Os-
borne's room on the military base where he lived. 

The  State  also  performed  DQ  Alpha  testing  on  sperm 
found in  the  blue  condom.  DQ  Alpha  testing is  a relatively 
inexact  form  of  DNA  testing  that  can  clear  some  wrongly 
accused individuals,  but generally  cannot narrow  the perpe-
trator down to less than 5% of the population.  See Dept. of 
Justice,  National  Comm'n  on  the  Future  of  DNA  Evidence,

type  that  matched  a  blood  sample  taken  from  Osborne,  but not ones from Jackson, K. G., or a third suspect named James 

Hunter.  Osborne  is  black,  and  approximately  16%  of  black individuals  have  such  a  genotype.  App.  117-119.  In  other 
words, the testing ruled  out Jackson and Hunter as possible sources  of  the  semen,  and  also  ruled  out  over  80%  of  other 
black  individuals.  The  State  also  examined  some  pubic hairs found at the scene of the crime, which were not suscep-
tible to DQ Alpha testing, but which state witnesses attested to be similar to Osborne's.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 117a.

Osborne and Jackson were convicted by an Alaska jury of kidnaping, assault, and sexual assault.  They were acquitted 

of  an  additional  count  of  sexual  assault  and  of  attempted murder.  Finding  it  " `nearly  miraculous' "  that  K.  G.  had 
survived,  the  trial  judge  sentenced  Osborne  to  26  years  in prison,  with 5  suspended. 

Id.,  at 128a.  His conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal.  Id., at 113a-130a. 

Osborne  then  sought  postconviction  relief  in  Alaska  state court.  He claimed that  he  had asked  his attorney, Sid-
ney Billingslea, to seek more  discriminating  restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) DNA testing during 
trial, and argued that she was constitutionally ineffective for not  doing  so.

1  Billingslea  testified  that  after  investigation, 

she  had concluded  that  further  testing  would  do  more  harm than  good.  She  planned  to  mount  a  defense  of  mistaken 

identity,  and  thought  that  the  imprecision  of  the  DQ  Alpha test  gave  her  " `very  good  numbers  in  a  mistaken  identity,

dark  and  had  bad  eyesight.' "  Osborne  I,  110  P.  3d,  at  990. Because  she  believed  Osborne  was  guilty,  " `insisting  on  a 

more  advanced  . . . DNA  test  would  have  served  to  prove that  Osborne  committed  the  alleged  crimes.' "  Ibid.  The 
Alaska Court of Appeals concluded that Billingslea's decision had  been  strategic  and  rejected  Osborne's  claim. 

Id.,  at 991-992. 

In  this  proceeding,  Osborne  also  sought  the  DNA  testing that  Billingslea  had  failed  to  perform,  relying  on  an  Alaska 
postconviction  statute,  Alaska  Stat.  $ 12.72  (2008),  and  the State  and  Federal  Constitutions.  In  two  decisions,  the 
Alaska  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that  Osborne  had  no right to the RFLP test.  According to the court, $ 12.72 "ap-
parently" did not apply to DNA testing that had been avail-able  at  trial.

2  Osborne  I,  110  P.  3d,  at  992-993.  The  court 

found  no  basis  in  our  precedents  for  recognizing  a  federal constitutional right to DNA  evidence.  Id.,  at 993.  After  a 

remand  for  further  findings,  the  Alaska  Court  of  Appeals concluded that Osborne could not claim a state constitutional 
right  either,  because  the  other  evidence  of  his  guilt  was  too strong  and  RFLP  testing  was  not  likely  to  be  conclusive. 
Osborne  II,  163  P.  3d,  at  979-981.  Two  of  the  three  judges wrote  separately  to  say  that  "[i]f  Osborne  could  show  that 
he  were  in  fact  innocent,  it  would  be  unconscionable  to punish  him,"  and  that  doing  so  might  violate  the  Alaska 
Constitution.  Id.,  at  984-985  (Mannheimer,  J.,  concurring). The court relied heavily on the fact that Osborne had con-
fessed to some of his crimes in a 2004 application for parole-- in  which  it  is  a  crime  to  lie. 

Id.,  at  978-979,  981  (majority opinion)  (citing  Alaska  Stat.  $ 11.56.210  (2002)).  In  this

sion before the parole board.  Despite this acceptance of re-
sponsibility, the board did not grant him discretionary parole.

datory  parole,  but  he  has  since  been  rearrested  for  another

Brief for Petitioners 7, n. 3. 

Meanwhile, Osborne had also been active in federal court, 
suing  state  officials  under  42  U. S. C.  $ 1983.  He  claimed 
that  the  Due  Process  Clause  and  other  constitutional  provi-
sions gave him a constitutional right to access the DNA evi-
dence for what is known as short-tandem-repeat (STR) test-
ing  (at  his  own  expense).  App. 24.  This  form  of  testing  is 
more  discriminating  than  the  DQ  Alpha  or  RFLP  methods 
available at the time of Osborne's trial.3  The District Court 
first dismissed the claim under Heck v.  Humphrey, 512 U. S. 
477  (1994),  holding  it  "inescapable"  that  Osborne  sought  to 
"set the stage" for an attack on his conviction, and therefore 
"must  proceed  through  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus."  App.  207 
(internal quotation marks omitted).  The United States 
Court of  Appeals  for the  Ninth Circuit  reversed,  concluding 
that $ 1983 was the proper vehicle for Osborne's claims, while 
"express[ing]  no  opinion  as  to  whether  Osborne  ha[d]  been 
deprived of a federally protected right."  423 F. 3d, at 1056. 

On cross-motions for summary judgment after remand, the 
District  Court  concluded  that  "there  does  exist,  under  the 
unique  and  specific  facts  presented,  a  very  limited  constitu-
tional  right  to  the  testing  sought."  445  F.  Supp.  2d  1079, 

3 STR testing is extremely discriminating, can be used on small samples, 
and is "rapidly becoming the standard."  Future of Forensic DNA Testing 
18, n. 9.  Osborne also sought to subject the pubic hairs to mitochondrial 
DNA testing, a secondary testing method often used when a sample can-
not be subjected to other tests.  See Postconviction DNA Testing 28.  He 
argues that "[a]ll of the same arguments that support access to the condom 
for  STR  testing  support  access  to  the  hairs  for  mitochondrial  testing  as 
well,"  Brief  for  Respondent  11,  n.  4,  and  we  treat  the  claim  accordingly.

Opinion of the Court 
1081  (2006)  (some  emphasis  deleted).  The  court  relied  on several  factors:  that  the  testing  Osborne  sought  had  been 

unavailable  at  trial,  that  the  testing  could  be  accomplished at  almost  no  cost  to  the  State,  and  that  the  results  were 
likely to be material.  Id., at 1081-1082.  It therefore granted summary judgment in favor of Osborne. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed,  relying  on  the  prosecuto-r
ial  duty  to  disclose  exculpatory  evidence  recognized  in 
Pennsylvania  v.  Ritchie,  480  U. S.  39  (1987),  and  Brady  v. 
Maryland,  373  U. S.  83  (1963).  While  acknowledging  that our  precedents  "involved  only  the  right  to 

pre-trial  disclo-
sure," the  court concluded that the  Due  Process Clause also 
"extends  the  government's  duty  to  disclose  (or  the  defend-
ant's  right  of  access)  to  post-conviction  proceedings."  521 
F.  3d,  at  1128.  Although  Osborne's  trial  and  appeals  were 
over, the court noted that he had a "potentially viable" state 
constitutional  claim  of  "actual  innocence,"  id.,  at  1130,  and 
relied  on  the  "well-established  assumption"  that  a  similar 
claim  arose  under  the  Federal  Constitution,  id.,  at  1131; 
cf.  Herrera  v.  Collins,  506  U. S.  390  (1993).  The  court  held 
that  these  potential  claims  extended  some  of  the  State's 
Brady obligations to the postconviction context. 

The  court  declined  to  decide  the  details  of  what  showing 
must  be  made  to  access  the  evidence  because  it  found  "Os-
borne's  case  for  disclosure  .  .  .  so  strong  on  the  facts"  that 
"[w]herever  the  bar  is,  he  crosses  it."  521  F.  3d,  at  1134. 
While  acknowledging  that  Osborne's  prior  confessions  were 
"certainly  relevant,"  the  court  concluded  that  they  did  not 
"necessarily  trum[p] . . .  the  right  to  obtain  post-conviction 
access  to  evidence"  in  light  of  the  "emerging  reality  of 
wrongful  convictions  based  on  false  confessions."  Id.,  at 
1140. 

We  granted  certiorari to decide  whether Osborne's  claims 
could  be  pursued  using  $ 1983,  and  whether  he  has  a  right 
under  the  Due  Process  Clause  to  obtain  postconviction  ac-
cess to the State's evidence  for DNA testing.  555 U. S. 992

II 
Modern  DNA  testing  can  provide  powerful  new  evidence unlike anything known before.  Since its first use in criminal 

investigations  in  the  mid-1980s,  there  have  been  several major  advances  in  DNA  technology,  culminating  in  STR 
technology.  It  is  now  often  possible  to  determine  whether a  biological  tissue  matches  a  suspect  with  near  certainty. 
While  of  course  many  criminal  trials  proceed  without  any forensic  and  scientific  testing  at  all,  there  is  no  technology 
comparable  to  DNA  testing  for  matching  tissues  when  such evidence  is  at  issue.  Postconviction  DNA  Testing  1-2;  Fu-
ture  of  Forensic  DNA  Testing 13-14.  DNA  testing  has  ex-onerated  wrongly  convicted  people,  and  has  confirmed  the 
convictions of many others. At  the  same time,  DNA testing  alone  does not  always re-
solve a case.  Where there is enough other incriminating ev-idence and an explanation for the  DNA result, science alone 
cannot  prove  a  prisoner  innocent.  See  House  v.  Bell,  547 U. S.  518,  540-548  (2006).  The  availability  of  technologies 
not available at trial cannot mean that every criminal convic-tion,  or  even  every  criminal  conviction  involving  biological 
evidence, is suddenly in doubt.  The dilemma is how to har-ness DNA's power to prove innocence without unnecessarily 
overthrowing the established system of criminal justice. That  task  belongs  primarily  to  the  legislature.  "[T]he 
States are currently engaged in serious, thoughtful examina-tions," 

Washington  v.  Glucksberg,  521  U. S.  702,  719  (1997), of  how  to  ensure  the  fair  and  effective  use  of  this  testing 

within  the  existing  criminal  justice  framework.  Forty-six States  have  already  enacted  statutes  dealing  specifically 
with access to DNA evidence.  See generally Brief for State of California et al.  as

Innocence Protection Act of 2004, $ 411, 118 Stat. 2278, codi-fied in part at 18 U. S. C. $ 3600, which allows federal prison-
ers  to  move  for  court-ordered  DNA  testing  under  certain 
specified  conditions.  That  Act  also  grants  money  to  States 
that  enact  comparable  statutes,  $ 413,  118  Stat.  2285,  note 
following 42 U. S. C. $ 14136, and as a consequence has served

see  also  Brief  for  United  States  as  Amicus  Curiae  19-26 
(defending constitutionality of Innocence Protection Act). 

These  laws  recognize the  value  of DNA  evidence  but also 
the  need  for  certain  conditions  on  access  to  the  State's  evi-
dence.  A requirement of demonstrating materiality is com-
mon,  e. g.,  18  U. S. C.  $ 3600(a)(8),  but  it  is  not  the  only  one. 
The federal statute, for example, requires a sworn statement 
that  the  applicant  is  innocent.  $ 3600(a)(1).  This  require-
ment is replicated in several state statutes.  E. g., Cal. Penal 
Code  Ann.  $$ 1405(b)(1),  (c)(1)  (West  Supp.  2009);  Fla.  Stat. 

$ 925.11(2)(a)(3)  (2007);  N.  H.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  $ 651-D:2(I)(b) 
(West  2007);  S.  C.  Code  Ann.  $ 17-28-40  (Supp.  2008). 
States also  impose  a  range  of diligence  requirements.  Sev-
eral require the requested testing to "have been technologi-
cally  impossible  at  trial."  Garrett,  supra,  at  1681,  and 
n.  242.  Others  deny  testing  to  those  who  declined  testing 
at trial for tactical reasons.  E. g.,  Utah Code Ann. $ 78B-9- 
301(4) (Lexis 2008).

64  DISTRICT  ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE  FOR  THIRD  

JUDICIAL  DIST.  v.  OSBORNE  

Opinion of the Court  

Alaska is one of a handful of States yet to enact legislation specifically  addressing  the  issue  of  evidence  requested  for 

DNA testing.  But that does not mean that such evidence is unavailable  for  those  seeking  to  prove  their  innocence.  In-
stead,  Alaska  courts  are  addressing  how  to  apply  existing laws  for  discovery  and  postconviction  relief  to  this  novel 
technology.  See Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 992-993; Patterson v. 

State, No. A-8814, 2006 WL 573797, *4 (Alaska App., Mar. 
8, 2006).  The same is true with respect to other States that 
do  not  have  DNA-specific  statutes.  E. g.,  Fagan  v.  State, 957  So.  2d  1159  (Ala.  Crim.  App.  2007).  Cf.  Mass.  Rule 

Crim. Proc. 30(c)(4) (2009). 

First, access to evidence is available under Alaska law for 
those who seek to subject it to newly available DNA testing 
that  will  prove  them  to  be  actually  innocent.  Under  the 
State's  general  postconviction  relief  statute,  a  prisoner  may 
challenge his conviction when "there exists evidence of mate-
rial  facts,  not  previously  presented  and  heard  by  the  court, 
that  requires  vacation  of  the  conviction  or  sentence  in 
the  interest  of  justice."  Alaska  Stat.  $ 12.72.010(4)  (2008). 
Such a claim is exempt from otherwise applicable time limits 
if  "newly  discovered  evidence,"  pursued  with  due  diligence, 
"establishes by clear and convincing evidence that the appli-
cant is innocent."  $ 12.72.020(b)(2). 

Both  parties  agree  that  under  these  provisions  of  $ 12.72, 
"a defendant is entitled to post-conviction relief if the defend-
ant  presents  newly  discovered  evidence  that  establishes  by 
clear  and  convincing  evidence  that  the  defendant  is  inno-
cent."  Osborne  I,  supra,  at  992  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted).  If such a claim is brought, state law permits gen-
eral  discovery.  See  Alaska  Rule  Crim.  Proc.  35.1(g)  (2008- 
2009).  Alaska  courts  have  explained  that  these  procedures 
are  available  to  request  DNA  evidence  for  newly  available 
testing to establish actual innocence.  See Patterson, supra, 
at  *4  ("If  Patterson  had  brought  the  DNA  analysis  request 
as  part  of  his  previous  application  for  [postconviction]

Opinion of the Court 
relief  .  .  .  he  would  have  been  able  to  request  production of evidence"). 

In  addition  to  this  statutory  procedure,  the  Alaska  Court of  Appeals  has  invoked  a  widely  accepted  three-part  test  to 
govern additional rights to DNA access under the State Con-stitution. 

Osborne  II,  163  P.  3d,  at  974-975.  Drawing  on the experience with DNA evidence of State Supreme Courts 

around  the  country,  the  Court  of  Appeals  explained  that  it was  "reluctant  to  hold  that  Alaska  law  offers  no  remedy  to 
defendants  who  could  prove  their  factual  innocence."  Os-borne I, 110 P. 3d, at 995; see id., at 995, n. 27 (citing decisions 
from other state courts).  It was "prepared to hold, however, that a defendant who seeks post-conviction DNA testing . . . 
must  show  (1)  that  the  conviction  rested  primarily  on  eye-witness  identification  evidence,  (2)  that  there  was  a  demon-
strable doubt concerning the defendant's identification as the perpetrator,  and  (3)  that  scientific  testing  would  likely  be 
conclusive  on  this  issue."  Id.,  at  995.  Thus,  the  Alaska courts have suggested that even those who do not get discov-
ery  under  the  State's  criminal  rules  have  available  to  them a safety valve under the State Constitution. 

This is the background against which the Federal Court of Appeals  ordered  the  State  to  turn  over  the  DNA  evidence 
in  its  possession,  and  it  is  our  starting  point  in  analyzing Osborne's constitutional claims. 

III 
The  parties  dispute  whether  Osborne  has  invoked  the proper federal statute in bringing his claim.  He sued under 

the federal civil rights statute, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, which gives a  cause  of  action  to  those  who  challenge  a  State's  "depriva-
tion  of  any  rights  .  .  .  secured  by  the  Constitution."  The State insists that Osborne's claim must be brought under 28 
U. S. C.  $ 2254,  which  allows  a  prisoner  to  seek  "a  writ  of habeas  corpus  .  .  .  on  the  ground  that  he  is  in  custody  in 
violation of the Constitution."

JUDICIAL  DIST.  v.  OSBORNE  

Opinion of the Court  

While  Osborne's  claim  falls  within  the  literal  terms  of $ 1983,  we  have  also  recognized  that  $ 1983  must  be  read  in 

harmony  with  the  habeas  statute.  See  Preiser  v.  Rodri-
guez,  411  U. S.  475,  500  (1973);  Heck,  512  U. S.,  at  487. 
"Stripped  to  its  essence,"  the  State  says,  "Osborne's  $ 1983 action is nothing more than a request for evidence to support 

a  hypothetical  claim  that  he  is  actually  innocent.  .  .  .  [T]his 
hypothetical  claim  sounds  at  the  core  of  habeas  corpus." Brief for Petitioners 19. 

Osborne responds  that his  claim does not sound in  habeas at  all.  Although  invalidating  his  conviction  is  of  course  his 
ultimate  goal,  giving  him  the  evidence  he  seeks  "would  not 
necessarily imply the invalidity of [his] confinement."  Brief 
for  Respondent  21.  If  he  prevails,  he  would  receive  only 
access to the DNA, and even if DNA testing exonerates him, 
his  conviction  is  not  automatically  invalidated.  He  must 
bring  an  entirely  separate  suit  or  a  petition  for  clemency  to 
invalidate  his  conviction.  If  he  were  proved  innocent,  the 
State  might  also  release  him  on  its  own  initiative,  avoiding 
any need to pursue habeas at all. 

Osborne  also  invokes  our  recent  decision  in  Wilkinson  v. 
Dotson,  544  U. S.  74  (2005).  There,  we  held  that  prisoners 
who sought new hearings for parole eligibility and suitability 
need not proceed in habeas.  We acknowledged that the two 
plaintiffs  "hope[d]"  their  suits  would  "help  bring  about  ear-
lier  release,"  id.,  at  78,  but  concluded  that  the  $ 1983  suit 
would  not  accomplish  that  without  further  proceedings. 
"Because  neither  prisoner's  claim  would  necessarily  spell 
speedier  release,  neither  l[ay]  at  the  core  of  habeas  corpus." 
Id.,  at  82  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Every  Court 
of Appeals to consider the question since Dotson has decided 
that because access to DNA evidence similarly does not "nec-
essarily spell speedier release," ibid., it can be sought under 

$ 1983.  See  423  F.  3d,  at  1055-1056;  Savory  v.  Lyons,  469 
F. 3d 667, 672 (CA7 2006); McKithen v.  Brown, 481 F. 3d 89, 
103,  and  n.  15  (CA2  2007).  On  the  other  hand,  the  State

Opinion of the Court 
argues that Dotson is distinguishable because the challenged procedures in that  case did not  affect the ultimate "exercise 

of discretion by the parole board."  Brief for Petitioners 32. It  also  maintains  that  Dotson  does  not  set  forth  "the  exclu-
sive  test for whether  a  prisoner  may  proceed under  $ 1983." Brief for Petitioners 32. 

While  we  granted  certiorari  on  this  question,  our  resolu-tion  of  Osborne's  claims  does  not  require  us  to  resolve  this 
difficult  issue.  Accordingly,  we  will  assume  without  decid-ing that the Court of Appeals was correct that 

Heck does not bar  Osborne's  $ 1983  claim.  Even  under  this  assumption,  it 

was wrong to find a due process violation. 

IV 

A 

"No  State  shall  .  . .  deprive  any  person  of  life,  liberty,  or property,  without  due  process  of  law."  U. S.  Const.,  Amdt. 

14,  $ 1;  accord,  Amdt.  5.  This  Clause  imposes  procedural limitations on a State's power to take away protected entitle-
ments.  See,  e. g.,  Jones  v.  Flowers,  547  U. S.  220,  226-239 (2006).  Osborne  argues  that  access  to  the  State's  evidence 
is a "process" needed to vindicate his  right to prove himself innocent  and  get  out  of  jail.  Process  is  not an  end  in  itself, 
so  a  necessary  premise  of  this  argument  is  that  he  has  an entitlement (what our precedents call a "liberty interest") to 
prove his  innocence even after a  fair trial has  proved other-wise.  We  must  first  examine  this  asserted  liberty  interest 
to  determine  what  process  (if  any)  is  due.  See  Board  of 
Regents  of  State  Colleges  v.  Roth,  408  U. S.  564,  570-571 (1972); 

Olim  v.  Wakinekona,  461  U. S.  238,  250-251  (1983). In  identifying  his  potential  liberty  interest,  Osborne  first 

attempts  to  rely  on  the  Governor's  constitutional  authority to  "grant  pardons,  commutations,  and  reprieves."  Alaska

Opinion of the Court  

to  which  no  particular  claimant  is  entitled  as  a  matter  of state  law. 

Connecticut  Bd.  of  Pardons  v.  Dumschat,  452 
U. S.  458,  464  (1981).  Osborne  therefore  cannot  challenge the constitutionality of any procedures available to vindicate 

an interest in state clemency. Osborne  does,  however,  have  a  liberty  interest  in  demon-
strating  his  innocence  with  new  evidence  under  state  law. 
As explained, Alaska law provides that those who use "newly discovered  evidence"  to  "establis[h]  by  clear  and  convincing 

evidence  that  [they  are]  innocent"  may  obtain  "vacation  of [their]  conviction  or  sentence  in  the  interest  of  justice." 
Alaska  Stat.  $$ 12.72.020(b)(2),  12.72.010(4).  This  "state-
created  right  can,  in  some  circumstances,  beget  yet  other 
rights to procedures essential to the realization of the parent 
right."  Dumschat, supra,  at 463; see also Wolff  v.  McDon-
nell, 418 U. S. 539, 556-558 (1974). 

The Court of Appeals went too far, however, in concluding 
that  the  Due  Process  Clause  requires  that  certain  familiar 
preconviction  trial  rights  be  extended  to  protect  Osborne's 
postconviction liberty interest.  After identifying Osborne's 
possible liberty interests, the court concluded that the State 
had  an  obligation  to  comply  with  the  principles  of  Brady  v. 
Maryland, 373 U. S. 83.  In that case, we held that due proc-
ess  requires  a  prosecutor  to  disclose  material  exculpatory 
evidence  to  the  defendant  before  trial.  The  Court  of  Ap-
peals  acknowledged  that  nothing  in  our  precedents  sug-
gested that this disclosure obligation continued after the de-
fendant was  convicted and the case  was closed, 521  F. 3d, at 
1128, but it relied on prior Ninth Circuit precedent applying 
"Brady  as  a  post-conviction  right,"  ibid.  (citing  Thomas  v. 
Goldsmith, 979 F. 2d 746, 749-750 (1992)).  Osborne does not 
claim  that  Brady  controls  this  case,  Brief  for  Respondent 
39-40, and with good reason. 

A  criminal  defendant  proved  guilty  after  a  fair  trial  does 
not have the same liberty interests as a free man.  At trial, 
the  defendant  is  presumed  innocent  and  may  demand  that

Opinion of the Court 
the  government  prove  its  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt. But  "[o]nce  a  defendant  has  been  afforded  a  fair  trial  and 

convicted  of  the  offense  for  which  he  was  charged,  the  pre-sumption  of  innocence  disappears." 

Herrera,  506  U. S.,  at 
399.  "Given  a  valid  conviction,  the  criminal  defendant  has been  constitutionally  deprived  of  his  liberty." 

Dumschat, 
supra,  at  464  (internal  quotation  marks  and  alterations 
omitted). The State accordingly has more flexibility in deciding what 

procedures are needed in the context of postconviction relief. "[W]hen a State chooses to offer help to those seeking relief 
from  convictions,"  due  process  does  not  "dictat[e]  the  exact 
form  such  assistance  must  assume."  Pennsylvania  v.  Fin-
ley, 481 U. S. 551, 559 (1987).  Osborne's right to due process 
is  not  parallel  to  a  trial  right,  but  rather  must  be  analyzed 
in  light  of  the  fact  that  he  has  already  been  found  guilty  at 
a  fair  trial,  and  has  only  a  limited  interest  in  postconviction 
relief.  Brady is the wrong framework. 

Instead,  the  question  is  whether  consideration  of  Os-
borne's claim within the framework of the State's procedures 
for postconviction relief "offends some principle of justice so 
rooted  in  the  traditions  and  conscience  of  our  people  as  to 
be ranked as fundamental," or "transgresses any recognized 
principle  of  fundamental  fairness  in  operation."  Medina  v. 
California, 505 U. S. 437, 446, 448 (1992) (internal quotation 
marks  omitted);  see  Herrera,  supra,  at  407-408  (applying 
Medina to postconviction relief for actual innocence); Finley, 
supra,  at  556  (postconviction  relief  procedures  are  constitu-
tional  if  they  "compor[t]  with  fundamental  fairness").  Fed-
eral  courts  may  upset  a  State's  postconviction  relief  proce-
dures only if they are fundamentally inadequate to vindicate 
the substantive rights provided. 

We  see  nothing  inadequate  about  the  procedures  Alaska 
has  provided  to  vindicate  its  state  right  to  postconviction 
relief  in  general,  and  nothing  inadequate  about  how  those 
procedures apply to those who seek access to DNA evidence.

70  DISTRICT  ATTORNEY'S  OFFICE  FOR  THIRD  

JUDICIAL  DIST.  v.  OSBORNE  

Opinion of the Court  

Alaska  provides  a  substantive  right  to  be  released  on  a sufficiently  compelling  showing  of  new  evidence  that  estab-

lishes innocence.  It exempts such claims from otherwise ap-plicable  time  limits.  The  State  provides  for  discovery  in 
postconviction  proceedings,  and  has--through  judicial  deci-sion--specified  that  this  discovery  procedure  is  available  to 
those seeking access to DNA evidence.  Patterson, 2006 WL 
573797,  *4.  These  procedures  are  not  without  limits.  The evidence  must  indeed  be  newly  available  to  qualify  under 

Alaska's  statute,  must  have  been  diligently  pursued,  and must  also  be  sufficiently  material.  These  procedures  are 
similar  to  those  provided  for  DNA  evidence  by  federal  law 
and  the  law  of  other  States,  see,  e. g.,  18  U. S. C.  $ 3600(a), 
and  they  are  not  inconsistent  with  the  "traditions  and  con-
science  of  our  people"  or  with  "any  recognized  principle  of 
fundamental  fairness,"  Medina,  supra,  at  446,  448  (internal 
quotation marks omitted). 

And there is more.  While the Alaska courts have not had 
occasion  to  conclusively  decide  the  question,  the  Alaska 
Court  of  Appeals  has  suggested  that  the  State  Constitution 
provides an additional right of  access  to DNA.  In express-
ing  its  "reluctan[ce]  to  hold  that  Alaska  law  offers  no  rem-
edy" to those who belatedly seek DNA testing, and in invok-
ing the  three-part test used by other state courts, the court 
indicated  that  in  an  appropriate  case  the  State  Constitution 
may provide a failsafe even for those who cannot satisfy the 
statutory  requirements  under  general  postconviction  proce-
dures.  Osborne I, 110 P. 3d, at 995-996. 

To  the  degree  there  is  some  uncertainty  in  the  details  of 
Alaska's newly developing procedures for obtaining postcon-
viction access to DNA, we can hardly fault the State for that. 
Osborne  has  brought  this  $ 1983  action  without  ever  using 
these procedures in filing a state or federal habeas claim re-
lying  on actual  innocence.  In other words, he has  not  tried 
to use the process provided to him by the State or attempted 
to  vindicate  the  liberty  interest  that  is  now  the  centerpiece

Opinion of the Court 
of  his  claim.  When  Osborne  did  request  DNA  testing  in state court, he sought RFLP testing that had been available 

at  trial,  not  the  STR  testing  he  now  seeks,  and  the  state court relied on that fact in denying him testing under Alaska 
law.  Id., at 992 ("[T]he DNA testing that Osborne proposes to perform on this evidence existed at the time of Osborne's 
trial"); Osborne II, 163 P. 3d, at 984 (Mannheimer, J., concur-
ring)  ("[T]he  DNA  testing  [Osborne]  proposes  would  not yield  `new  evidence'  for  purposes  of . . .  [Alaska  Stat. 

$ 12.72.010]"  because  it  was  "available  at  the  time  of  Os-borne's trial"). 

His  attempt  to  sidestep  state  process  through  a  new  fed-
eral  lawsuit  puts  Osborne  in  a  very  awkward  position.  If 
he simply seeks the DNA through the State's discovery pro-
cedures,  he  might  well  get  it.  If  he  does  not,  it  may  be  for 
a  perfectly  adequate  reason,  just  as  the  federal  statute  and 
all  state  statutes  impose  conditions  and  limits  on  access  to 
DNA  evidence.  It  is  difficult  to  criticize  the  State's  proce-
dures  when  Osborne  has  not  invoked  them.  This  is  not  to 
say  that  Osborne  must  exhaust  state-law  remedies.  See 
Patsy  v.  Board  of  Regents  of  Fla.,  457  U. S.  496,  500-501 
(1982).  But it is Osborne's burden to demonstrate the inade-
quacy  of  the  state-law  procedures  available  to  him  in  state 
postconviction  relief.  Cf.  Medina,  supra,  at  453.  These 
procedures  are  adequate  on  their  face,  and  without  trying 
them,  Osborne  can  hardly  complain  that  they  do  not  work 
in practice. 

As a fallback, Osborne also obliquely relies on an asserted 
federal  constitutional  right  to  be  released  upon  proof  of 
"actual  innocence."  Whether  such  a  federal  right  exists  is 
an open question.  We have struggled with it over the years, 
in  some  cases  assuming,  arguendo,  that  it  exists  while  also 
noting the difficult questions such a right would pose and the 
high standard any claimant would have to meet.  House, 547 
U. S., at 554-555; Herrera, 506 U. S., at 398-417; see also id., 
at 419-421 (O'Connor, J., concurring); id., at 427-428 (Scalia,

J.,  concurring); Friendly, Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack  on  Criminal  Judgments,  38  U.  Chi.  L.  Rev.  142,  159, 

n. 87 (1970).  In this case too we can assume without decid-ing  that  such  a  claim  exists,  because  even  if  so  there  is  no 
due  process  problem.  Osborne  does  not  dispute  that  a  fed-eral  actual  innocence  claim  (as  opposed  to  a  DNA  access 
claim)  would  be  brought  in  habeas.  Brief  for  Respondent 22-24.  If  such  a  habeas  claim  is  viable,  federal  procedural 
rules  permit  discovery  "for  good  cause."  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254 Rule  6; 

Bracy  v.  Gramley,  520  U. S.  899,  908-909  (1997). Just  as  with  state  law,  Osborne  cannot  show  that  available 

discovery  is  facially  inadequate,  and  cannot  show  that  it would be arbitrarily denied to him. 

B 
The Court of Appeals below relied only on procedural due process,  but  Osborne  seeks  to  defend  the  judgment  on  the 

basis  of  substantive  due  process  as  well.  He  asks  that  we recognize  a  freestanding  right  to  DNA  evidence  untethered 
from the liberty interests he hopes to vindicate with it.  We reject  the  invitation  and  conclude,  in  the  circumstances  of 
this case, that there is no such substantive due process right. "As  a  general  matter,  the  Court  has  always  been  reluctant 
to  expand  the  concept  of  substantive  due  process  because guideposts  for  responsible  decisionmaking  in  this  unchar-
tered  area  are  scarce  and  open-ended."  Collins  v.  Harker 
Heights,  503  U. S.  115,  125  (1992).  Osborne  seeks  access  to state  evidence  so  that  he  can  apply  new  DNA-testing  tech-

nology that might prove him innocent.  There is no long his-tory of  such  a  right, and  "[t]he  mere novelty  of such  a claim 
is reason enough to doubt that `substantive due process' sus-tains it." 

Reno v.  Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 303 (1993). And there are further reasons to doubt.  The elected gov-

ernments  of  the  States  are  actively  confronting  the  chal-lenges DNA technology poses to our criminal justice systems 
and our traditional notions of finality, as well as the opportu-

Opinion of the Court 
nities  it  affords.  To  suddenly  constitutionalize  this  area would short circuit what looks to be a prompt and considered 

legislative  response.  The  first  DNA-testing  statutes  were passed  in  1994  and  1997.  Act  of  Aug.  2,  1994,  ch.  737,  1994 
N.  Y.  Laws  3709  (codified  at  N.  Y.  Crim.  Proc.  Law  Ann. $ 440.30(1-a)  (West  2005));  Act  of  May  9,  1997,  Pub.  Act 
No.  90-141,  1997  Ill.  Laws  2461  (codified  at  725  Ill.  Comp. Stat., ch. 725, $ 5/116-3(a) (West 2007)).  In the past decade, 
44  States  and  the  Federal  Government  have  followed  suit, reflecting  the  increased  availability  of  DNA  testing.  As 
noted,  Alaska  itself  is  considering  such  legislation.  See 
supra,  at 64.  "By extending constitutional protection to an asserted right or liberty interest, we, to a great extent, place 

the matter outside the arena of public debate and legislative action.  We  must  therefore  exercise  the  utmost  care  when-
ever  we  are  asked  to  break  new  ground  in  this  field." 
Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 720 (internal quotation marks omit-ted).  "[J]udicial  imposition  of  a  categorical  remedy . . .

Opinion of the Court  

substantive  due  process  rulemaking  authority  would  not only  have  to  cover  the  right  of  access but  a  myriad  of  other 

issues.  We would soon have to decide if there is a constitu-tional  obligation  to  preserve  forensic  evidence  that  might 
later  be  tested.  Cf.  Arizona  v.  Youngblood,  488  U. S.  51, 56-58 (1988).  If so, for how long?  Would it be different for 
different  types  of  evidence?  Would  the  State  also  have some  obligation  to  gather  such  evidence  in  the  first  place? 
How  much,  and  when?  No  doubt  there  would  be  a  miscel-lany  of  other  minor  directives.  See, 

e. g.,  Harvey  v.  Horan, 285  F.  3d  298,  300-301  (CA4  2002)  (Wilkinson,  C.  J.,  concur-

ring in denial of rehearing). In  this  case,  the  evidence  has  already  been  gathered  and 
preserved,  but  if  we  extend  substantive  due  process  to  this area, these questions would be before us in short order, and 
it  is  hard  to  imagine  what  tools  federal  courts  would  use  to answer  them.  At  the  end  of  the  day,  there  is  no  reason  to 
suppose  that  their  answers to  these questions  would be  any better  than  those  of  state  courts  and  legislatures,  and  good 
reason  to  suspect  the  opposite.  See  Collins,  supra,  at  125; 
Glucksberg, supra, at 720.

DNA  evidence  will  undoubtedly  lead  to  changes  in  the criminal justice system.  It has done so already.  The ques-

tion  is  whether  further  change  will  primarily  be  made  by legislative revision and judicial interpretation of the existing 
system, or whether the Federal Judiciary must leap ahead-- revising  (or  even  discarding)  the  system  by  creating  a  new 
constitutional  right  and  taking  over  responsibility  for  refin-ing it. 

Federal courts should not presume that state criminal pro-cedures will be inadequate to deal with technological change. 
The  criminal  justice  system  has  historically  accommodated new types of evidence, and is a time-tested means of carrying 
out  society's  interest  in  convicting  the  guilty  while  respect-

late  in  a  more  comprehensive  way  to  Travelers'  dealings 
with Manville. 

The Bankruptcy Court's uncontested factual findings drive 
the point  home.  In substance, the Bankruptcy  Court found 
that  the  Direct  Actions  seek  to  recover  against  Travelers 
either  for  supposed  wrongdoing  in  its  capacity  as  Manville's 
insurer  or  for  improper  use  of  information  that  Travelers 
obtained  from  Manville  as  its  insurer.  These  actions  so 
clearly  involve  "claims"  (and,  all  the  more  so,  "allegations") 
"based  upon,  arising  out  of  or  relating  to"  Travelers'  insur-
ance  coverage  of  Manville,  that  we  have  no  need  here  to 
stake  out  the  ultimate  bounds  of  the  injunction.  There  is, 
of  course,  a  cutoff  at  some  point,  where  the  connection  be-
tween  the  insurer's  action  complained  of  and  the  insurance 
coverage would be thin to the point of absurd.  See Califor-

Given  the  Clarifying  Order's  correct  reading  of  the  1986 Orders,  the  only  question  left  is  whether  the  Bankruptcy 

Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to enter the Clarifying Order.  The answer  here is  easy: as the  Second Circuit rec-
ognized,  and  respondents  do  not  dispute,  the  Bankruptcy Court  plainly  had  jurisdiction  to  interpret  and  enforce  its 
own  prior  orders.  See  Local Loan Co.

Opinion of the Court

Our  holding  is  narrow.  We  do  not  resolve  whether  a 
bankruptcy  court,  in  1986  or  today,  could  properly  enjoin 
claims  against  nondebtor  insurers  that  are  not  derivative  of 
the debtor's wrongdoing.  As the Court of Appeals noted, in 
1994  Congress  explicitly  authorized  bankruptcy  courts,  in 
some  circumstances,  to  enjoin  actions  against  a  nondebtor 
"alleged to be directly or indirectly liable for the conduct of, 
claims against, or demands  on the  debtor to the  extent such 
alleged liability . . . arises by reason of . . . the third party's 
provision of insurance to the debtor or a related party," and 
to  channel  those  claims  to  a  trust  for  payments  to  asbestos 
claimants.  11  U. S. C.  $ 524(g)(4)(A)(ii).  On  direct  review 
today, a channeling injunction of the sort issued by the Bank-
ruptcy Court in 1986 would have to be measured against the 
requirements  of  $ 524  (to  begin  with,  at  least).  But  owing 
to the posture of this litigation, we do not address the scope 
of an injunction authorized by that section.8 

Nor  do  we  decide  whether  any  particular  respondent  is 
bound by the 1986 Orders.  We have assumed that respond-
ents  are  bound,  but  the  Court  of  Appeals  did  not  consider 
this question.  Chubb, in fact, relying on Amchem

action,  see  42  U. S. C.  $$ 2000e-2(m)  and  2000e-5(g)(2)(B),  the  ADEA 
does  not  provide  that  a  plaintiff  may  establish  discrimination  by 
showing that age was simply a motivating factor.  Moreover, Congress 
neglected to add such a provision to the ADEA when it added $$ 2000e- 
2(m)  and  2000e-5(g)(2)(B)  to  Title  VII,  even  though  it  contemporane-
ously  amended  the  ADEA  in  several  ways.  When  Congress  amends 
one  statutory  provision  but  not  another,  it  is  presumed  to  have  acted 
intentionally,  see  EEOC  v.  Arabian  American  Oil  Co.,  499  U. S.  244, 
256, and "negative implications raised by disparate provisions are stron-
gest"  where  the  provisions  were  "considered  simultaneously  when  the 
language  raising  the  implication  was  inserted,"  Lindh  v.  Murphy,  521 
U. S. 320, 330.  Pp. 173-175. 

(b)  The ADEA's text does not authorize an alleged mixed-motives age 
discrimination  claim.  The  ordinary  meaning  of  the  ADEA's  require-
ment that an employer took adverse action "because of" age is that age 
was  the  "reason"  that  the  employer  decided  to  act.  See  Hazen  Paper 
Co.  v.  Biggins,  507  U. S.  604,  610.  To  establish  a  disparate-treatment 
claim  under  this  plain  language,  a  plaintiff  must  prove  that  age  was 
the  "but-for"  cause  of  the  employer's  adverse  decision.  See  Bridge  v. 
Phoenix Bond & Indemnity Co., 553 U. S. 639, 653-654.  It follows that 
under $ 623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to estab-
lish that "but-for" cause.  This Court has previously held this to be the 
burden's  proper  allocation  in  ADEA  cases,  see,  e. g.,  Kentucky  Retire-
ment  Systems  v.  EEOC,  554  U. S.  135,  139-143,  148-150,  and  nothing 

in the statute's text indicates that Congress has carved out an exception 
for a  subset of  ADEA cases.  Where a  statute is  "silent  on  the alloca-
tion  of  the  burden  of  persuasion,"  "the  ordinary  default  rule  [is]  that 
plaintiffs  bear  the  risk  of  failing  to  prove  their  claims."  Schaffer  v. 
Weast, 546 U. S. 49, 56.  Hence, the burden of persuasion is the same in 
alleged mixed-motives cases as in any other ADEA disparate-treatment 
action.  Pp. 175-178. 

(c)  This  Court  rejects  petitioner's  contention  that  the  proper  inter-
pretation of the  ADEA is nonetheless controlled  by Price Waterhouse, 
which  initially  established  that  the  burden  of  persuasion  shifted  in  al-
leged  mixed-motives  Title  VII  claims.  It  is  far  from  clear  that  the 
Court  would  have  the  same  approach  were  it  to  consider  the  question 
today  in  the  first  instance.  Whatever  Price  Waterhouse's  deficiencies 
in  retrospect,  it  has  become  evident  in  the  years  since  that  case  was 
decided  that  its  burden-shifting  framework  is  difficult  to  apply.  The 
problems associated with its application have eliminated any perceivable 
benefit  to  extending  its  framework  to  ADEA  claims.  Cf.  Continental

Opinion of the Court 
crimination in order to obtain a mixed-motives jury instruc-tion  in  a  suit  brought  under  the  Age  Discrimination  in  Em-

ployment  Act  of  1967  (ADEA),  81  Stat.  602,  as  amended,  29 U. S. C.  $ 621  et  seq.  Because  we  hold  that  such  a  jury  in-
struction  is  never  proper  in  an  ADEA  case,  we  vacate  the decision below. 

I 
Petitioner Jack  Gross began  working for respondent FBL Financial Group, Inc. (FBL), in 1971.  As of 2001, Gross held 

the  position  of  claims  administration  director.  But  in  2003, when he was 54 years old, Gross was reassigned to the posi-
tion of claims project coordinator.  At that same time, FBL transferred  many  of  Gross'  job  responsibilities  to  a  newly 
created  position--claims  administration  manager.  That  po-sition was given to Lisa Kneeskern, who had previously been 
supervised  by  Gross  and  who  was  then  in  her  early  forties. App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a, 23a (District Court opinion).  Al-
though  Gross  (in  his  new  position)  and  Kneeskern  received the  same  compensation,  Gross  considered  the  reassignment 
a  demotion  because  of  FBL's  reallocation  of  his  former  job responsibilities to Kneeskern. 

In  April  2004,  Gross  filed  suit  in  District  Court,  alleging that his reassignment to the position of claims project coordi-
nator  violated  the  ADEA,  which  makes  it  unlawful  for  an employer  to  take  adverse  action  against  an  employee  "be-
cause  of  such  individual's  age."  29  U. S. C.  $ 623(a).  The case  proceeded  to  trial,  where  Gross  introduced  evidence 
suggesting  that  his  reassignment  was  based  at  least  in  part on  his  age.  FBL  defended  its  decision  on  the  grounds  that 
Gross'  reassignment  was  part  of  a  corporate  restructuring and  that  Gross'  new  position  was  better  suited  to  his  skills. 
See App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a (District Court opinion). At  the  close  of  trial,  and  over  FBL's  objections,  the  Dis-
trict Court instructed the jury that it must return a verdict for  Gross  if  he  proved,  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence, 
that FBL "demoted [him] to claims projec[t] coordinator" and

Opinion of the Court 
that  his  "age  was  a  motivating  factor"  in  FBL's  decision  to demote  him.  App.  9-10.  The  jury  was  further  instructed 

that Gross' age would qualify as a " `motivating factor,' if [it] played a part or a role in [FBL]'s decision to demote [him]." 
Id.,  at  10.  The  jury  was  also  instructed  regarding  FBL's burden of proof.  According to the  District  Court, the "ver-
dict  must  be  for  [FBL]  .  .  .  if  it  has  been  proved  by  the 
preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  [FBL]  would  have  de-moted  [Gross]  regardless  of  his  age." 

Ibid.  The  jury  re-
turned  a  verdict  for  Gross,  awarding  him  $46,945  in  lost compensation. 

Id., at 8. 
FBL  challenged  the  jury  instructions  on  appeal.  The 
United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eighth  Circuit  re-

172  GROSS  v.  FBL  FINANCIAL  SERVICES,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 
of  O'Connor,  J.).  Justice  O'Connor  further  found  that  to shift the burden of persuasion to the employer, the employee 

must  present  "direct  evidence  that  an  illegitimate  criterion was  a  substantial  factor  in  the  [employment]  decision." 
Ibid. In  accordance  with  Circuit  precedent,  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals  identified  Justice  O'Connor's  opinion  as  controlling. 
See  526  F.  3d,  at  359  (citing  Erickson  v.  Farmland  Indus-
tries,  Inc.,  271  F.  3d  718,  724  (CA8  2001)).  Applying  that 
standard,  the  Court  of  Appeals  found  that  Gross  needed  to present  "[d]irect evidence  .  .  . sufficient  to support  a finding 

by a reasonable fact finder that an illegitimate criterion actu-
ally  motivated  the  adverse  employment  action."  526  F.  3d, 
at  359  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  In  the  Court  of 
Appeals'  view,  "direct  evidence"  is  only  that  evidence  that 
"show[s]  a  specific  link  between  the  alleged  discriminatory 
animus and the challenged decision."  Ibid. (internal quota-
tion  marks  omitted).  Only upon a  presentation  of  such evi-
dence, the Court of Appeals held, should the burden shift to 
the  employer  " `to  convince  the  trier  of  fact  that  it  is  more 
likely  than  not  that  the  decision  would  have  been  the  same 
absent consideration of the  illegitimate  factor. ' "  Ibid. 
(quoting  Price  Waterhouse,  supra,  at  276  (opinion  of  O'Con-
nor, J.)). 

The  Court  of  Appeals  thus  concluded  that  the  District 
Court's  jury  instructions  were  flawed  because  they  allowed 
the burden to shift to FBL upon a presentation of a prepon-
derance of any category of evidence showing that age was a 
motivating  factor--not  just  "direct  evidence"  related  to 
FBL's  alleged  consideration  of  age.  See  526  F.  3d,  at  360. 
Because  Gross  conceded  that  he  had  not  presented  direct 
evidence  of  discrimination,  the  Court  of  Appeals  held  that 
the District Court should not  have given the mixed-motives 
instruction.  Ibid.  Rather, Gross  should have  been  held  to 
the  burden  of  persuasion  applicable  to  typical,  non-mixed-
motives  claims;  the  jury  thus  should  have  been  instructed

only  to  determine  whether  Gross  had  carried  his  burden  of "prov[ing] that age was the determining factor in FBL's em-

ployment action."  See ibid. We  granted  certiorari,  555  U. S.  1066  (2008),  and  now  va-
cate the decision of the Court of Appeals. 

II 
The  parties  have  asked  us  to  decide  whether  a  plaintiff must  "present  direct  evidence  of  discrimination  in  order 

to  obtain  a  mixed-motive  instruction  in  a  non-Title  VII  dis-crimination  case."  Pet.  for  Cert.  i.  Before  reaching  this 
question,  however,  we  must  first  determine  whether  the burden  of  persuasion  ever  shifts  to  the  party  defending  an 
alleged  mixed-motives  discrimination  claim  brought  under the ADEA.

1  We hold that it does not. 

A 
Petitioner relies on this Court's decisions  construing Title VII for his interpretation of the ADEA.  Because Title VII 

is  materially  different  with  respect  to  the  relevant  burden of  persuasion,  however,  these  decisions  do  not  control  our 
construction of the ADEA. In 

Price Waterhouse, a plurality of the Court and two Jus-tices  concurring  in  the  judgment  determined  that  once  a 

"plaintiff in a Title VII case proves that [the plaintiff 's mem-bership  in  a  protected  class]  played  a  motivating  part  in  an 

1 Although the parties did not specifically frame the question to include 
this  threshold  inquiry,  "[t]he  statement  of  any  question  presented  is 
deemed  to  comprise  every  subsidiary  question  fairly  included  therein." 
This Court's Rule 14.1; see also City of Sherrill v.  Oneida Indian Nation 
of N. Y., 544 U. S. 197, 214, n. 8 (2005) (" `Questions not explicitly mentioned 
but essential to the analysis of the decisions below or to the correct dispo-

employment  decision,  the  defendant  may  avoid  a  finding  of 
liability only by proving by a preponderance of the evidence 
that it would have made the same decision even if it had not 
taken  [that  factor]  into  account."  490  U. S.,  at  258;  see  also 
id.,  at  259-260  (opinion  of  White,  J.);  id.,  at  276  (opinion  of 
O'Connor,  J.).  But  as  we  explained  in  Desert  Palace,  Inc. 
v.  Costa,  539  U. S.  90,  94-95  (2003),  Congress  has  since 
amended  Title  VII  by  explicitly  authorizing  discrimination 
claims in which an improper consideration was "a motivating 
factor" for an adverse employment decision.  See 42 U. S. C. 

$ 2000e-2(m) (providing that "an  unlawful  employment 
practice  is  established  when  the  complaining  party  demon-
strates  that  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  or  national  origin  was 
a  motivating  factor  for  any  employment  practice,  even 
though  other  factors  also  motivated  the  practice"  (emphasis 
added));  $ 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)  (restricting  the  remedies  avail-
able to plaintiffs proving violations of $ 2000e-2(m)). 

This Court has never held that this burden-shifting frame-
work  applies  to  ADEA  claims.  And,  we  decline  to  do  so 
now.  When  conducting  statutory  interpretation,  we  "must 
be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to 
a different statute without careful and critical examination." 
Federal  Express  Corp.  v.  Holowecki,  552  U. S.  389,  393 
(2008).  Unlike Title VII, the ADEA's text does not provide 
that a plaintiff may establish discrimination by showing that 
age  was  simply  a  motivating  factor.  Moreover,  Congress 
neglected  to  add  such  a  provision  to  the  ADEA  when 
it  amended  Title  VII  to  add  $$ 2000e-2(m)  and  2000e- 
5(g)(2)(B),  even  though  it  contemporaneously  amended  the 
ADEA  in  several  ways,  see  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1991,  $ 115, 
105 Stat. 1079; id., $ 302, at 1088. 

We  cannot ignore  Congress'  decision to  amend Title  VII's 
relevant  provisions  but  not  make  similar  changes  to  the 
ADEA.  When  Congress  amends  one  statutory  provision 
but  not  another,  it  is  presumed  to  have  acted  intentionally.

Opinion of the Court 
See  EEOC  v.  Arabian  American  Oil  Co.,  499  U. S.  244,  256 (1991).  Furthermore, as the Court has explained, "negative 

implications  raised  by  disparate  provisions  are  strongest" when  the  provisions  were  "considered  simultaneously  when 
the  language  raising  the  implication  was  inserted."  Lindh v.  Murphy,  521  U. S.  320,  330  (1997).  As  a  result,  the 
Court's interpretation of the ADEA is not governed by Title VII decisions such as 

Desert Palace and Price Waterhouse.2 

B 
Our inquiry therefore must focus on the text of the ADEA to decide whether it authorizes a mixed-motives age discrim-

ination  claim.  It  does  not.  "Statutory  construction  must begin  with  the  language  employed  by  Congress  and  the  as-
sumption  that  the  ordinary  meaning  of  that  language  accu-rately  expresses  the  legislative  purpose."

176  GROSS  v.  FBL  FINANCIAL  SERVICES,  INC. 

Opinion of the Court 
U. S.  246,  252  (2004)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted). 
The ADEA provides, in relevant part,  that "[i]t shall be un-
lawful  for  an  employer  . . . to fail or  refuse  to  hire  or  to 
discharge  any  individual  or  otherwise  discriminate  against 
any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, con-
ditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individ-
ual's age."  29 U. S. C. $ 623(a)(1) (emphasis added). 

The  words  "because  of "  mean  "by  reason  of:  on  account 
of."  1  Webster's  Third  New  International  Dictionary  194 
(1966);  see  also  1  Oxford  English  Dictionary  746  (1933)  (de-
fining  "because  of "  to  mean  "[b]y  reason  of,  on  account  of " 
(italics  in  original));  The  Random  House  Dictionary  of  the 
English  Language  132  (1966)  (defining  "because"  to  mean 
"by reason; on account").  Thus, the ordinary meaning of the 
ADEA's  requirement  that  an  employer  took  adverse  action 
"because  of "  age  is  that  age  was  the  "reason"  that  the  em-
ployer decided to act.  See Hazen Paper Co. v.  Biggins, 507 
U. S.  604,  610  (1993)  (explaining  that  the  claim  "cannot  suc-
ceed  unless  the  employee's  protected  trait  actually  played  a 
role  in  [the  employer's  decisionmaking]  process  and  had  a 
determinative influence on the outcome" (emphasis added)). 
To establish a disparate-treatment claim under the plain lan-
guage  of  the  ADEA,  therefore,  a  plaintiff  must  prove  that 
age  was  the  "but-for"  cause  of  the  employer's  adverse  deci-
sion.  See  Bridge  v.  Phoenix  Bond  &  Indemnity  Co.,  553 
U. S. 639, 653-654 (2008) (recognizing that the phrase, "by rea-
son of," requires at least a showing of "but for" causation (in-
ternal quotation marks omitted)); Safeco Ins. Co. of America 
v.  Burr, 551  U. S. 47,  63-64, and n. 14 (2007)  (observing that 
"[i]n  common  talk,  the  phrase  `based  on'  indicates  a  but-for 
causal  relationship  and  thus  a  necessary  logical  condition" 
and  that  the  statutory  phrase,  "based  on,"  has  the  same 
meaning  as  the  phrase,  "because  of "  (internal  quotation 
marks  omitted));  cf.  W.  Keeton,  D.  Dobbs,  R.  Keeton,  &  D. 
Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 265 (5th ed. 1984)

Opinion of the Court 
("An  act  or  omission  is  not  regarded  as  a  cause  of  an  event if the particular event would have occurred without it").

It follows, then, that under $ 623(a)(1), the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion to establish that age was the "but-

for"  cause  of  the  employer's  adverse  action.  Indeed,  we have previously held that the burden is allocated in this man-
ner  in  ADEA  cases.  See  Kentucky  Retirement  Systems  v. 
EEOC,  554  U. S.  135,  139-143,  148-150  (2008);  Reeves  v. Sanderson  Plumbing  Products,  Inc.,  530  U. S.  133,  141,  143 

(2000).  And nothing in the statute's text indicates that Con-gress  has  carved  out  an  exception  to  that  rule  for  a  subset 
of ADEA  cases.  Where  the  statutory  text  is  "silent  on  the allocation  of  the  burden  of  persuasion,"  we  "begin  with  the 
ordinary  default  rule  that  plaintiffs  bear  the  risk  of  failing to  prove  their  claims." 

Schaffer  v.  Weast,  546  U. S.  49,  56 (2005);  see  also  Meacham  v.  Knolls  Atomic  Power  Labora-

tory,  554  U. S.  84,  92  (2008)  ("Absent  some  reason  to  be-lieve that Congress intended otherwise, . . . we will conclude 
that the burden of persuasion lies where it usually falls, upon the  party  seeking  relief "  (internal  quotation  marks  omit-
ted)).  We have  no warrant to depart from  the general rule in this setting. 

Hence, the burden of persuasion necessary to establish em-ployer liability is the same in alleged mixed-motives cases as 
in any other ADEA disparate-treatment action.  A plaintiff must  prove  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  (which  may

Opinion of the Court 
be direct or circumstantial) that age was the "but-for" cause of  the  challenged  employer  decision.  See  Reeves,  supra,  at 

141-143, 147.4  III 

Finally,  we  reject  petitioner's  contention  that  our  inter-pretation  of  the  ADEA  is  controlled  by  Price  Waterhouse, 
which  initially  established  that  the  burden  of  persuasion shifted  in  alleged  mixed-motives  Title  VII  claims.

5  In  any 

event, it is far from clear that the Court would have the same approach  were  it  to  consider  the  question  today  in  the  first 

4 Because we hold that ADEA plaintiffs retain the burden of persuasion 
to  prove  all  disparate-treatment  claims,  we  do  not  need  to  address 
whether  plaintiffs  must  present  direct,  rather  than  circumstantial,  evi-
dence  to  obtain  a  burden-shifting  instruction.  There  is  no  heightened 
evidentiary  requirement  for  ADEA  plaintiffs  to  satisfy  their  burden  of 
persuasion  that  age  was  the  "but-for"  cause  of  their  employer's  adverse 
action,  see  29  U. S. C.  $ 623(a),  and  we  will  imply  none.  "Congress  has 
been unequivocal when imposing heightened proof requirements" in other 
statutory contexts, including in other subsections within Title 29, when it 
has  seen  fit.  See  Desert  Palace,  Inc.  v.  Costa,  539  U. S.  90,  99  (2003); 
see  also,  e. g.,  25  U. S. C.  $ 2504(b)(2)(B)  (imposing  "clear  and  convincing 
evidence" standard); 29 U. S. C. $ 722(a)(2)(A) (same).

instance.  Cf. 14 Penn Plaza LLC v.  Pyett, 556 U. S. 247, 270 (2009) (declining to "introduc[e] a qualification into the 

ADEA  that  is  not  found  in  its  text");  Meacham,  supra,  at 102  (explaining  that  the  ADEA  must  be  "read  .  .  .  the  way 
Congress wrote it"). Whatever  the  deficiencies  of  Price  Waterhouse  in  retro-
spect, it has become evident in the years since that case was decided  that  its  burden-shifting  framework  is  difficult  to 
apply.  For  example,  in  cases  tried  to  a  jury,  courts  have found  it  particularly  difficult  to  craft  an  instruction  to  ex-
plain  its  burden-shifting  framework.  See,  e. g.,  Tyler  v. 
Bethlehem  Steel  Corp.,  958  F.  2d  1176,  1179  (CA2  1992)  (re-ferring to "the murky water of shifting burdens in discrimi-

nation  cases");  Visser  v.  Packer  Engineering  Associates, 
Inc.,  924  F.  2d  655,  661  (CA7  1991)  (en  banc)  (Flaum,  J., dissenting)  ("The  difficulty  judges  have  in  formulating 

[burden-shifting]  instructions  and  jurors  have  in  applying them  can  be  seen  in  the  fact  that  jury  verdicts  in  ADEA 
cases are supplanted by judgments notwithstanding the ver-dict or reversed on appeal more frequently than jury verdicts 
generally").  Thus,  even  if  Price  Waterhouse  was  doctrin-ally sound, the problems associated with its application have 
eliminated  any  perceivable  benefit  to  extending  its  frame-work  to  ADEA  claims.  Cf. 

Continental  T.  V.,  Inc.  v.  GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47 (1977) (reevaluating precedent

Opinion of the Court 
The  district  filed  suit  seeking  relief  from  these  preclear-ance  obligations  under  the  "bailout"  provision  of  the  Voting 

Rights Act.  That provision allows the release of a "political subdivision"  from  the  preclearance  requirements  if  certain 
rigorous conditions are met.  The court below denied relief, concluding that bailout was unavailable to a political subdivi-
sion like the utility district that did not register its own vot-ers.  The district appealed, arguing that the Act imposes no 
such  limitation  on  bailout,  and  that  if  it  does,  the  preclear-ance requirements are unconstitutional. 

That  constitutional  question  has  attracted  ardent  briefs from dozens of interested  parties, but the  importance of the 
question does not justify our rushing to decide it.  Quite the contrary: Our usual practice is to avoid the unnecessary reso-
lution  of  constitutional  questions.  We  agree  that  the  dis-trict is eligible under the Act to seek bailout.  We therefore 
reverse, and do not reach the constitutionality of $ 5.

(1985).  The  question  presented  in  this  case  is  whether  the IDEA  Amendments  of  1997  (Amendments),  111  Stat.  37, 

categorically  prohibit  reimbursement  for  private-education costs if a child has not "previously received special education 
and related services under the authority of a public agency." $ 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  We  hold  that  the  Amendments  impose 
no such categorical bar.  I 

Respondent  T.  A.  attended  public  schools  in  the  Forest Grove  School  District  (School  District  or  District)  from  the 
time  he  was  in  kindergarten  through  the  winter  of  his  ju-nior year of high school.  From kindergarten through eighth 
grade,  respondent's  teachers  observed  that  he  had  trou-ble  paying  attention  in  class  and  completing  his  assign-
ments.  When  respondent  entered  high  school,  his  difficul-ties increased. 

In December 2000, during respondent's freshman year, his mother  contacted  the  school  counselor  to  discuss  respond-
ent's problems with his schoolwork.  At the end of the school year,  respondent  was  evaluated  by  a  school  psychologist. 
After  interviewing  him,  examining  his  school  records,  and administering  cognitive  ability  tests,  the  psychologist  con-
cluded  that  respondent  did  not  need  further  testing  for  any learning  disabilities  or  other  health  impairments,  including 
attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD).  The  psy-chologist and two other school officials discussed the evalua-
tion  results  with  respondent's  mother  in  June  2001,  and  all agreed  that  respondent  did  not  qualify  for  special-education 
services.  Respondent's  parents  did  not  seek  review  of that decision, although the hearing examiner later found that the 
School  District's  evaluation  was  legally  inadequate  because it  failed  to  address  all  areas  of  suspected  disability,  includ-
ing ADHD. With extensive help from his family, respondent completed 
his  sophomore  year  at  Forest  Grove  High  School,  but  his problems  worsened  during  his  junior  year.  In  February

testimony  of  numerous  experts,  the  hearing  officer  issued a  decision  in  January  2004  finding  that  respondent's  ADHD 

adversely affected his  educational performance  and that the School  District failed to meet its obligations  under IDEA  in 
not  identifying  respondent  as  a  student  eligible  for  special-education  services.  Because  the  District  did  not  offer  re-
spondent  a  FAPE  and  his  private-school  placement  was appropriate  under  IDEA,  the  hearing  officer  ordered  the 
District to reimburse respondent's parents for the cost of the private-school tuition.

2 

The  School  District  sought  judicial  review  pursuant  to $ 1415(i)(2),  arguing  that  the  hearing  officer  erred  in  grant-

ing  reimbursement.  The  District  Court  accepted  the  hear-ing officer's findings of fact but set aside the reimbursement 
award  after  finding  that  the  1997  Amendments  categor-ically  bar  reimbursement  of  private-school  tuition  for  stu-
dents  who  have  not  "previously  received  special  education and related services under the authority of a public agency." 

$ 612(a)(10)(C)(ii), 111 Stat. 63, 20 U. S. C. $ 1412(a)(10)(C)(ii). The  District  Court  further  held  that,  "[e]ven  assuming  that 
tuition  reimbursement  may  be  ordered  in  an  extreme  case for a student not receiving special education services, under 
general principles of equity where the need for special educa-tion was obvious to school authorities," the facts of this case 
do  not  support  equitable  relief.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  53a. The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Ninth  Circuit  reversed  and 
remanded  for  further  proceedings.  The  court  first  noted that,  prior  to  the  1997  Amendments,  "IDEA  was  silent  on 
the  subject  of private school  reimbursement,  but courts had granted  such  reimbursement  as  `appropriate'  relief  under 
principles  of  equity  pursuant  to  20  U. S. C.  $ 1415(i)(2)(C)." 523  F.  3d  1078,  1085  (2008)  (citing

Opinion of the Court 
Looking primarily to clauses (i) and (ii), the School District argues that Congress intended $ 1412(a)(10)(C) to provide the 

exclusive  source  of  authority  for  courts  to  order  reimburse-ment  when  parents  unilaterally  enroll  a  child  in  private 
school.  According  to  the  District,  clause  (i)  provides  a  safe harbor for school  districts that provide  a FAPE by  foreclos-
ing reimbursement in those circumstances.  Clause (ii) then 
sets  forth  the  circumstance  in  which  reimbursement  is  ap-propriate--namely,  when  a  school  district  fails  to  provide 

a  FAPE  to  a  child  who  has  previously  received  special-education  services  through  the  public  school.  The  District 
contends  that  because  $ 1412(a)(10)(C)  only  discusses  reim-
bursement  for  children  who  have  previously  received 
special-education  services  through  the  public  school,  IDEA 
only  authorizes  reimbursement  in  that  circumstance.  The 
dissent agrees. 

For  several  reasons,  we  find  this  argument  unpersuasive. 
First,  the  School  District's  reading  of  the  Act  is  not  sup-
ported  by  its  text  and  context,  as  the  1997  Amendments  do 
not  expressly  prohibit  reimbursement  under  the  circum-
stances of this case, and the  District offers no  evidence  that 
Congress intended to supersede our decisions in Burlington

then courts retain discretion to reduce the amount of a reim-bursement award  if the equities so warrant--for instance, if 

the parents failed to give the school district adequate notice of  their  intent  to  enroll  the  child  in  private  school.  In  con-
sidering  the  equities,  courts  should  generally  presume  that public-school  officials  are  properly  performing  their  obliga-
tions  under  IDEA.  See  Schaffer

performance  standard  does  not  apply  to  discharges  of  fill material. 

Reversing  the  judgment  of  the  District  Court,  the  Court of Appeals held that the EPA's performance standard applies 
to  this  discharge  so  that  the  permit  from  the  Corps  is unlawful. 

I 
A 
Petitioner  Coeur  Alaska  plans  to  reopen  the  Kensington Gold  Mine,  located  some  45  miles  north  of  Juneau,  Alaska. 

The mine has been closed since 1928, but Coeur Alaska seeks to make it profitable once  more by using  a technique known 
as  "froth  flotation."  Coeur  Alaska  will  churn  the  mine's crushed  rock  in  tanks  of  frothing  water.  Chemicals  in  the 
water will cause gold-bearing minerals to float to the surface, where they will be skimmed off. 

At  issue  is  Coeur  Alaska's  plan  to  dispose  of  the  mixture of  crushed  rock  and  water  left  behind  in  the  tanks.  This 
mixture is called slurry.  Some 30 percent of the slurry's vol-ume  is  crushed  rock,  resembling  wet  sand,  which  is  called 
tailings.  The rest is water. The  standard  way  to  dispose  of  slurry  is  to  pump  it  into 
a  tailings  pond.  The  slurry  separates  in  the  pond.  Solid tailings sink to the bottom, and water on the surface returns 
to the mine to be used again. Rather  than  build  a  tailings  pond,  Coeur  Alaska  proposes 
to use Lower Slate Lake, located some three miles from the mine  in  the  Tongass  National  Forest.  This  lake  is  small-- 
800  feet  at  its  widest  crossing,  2,000  feet  at  its  longest,  and 23  acres  in  area.  See  App.  138a,  212a.  Though  small,  the

ject to the CWA.  They also agree there can be no discharge into the lake except as the CWA and any lawful permit allow. 

Over the life of the mine, Coeur  Alaska intends to put 4.5 million tons of tailings in the lake.  This will raise the lake-

ries of new sources may discharge into the navigable waters of  the  United  States.  33  U. S. C.  $ 1316(b).  Pursuant  to 

this  authority,  the  EPA  in  1982  promulgated  a  new  source performance standard restricting discharges from new 
froth-flotation gold mines like Coeur Alaska's.  The standard is  stringent: It  allows  "no  discharge  of process  wastewater" 
from these mines.  40 CFR $ 440.104(b)(1). Applying  that  standard  to  the  discharge  of  water  from 
Lower  Slate  Lake  into  the  downstream  creek,  the  EPA's $ 402 permit sets strict limits on the amount of pollutants the 
water  may  contain.  The  permit  requires  Coeur  Alaska  to treat  the  water  using  "reverse  osmosis"  to  remove  alumi-
num, suspended solids, and other pollutants.  App. 298a; id.,

Opinion of the Court 
The  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  in  effect  reallocated the  division  of  responsibility  that  the  Corps  and  the  EPA 

had  been  following.  The  Court  granted  certiorari.  554 U. S. 931 (2008).  We now hold that the decision of the Court 
of Appeals was incorrect.  II 

The  question  of  which  agency  has  authority  to  consider whether  to  permit  the  slurry  discharge  is  our  beginning 
inquiry.  We  consider  first  the  authority  of  the  EPA  and second  the  authority  of  the  Corps.  Our  conclusion  is  that 
under the CWA the Corps had authority to determi ne 
whether Coeur Alaska was entitled to the permit governing this discharge. 

A 
Section 402 gives the EPA authority to issue "permit[s] for the  discharge  of  any  pollutant,"  with  one  important  excep-

tion:  The  EPA  may  not  issue  permits  for  fill  material  that 
fall  under  the  Corps'  $ 404  permitting  authority.  Section 
402(a) states:

applies,  so  that  the  discharger  requires  a  $ 402  permit  from the EPA. 

Under  SEACC's  interpretation,  however,  the  discharger would  face  a  more  difficult  problem.  The  discharger  would 
have  to  ask--is  the  fill  material  also  subject  to  one  of  the many  hundreds  of  EPA  performance  standards,  so  that  the 
permit must come from the EPA, not the Corps?  The stat-ute gives no indication that Congress intended to burden in-
dustry with that confusing division of permit authority. The  regulatory  scheme  discloses  a  defined,  and  workable, 
line  for determining  whether the  Corps or  the  EPA  has  the permit  authority.  Under  this  framework,  the  Corps  of  En-
gineers,  and  not  the  EPA,  has  authority  to  permit  Coeur Alaska's discharge of the slurry. 

III 
A  second  question  remains:  In  issuing  the  permit  did  the Corps  act  in  violation  of  a  statutory  mandate  so  that  the 

issuance  was  "not  in  accordance  with  law"?  5  U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A).  SEACC contends that the slurry discharge will 
violate the EPA's new source performance standard and that the  Corps'  permit  is  made  "unlawful"  by  CWA  $ 306(e). 
Petitioners and  the  agencies argue  that  the permit  is  lawful because  the  EPA  performance  standard  and  $ 306(e)  do  not 
apply  to  fill  material  regulated  by  the  Corps.  In  order  to determine  whether  the  Corps'  permit  is  lawful  we  must  an-
swer  the  question:  Do  EPA  performance  standards,  and $ 306(e), apply to discharges of fill material? 

We  address  in  turn  the  statutory  text  of  the  CWA,  the agencies'  regulations  construing  it,  and  the  EPA's  subse-
quent  interpretation  of  those  regulations.  Because  Con-gress  has  not  "directly  spoken"  to  the  "precise  question"  of 
whether an EPA performance standard applies to discharges of  fill  material,  the  statute  alone  does  not  resolve  the  case.

$ 307],  and  1343  [CWA  $ 403]  of  this  title."  33  U. S. C. $ 1344(p). 

Here  again,  their  argument  is  that  silence  is  significant. Section 404(p) protects the permittee from lawsuits alleging 
violations  of  CWA  $ 301  (which  bars  the  discharge  of  "any pollutant"  "[e]xcept  as  in  compliance"  with  the  Act);  $ 307 
(which  bars  the  discharge  of  "toxic  pollutants");  and  $ 403 (which  bars  discharges  into  the  sea).  But  $ 404(p)  does  not 
in  express  terms  protect  the  permittee  from  a  lawsuit  al-leging  a  violation  of  $ 306(e)  or  of  the  EPA's  new  source 
performance  standards.  Section  404(p)'s  silence  regarding $ 306 is made even more significant because a parallel provi-
sion in $ 402  does protect a $ 402  permittee from an enforce-
ment  action  alleging  a  violation  of  $ 306.  CWA  $ 402(k),  33 U. S. C. $ 1342(k). 

In our view, Congress' omission of $ 306 from $ 404, and its inclusion  of  $ 306  in  $ 402(k),  is  evidence  that  Congress  did 
not intend $ 306(e) to apply to Corps $ 404  permits or to dis-charges  of  fill  material.  If  $ 306  did  apply,  then  the  Corps 
would  be  required  to  evaluate  each  permit  application  for compliance with $ 306, and issue a permit only if it found the 
discharge would comply with $ 306.  But even if that finding were made,  it  is  not clear  that  the  $ 404  permittee  would be 
protected  from  a  suit  seeking  a  judicial  determination  that the discharge violates $ 306. 

3 
The CWA  is ambiguous on the question whether $ 306 ap-plies to discharges of fill material regulated under $ 404.  On 

the  one  hand,  $ 306  provides  that  a  discharge  that  violates an  EPA  new  source  performance  standard  is  "unlawful"-- 
without  any  exception  for  fill  material.  On  the  other  hand, 

$ 404  grants  the  Corps  blanket  authority  to  permit  the  dis-
charge  of  fill  material--without  any  mention  of  $ 306.  This 
tension indicates that  Congress has  not  "directly  spoken" to

Opinion of the Court 
Second,  the  Memorandum  acknowledges  that  this  is  not an  instance  in  which  the  discharger  attempts  to  evade  the 

requirements of the EPA's performance standard.  The Ken-sington  Mine  is  not,  for  example,  a  project  that  smuggles  a 
discharge  of  EPA-regulated  pollutants  into  a  separate  dis-charge  of  Corps-regulated  fill  material.  The  instant  cases 
do not present a  process or plan  designed to manipulate the 
outer  boundaries  of  the  definition  of  "fill  material"  by  label-ing  minute  quantities  of  EPA-regulated  solids  as  fill.  The 

Memorandum states that when a discharge has only an "inci-dental  filling  effect,"  the  EPA's  performance  standard  con-
tinues to govern that discharge.  Id.,

garding  the  definition  of  fill  material;  the  preamble  to  the agencies' current 2002 fill regulation; and comments made by 

the agencies in promulgating the 2002 fill regulation.  These arguments are not convincing. 

1 
In 1986, to reconcile their then-differing definitions of "fill material," the EPA and the Corps issued a "memorandum of 

agreement."  51 Fed. Reg. 8871 (MOA).  The memorandum was not made subject to notice-and-comment procedures, but 
it  was  published  in  the  Federal  Register.  It  defined  the statutory term "fill material" until the current definition took 
effect  in  2002.  Brief  for  Federal  Respondents  30-31,  n.  8. SEACC points to paragraph B(5) of the MOA, which reads: 

"[A]  pollutant  (other  than  dredged  material)  will  nor-mally be considered by EPA and the Corps to be subject 
to  section  402  if  it  is  a  discharge  in  liquid,  semi-liquid, or  suspended  form  or  if  it  is  a  discharge  of  solid  mate-
rial  of  a  homogeneous  nature  normally  associated  with single  industry  wastes  . . . .   These  materials  include 
placer  mining  wastes,  phosphate  mining  wastes,  tita-nium mining wastes, sand and gravel wastes, fly ash, and 
drilling muds.  As appropriate, EPA and the Corps will identify  additional  such  materials."  51 Fed.  Reg.  8872. 

It  is  true,  as  SEACC  notes,  that  this  passage  suggests  that $ 402  will  "normally"  apply  to  discharges  of  "suspended"--

corporated  into  permits  issued  under  section  402  of  the Act.  EPA  has  never  sought  to  regulate  fill  material 

under  effluent  guidelines.  Rather,  effluent  guidelines restrict  discharges  of  pollutants  from  identified  waste-
streams  based  upon  the  pollutant  reduction  capabilities of  available  treatment  technologies.  Recognizing  that 
some discharges (such as suspended or settleable solids) 
can  have  the  associated  effect,  over  time,  of  raising  the bottom  elevation  of  a  water  due  to  settling  of  water-

borne  pollutants,  we  do  not  consider  such  pollutants  to be `fill material,' and nothing in today's rule changes that 
view.  Nor  does  today's  rule  change  any  determination we  have  made  regarding  discharges  that  are  subject  to 
an  effluent  limitation  guideline  and  standards,  which will  continue  to  be  regulated  under  section  402  of  the 
CWA.  Similarly, this rule does not alter the manner in 
which water quality standards currently apply under the section 402 or the section 404 programs."

than those observed at the crime scene are exempt from confrontation. 
The absence of interrogation is irrelevant; a witness who volunteers his 
testimony  is  no  less  a  witness  for  Sixth  Amendment  purposes.  The 
affidavits do not qualify as traditional official or business records.  The 
argument  that  the  analysts  should  not  be  subject  to  confrontation  be-
cause their statements result from neutral scientific testing is little more 
than  an  invitation  to  return  to  the  since-overruled  decision  in  Ohio  v. 
Roberts, 448 U. S. 56, 66, which held that evidence with "particularized 
guarantees  of  trustworthiness"  was  admissible  without  confrontation. 
Petitioner's power to subpoena the analysts is no substitute for the right 
of confrontation.  Finally, the requirements of the Confrontation Clause 
may  not  be  relaxed  because  they  make  the  prosecution's  task  burden-
some.  In any event, the practice in many  States already  accords with 
today's decision, and the serious disruption predicted by respondent and 
the dissent has not materialized.  Pp. 312-328.

Opinion of the Court 
ity.  The  informant  reported  that  Wright  repeatedly  re-ceived  phone  calls  at  work,  after  each  of  which  he would  be 

picked  up  in  front  of  the  store  by  a  blue  sedan,  and  would return  to  the  store  a  short  time  later.  The  police  set  up 
surveillance in the Kmart parking lot and witnessed this pre-cise  sequence  of  events.  When  Wright  got  out  of  the  car 
upon  his  return,  one  of  the  officers  detained  and  searched 
him,  finding  four  clear  white  plastic  bags  containing  a  sub-stance  resembling  cocaine.  The  officer  then  signaled  other 

officers  on  the  scene  to  arrest  the  two  men  in  the  car--one of  whom  was  petitioner  Luis  Melendez-Diaz.  The  officers 
placed all three men in a police cruiser. 

During  the  short  drive  to  the  police  station,  the  officers 
observed  their  passengers  fidgeting  and  making  furtive 
movements in the back of the car.  After depositing the men 
at  the  station,  they  searched  the  police  cruiser  and  found  a 
plastic  bag  containing  19  smaller  plastic  bags  hidden  in  the 
partition between the front and back seats.  They submitted 
the  seized  evidence  to  a state  laboratory  required  by law  to 
conduct  chemical  analysis  upon  police  request.  Mass.  Gen. 
Laws, ch. 111, $ 12 (West 2006). 

Melendez-Diaz  was  charged  with  distributing  cocaine  and 
with  trafficking  in  cocaine  in  an  amount  between  14  and  28 
grams.  Ch.  94C,  $$ 32A,  32E(b)(1).  At  trial,  the  prosecu-
tion  placed  into  evidence  the  bags  seized  from  Wright  and 
from the police cruiser.  It also submitted three "certificates 
of analysis" showing the results of the forensic analysis per-
formed  on  the  seized  substances.  The  certificates  reported 
the  weight  of  the  seized  bags  and  stated  that  the  bags 
"[h]a[ve]  been  examined  with  the  following  results:  The 
substance  was  found  to  contain:  Cocaine."  App.  to  Pet.  for 
Cert. 24a, 26a, 28a.  The certificates were sworn to before a 
notary  public  by  analysts  at  the  State  Laboratory  Insti-
tute  of  the  Massachusetts  Department  of  Public  Health, 
as  required  under  Massachusetts  law.  Mass.  Gen.  Laws,

Opinion of the Court 
Petitioner objected to the admission of the certificates, as-serting  that  our  Confrontation  Clause  decision  in  Crawford 

v.  Washington,  541  U. S.  36  (2004),  required  the  analysts  to testify in person.  The objection was overruled, and the cer-
tificates were admitted pursuant to state law as "prima facie evidence  of  the  composition,  quality,  and  the  net  weight  of 
the  narcotic  .  .  .  analyzed."  Mass.  Gen.  Laws,  ch.  111,  $ 13. The  jury  found  Melendez-Diaz  guilty.  He  appealed,  con-
tending,  among  other  things,  that  admission  of  the  certifi-cates  violated  his  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  be  confronted 
with the witnesses against him.  The Appeals Court of Mas-sachusetts  rejected  the  claim,  affirmance  order,  69  Mass. 
App. 1114, 870 N. E. 2d 676, 2007 WL 2189152, *4, n. 3 (July 31,  2007),  relying  on  the  Massachusetts  Supreme  Judicial 
Court's  decision  in  Commonwealth  v.  Verde,  444  Mass.  279, 283-285,  827  N.  E.  2d  701,  705-706  (2005),  which  held  that 
the authors of certificates of forensic analysis are not subject to  confrontation  under  the  Sixth  Amendment.  The  Su-
preme  Judicial  Court  denied  review.  449  Mass.  1113,  874 N. E. 2d 407 (2007).  We  granted certiorari.  552 U. S. 1256

The  Sixth  Amendment  to  the  United  States  Constitution, made  applicable  to  the  States  via  the  Fourteenth  Amend-
ment,  Pointer  v.  Texas,  380  U. S.  400,  403  (1965),  provides that  "[i]n  all  criminal  prosecutions,  the  accused  shall  enjoy 
the  right  . . . to  be  confronted  with  the  witnesses  against him."  In  Crawford,  after  reviewing  the  Clause's  historical 
underpinnings, we held that it guarantees a defendant's right to  confront  those  "who  `bear  testimony' "  against  him.  541 
U. S.,  at  51.  A  witness's  testimony  against  a  defendant  is thus  inadmissible  unless  the  witness  appears  at  trial  or,  if 
the  witness  is  unavailable,  the  defendant  had  a  prior  oppor-tunity for cross-examination. 

Id., at 54. Our  opinion  described  the  class  of  testimonial  statements 

covered by the Confrontation Clause as follows:

Opinion of the Court 
"Various formulations of this core class of testimonial statements exist: ex parte in-court testimony or its func-

tional  equivalent--that  is,  material  such  as  affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defend-
ant  was  unable  to  cross-examine,  or  similar  pretrial statements  that  declarants  would  reasonably  expect  to 
be  used  prosecutorially;  extrajudicial  statements . . .  contained  in  formalized  testimonial  materials,  such  as 
affidavits,  depositions,  prior  testimony,  or  confessions; statements  that  were  made  under  circumstances  which 
would  lead  an  objective  witness  reasonably  to  believe that  the  statement would be  available for  use  at  a later 
trial."  Id., at 51-52 (internal quotation marks and cita-tions omitted). 

There  is  little  doubt  that  the  documents  at  issue  in  this case  fall  within  the  "core  class  of  testimonial  statements" 
thus  described.  Our  description  of  that  category  mentions affidavits  twice.  See  also

to  live,  in-court  testimony,  doing  "precisely  what  a  witness does  on  direct  examination."  Davis  v.  Washington,  547 

U. S. 813, 830 (2006) (emphasis deleted). Here, moreover, not only were the affidavits " `made under 
circumstances  which  would  lead  an  objective  witness  rea-sonably  to  believe  that  the  statement  would  be  available 
for  use  at  a  later  trial,' "  Crawford,  supra,  at  52,  but  under Massachusetts  law  the 

sole  purpose  of  the  affidavits  was  to provide "prima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and 

the net weight" of the analyzed substance, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.  111,  $ 13.  We  can  safely  assume  that  the  analysts  were 
aware  of  the  affidavits'  evidentiary  purpose,  since  that  pur-pose--as stated in the relevant state-law provision--was re-
printed  on  the  affidavits  themselves.  See  App.  to  Pet.  for Cert. 25a, 27a, 29a. 

In  short,  under  our  decision  in  Crawford  the  analysts'  af-fidavits  were  testimonial  statements,  and  the  analysts  were 
"witnesses"  for  purposes of the  Sixth Amendment.  Absent a  showing  that  the  analysts  were  unavailable  to  testify  at 
trial  and  that  petitioner  had  a  prior  opportunity  to  cross-examine  them,  petitioner  was  entitled  to  " `be  confronted 
with' " the analysts at trial.  Crawford, supra, at 54.1

III 
Respondent  and  the  dissent  advance  a  potpourri  of  ana-lytic  arguments  in  an  effort  to  avoid  this  rather  straight-

forward  application  of  our  holding  in  Crawford.  Before addressing them, however, we must assure the reader of the 
falsity  of  the  dissent's  opening  alarum  that  we  are  "sweep-[ing] away an accepted rule governing the admission of scien-
tific  evidence"  that  has  been  "established  for  at  least  90 years" and "extends across at least 35 States and six Federal 
Courts of Appeals."  Post, at 330. The vast majority of the state-court cases the dissent cites 
in support of this claim come not from the last 90 years, but from the last 30, and not surprisingly nearly all of them rely 
on  our  decision  in  Ohio  v.  Roberts,  448  U. S.  56  (1980),  or its  since-rejected  theory  that  unconfronted  testimony  was 
admissible  as  long  as  it  bore  indicia  of  reliability,  id.,  at  66. See 

post, at 357-358.2  As for the six Federal Courts of Ap-peals  cases  cited  by  the  dissent,  five  of  them  postdated  and 

expressly  relied  on  Roberts.  See  post,  at  349-350.  The sixth predated 

Roberts but relied entirely on the same erro-neous theory
.  See Kay v.  United States, 255 F. 2d 476, 480- 481  (CA4  1958)  (rejecting  Confrontation  Clause  challenge 

"where  there  is  reasonable  necessity  for  [the  evidence]  and where  . .  .  the  evidence  has  those  qualities  of reliability  and 
trustworthiness"). A  review  of  cases  that  predate  the  Roberts  era  yields  a 
mixed  picture.  As  the  dissent  notes,  three  State  Supreme Court decisions from  the early 20th century denied confron-
tation  with  respect  to  certificates  of  analysis  regarding  a 

2 The exception is a single pre-Roberts case that relied on longstanding 
Massachusetts  precedent.  See  Commonwealth  v.  Harvard,  356  Mass. 
452, 462, 253 N. E. 2d 346, 352 (1969).  Others are simply irrelevant, since 
they  involved  medical  reports  created  for  treatment  purposes,  which 
would  not  be  testimonial  under  our  decision  today.  See,  e. g.,  Baber  v. 
State,  775  So.  2d  258,  258-259  (Fla.  2000);  State  v.  Garlick,  313  Md.  209,

substance's  alcohol  content.  See  post,  at  349  (citing  cases from  Massachusetts,  Connecticut,  and  Virginia).  But  other 

state courts in the same era reached the opposite conclusion. See  Torres  v.  State,  113  Tex.  Crim.  1,  2-4,  18  S.  W.  2d  179, 
180  (1929);  Volrich  v.  State,  4  Ohio  L.  Abs.  253  (App.  1925) 
(per curiam).  At least  this much is entirely  clear: In faith-fully applying  Crawford to the  facts of this case, we  are not 

overruling  90  years  of  settled  jurisprudence.  It  is  the  dis-sent  that  seeks  to  overturn  precedent  by  resurrecting  Rob-
erts a mere five years after it was rejected in Crawford. We turn now to the various legal arguments raised by re-
spondent and the dissent.  A 

Respondent  first  argues  that  the  analysts  are  not  subject to  confrontation  because  they  are  not  "accusatory"  wit-
nesses,  in  that  they  do  not  directly  accuse  petitioner  of wrongdoing; rather, their testimony is inculpatory only when 
taken  together with  other evidence  linking petitioner  to the contraband.  See  Brief  for  Respondent  10.  This  finds  no 
support  in  the  text  of  the  Sixth  Amendment  or  in  our case law. 

The  Sixth  Amendment  guarantees  a  defendant  the  right "to  be  confronted  with  the  witnesses  against  him."  (Em-
phasis added.)  To the extent the analysts were witnesses (a question  resolved above), they  certainly provided  testimony 
against petitioner, proving one fact necessary for his convic-tion--that  the  substance  he  possessed  was  cocaine.  The 
contrast  between  the  text  of  the  Confrontation  Clause  and the text of the adjacent Compulsory Process Clause confirms 
this analysis.  While the Confrontation Clause guarantees a defendant  the  right  to  be  confronted  with  the  witnesses 
"against him," the Compulsory Process Clause guarantees a defendant  the  right  to  call  witnesses  "in  his  favor."  U. S. 
Const., Amdt.  6.  The text  of the  Amendment contemplates two  classes  of  witnesses--those  against  the  defendant  and 
those  in  his  favor.  The  prosecution  must  produce  the  for-

Opinion of the Court 
mer; 3  the  defendant  may  call  the  latter.  Contrary  to  re-
spondent's  assertion,  there  is  not  a  third  category  of  wit-
nesses,  helpful  to  the  prosecution,  but  somehow  immune 
from confrontation. 

It  is  often,  indeed  perhaps  usually,  the  case  that  an  ad-
verse witness's testimony, taken alone, will not suffice to con-
vict.  Yet respondent fails to cite a single case in which such 
testimony was admitted absent a defendant's  opportunity to 
cross-examine.4  Unsurprisingly, since such a holding would 
be  contrary  to  longstanding  case  law.  In  Kirby  v.  United 
States, 174 U. S. 47 (1899), the Court considered Kirby's con-
viction  for receiving stolen property, the  evidence for which 
consisted,  in  part,  of  the  records  of  conviction  of  three  indi-
viduals who were found guilty of stealing the relevant prop-
erty.  Id., at 53.  Though this evidence proved only that the 
property  was  stolen,  and  not  that  Kirby  received  it,  the 
Court  nevertheless  ruled  that  admission  of  the  records  vio-
lated  Kirby's  rights  under  the  Confrontation  Clause.  Id., 
at 55.  See also King v.  Turner, 1 Mood.  347, 168  Eng. Rep. 
1298 (1832) (confession by one defendant to having stolen cer-
tain goods could not be used as evidence against another de-
fendant accused of receiving the stolen property). 

3 The right to confrontation may, of course, be waived, including by fail-
ure to object to the offending evidence; and States may adopt procedural 
rules governing the exercise of such objections.  See infra, at 327. 

4 Respondent  cites  our  decision  in  Gray  v.  Maryland,  523  U. S.  185 

(1998).  That  case  did  indeed  distinguish  between  evidence  that  is  "in-
criminating  on  its  face"  and  evidence  that  "bec[omes]  incriminating  .  .  . 
only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial," id., at 191 (inter-
nal quotation marks omitted).  But it did so for the entirely different pur-
pose  of  determining  when  a  nontestifying  codefendant's  confession,  re-
dacted  to  remove  all  mention  of  the  defendant,  could  be  admitted  into 
evidence  with  instruction  for  the  jury  not  to  consider  the  confession  as 
evidence  against  the  nonconfessor.  The  very  premise  of  the  case  was 
that, without the limiting instruction even admission of a redacted confes-
sion containing evidence of the latter sort would have violated the defend-
ant's Sixth Amendment rights.  See id., at 190-191.

Opinion of the Court 

B 
Respondent and the dissent argue that the analysts should not be subject to confrontation because they are not "conven-

tional"  (or  "typical"  or  "ordinary")  witnesses  of  the  sort whose 

ex  parte  testimony  was  most  notoriously  used  at  the trial  of  Sir  Walter  Raleigh.  Post,  at  343-345;  Brief  for  Re-

spondent  28.  It  is  true,  as  the  Court  recognized  in  Craw-ford, that ex parte examinations of the sort used at Raleigh's 
trial  have  "long  been  thought  a  paradigmatic  confrontation violation."  541  U. S.,  at  52.  But  the  paradigmatic  case 
identifies the core of the right to confrontation, not its limits. The  right  to  confrontation  was  not  invented  in  response  to 
the  use  of  the  ex  parte  examinations  in  Raleigh's  Case,  2 How.  St.  Tr.  1  (1603).  That  use  provoked  such  an  outcry 
precisely  because  it  flouted  the  deeply  rooted  common-law tradition  "of  live  testimony  in  court  subject  to  adversarial 
testing."  Crawford,  supra,  at  43  (citing  3  W.  Blackstone, Commentaries  on  the  Laws  of  England  373-374  (1768)). 
See also Crawford, supra, at 43-47. In any case, the purported distinctions respondent and the 
dissent  identify  between  this  case  and  Sir  Walter  Raleigh's "conventional"  accusers  do  not  survive  scrutiny.  The  dis-
sent  first  contends  that  a  "conventional  witness  recalls events  observed  in  the  past,  while  an  analyst's  report 
contains  near-contemporaneous  observations  of  the  test." Post,  at  345.  It  is  doubtful  that  the  analyst's  reports 
in  this  case  could  be  characterized  as  reporting  "near-contemporaneous  observations";  the  affidavits  were  com-
pleted  almost  a  week  after  the  tests  were  performed.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 24a-29a (the  tests were performed on 
November 28, 2001, and the affidavits sworn on December 4, 2001).  But  regardless,  the  dissent  misunderstands  the  role 
that  "near-contemporaneity"  has  played  in  our  case  law. The  dissent  notes  that  that  factor  was  given  "substantial 
weight"  in  Davis,  post,  at  345,  but  in  fact  that  decision  dis-
proves  the  dissent's  position.  There  the  Court  considered

Opinion of the Court 
the  admissibility  of  statements  made  to  police  officers  re-sponding to a report of a domestic disturbance.  By the time 

officers arrived the assault had ended, but the victim's state-ments--written  and  oral--were  sufficiently  close  in  time  to 
the alleged assault that the trial court admitted her affidavit as a "present sense  impression."  547 U. S., at 820  (internal 
quotation marks omitted).  Though the witness's statements 
in Davis were "near-contemporaneous" to the events she re-ported, we nevertheless held that they could 

not be admitted 
absent  an  opportunity  to  confront  the  witness.  Id.,  at  830. A second reason the dissent contends that the analysts are 

not  "conventional  witnesses"  (and  thus  not  subject  to  con-
frontation) is that they "observe[d] neither the crime nor any 
human action related to it."  Post, at 345.  The dissent pro-
vides  no  authority  for  this  particular  limitation  of  the  type 
of witnesses  subject  to confrontation.  Nor  is  it  conceivable 
that  all  witnesses  who  fit  this  description  would  be  outside 
the  scope  of  the  Confrontation  Clause.  For  example,  is  a 
police  officer's  investigative  report  describing  the  crime 
scene  admissible  absent  an  opportunity  to  examine  the  offi-
cer?  The  dissent's  novel  exception  from  coverage  of  the 
Confrontation Clause would exempt all expert witnesses--a 
hardly "unconventional" class of witnesses. 

A  third  respect in which  the  dissent asserts that  the  ana-
lysts  are  not  "conventional"  witnesses  and  thus  not  subject 
to confrontation is that their statements were not provided in 
response to interrogation.  Post, at 345-346.  See also Brief 
for  Respondent  29.  As  we  have  explained,  "[t]he  Framers 
were no more willing to exempt from cross-examination vol-
unteered testimony or answers to open-ended questions than 
they  were  to  exempt  answers  to  detailed  interrogation." 
Davis, supra, at 822-823, n. 1.  Respondent and the dissent 
cite  no  authority,  and  we  are  aware  of  none,  holding  that  a 
person  who  volunteers  his  testimony is  any  less  a  " `witness 
against'  the  defendant,"  Brief  for  Respondent  26,  than  one 
who  is  responding  to  interrogation.  In  any  event,  the  ana-

lysts'  affidavits  in  this  case  were presented  in  response  to  a police  request.  See  Mass.  Gen.  Laws,  ch.  111,  $$ 12-13.  If 

an affidavit submitted in response to a police officer's request to "write down what happened" suffices to trigger the Sixth 
Amendment's  protection  (as  it  apparently  does,  see  Davis, 547 U. S., at 819-820;

Respondent  and  the  dissent  may  be  right  that  there  are other ways--and in some cases better ways--to challenge or 
verify  the  results  of  a  forensic  test.5  But  the  Constitution guarantees one way: confrontation.  We do not have license 
to suspend the Confrontation Clause when a preferable trial strategy is available. 

Nor is it evident that what respondent calls "neutral scien-tific  testing"  is  as  neutral  or  as  reliable  as  respondent  sug-
gests.  Forensic  evidence  is  not  uniquely  immune  from  the risk of manipulation.  According to a recent study conducted 
under  the  auspices  of  the  National  Academy  of  Sciences, "[t]he  majority  of  [laboratories  producing  forensic  evidence] 
are administered by law enforcement agencies, such as police departments,  where  the  laboratory  administrator  reports  to 
the  head  of  the  agency."  National  Research  Council  of  the National  Academies,  Strengthening  Forensic  Science  in  the 
United  States:  A  Path  Forward  183  (2009)  (hereinafter  Na-tional Academy Report).  And "[b]ecause forensic scientists 
often are driven in their work by a need to answer a particu-lar  question  related  to  the  issues  of  a  particular  case,  they 
sometimes  face  pressure  to  sacrifice  appropriate  methodol-ogy  for  the  sake  of  expediency."  Id.,  at  23-24.  A  forensic 
analyst responding to a request from a law enforcement offi-cial  may  feel  pressure--or  have  an  incentive--to  alter  the 
evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution. Confrontation  is  one  means  of  ensuring  accurate  forensic 
analysis.  While it is true, as the dissent notes, that an hon-est  analyst  will  not  alter  his  testimony  when  forced  to  con-
front  the  defendant,  post,  at  339,  the  same  cannot  be  said of the fraudulent analyst.  See Brief for National Innocence 

5 Though surely not always.  Some forensic analyses, such as autopsies 
and  breathalyzer  tests,  cannot  be  repeated,  and  the  specimens  used  for 
other analyses have often been lost or degraded.

Coy  v.  Iowa,  487  U. S.  1012, 1019  (1988).  And,  of  course,  the  prospect  of  confrontation 

will deter fraudulent analysis in the first place. Confrontation is designed to weed out not only the fraudu-
lent analyst, but the incompetent one as well.  Serious defi-ciencies  have  been  found  in  the  forensic  evidence  used  in 
criminal  trials.  One  commentator  asserts  that  "[t]he  legal community  now  concedes,  with  varying  degrees  of  urgency,

Opinion of the Court 
Like  expert  witnesses  generally,  an  analyst's  lack  of  proper training  or  deficiency  in  judgment  may  be  disclosed  in 

cross-examination. This  case  is  illustrative.  The  affidavits  submitted  by  the 
analysts contained only the bare-bones statement that "[t]he substance  was  found  to  contain:  Cocaine."  App.  to  Pet.  for 
Cert.  24a,  26a,  28a.  At  the  time  of  trial,  petitioner  did  not know what tests the analysts performed, whether those tests 
were  routine,  and  whether  interpreting  their  results  re-quired the exercise of judgment or the  use  of skills  that the 
analysts  may  not  have  possessed.  While  we  still  do  not know the precise tests used by the analysts, we are told that 
the laboratories use "methodology recommended by the Sci-entific  Working  Group  for  the  Analysis  of  Seized  Drugs," 
App.  to  Brief  for  Petitioner  1a-2a.  At  least  some  of  that methodology requires the exercise of judgment and presents 
a risk of error that might be explored on cross-examination. See  2  P.  Giannelli  &  E.  Imwinkelried,  Scientific  Evidence 

$ 23.03[c],  pp.  532-533,  and  ch.  23A,  p.  607  (4th  ed.  2007) (identifying  four  "critical  errors"  that  analysts  may  commit 
in interpreting the results of the commonly used gas chroma-tography/mass spectrometry analysis); Shellow, The Applica-

ing  that  while  spectrometers  may  be  equipped  with  compu-terized matching systems, "forensic analysts in crime labora-
tories  typically do  not utilize this feature of the  instrument, but rely exclusively on their subjective judgment"). 

The  same  is  true  of  many  of  the  other  types  of  forensic evidence commonly used in criminal prosecutions.  "[T]here 
is wide variability across forensic science disciplines with re-gard  to  techniques,  methodologies,  reliability,  types  and

empty formalism.

Contrary to respondent's and the dissent's suggestion, there is  little  reason  to  believe  that  confrontation  will  be  useless

Respondent argues that the analysts' affidavits are admis-sible  without  confrontation  because  they  are  "akin  to  the 
types  of  official  and  business  records  admissible  at  common law."  Brief  for  Respondent  35.  But  the  affidavits  do  not 
qualify as traditional official or business records, and even if they  did,  their  authors  would  be  subject  to  confrontation 
nonetheless. Documents kept in the regular course of business may or-
dinarily  be  admitted  at  trial  despite  their  hearsay  status. See  Fed.  Rule  Evid.  803(6).  But  that  is  not  the  case  if  the 
regularly conducted business activity is the production of ev-idence for use at trial.  Our decision in Palmer v.  Hoffman, 
318  U. S.  109  (1943),  made  that  distinction  clear.  There  we held  that  an  accident  report  provided  by  an  employee  of 
a  railroad  company  did  not  qualify  as  a  business  record because,  although  kept  in  the  regular  course  of  the  rail-
road's  operations,  it  was  "calculated  for  use  essentially  in the  court,  not  in  the  business."

administration  of  an  entity's  affairs,  and  not  for  use  in  litigation.  See,

Opinion of the Court 
certificates--like  police  reports  generated  by  law  enforce-
ment  officials--do  not  qualify  as  business  or  public  records 
for  precisely  the  same  reason.  See  Rule  803(8)  (defining 
public records as "excluding, however, in criminal cases mat-
ters  observed  by  police  officers  and  other  law  enforcement 
personnel"). 

Respondent  seeks  to  rebut  this  limitation  by  noting  that 
at common law the results of a coroner's inquest were admis-
sible  without  an  opportunity  for  confrontation.  But  as  we 
have  previously  noted,  whatever  the  status  of  coroner's  re-
ports  at  common  law  in  England,  they  were  not  accorded 
any special status in American practice.  See Crawford, 541 
U. S.,  at  47,  n.  2;  Giles v.  California, 554  U. S.  353,  399-400

Opinion of the Court 
wise  admissible  record,  but  could  not  do  what  the  analysts did  here: 

create  a  record  for  the  sole  purpose  of  providing 
evidence against a defendant.8 Far  more  probative  here  are  those  cases  in  which  the 

prosecution sought to admit into evidence a clerk's certificate attesting to the fact that the clerk had searched for a particu-
lar relevant record and failed to find it.  Like the testimony 
of the analysts in this case, the clerk's statement would serve as  substantive  evidence  against  the  defendant  whose  guilt 

depended  on  the  nonexistence  of  the  record  for  which  the clerk searched.  Although the clerk's certificate would qual-
ify as an official record under respondent's definition--it was prepared by a public officer in the  regular course of his  offi-
cial duties--and although the clerk was certainly not a "con-ventional  witness"  under  the  dissent's  approach,  the  clerk 
was  nonetheless  subject  to  confrontation.  See  People  v. 
Bromwich,  200  N. Y.  385,  388-389,  93  N.  E.  933,  934  (1911); 
People v.  Goodrode, 132 Mich. 542, 547, 94 N. W. 14, 16 (1903); 
Wigmore, supra, $ 1678.9 

8 The dissent's reliance on our decision in Dowdell v.  United States, 221 
U. S. 325 (1911), see post, at 348-349, is similarly misplaced.  As the opin-
ion  stated  in  Dowdell--and  as  this  Court  noted  in  Davis  v.  Washington, 
547  U. S.  813,  825  (2006)--the  judge  and  clerk  who  made  the  statements 
at issue in Dowdell were not witnesses for purposes of the Confrontation 
Clause because their statements concerned only the conduct of defendants' 
prior  trial,  not  any  facts  regarding  defendants'  guilt  or  innocence.  221 
U. S., at 330-331. 

9 An earlier line of 19th-century state-court cases also supports the no-

tion that forensic analysts' certificates were not admitted into evidence as 
public  or  business  records.  See  Commonwealth  v.  Waite,  93  Mass.  264, 
266 (1865); Shivers v.  Newton, 45 N. J. L. 469, 476 (Sup. Ct. 1883); State v. 
Campbell,  64  N.  H.  402,  403,  13  A.  585,  586  (1888).  In  all  three  cases, 
defendants--who  were  prosecuted  for  selling  adulterated  milk--objected 
to the admission of the state chemists' certificates of analysis.  In all three 
cases, the objection was defeated because the chemist testified live at trial. 
That  the prosecution  came  forward  with live witnesses  in all  three  cases 
suggests doubt as to the admissibility of the certificates without opportu-
nity for cross-examination.

324  MELENDEZ-DIAZ  v.  MASSACHUSETTS 

Opinion of the Court 
Respondent also misunderstands the relationship between the  business-and-official-records  hearsay  exceptions  and  the 

Confrontation  Clause.  As  we  stated  in  Crawford:  "Most  of the hearsay exceptions covered statements that by their na-
ture were not  testimonial--for example, business  records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy."  541 U. S., at 56. 
Business and public  records are  generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to 
the hearsay rules, but because--having been created for the administration  of  an  entity's  affairs  and  not  for  the  purpose 
of  establishing  or  proving  some  fact  at  trial--they  are  not testimonial.  Whether or not they qualify as business or of-
ficial  records,  the  analysts'  statements  here--prepared  spe-cifically for use at petitioner's trial--were testimony against 
petitioner,  and  the  analysts  were  subject  to  confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. 

E 
Respondent  asserts  that  we  should  find  no  Confrontation Clause violation in this case because petitioner had the abil-

ity  to  subpoena  the  analysts.  But  that  power--whether pursuant  to  state  law  or  the  Compulsory  Process  Clause-- 
is  no  substitute  for  the  right  of  confrontation.  Unlike  the Confrontation  Clause,  those  provisions  are  of  no  use  to  the 
defendant when the witness is unavailable or simply refuses to appear.  See, e. g., Davis, 547 U. S., at 820 ("[The witness] 
was subpoenaed, but she did not appear at . . . trial").  Con-verting  the  prosecution's  duty  under  the  Confrontation 
Clause  into  the  defendant's  privilege  under  state  law  or the  Compulsory  Process  Clause  shifts  the  consequences  of 
adverse-witness  no-shows  from  the  State  to  the  accused. More  fundamentally,  the  Confrontation  Clause  imposes  a 
burden  on  the  prosecution  to  present  its  witnesses,  not  on the  defendant  to  bring  those  adverse  witnesses  into  court. 
Its  value  to  the  defendant  is  not  replaced  by  a  system  in which  the  prosecution  presents  its  evidence  via 

ex  parte  af-

fidavits and waits for the defendant to subpoena the affiants 
if he chooses. 

F 

Finally,  respondent  asks  us  to  relax  the  requirements  of 
the  Confrontation  Clause  to  accommodate  the  " `necessities 
of  trial  and  the  adversary  process.' "  Brief  for  Respondent 
59.  It is not clear whence we would derive the authority to 
do so.  The Confrontation Clause may make the prosecution 
of criminals more burdensome, but that is equally true of the 
right  to  trial  by  jury  and  the  privilege  against  self-
incrimination.  The  Confrontation  Clause--like  those  other 
constitutional provisions--is  binding, and  we  may  not  disre-
gard it at our convenience. 

We  also  doubt  the  accuracy  of  respondent's  and  the  dis-
sent's  dire  predictions.  The  dissent,  respondent,  and  its 
amici  highlight  the  substantial  total  number  of  controlled-
substance  analyses  performed  by  state  and  federal  labora-
tories in recent years.  But only some of those tests are im-
plicated  in  prosecutions,  and  only  a  small  fraction  of  those 
cases  actually  proceed  to  trial.  See  Brief  for  Law  Profes-
sors as Amici Curiae 7-8 (nearly 95% of convictions in state 
and federal courts are obtained via guilty plea).10 

Perhaps the best indication that the sky will not fall after 
today's  decision  is  that  it  has  not  done  so  already.  Many 
States  have  already  adopted  the  constitutional  rule  we  an-

10 The dissent provides some back-of-the-envelope calculations regarding 
the  number  of  court  appearances  that  will  result  from  today's  ruling. 
Post,  at  342.  Those  numbers  rely  on  various  unfounded  assumptions: 
that the prosecution will place into evidence a drug analysis certificate in 
every  case;  that  the  defendant  will  never  stipulate  to  the  nature  of  the 
controlled  substance;  that  even  where  no  such  stipulation  is  made,  every 
defendant will object to the evidence or otherwise demand the appearance 
of  the  analyst.  These  assumptions  are  wildly  unrealistic,  and,  as  dis-
cussed  below,  the  figures  they  produce  do  not  reflect  what  has  in  fact 
occurred in those jurisdictions that have already adopted the rule we an-
nounce today.

Opinion of the Court 
nounce  today,11  while  many  others  permit  the  defendant  to assert  (or  forfeit  by  silence)  his  Confrontation  Clause  right 

after  receiving  notice  of  the  prosecution's  intent  to  use  a forensic  analyst's report,  id., at  13-15 (cataloging  such  state 
laws).  Despite  these  widespread  practices,  there  is  no  evi-dence  that  the  criminal  justice  system  has  ground  to  a  halt 
in the States that, one way or another, empower a defendant to  insist  upon  the  analyst's  appearance  at  trial.  Indeed,  in 
Massachusetts  itself,  a  defendant  may  subpoena  the  analyst to appear at trial, see Brief for Respondent 57, and yet there 
is  no  indication  that  obstructionist  defendants  are  abusing the privilege. 

The  dissent  finds  this  evidence  "far  less  reassuring  than promised." 

Post, at 356.  But its doubts rest on two flawed premises.  First,  the  dissent  believes  that  those  state  stat-

utes  "requiring  the  defendant  to  give  early  notice  of  his  in-tent  to  confront  the  analyst"  are  "burden-shifting  statutes 
[that]  may  be  invalidated  by  the  Court's  reasoning."  Post, at  350, 356.  That  is not  so.  In  their  simplest form,  notice-
and-demand  statutes  require  the  prosecution  to  provide  no-tice  to  the  defendant  of  its  intent  to  use  an  analyst's  report 
as  evidence  at  trial,  after  which  the  defendant  is  given  a period  of  time  in  which  he  may  object  to  the  admission  of 
the  evidence  absent  the  analyst's  appearance  live  at  trial. See, 

e. g., Ga. Code Ann. $ 35-3-154.1 (2006); Tex. Code Crim. Proc.  Ann.,  Art.  38.41,  $ 4  (Vernon  2005);  Ohio  Rev.  Code

perception,  these  statutes  shift  no  burden  whatever.  The defendant  always  has  the  burden  of  raising  his  Confronta-

tion  Clause  objection;  notice-and-demand  statutes  simply govern  the  time  within  which  he  must  do  so.  States  are 
free  to  adopt  procedural  rules  governing  objections.  See 
Wainwright  v.  Sykes,  433  U. S.  72,  86-87  (1977).  It  is  com-mon  to  require  a  defendant  to  exercise  his  rights  under  the 

Compulsory  Process  Clause  in  advance  of  trial,  announcing his  intent  to  present  certain  witnesses.  See  Fed.  Rules 
Crim.  Proc.  12.1(a),  (e),  16(b)(1)(C);  Comment,  Alibi  Notice Rules: The Preclusion Sanction as Procedural Default, 51 U. 
Chi. L. Rev. 254, 254-255, 281-285 (1984) (discussing and cat-aloging  state  notice-of-alibi  rules); 

Taylor  v.  Illinois,  484 U. S. 400, 411 (1988); Williams v.  Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 81-82 

(1970).  There  is  no conceivable reason  why he  cannot simi-larly  be  compelled  to  exercise  his  Confrontation  Clause 
rights  before  trial.  See  Hinojos-Mendoza  v.  People,  169  P. 3d 662, 670 (Colo. 2007) (discussing and approving Colorado's 
notice-and-demand provision).  Today's decision will not dis-rupt  criminal  prosecutions  in  the  many  large  States  whose 
practice is already in accord with the Confrontation Clause.12 Second,  the  dissent  notes  that  several  of  the  state-court 
cases that have already adopted this rule did so pursuant to our  decision  in  Crawford,  and  not  "independently . . .  as  a  
matter of state law."  Post, at 356.  That may be so.  But in 

12 As  the  dissent  notes,  post,  at  355,  some  state  statutes  "requir[e]  de-
fense counsel to subpoena the analyst, to show good cause for demanding 
the  analyst's  presence,  or  even  to  affirm  under  oath  an  intent  to  cross-
examine the analyst."  We have no occasion today to pass on the constitu-
tionality  of  every  variety  of  statute  commonly  given  the  notice-and-
demand  label.  It  suffices  to  say  that  what  we  have  referred  to  as  the 
"simplest form [of] notice-and-demand statutes," supra, at 326, is constitu-
tional;  that  such  provisions  are  in  place  in  a  number  of  States;  and  that 
in  those  States,  and  in  other  States  that  require  confrontation  without 
notice-and-demand, there is no indication that the dire consequences pre-
dicted by the dissent have materialized.

Opinion of the Court 
assessing  the  likely  practical  effects  of  today's  ruling,  it  is irrelevant 

why those courts adopted this rule; it matters only 
that they did so.  It is true that many of these decisions are recent,  but  if  the  dissent's  dire  predictions  were  accurate, 

and given the large number of drug prosecutions at the state level,  one  would  have  expected  immediate  and  dramatic  re-
sults.  The absence of such evidence is telling. But  it  is  not  surprising.  Defense  attorneys  and  their  cli-
ents will often stipulate to the nature of the substance in the 
ordinary  drug  case.  It  is  unlikely  that  defense  counsel  will insist on live  testimony whose effect will be merely to high-

light rather than cast doubt upon the forensic analysis.  Nor will  defense attorneys  want  to antagonize  the  judge or  jury 
by  wasting  their  time  with  the  appearance  of  a  witness whose testimony defense counsel does not intend to rebut in 
any  fashion.13  The  amicus  brief  filed  by  district  attorneys in  support  of  the  Commonwealth  in  the  Massachusetts  Su-
preme Judicial Court case upon which the Appeals Court here 
relied  said  that  "it  is  almost  always  the  case  that  [analysts' 
certificates]  are  admitted  without  objection.  Generally,  de-
fendants  do  not  object  to  the  admission  of  drug  certificates 
most  likely  because  there  is  no  benefit  to  a  defendant  from 
such testimony."  Brief for District Attorneys in Support of 
the  Commonwealth  in  No.  SJC-09320  (Mass.),  p.  7  (footnote 
omitted).  Given these strategic  considerations, and in light 
of  the  experience  in  those  States  that  already  provide  the 
same or similar protections to defendants, there is little rea-
son to believe that our decision today will commence the pa-
rade of horribles respondent and the dissent predict. 

13 Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 352-353, we do not cast 
aspersions on trial judges, who we trust will not be antagonized by good-
faith requests for analysts' appearance at trial.  Nor do we expect defense 
attorneys to refrain from zealous representation of their clients.  We sim-
ply do not expect defense attorneys to believe that their clients' interests 
(or their own) are furthered by objections to analysts' reports whose con-
clusions counsel have no intention of challenging.

(a)  For  school  searches,  "the  public  interest  is  best  served  by  a 
Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that stops short of prob-
able cause."  T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 341.  Under the resulting reasonable 
suspicion  standard,  a  school  search  "will  be  permissible . . .  when  the 
measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the search 
and not excessively intrusive in light of the age and sex of the student 
and the nature of the infraction."  Id., at 342.  The required knowledge 
component of reasonable suspicion for a school administrator's evidence 
search is that it raise a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdo-
ing.  Pp. 370-371. 

(b)  Wilson  had  sufficient  suspicion  to  justify  searching  Savana's 
backpack  and  outer  clothing.  A  week  earlier,  a  student,  Jordan,  had 
told  the  principal  and  Wilson  that  students  were  bringing  drugs  and 
weapons to school and that he had gotten sick from some pills.  On the 
day  of  the  search,  Jordan  gave  Wilson  a  pill  that  he  said  came  from 
Marissa.  Learning  that  the  pill  was  prescription  strength,  Wilson 
called  Marissa  out  of  class  and  was  handed  the  day  planner.  Once  in 
his office, Wilson, with Romero present, had Marissa turn out her pock-
ets  and open  her  wallet,  producing,  inter alia,  an over-the-counter  pill 
that Marissa claimed was Savana's.  She also denied knowing about the 
day planner's  contents.  Wilson did  not ask her when  she received the 
pills  from  Savana  or  where  Savana  might  be  hiding  them.  After  a 
search  of  Marissa's  underwear  by  Romero  and  Schwallier  revealed  no 
additional  pills,  Wilson  called  Savana  into  his  office.  He  showed  her 
the day planner and confirmed her relationship with Marissa.  He knew 
that  the  girls  had  been  identified  as  part  of  an  unusually  rowdy  group 
at  a  school  dance,  during  which  alcohol  and  cigarettes  were  found  in 
the  girls'  bathroom.  He  had  other  reasons  to  connect  them  with  this 
contraband, for  Jordan  had told  the principal  that before  the  dance, he 
had  attended  a  party  at  Savana's  house  where  alcohol  was  served. 
Thus,  Marissa's  statement  that  the  pills  came  from  Savana  was  suf-
ficiently plausible to warrant suspicion that Savana was involved in pill 
distribution.  A student who is reasonably suspected of giving out con-
traband  pills  is  reasonably  suspected  of  carrying  them  on  her  person 
and  in  her  backpack.  Looking  into  Savana's  bag,  in  her  presence  and 
in  the relative privacy of  Wilson's office, was not excessively intrusive, 
any  more  than  Romero's  subsequent  search  of  her  outer  clothing. 
Pp. 371-374. 

(c)  Because the suspected facts pointing to Savana did not indicate 
that the drugs presented a danger to students or were concealed in her 
underwear, Wilson did not have  sufficient suspicion to warrant extend-
ing  the  search  to  the  point  of  making  Savana  pull  out  her  underwear.

Syllabus 
Romero and Schwallier said that they did not see anything when Savana 
pulled out her underwear, but a strip search and its Fourth Amendment 
consequences  are  not  defined  by  who  was  looking  and  how  much  was 
seen.  Savana's  actions  in  their  presence  necessarily  exposed  her 
breasts and pelvic area to some degree, and both subjective and reason-
able societal expectations of personal  privacy support the treatment of 
such  a  search  as  categorically  distinct,  requiring  distinct  elements  of 
justification on the part of school authorities for going beyond a search 
of  outer  clothing  and  belongings.  Savana's  subjective  expectation  of 
privacy is inherent in her account of it as embarrassing, frightening, and 
humiliating.  The reasonableness of her expectation is indicated by the 
common  reaction of  other young  people  similarly  searched, whose  ado-
lescent  vulnerability  intensifies  the  exposure's  patent  intrusiveness. 
Its indignity  does not  outlaw the  search,  but it  does  implicate  the rule 
that  "the  search  [be]  `reasonably  related  in  scope  to  the  circumstances 
which justified  the interference  in  the first  place.' "  T. L. O.,  supra,  at 
341.  Here,  the  content  of  the  suspicion  failed  to  match  the  degree  of 
intrusion.  Because  Wilson  knew  that  the  pills  were  common  pain  re-
lievers, he must have known of their nature and limited threat and had 
no  reason  to  suspect  that  large  amounts  were  being  passed  around  or 
that  individual  students  had  great  quantities.  Nor  could  he  have  sus-
pected  that  Savana  was  hiding  common  painkillers  in  her  underwear. 
When suspected facts must support the categorically extreme intrusive-
ness of a search down to an adolescent's body, petitioners' general belief 
that students hide contraband in their clothing falls short; a reasonable 
search  that extensive  calls for  suspicion  that  it will succeed.  Nondan-
gerous school contraband does  not conjure  up the  specter of stashes in 
intimate places, and there is no evidence of such behavior at the school; 
neither  Jordan nor Marissa suggested  that Savana was doing that,  and 
the  search  of  Marissa  yielded  nothing.  Wilson  also  never  determined 
when Marissa had received the pills from Savana; had it been a few days 
before, that would weigh heavily against any reasonable conclusion that 
Savana  presently  had  the  pills  on  her  person,  much  less  in  her  under-
wear.  Pp. 374-377. 

2.  Although  the  strip  search  violated  Savana's  Fourth  Amendment 
rights,  petitioners  Wilson,  Romero,  and  Schwallier  are  protected  from 
liability by qualified immunity because "clearly established law [did] not 
show that the search violated the Fourth Amendment," Pearson v.  Cal-
lahan,  555  U. S.  223,  243-244.  The  intrusiveness  of  the  strip  search 
here cannot, under T. L. O., be seen as justifiably related to the circum-
stances, but lower court cases viewing school strip searches differently 
are numerous enough, with well-reasoned majority and dissenting opin-

Opinion of the Court 
At  that  point,  Wilson  instructed  Romero  to  take  Savana to  the  school  nurse's  office  to  search  her  clothes  for  pills. 

Romero  and  the  nurse,  Peggy  Schwallier,  asked  Savana  to remove  her  jacket,  socks,  and  shoes,  leaving  her  in  stretch 
pants  and  a  T-shirt  (both  without  pockets),  which  she  was then asked  to remove.  Finally, Savana  was told to pull her 
bra out and to the side and shake it, and to pull out the elastic 
on her underpants, thus exposing her breasts and pelvic area to some degree.  No pills were found. 

Savana's  mother  filed  suit  against  Safford  Unified  School District #1, Wilson, Romero, and Schwallier for conducting a 
strip  search  in  violation  of  Savana's  Fourth  Amendment 
rights.  The  individuals  (hereinafter  petitioners)  moved  for 
summary  judgment,  raising  a  defense  of  qualified  immunity. 
The  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Arizona  granted  the 
motion on the ground that there was no Fourth Amendment 
violation,  and  a  panel  of  the  Ninth  Circuit  affirmed.  504 
F. 3d 828 (2007). 

A  closely  divided  Circuit  sitting  en  banc,  however,  re-
versed.  Following the two-step protocol for evaluating 
claims  of  qualified  immunity,  see  Saucier  v.  Katz,  533  U. S. 
194,  200  (2001),  the  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  the  strip  search 
was unjustified under the Fourth Amendment test for 
searches of children by school officials set out in New Jersey 
v.  T.  L. O.,  469  U. S.  325  (1985).  531  F.  3d  1071,  1081-1087 
(2008).  The Circuit then applied the test for qualified immu-
nity, and found that Savana's right was clearly established at 
the  time  of  the  search:  " `[t]hese  notions  of  personal  privacy 
are "clearly established" in that they inhere in all of us, par-
ticularly  middle  school  teenagers,  and  are  inherent  in  the 
privacy  component  of  the  Fourth  Amendment's  proscription 
against unreasonable searches.' "  Id., at 1088-1089 (quoting 
Brannum  v.  Overton  Cty.  School  Bd.,  516  F.  3d  489,  499 
(CA6  2008)).  The  upshot  was  reversal  of  summary  judg-
ment as to Wilson, while affirming the judgments in favor of 
Schwallier, the school nurse, and Romero, the administrative

The  Fourth  Amendment  "right  of  the  people  to  be  secure in  their  persons  .  .  .  against  unreasonable  searches  and  sei-

zures"  generally  requires  a  law  enforcement  officer  to  have probable cause for conducting a search.  "Probable cause ex-
ists  where  `the  facts  and  circumstances  within  [an  officer's] knowledge and of which [he] had reasonably trustworthy in-
formation  [are]  sufficient  in  themselves  to  warrant  a  man  of reasonable  caution  in  the  belief  that'  an  offense  has  been  or 
is being committed," Brinegar v.  United States, 338 U. S. 160, 175-176  (1949)  (quoting 

Carroll  v.  United  States,  267  U. S. 132,  162  (1925)),  and  that  evidence  bearing  on  that  offense 

will be found in the place to be searched. In T. L. O., we recognized that the school setting "requires 
some  modification  of  the  level  of  suspicion  of  illicit  activity needed  to  justify  a  search,"  469  U. S.,  at  340,  and  held  that 
for searches by school officials "a careful balancing of govern-mental  and  private  interests  suggests  that  the  public  in-
terest  is  best  served  by  a  Fourth  Amendment  standard  of reasonableness  that  stops  short  of  probable  cause," 

id.,  at 341.  We  have  thus  applied  a  standard  of  reasonable  suspi-

cion  to  determine  the  legality  of  a  school  administrator's search  of  a  student,  id.,  at  342,  345,  and  have  held  that  a 
school  search  "will  be  permissible  in  its  scope  when  the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of 
the  search  and  not  excessively  intrusive  in  light  of  the  age and  sex  of  the  student  and  the  nature  of  the  infraction," 
id., at 342. A  number  of our cases on  probable cause have  an implicit 
bearing on the reliable knowledge element of reasonable sus-picion, as we have attempted to flesh out the knowledge com-

ponent by looking to the degree to which known facts imply prohibited  conduct,  see,  e. g.,  Adams  v.  Williams,  407  U. S. 

143, 148  (1972); id., at  160, n. 9 (Marshall, J.,  dissenting), the specificity  of  the  information  received,  see,  e. g.,  Spinelli  v. 
United States, 393 U. S. 410, 416-417 (1969), and the reliabil-ity  of  its  source,  see, 

e. g.,  Aguilar  v.  Texas,  378  U. S.  108, 114 (1964).  At the end of the day, however, we have realized 

that  these  factors  cannot  rigidly  control,  Illinois  v.  Gates, 462  U. S.  213,  230  (1983),  and  we  have  come  back  to  saying 
that  the  standards  are  "fluid  concepts  that  take  their  sub-stantive content from the particular contexts" in which they 
are  being  assessed,  Ornelas  v.  United  States,  517  U. S.  690, 696 (1996). 

Perhaps  the  best  that  can  be  said  generally  about  the  re-quired knowledge component of probable cause for a law en-
forcement  officer's  evidence  search  is  that  it  raise  a  "fair probability,"  Gates,  462  U. S.,  at  238,  or  a  "substantial 
chance," id., at 244, n. 13, of discovering evidence of criminal activity.  The  lesser  standard  for  school  searches  could  as 
readily be described as a moderate chance of finding evidence of wrongdoing.

In this case,  the  school's policies strictly  prohibit the non-medical  use,  possession,  or  sale  of  any  drug  on  school 

grounds,  including  " `[a]ny  prescription  or  over-the-counter drug, except those for which permission to use in school has 
been  granted  pursuant  to  Board  policy.' "  App.  to  Pet.  for Cert.  128a.

a  valid  search  assumes,  of  course,  the  rule's  legitimacy.  But  the  legiti-
macy of the rule usually goes without saying as it does here.  The Court 
said  plainly  in  New  Jersey  v.  T.  L. O.,  469  U. S.  325,  342,  n.  9  (1985),  that 
standards of conduct for schools are for school administrators to determine 
without  second-guessing  by  courts  lacking  the  experience  to  appreciate 
what  may  be  needed.  Except  in  patently  arbitrary  instances,  Fourth

student,  Jordan  Romero  (no  relation  of the  school's  adminis-
trative  assistant),  told  the  principal  and  Assistant  Principal 
Wilson  that  "certain  students  were  bringing  drugs  and 
weapons on campus," and that he had been sick after taking 
some pills that "he got from a classmate."  App. 8a.  On the 
morning  of  October  8,  the  same  boy  handed  Wilson  a  white 
pill that he said Marissa Glines had given him.  He told Wil-
son  that  students  were  planning  to  take  the  pills  at  lunch. 

Wilson  learned  from  Peggy  Schwallier,  the  school  nurse, 
that  the  pill  was  ibuprofen  400  mg,  available  only  by  pre-
scription.  Wilson then called Marissa out of class.  Outside 
the classroom, Marissa's teacher handed Wilson the day plan-
ner, found within Marissa's reach, containing various contra-
band items.  Wilson escorted Marissa back to his office. 

In  the  presence  of  Helen  Romero,  Wilson  requested  Ma-
rissa  to  turn  out  her  pockets  and open  her  wallet.  Marissa 
produced  a  blue  pill,  several  white  ones,  and  a  razor  blade. 
Wilson  asked  where  the  blue  pill  came  from,  and  Marissa 
answered, " `I guess it slipped in when she gave me the IBU 
400s.' "  Id.,  at  13a.  When  Wilson  asked  whom  she  meant, 
Marissa  replied,  " `Savana  Redding.' "  Ibid.  Wilson  then 
enquired about the day planner and its contents; Marissa de-
nied  knowing  anything  about  them.  Wilson  did  not  ask 
Marissa  any  followup  questions  to  determine  whether  there 
was  any  likelihood  that  Savana  presently  had  pills:  neither 
asking  when  Marissa  received  the  pills  from  Savana  nor 
where Savana might be hiding them. 

Amendment  analysis  takes  the  rule  as  a  given,  as  it  obviously  should  do 
in  this  case.  There  is  no  need  here  either  to  explain  the  imperative  of 
keeping drugs out of schools, or to explain the reasons for the school's rule 
banning  all  drugs,  no  matter  how  benign,  without  advance  permission. 
Teachers  are  not  pharmacologists  trained  to  identify  pills  and  powders, 
and  an  effective  drug  ban  has  to  be  enforceable  fast.  The  plenary  ban 
makes sense, and there is no basis to claim that the search was unreason-
able  owing  to  some  defect  or  shortcoming  of  the  rule  it  was  aimed  at 
enforcing.

Opinion of the Court 
Schwallier did not immediately recognize the blue pill, but information  provided  through  a  poison  control  hotline 

2  indi-

cated that the pill was a 200-mg dose of an antiinflammatory drug, generically called naproxen, available over the counter. 

At Wilson's direction, Marissa was then subjected to a search of her bra and underpants by Romero and Schwallier, as Sa-
vana  was  later  on.  The  search  revealed  no  additional  pills. It  was  at  this  juncture  that  Wilson  called  Savana  into  his 
office  and  showed  her  the  day  planner.  Their  conversation established that Savana and Marissa were on friendly terms: 
while  she  denied  knowledge  of  the  contraband,  Savana  ad-mitted  that  the  day  planner  was  hers  and  that  she  had  lent 
it  to  Marissa.  Wilson  had  other  reports  of  their  friendship from staff  members,  who had  identified Savana  and Marissa 
as  part  of  an  unusually  rowdy  group  at  the  school's  opening 
dance  in  August,  during  which  alcohol  and  cigarettes  were 
found in the  girls' bathroom.  Wilson had  reason to connect the  girls  with  this  contraband,  for  Wilson  knew  that  Jordan 

Romero had  told the principal that  before the dance, he had been at a party at Savana's house where alcohol was served. 
Marissa's  statement  that  the  pills  came  from  Savana  was thus  sufficiently  plausible  to  warrant  suspicion  that  Savana 
was involved in pill distribution. This  suspicion  of  Wilson's  was  enough  to  justify  a  search 
of  Savana's  backpack  and  outer  clothing.3  If  a  student  is

3 There  is  no  question  here  that  justification  for  the  school  officials' 

search was required in accordance with the T.  L. O.  standard of reasonable 
suspicion, for it is common ground that Savana had a reasonable expecta-
tion  of  privacy  covering  the  personal  things  she  chose  to  carry  in  her 
backpack,  cf.  469 U. S.,  at  339,  and that  Wilson's  decision  to look  through 
it was a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

Opinion of the Court 
reasonably  suspected  of  giving  out  contraband  pills,  she  is reasonably suspected of carrying them on her  person and in 

the  carryall  that  has  become  an  item  of  student  uniform  in most  places  today.  If  Wilson's  reasonable  suspicion  of  pill 
distribution  were  not  understood  to  support  searches  of outer  clothes  and  backpack,  it  would  not  justify  any  search 
worth making.  And the look into Savana's bag, in her pres-ence  and  in  the  relative  privacy  of  Wilson's  office,  was  not 
excessively  intrusive,  any  more  than  Romero's  subsequent search of her outer clothing. 

B 
Here  it  is  that  the  parties  part  company,  with  Savana's claim  that  extending  the  search  at  Wilson's  behest  to  the 

point of making her pull out her underwear was constitution-ally  unreasonable.  The exact  label  for  this  final  step  in  the 
intrusion  is  not  important,  though strip  search  is  a fair  way to  speak  of  it.  Romero  and  Schwallier  directed  Savana  to 
remove  her  clothes  down  to  her  underwear,  and  then  "pull out" her bra and the elastic band on her underpants. 

Id., at 23a.  Although Romero  and Schwallier  stated  that  they  did 

not  see  anything  when  Savana  followed  their  instructions, App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a, we would not define strip search 
and  its  Fourth  Amendment  consequences  in  a  way  that would  guarantee  litigation  about  who  was  looking  and  how 
much  was  seen.  The  very  fact  of  Savana's  pulling  her  un-derwear away from her body in the presence of the two offi-
cials  who  were  able  to  see  her  necessarily  exposed  her breasts  and pelvic  area to  some degree,  and both  subjective 
and reasonable societal expectations of personal privacy sup-port the treatment of such a search as categorically distinct, 
requiring  distinct  elements  of  justification  on  the  part  of school authorities for going beyond a search of outer clothing 
and belongings. Savana's  subjective  expectation  of  privacy  against  such  a 
search  is  inherent  in  her  account  of  it  as  embarrassing,

ing  the  body  from  the  experience  of  nakedness  or  near  un-
dress  in  other  school  circumstances.  Changing  for  gym  is 
getting ready for play; exposing for a search is responding to 
an  accusation  reserved  for  suspected  wrongdoers  and  fairly 
understood  as  so  degrading  that  a  number  of  communities 
have decided that strip searches in schools are never reason-
able  and  have  banned  them  no  matter  what  the  facts  may 
be,  see,  e. g.,  New  York  City  Dept.  of  Education,  Reg. 
No. A-432, p. 2 (2005), online at http://docs.nycenet.edu/docu 
share/dsweb/Get/Document-21/A-432.pdf ("Under no  circum-
stances shall a strip-search of a student be conducted"). 

The  indignity  of  the  search  does  not,  of  course,  outlaw  it, 
but  it  does  implicate  the  rule  of  reasonableness  as  stated  in 
T.  L. O.,  that  "the  search  as  actually  conducted  [be]  reason-
ably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the 
interference  in  the  first  place."  469  U. S.,  at  341  (internal 
quotation  marks  omitted).  The  scope  will  be  permissible, 
that  is,  when  it  is  "not  excessively  intrusive  in  light  of  the 
age and sex of the student and the nature of the infraction." 
Id., at 342. 

Here,  the  content  of  the  suspicion  failed  to  match  the  de-
gree  of  intrusion.  Wilson  knew  beforehand  that  the  pills 
were  prescription-strength  ibuprofen  and  over-the-counter 
naproxen, common pain relievers equivalent to two Advil, or

one  Aleve.4  He  must  have  been  aware  of  the  nature  and 
limited threat of the specific drugs he was searching for, and 
while just about anything can be taken in quantities that will 
do  real  harm,  Wilson  had  no  reason  to  suspect  that  large 
amounts of the drugs were being passed around, or that indi-
vidual students were receiving great numbers of pills. 

Nor  could  Wilson  have  suspected  that  Savana  was  hiding 
common  painkillers  in  her  underwear.  Petitioners  suggest, 
as a truth universally acknowledged, that "students . . . hid[e] 
contraband in or under their clothing," Reply Brief for Peti-
tioners  8,  and  cite  a  smattering  of  cases  of  students  with 
contraband  in  their  underwear,  id.,  at  8-9.  But  when  the 
categorically  extreme  intrusiveness  of  a  search  down  to  the 
body  of  an  adolescent  requires  some  justification  in  sus-
pected  facts,  general  background  possibilities  fall  short;  a 
reasonable  search  that  extensive  calls  for  suspicion  that  it 
will  pay  off.  But  nondangerous  school  contraband  does  not 
raise the specter of stashes in intimate places, and there is no 
evidence in the record of any general practice among Safford 
Middle School students of hiding that sort of thing in under-
wear;  neither  Jordan  nor  Marissa  suggested  to  Wilson  that 
Savana was doing that, and the  preceding search of Marissa 
that Wilson ordered yielded nothing.  Wilson never even de-
termined  when  Marissa  had  received  the  pills  from  Savana; 
if  it  had  been  a  few  days  before,  that  would  weigh  heavily 
against any reasonable conclusion that Savana presently had 
the pills on her person, much less in her underwear. 

In  sum,  what  was  missing  from  the  suspected  facts  that 
pointed  to  Savana  was  any  indication  of  danger  to  the  stu-
dents  from  the  power  of  the  drugs  or  their  quantity,  and 
any reason to suppose  that Savana was  carrying  pills  in her

Opinion of the Court 
underwear.  We  think  that  the  combination  of  these  defi-
ciencies was fatal to finding the search reasonable. 

In  so  holding,  we  mean  to  cast  no  ill  reflection  on  the 
assistant  principal,  for  the  record  raises  no  doubt  that  his 
motive  throughout  was  to  eliminate  drugs  from  his  school 
and  protect  students  from  what  Jordan  Romero  had  gone 
through.  Parents  are  known  to  overreact  to  protect  their 
children from danger, and a school official with responsibility 
for  safety  may  tend  to  do  the  same.  The  difference  is  that 
the  Fourth  Amendment  places  limits  on  the  official,  even 
with  the  high  degree  of  deference  that  courts  must  pay  to 
the educator's professional judgment. 

We do mean, though, to make it clear that the T.  L. O.  con-
cern  to  limit  a  school  search  to  reasonable  scope  requires 
the support of reasonable suspicion of danger or of resort to 
underwear for hiding evidence of wrongdoing before a search 
can  reasonably  make  the  quantum  leap  from  outer  clothes 
and backpacks  to exposure  of  intimate parts.  The meaning 
of such a search, and the degradation its subject may reason-
ably  feel,  place  a  search  that  intrusive  in  a  category  of  its 
own demanding its own specific suspicions. 

IV 
A school official searching a student is "entitled to qualified 
immunity  where  clearly  established  law  does  not  show  that 
the  search  violated  the  Fourth  Amendment."  Pearson  v. 
Callahan,  555  U. S.  223,  243-244  (2009).  To  be  established 
clearly,  however,  there  is  no  need  that  "the  very  action  in 
question  [have]  previously  been  held  unlawful."  Wilson  v. 
Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 615 (1999).  The unconstitutionality of 
outrageous  conduct  obviously  will  be  unconstitutional,  this 
being the reason, as Judge Posner has said, that "[t]he easiest 
cases  don't  even  arise."  K.  H.  v.  Morgan,  914  F.  2d  846, 
851 (CA7 1990).  But even as to action less than an outrage, 
"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates es-

tablished  law . . .  in  novel  factual  circumstances."  Hope  v. 
Pelzer, 536 U. S. 730, 741 (2002). 

T.  L. O.  directed  school  officials  to  limit  the  intrusiveness of  a  search,  "in  light  of  the  age  and  sex  of  the  student  and 

the  nature  of  the  infraction,"  469  U. S.,  at  342,  and  as  we have  just  said at  some  length,  the  intrusiveness  of  the  strip 
search  here  cannot  be  seen  as  justifiably  related  to  the  cir-
cumstances.  But  we  realize  that  the  lower  courts  have reached  divergent  conclusions  regarding  how  the 

T.  L. O. 
standard applies to such searches. A  number  of  judges  have  read 

T.  L. O.  as  the  en  banc  mi-
nority  of  the  Ninth  Circuit  did  here.  The  Sixth  Circuit  up-
held a strip search of a high school student for a drug, with-
out  any  suspicion  that  drugs  were  hidden  next  to  her  body. 
Williams  v.  Ellington,  936  F.  2d  881,  882-883,  887  (1991). 
And  other  courts  considering  qualified  immunity  for  strip 
searches  have  read  T.  L. O.  as  "a  series  of  abstractions,  on 
the  one  hand,  and  a  declaration  of  seeming  deference  to  the 
judgments of school officials, on the other," Jenkins v.  Talla-
dega  City  Bd.  of  Ed.,  115  F.  3d  821,  828  (CA11  1997)  (en 
banc), which made it impossible "to establish clearly the con-
tours of a Fourth Amendment right . . . [in] the wide variety 
of  possible  school  settings  different  from  those  involved  in 
T.  L. O."  itself,  ibid.  See  also  Thomas  v.  Roberts,  323 F.  3d 
950  (CA11  2003)  (granting  qualified  immunity  to  a  teacher 
and  police  officer  who  conducted  a  group  strip  search  of  a 
fifth grade class when looking for a missing $26). 

We  think  these  differences  of  opinion  from  our  own  are 
substantial  enough  to  require  immunity  for  the  school  offi-
cials in this case.  We would not suggest that entitlement to 
qualified  immunity  is  the  guaranteed  product  of  disuniform 
views  of  the  law  in  the  other  federal,  or  state,  courts,  and 
the  fact  that  a  single  judge,  or  even  a  group  of  judges,  dis-
agrees  about  the  contours  of  a  right  does  not  automatically 
render  the  law  unclear  if  we  have  been  clear.  That  said, 
however,  the  cases  viewing  school  strip  searches  differently

(iii)  Nothing in maritime law undermines this general rule's appli-
cability  in  the  maintenance  and  cure  context.  The  maintenance  and 
cure  obligation  dates  back  centuries  as  an  aspect  of  general  maritime 
law, and the failure of a seaman's employers to provide adequate medical 
care  was  the  basis  for  awarding  punitive  damages  in  cases  decided  in 
the  1800's.  This  Court  has  since  registered  its  agreement  with  such 
decisions and has subsequently found that in addition to wages, "mainte-
nance" includes food and lodging at the ship's expense, and "cure" refers 
to  medical  treatment,  Lewis  v.  Lewis  &  Clark  Marine,  Inc.,  531  U. S. 
438,  441.  Moreover, an  owner's failure to provide proper medical  care 
for  seamen  has  provided  lower  courts  the  impetus  to  award  damages 
that appear to contain at least some punitive element.  Pp. 412-414. 

(iv)  Under  these  settled  legal  principles,  respondent  is  entitled  to 
pursue  punitive  damages  unless  Congress  has  enacted  legislation  that 
departs from the common-law understanding.  Pp. 414-415. 

(b)  The  plain  language  of the  Jones  Act  does  not  provide a  basis  for 
overturning the common-law rule.  Congress  enacted the Jones Act to 
overrule The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, where the Court prohibited a sea-
man or his family from recovering for injuries or death suffered due to 
his  employers'  negligence.  To  that  end,  the  Act  created  a  statutory 
negligence cause of action, but it did not eliminate pre-existing remedies 
available to seamen for the separate common-law cause of action based 
on maintenance and cure.  The Act bestows the right to "elect" to bring 
a  Jones  Act  claim,  thereby  indicating  a  choice  of  actions  for  seamen-- 
not  an  exclusive  remedy.  Because  the  then-accepted  remedies  arose 
from  general  maritime  law,  it  necessarily  follows  that  Congress  envi-
sioned  their  continued  availability.  See  Chandris,  Inc.  v.  Latsis,  515 
U. S.  347,  354.  Had  the  Jones  Act  been  the  only  remaining  remedy 
available,  there  would  have  been  no  election  to  make.  And,  the  only 
statutory restrictions on general maritime maintenance and cure claims 
were  enacted  long  after  the  Jones  Act's  passage  and  limit  availability 
for only two discrete classes: foreign workers on offshore oil and mineral 
production  facilities  and  sailing  school  students  and  instructors.  This 
indicates that "Congress knows how to" restrict the traditional mainte-
nance  and  cure  remedy  "when  it  wants  to."  Omni  Capital  Int'l,  Ltd. 
v.  Rudolf  Wolff  &  Co.,  484  U. S.  97,  106.  This  Court  has  consistently 
observed that the Jones Act preserves common-law causes of action such 
as  maintenance  and  cure,  see,  e. g.,  The  Arizona  v.  Anelich,  298  U. S. 
110,  and  its case  law supports  the  view that  punitive  damages awards, 
in  particular,  continue to remain  available  in maintenance and  cure  ac-
tions, see Vaughan v.  Atkinson, 369 U. S. 527.  Pp. 415-418. 

(c)  Contrary  to  petitioners'  argument,  Miles does  not  limit  recovery 
to the remedies available under the Jones Act.  Miles does not address

Syllabus 
either  maintenance  and  cure  actions  in  general  or  the  availability  of 
punitive  damages  for  such  actions.  Instead,  it  grappled  with  the  en-
tirely  different  question  whether  general  maritime  law  should  provide 
a  cause  of  action  for  wrongful  death  based  on  unseaworthiness.  The 
Court  found  that  the  Jones  Act  and  the  Death  on  the  High  Seas  Act 
(DOHSA), along with state statutes, supported recognition of a general 
maritime  rule  for  wrongful  death  of  a  seaman.  However,  since  Con-
gress  had  chosen  to  limit  the  damages  available  in  the  Jones  Act  and 
DOHSA,  excluding  damages  for  loss  of  society  or  lost  future  earnings, 
498 U. S., at 21, 31-32, its judgment must control the availability of rem-
edies  for  wrongful-death  actions  brought  under  general  maritime  law, 
id., at 32-36.  Miles' reasoning does not apply here.  Unlike Miles' sit-
uation, both the general maritime cause of action here (maintenance and 
cure)  and  the  remedy  (punitive  damages)  were  well  established  before 
the  Jones  Act's  passage.  And  unlike  Miles'  facts,  the  Jones  Act  does 
not address the general maritime cause of action here or its remedy.  It 
is  thus  possible to adhere  to the traditional  understanding  of  maritime 
actions and  remedies without  abridging or violating the Jones  Act; un-
like wrongful-death actions, this traditional understanding is not a mat-
ter to which "Congress has spoken directly."  See id., at 31.  Moreover, 
petitioners'  contrary  view  was  directly  rejected  in  Norfolk  Shipbuild-
ing & Drydock Corp. v.  Garris, 532 U. S. 811, 820.  If Miles presented 
no  barrier  to  the  Garris Court's  endorsement  of  a  previously  unrecog-
nized maritime cause of action for negligent wrongful death, there is no 
legitimate  basis  for  a  contrary  conclusion  here.  Like  negligence,  the 
duty  of  maintenance  and  cure  and  the  general  availability  of  punitive 
damages have  been  recognized  "for  more than a  century," 532 U. S.,  at 
820.  And because respondent does not ask this Court to alter statutory 
text or "expand" the maritime tort law's general principles, Miles does 
not  require  eliminating  the  general  maritime  remedy  of  punitive  dam-
ages  for  the  willful  or  wanton  failure  to  comply  with  the  duty  to  pay 
maintenance and cure.  The fact that seamen commonly seek to recover 
under  the  Jones  Act  for  maintenance  and  cure  claims  does  not  mean 
that the Jones Act provides the only remedy.  See Cortes v.  Baltimore 
Insular Line, Inc., 287 U. S. 367, 374-375.  The laudable quest for uni-
formity  in  admiralty  does  not  require  narrowing  available  damages  to 
the  lowest  common  denominator  approved  by  Congress  for  distinct 
causes of action.  Pp. 418-425.

man  injured  while  serving  the  ship."  Lewis  v.  Lewis  & 
Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U. S. 438, 441 (2001). 

Petitioners thereafter filed an action for declaratory relief 
regarding their obligations with respect to maintenance and 
cure.  Respondent filed his own suit under the Jones Act and 
general maritime law, alleging negligence, unseaworthiness, 
arbitrary  and  willful  failure  to  pay  maintenance  and  cure, 
and  wrongful  termination.  In  addition,  respondent  filed 
similar  counterclaims  in  the  declaratory  judgment  action, 
seeking punitive  damages  for the  denial  of maintenance  and 
cure.  The  District  Court  consolidated  the  cases.  See  496 
F. 3d, at 1283-1284. 

Petitioners  moved  to  dismiss  respondent's  punitive  dam-
ages  claim.  The  District  Court  denied  the  motion,  holding 
that  it  was  bound  by  the  determination  in  Hines  v.  J.  A. 
LaPorte, Inc., 820 F. 2d 1187, 1189 (CA11 1987) (per curiam), 
that punitive damages were available in an action for mainte-
nance  and  cure.  The  court,  however,  agreed  to  certify  the 
question  for  interlocutory  appeal.  See  496  F.  3d,  at  1284. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit 
agreed  with  the  District  Court  that  Hines  controlled  and 
held  that  respondent  could  pursue  his  punitive  damages 
claim  for  the  willful  withholding  of  maintenance  and  cure. 
496  F.  3d,  at  1285-1286.  The  decision  conflicted  with  those 
of  other  Courts  of  Appeals,  see,  e. g.,  Guevara  v.  Maritime 
Overseas Corp., 59 F. 3d 1496 (CA5 1995) (en banc); Glynn v. 
Roy  Al  Boat  Management  Corp.,  57  F.  3d  1495  (CA9  1995), 
and we granted certiorari, 555 U. S. 993 (2008).

Opinion of the Court 

A 
Punitive  damages  have  long  been  an  available  remedy  at common  law  for  wanton,  willful,  or  outrageous  conduct. 

Under  English  law  during  the  colonial  era,  juries  were  ac-corded  broad  discretion  to  award  damages  as  they  saw  fit. 
See,  e. g.,  Lord  Townsend  v.  Hughes,  2  Mod.  150,  86  Eng. Rep.  994  (C.  P.  1676)  ("[I]n 

civil  actions  the  plaintiff  is  to recover  by  way  of  compensation  for  the  damages  he  hath 

sustained,  and  the  jury  are  the  proper  judges  thereof "  (em-phasis  in  original));  1  T.  Sedgwick,  Measure  of  Damages 

$ 349,  p.  688  (9th  ed.  1912)  (hereinafter  Sedgwick)  ("Until comparatively  recent  times  juries  were  as  arbitrary  judges 
of  the  amount  of  damages  as  of  the  facts").  The  common-law  view  "was  that  `in  cases  where  the  amount  of  damages 
was uncertain[,] their assessment was a matter so peculiarly within  the  province  of  the  jury  that  the  Court  should  not 
alter  it.' "  Feltner  v.  Columbia  Pictures  Television,  Inc., 523 U. S. 340, 353 (1998) (quoting Dimick v.  Schiedt, 293 U. S. 
474, 480 (1935); alteration in original). The  jury's  broad  discretion  to  set  damages  included  the 
authority  to  award  punitive  damages  when  the  circum-stances  of  the  case  warranted.  Just  before  the  ratification 
of  the  Constitution,  Lord  Chief  Justice  Pratt  explained: "[A] jury ha[s] it in [its] power to give damages for more than 
the  injury  received.  Damages  are  designed  not  only  as  a satisfaction  to  the  injured  person,  but  likewise  as  a  punish-
ment to the guilty, to deter from any such proceeding for the future,  and  as  a  proof  of  the  detestation  of  the  jury  to  the 
action itself."  Wilkes v.  Wood, Lofft 1, 18-19,  98 Eng. Rep. 489,  498-499  (C. P.  1763);  see  also  Pacific Mut.  Life  Ins.  Co.

Opinion of the Court 
American  courts  have  likewise  permitted  punitive  dam-ages  awards  in  appropriate  cases  since  at  least  1784.  See, 

e. g.,  Genay  v.  Norris,  1  S.  C.  L.  6,  7  (C.  P.  and  Gen.  Sess. 1784)  (approving  award  of  "very  exemplary  damages"  be-
cause  spiking  wine  represented  a  "very  wanton  outrage"); 
Coryell  v.  Colbaugh,  1  N.  J.  L.  77  (1791)  (concluding  that  a 
breach  of  promise  of  marriage  was  "of  the  most  atrocious 
and  dishonourable  nature"  and  supported  "damages  for  ex-
ample's  sake,  to  prevent  such  offences  in  future"  (emphasis 
in original)).  Although some States elected not to allow ju-ries to make such awards, the vast majority permitted them. 

See  1  Sedgwick  $$ 352,  354,  at  694,  700.  By  the  middle  of 
the  19th  century,  "punitive  damages  were  undoubtedly  an 
established  part  of  the  American  common  law  of  torts  [and] 
no  particular  procedures  were  deemed  necessary  to  circum-
scribe  a  jury's  discretion  regarding  the  award  of  such  dam-
ages, or their amount."  Haslip, supra, at 26-27 (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 

B 
The  general  rule  that  punitive  damages  were  available  at common  law  extended  to  claims  arising  under  federal  mari-

time  law.  See  Lake  Shore  &  Michigan  Southern  R.  Co.  v. 
Prentice, 147 U. S. 101, 108 (1893) ("[C]ourts of admiralty . . . proceed, in  cases of  tort,  upon the  same principles  as courts 

of common law, in allowing exemplary damages . . . ").  One of  this  Court's  first  cases  indicating  that  punitive  damages 
were  available  involved  an  action  for  marine  trespass.  See 
The  Amiable  Nancy,  3  Wheat.  546  (1818).  In  the  course  of deciding  whether  to  uphold  the  jury's  award,  Justice  Story, 

writing for the Court, recognized that punitive damages are an  available  maritime  remedy  under  the  proper  circum-
stances.  Although the Court found that the particular facts of the case did not warrant such an award against the named 
defendants, it  explained that "if this were a  suit against the original  wrong-doers,  it  might  be  proper  to  . . . visit  upon 
them in the shape of exemplary damages, the proper punish-ment  which  belongs  to  such  lawless  misconduct." 

Id.,  at 558; see  also  Barry,  supra,  at 563  ("In The  Amiable Nancy, 

which was the case of a marine tort, Mr. Justice Story spoke of  exemplary  damages  as  `the  proper  punishment  which  be-
longs to . . . lawless misconduct' " (citation omitted)). The  lower  federal  courts  followed  suit,  finding  that  puni-
tive damages were available in maritime actions for tortious acts  of  a  particularly  egregious  nature.  See,  e. g.,  McGuire 
v.  The  Golden  Gate,  16  F.  Cas.  141,  143  (No.  8,815)  (CC  ND Cal.  1856)  ("In  an  action  against  the  perpetrator  of  the 
wrong, the aggrieved party would be entitled to recover not only  actual  damages  but  exemplary,--such  as  would  vindi-
cate  his  wrongs,  and  teach  the  tort  feasor  the  necessity  of reform");  Ralston  v.  The  State  Rights,  20  F.  Cas.  201,  210 
(No. 11,540) (DC ED Pa. 1836) ("[I]t is not legally correct . . . to say that a court cannot give exemplary damages, in a case

Opinion of the Court 
(Story, J.) ("In cases of marine torts, or illegal captures, it is far  from  being  uncommon  in  the  admiralty  to  allow  costs 

and  expences,  and  to  mulct  the  offending  parties,  even  in exemplary  damages,  where  the  nature  of  the  case  requires 
it").  In  short,  prior  to  enactment  of  the  Jones  Act  in  1920, "maritime  jurisprudence  was  replete  with  judicial  state-
ments  approving  punitive  damages,  especially  on  behalf  of 
passengers  and  seamen."  Robertson,  Punitive  Damages  in American  Maritime  Law,  28  J.  Mar.  L.  &  Comm.  73,  115 

(1997)  (hereinafter  Robertson);  see  also  2  Sedgwick  $ 599b, at  1156  ("Exemplary  damages  are  awarded  in  Admiralty,  as 
in  other  jurisdictions");  2  J.  Sutherland,  Law  of  Damages $ 392, p. 1272 (4th ed. 1916) ("As a rule a court of equity will 
not  award  [punitive]  damages,  but  courts  of  admiralty 
will . . . " (footnote omitted)).2 

C 
Nothing  in  maritime  law  undermines  the  applicability  of 
this general rule in the maintenance and cure context.  See 
G.  Gilmore  &  C.  Black,  Law  of  Admiralty  $ 6-13,  p.  312  (2d 
ed.  1975)  (hereinafter  Gilmore  &  Black)  (explaining  that  a 
seaman  denied  maintenance  and  cure  "has  a  free  option  to 
claim damages (including punitive damages) under a general 
maritime law count"); Robertson 163 (concluding that breach 
of  maintenance  and  cure  is  one  of  the  particular  torts  for 
which  general  maritime  law  would  most  likely  permit  the 

2 Although  punitive damages  awards  were  rarely upheld  on judicial  re-
view, but see Roza  v.  Smith,  65 F. 592,  596-597 (DC  ND Cal. 1895);  Gal-
lagher v.  The Yankee, 9 F. Cas. 1091, 1093 (No. 5,196) (DC ND Cal. 1859), 
that fact does not draw into question the basic understanding that punitive 
damages were considered an available maritime remedy.  Indeed, in sev-
eral  cases  in  which  a  judgment  awarding  punitive  damages  was  over-
turned on appeal, the reversal was based on unrelated grounds.  See, e. g., 
The  Margharita,  140  F.  820,  824  (CA5  1905); Pacific  Packing  &  Nav.  Co. 
v.  Fielding,  136  F.  577,  580  (CA9  1905);  Latchtimacker  v.  Jacksonville

Opinion of the Court 
awarding  of  punitive  damages  "assuming  .  .  .  the  requisite level  of  blameworthiness").  Indeed,  the  legal  obligation  to 

provide maintenance and cure dates back centuries as an as-pect  of  general  maritime  law,  and  the  failure  of  a  seaman's 
employers  to  provide  him  with  adequate  medical  care  was the basis for awarding  punitive damages in cases decided  as 
early as the 1800's. The right to receive maintenance and cure was first recog-
nized  in  this  country  in  two  lower  court  decisions  authored 
by  Justice  Story.  See  Harden  v.  Gordon,  11  F.  Cas.  480 (No.  6,047)  (CC  Me.  1823); 

Reed  v.  Canfield,  20  F.  Cas.  426 
(No.  11,641)  (CC  Mass.  1832).  According  to  Justice  Story, 
this  common-law  obligation  to  seamen  was  justified  on  hu-
manitarian and economic grounds: "If some provision be not 
made for [seamen] in sickness at the expense of the ship, they 
must  often  in  foreign  ports  suffer  the  accumulated  evils  of 
disease, and poverty, and sometimes perish from the want of 
suitable nourishment. . . .  [T]he merchant himself derives an 
ultimate benefit [because i]t encourages seamen to engage in 
perilous  voyages  with  more  promptitude,  and  at  lower 
wages."  Harden, supra, at 483; see also Reed, supra, at 429 
("The  seaman  is  to  be  cured  at  the  expense  of  the  ship,  of 
the sickness or injury sustained in the ship's service"). 

This  Court  has  since  registered  its  agreement  with  these 
decisions.  "Upon a full review . . . of English and American 
authorities,"  the  Court  concluded  that  "the  vessel  and  her 
owners are liable, in case a seaman falls sick, or is wounded, 
in  the  service  of  the  ship,  to  the  extent  of  his  maintenance 
and cure,  and to his  wages, at least  so  long  as the  voyage is 
continued."  The  Osceola,  189  U. S.  158,  175  (1903).  Deci-
sions  following  The  Osceola  have  explained  that  in  addition 
to wages, "maintenance" includes food and lodging at the ex-
pense  of  their  ship,  and  "cure"  refers  to  medical  treatment.

medical  expenses,  a  living  allowance,  and  unearned  wages).

Opinion of the Court 
In addition, the failure of a vessel owner to provide proper medical  care  for  seamen  has  provided  the  impetus  for  dam-

ages  awards  that  appear  to  contain  at  least  some  punitive element.  For  example,  in  The  City  of  Carlisle,  39  F.  807 
(DC Ore. 1889), the court added $1,000 to its damages award to  compensate  an  apprentice  seaman  for  "gross  neglect  and 
cruel maltreatment of the [seaman] since his injury."  Id., at 809,  817.  The  court  reviewed  the  indignities  to  which  the 
apprentice  had  been  subjected  as  he  recovered  without  any serious  medical attention,  see 

id., at  810-812, and  explained that "if owners do not wish to be mulct in damages for such 

misconduct,  they  should  be  careful  to  select  men  worthy  to command  their  vessels  and  fit  to  be  trusted  with  the  safety 
and  welfare  of  their  crews,  and  particularly  apprentice boys." 

Id.,  at  817;  see  also  The  Troop,  118  F.  769,  770-771, 773 (DC Wash. 1902) (explaining that $4,000 was a reasonable 

award  because  the  captain's  "failure  to  observe  the  dictates of  humanity" and  obtain prompt  medical care  for  an  injured 
seaman constituted a "monstrous wrong").3 

D 
The settled legal principles discussed above establish three  points  central  to  resolving  this  case.  First,  punitive 

damages  have  long  been  available  at  common  law.  Second, the  common-law  tradition  of  punitive  damages  extends  to 
maritime  claims.4  And  third,  there  is  no  evidence  that 

3 Although  these  cases  do  not  refer  to  "punitive"  or  "exemplary"  dam-
ages, scholars have characterized the awards authorized by these decisions 
as  such.  See  Robertson  103-105;  Edelman,  Guevara  v.  Maritime  Over-
seas  Corp.:  Opposing  the  Decision,  20  Tulane  Mar.  L.  J.  349,  351,  and 
n. 22 (1996). 

4 The  dissent  correctly  notes  that  the  handful  of  early  cases  involving 

maintenance and cure, by themselves, do not definitively resolve the ques-
tion of punitive damages availability in such cases.  See post, at 429-431

Opinion of the Court 
claims  for  maintenance  and  cure  were  excluded  from  this general admiralty rule.  Instead, the pre-Jones Act evidence 

indicates  that  punitive  damages  remain  available  for  such claims  under  the  appropriate  factual  circumstances.  As  a 
result, respondent is entitled to pursue punitive damages un-less  Congress  has  enacted  legislation  departing  from  this 
common-law understanding.  As explained below, it has not. 

III  

A  

The  only  statute  that  could  serve  as  a  basis  for  overturn-ing the common-law rule in this case is the Jones Act.  Con-

gress enacted the Jones Act primarily to overrule The Osce-
ola,  supra,  in  which  this  Court  prohibited  a  seaman  or  his family  from  recovering  for  injuries  or  death  suffered  due  to 

his employers' negligence.  To this end, the statute provides in relevant part: 

"A seaman injured in the course of employment or, if the seaman dies from the injury, the personal representative 
of  the  seaman  may  elect  to  bring  a  civil  action  at  law, with  the  right  of  trial  by  jury,  against  the  employer. 
Laws  of  the  United  States  regulating  recovery  for  per-sonal  injury  to,  or  death  of,  a  railway  employee  apply 
to  an  action  under  this  section."  46  U. S. C.  $ 30104(a) (incorporating  the  Federal  Employers'  Liability  Act,  45 
U. S. C. $$ 51-60). 
The Jones Act thus created a statutory cause of action for negligence,  but  it  did  not  eliminate  pre-existing  remedies 

available  to  seamen  for  the  separate  common-law  cause  of 
tenance and cure actions should be excepted from this general rule.  It is 
because  of  this  rule,  and  the  fact  that  these  early  cases  support--rather 
than  refute--its  application  to  maintenance  and  cure  actions,  see  supra, 
at  413-414,  that  the  pre-Jones  Act  evidence  supports  the  conclusion  that 
punitive damages were available at common law where the denial of main-
tenance and cure involved wanton, willful, or outrageous conduct.

Opinion of the Court 
action  based  on  a  seaman's  right  to  maintenance  and  cure. 
Section 30104 bestows upon the  injured seaman the right to 
"elect" to bring a Jones Act claim, thereby indicating a choice 
of  acti ons  for  seamen--not  an  exclusive  remedy.  See 
Funk  &  Wagnalls  New  Standard  Dictionary  of  the  English 
Language  798  (1913)  (defining  "elect"  as  "[t]o  make  choice 
of ");  1  Bouvier's  Law  Dictionary  979  (8th  ed.  1914)  (defin-
ing  "election"  as  "[c]hoice;  selection").  Because  the  then-
accepted  remedies  for  injured  seamen  arose  from  general 
maritime law, see The Osceola, 189 U. S., at 175, it necessar-
ily  follows  that  Congress  was  envisioning  the  continued 
availability  of  those  common-law  causes  of  action.  See 
Chandris, Inc. v.  Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, 354 (1995) ("Congress 
enacted  the  Jones  Act  in  1920  to  remove  the  bar  to  suit  for 
negligence  articulated  in  The  Osceola,  thereby  completing 
the  trilogy  of  heightened  legal  protections  [including  main-
tenance  and  cure]  that  seamen  receive  because  of  their 
exposure  to  the  perils  of  the  sea"  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted));  Stewart  v.  Dutra  Constr.  Co.,  543  U. S.  481,  487 
(2005)  (describing  the  Jones  Act  as  "remov[ing]  this  bar  to 
negligence suits by seamen").  If the Jones Act had been the 
only  remaining  remedy  available  to  injured  seamen,  there 
would have been no election to make. 

In  addition,  the  only  statutory  restrictions  expressly  ad-
dressing  general  maritime  claims  for  maintenance  and  cure 
were enacted long after the passage of the Jones Act.  They 
limit its availability for two discrete classes of people: foreign 
workers on offshore oil and mineral production facilities, see 

$ 503(a)(2), 96 Stat. 1955, codified at 46 U. S. C. $ 30105(b), and 
sailing  school  students  and  instructors,  $ 204,  96  Stat.  1589, 
codified  at  46  U. S. C.  $ 50504(b).  These  provisions  indicate 
that  "Congress  knows  how  to"  restrict  the  traditional  rem-
edy  of  maintenance  and  cure  "when  it  wants  to."  Omni 
Capital  Int'l,  Ltd.  v.  Rudolf  Wolff  &  Co.,  484  U. S.  97,  106

Opinion of the Court 
recovery  restricts  the  availability  of  punitive  damages  for maintenance and cure for those, like respondent, who are not 

precluded from asserting the general maritime claim. Further  supporting  this  interpretation  of  the  Jones  Act, 
this Court has consistently recognized that the Act "was re-medial, for the benefit and protection of seamen who are pe-
culiarly the wards of admiralty.  Its purpose was to enlarge 
that protection, not to narrow it."  The Arizona v.  Anelich, 298  U. S.  110,  123  (1936);  see  also 

American  Export  Lines, 
Inc. v.  Alvez, 446 U. S. 274, 282 (1980) (plurality opinion) (de-clining to "read the Jones Act as sweeping aside general mar-

itime  law  remedies");  O'Donnell  v.  Great  Lakes  Dredge  & 
Dock  Co.,  318  U. S.  36,  43  (1943)  ("It  follows  that  the  Jones 
Act,  in  extending  a  right  of  recovery  to  the  seaman  injured 
while  in  the  service  of  his  vessel  by  negligence,  has  done 
no  more  than  supplement  the  remedy  of  maintenance  and 
cure  . .  . ");  Pacific  S.  S.  Co.  v.  Peterson,  278  U. S.  130,  134, 
138-139 (1928) (holding that the Jones Act "was not intended 
to restrict in any way the long-established right of a seaman 
to maintenance, cure and wages"). 

Not  only  have  our  decisions  repeatedly  observed  that  the 
Jones  Act  preserves  common-law  causes  of  action  such  as 
maintenance  and  cure,  but  our  case  law  also  supports  the 
view  that  punitive  damages  awards,  in  particular,  remain 
available in maintenance and cure actions after the Act's pas-
sage.  In Vaughan v.  Atkinson, 369  U. S. 527  (1962),  for  ex-
ample,  the  Court  permitted  the  recovery  of  attorney's  fees 
for  the  "callous"  and  "willful  and  persistent"  refusal  to  pay 
maintenance  and  cure.  Id.,  at  529-531.  In  fact,  even  the 
Vaughan dissenters, who believed that such fees were gener-
ally unavailable, agreed  that a seaman "would be entitled to 
exemplary damages in accord with traditional concepts of the 
law of damages" where a "shipowner's refusal to pay mainte-
nance  stemmed  from  a  wanton  and  intentional  disregard  of 
the legal rights of the seaman."  Id., at 540 (opinion of Stew-
art,  J.);  see  also  Fiske,  3  F.  Cas.,  at  957  (Story,  J.)  (arguing

Opinion of the Court 
that counsel fees are awardable in "[c]ourts of admiralty . . . not technically as costs, but upon the same principles, as they 

are  often  allowed  damages  in  cases  of  torts,  by  courts  of common  law,  as  a  recompense  for  injuries  sustained,  as  ex-
emplary  damages,  or  as  a  remuneration  for  expences  in-curred,  or  losses  sustained,  by  the  misconduct  of  the  other 
party").5 

Nothing  in  the  text  of  the  Jones  Act  or  this  Court's  deci-sions  issued  in  the  wake  of  its  enactment  undermines  the 

continued  existence  of  the  common-law  cause  of  action  pro-viding  recovery  for  the  delayed  or  improper  provision  of 
maintenance  and  cure.  Petitioners  do  not  deny  the  avail-ability  of  punitive  damages  in  general  maritime  law,  or 

identify  any  cases establishing  that such  damages  were  his-torically  unavailable  for  breach  of  the  duty  of  maintenance 
and  cure.  The  plain  language  of  the  Jones  Act,  then,  does not  provide  the  punitive  damages  bar  that  petitioners  seek.

should  provide  a  cause  of  action  for  wrongful  death  based on  unseaworthiness.  By  providing  a  remedy  for  wrongful 
death  suffered  on  the  high  seas  or  in  territorial  waters,  the Jones  Act  and  DOHSA  displaced  a  general  maritime  rule 
that denied any recovery for wrongful death.  See 498 U. S., at  23-34.  This  Court,  therefore,  was  called  upon  in 

Miles to  decide  whether  these  new  statutes  supported  an  expan-

sion  of  the  relief  available  under  pre-existing  general  mari-time  law  to  harmonize  it  with  a  cause  of  action  created  by 
statute. The  Court  in  Miles  first  concluded  that  the  "unanimous 
legislative judgment behind the Jones Act, DOHSA, and the many  state  statutes"  authorizing  maritime  wrongful-death 
actions  supported  the  recognition  of  a  general  maritime  ac-tion  for  wrongful  death  of  a  seaman. 

Id.,  at  24  (discussing Moragne  v.  States  Marine  Lines,  Inc.,  398  U. S.  375  (1970), 

which  overruled  The  Harrisburg,  119  U. S.  199  (1886)). Congress  had  chosen  to  limit,  however,  the  damages  avail-
able  for  wrongful-death  actions  under  the  Jones  Act  and DOHSA,  such  that  damages  were  not  statutorily  available 
for  loss  of  society  or  lost  future  earnings.  See  Miles,  498 U. S., at 21, 31-32.  The Court thus concluded that Congress' 

judgment  must  control  the  availability  of  remedies  for wrongful-death actions brought under general maritime law, 
id., at 32-36. 

6 DOHSA applies only to individuals killed (not merely injured) by con-
duct on the high seas.  See 46 U. S. C. $ 30302.  Because this case involves 
injuries  to  a  seaman,  and  not  death  on  the  high  seas,  DOHSA  is  not 
relevant.

420  ATLANTIC  SOUNDING  CO.  v.  TOWNSEND 

Opinion of the Court 
The  reasoning  of  Miles  remains  sound.  As  the  Court  in that case explained, "[w]e no longer live in an era when sea-

men  and  their  loved  ones  must  look  primarily  to  the  courts as  a  source  of  substantive  legal  protection  from  injury  and 
death;  Congress  and  the  States  have  legislated  extensively in  these  areas." 

Id.,  at  27.  Furthermore,  it  was  only  be-cause of congressional action that  a general federal cause of 

action for wrongful death on the high seas and in territorial waters  even  existed;  until  then,  there  was  no  general 
common-law  doctrine  providing  for  such  an  action.  As  a result,  to  determine  the  remedies  available  under  the 
common-law wrongful-death action, "an admiralty court should look primarily to these legislative enactments for pol-
icy  guidance."  Ibid.  It  would  have  been  illegitimate  to create  common-law  remedies  that  exceeded  those  remedies 
statutorily available under the Jones Act and DOHSA.  See 
id.,  at  36  ("We  will  not  create,  under  our  admiralty  powers, a  remedy  .  .  .  that  goes  well  beyond  the  limits  of  Congress' 

ordered system of recovery for seamen's injury and death"). But  application of  that principle  here  does  not  lead to  the 
outcome  suggested  by  petitioners  or  the  dissent.  See  post, at 425-426.  Unlike the situation presented in Miles, both the 
general maritime cause of action (maintenance and cure) and the remedy (punitive damages) were well established before 
the passage of the Jones Act.  See supra, at 409-414.  Also unlike  the  facts  presented  by  Miles, the  Jones  Act  does  not 
address  maintenance  and  cure  or  its  remedy.7  It  is  there-fore  possible  to  adhere  to  the  traditional  understanding  of 
maritime  actions  and  remedies  without  abridging  or  violat-ing  the  Jones  Act;  unlike  wrongful-death  actions,  this  tradi-
tional understanding is not a matter to which "Congress has

spoken  directly."  See  Miles,  supra,  at  31  (citing  Mobil Oil 
Corp.  v.  Higginbotham,  436  U. S.  618,  625  (1978)).  Indeed, 
the  Miles  Court  itself  acknowledged  that  "[t]he  Jones  Act evinces no general hostility to recovery under maritime law," 

498 U. S., at 29, and noted that statutory remedy limitations "would  not  necessarily  deter  us,  if  recovery  .  .  .  were  more 
consistent with the general principles of maritime tort law," 
id.,  at  35.  The  availability  of  punitive  damages  for  mainte-nance  and  cure  actions  is  entirely  faithful  to  these  "general 

principles  of  maritime  tort  law,"  and  no  statute  casts  doubt on their availability under general maritime law. 

Moreover, petitioners' contention that Miles precludes any 
action or remedy for personal injury beyond that made avail-
able under the Jones Act was directly rejected by this Court 
in  Norfolk  Shipbuilding  &  Drydock  Corp.  v.  Garris,  532 
U. S. 811, 818 (2001).  That case involved the death of a har-
bor  worker.  Ibid.  There, the  Court  recognized  a  maritime 
cause of action for wrongful death attributable to negligence 
although  neither  the  Jones  Act  (which  applies  only  to  sea-
men)  nor  DOHSA  (which  does  not  cover  territorial  waters) 
provided  such  a  remedy.  Id.,  at  817-818.  The  Court  ac-
knowledged that "it will be the better course, in many cases 
that assert new claims beyond what those statutes have seen 
fit to allow, to leave further development to Congress."  Id., 
at 820.  But the Court concluded that the cause of action at 
issue  there  was  "new  only  in  the  most  technical  sense"  be-
cause "[t]he general maritime law has recognized the tort of 
negligence  for  more  than  a  century,  and  it  has  been  clear 
since  Moragne  that  breaches  of  a  maritime  duty  are  action-
able  when  they  cause  death,  as  when  they  cause  injury." 
Ibid.  The  Court  thus  found  that  "Congress's  occupation  of 
this field is not yet so extensive as to preclude us from recog-
nizing  what  is  already  logically  compelled  by  our  prece-
dents."  Ibid. 

Because  Miles  presented  no  barrier  to  this  endorsement 
of  a  previously  unrecognized  maritime  cause  of  action  for

Opinion of the Court 
negligent  wrongful  death,  we  see  no  legitimate  basis  for  a contrary  conclusion  in  the  present  case.  Like  negligence, 

"[t]he general maritime law has recognized . . . for more than a century" the duty of maintenance and cure and the general 
availability of punitive damages.  See Garris, supra, at 820; see  also 

supra,  at  409-414.  And  because  respondent  does 
not  ask  this  Court  to  alter  statutory  text  or  "expand"  the 
general  principles  of  maritime  tort  law,  Miles  does  not  re-quire  us  to  eliminate  the  general  maritime  remedy  of  puni-

tive damages for the willful or wanton failure to comply with the  duty  to  pay  maintenance  and  cure.  "We  assume  that 
Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation," 
Miles,  supra,  at  32,  and  the  available  history  suggests  that 
punitive  damages  were  an  established  part  of  the  maritime law in 1920, see 

supra, at 411-414.8 
It remains true, of course,  that "[a]dmiralty is not created in  a  vacuum;  legislation  has  always  served  as  an  impor-

tant  source  of  both  common  law  and  admiralty  principles." 
Miles,  supra,  at  24.  And  it  also  is  true  that  the  negligent 
denial  of  maintenance  and  cure  may  also  be  the  subject  of 
a  Jones  Act  claim.  See  Cortes  v.  Baltimore  Insular  Line, 
Inc.,  287  U. S.  367  (1932).9  But  the  fact  that  seamen  com-
monly seek to recover under the Jones Act for the wrongful 
withholding of maintenance and cure does not mean that the 

8 In  light  of  the  Court's  decision  in  Norfolk  Shipbuilding  &  Drydock 
Corp.  v.  Garris,  532  U. S.  811,  818  (2001),  our  reading  of  Miles  cannot, 
as  the  dissent  contends,  represent  an  "abrup[t]"  change  of  course.  See 
post, at 425. 

9 For  those  maintenance  and  cure  claims  that  do  not  involve  personal 

injury (and thus cannot  be asserted under the Jones Act),  the dissent ar-
gues  that  punitive  damages  should  be  barred  because  such  claims  are 
based in contract, not tort.  See post, at 431-432.  But the right of main-
tenance and cure "was firmly established in the maritime law long before 
recognition  of  the  distinction  between  tort  and  contract."  O'Donnell  v. 
Great  Lakes  Dredge  &  Dock  Co.,  318  U. S.  36,  42  (1943).  Although  the 
right has  been described as  incident to  contract, it cannot  be modified  or 
waived.  See Cortes, 287 U. S., at 372.

Opinion of the Court 
Jones  Act  provides  the  only  remedy  for  maintenance  and cure  claims.  Indeed,  contrary  to  petitioners'  view  that  the 

Jones  Act  replaced  in  their  entirety  the  remedies  available at common law for maintenance and cure, the 

Cortes decision 
explicitly  acknowledged  a  seaman's  right  to  choose  among overlapping statutory and common-law remedies for injuries 

sustained by the denial of maintenance and cure.  See id., at  
374-375 (A seaman's "cause of action for personal injury cre-ated by the statute may have overlapped his cause of action 

for breach of the maritime duty of maintenance and cure . . . .  In  such  circumstances  it  was  his  privilege,  in  so  far  as  the 
causes  of  action  covered  the  same  ground,  to  sue  indiffer-ently on any one of them").

10 

As this Court has repeatedly explained, "remedies for neg-ligence,  unseaworthiness,  and  maintenance  and  cure  have 

different  origins  and  may  on  occasion  call  for  application  of slightly  different  principles  and  procedures." 

Fitzgerald  v. 
United  States  Lines Co.,  374  U. S.  16, 18  (1963);  see  also  Pe-
terson,  278  U. S.,  at  138,  139  (emphasizing  that  a  seaman's 
action for maintenance and cure is "independent" and "cumu-
lative"  from  other  claims  such  as  negligence  and  that  the 
maintenance and cure right is "in no sense inconsistent with, 
or an alternative of, the right to recover compensatory dam-
ages [under the Jones Act]").  See also Gilmore & Black $ 6- 

10 The  fact  that,  in  some  cases,  a  violation  of  the  duty  of  maintenance 
and  cure  may  also  give  rise  to  a  Jones  Act  claim,  see  post,  at  426-427

Opinion of the Court 
23,  at  342  ("It  is  unquestioned  law  that  both  the  Jones  Act and the  unseaworthiness  remedies  are  additional  to mainte-

nance and cure: the seaman may have maintenance and cure and also one of the other two").  The laudable quest for uni-
formity in admiralty does not require the narrowing of avail-able  damages  to  the  lowest  common  denominator  approved 
by Congress for distinct causes of action.11  Although "Con-gress  .  .  .  is  free  to  say  this  much  and  no  more," 

Miles, 498 U. S.,  at  24  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted),  we  will  not 

attribute words to Congress that it has not written. 

IV 
Because  punitive  damages  have  long  been  an  accepted remedy under general maritime law, and because nothing in 

the  Jones  Act  altered  this  understanding,  such  damages  for the willful and wanton disregard of the maintenance and cure 
obligation should remain available in the appropriate case as a  matter  of  general  maritime  law.

12  Limiting  recovery  for 

maintenance and cure to whatever is permitted by the Jones Act would give greater pre-emptive effect to the Act than is 

required by its text, Miles, or any of this Court's other deci-

11 Although this Court has recognized that it may change maritime law 
in its operation as an admiralty court, see Edmonds v.  Compagnie Gener-
ale Transatlantique, 443 U. S. 256, 271 (1979), petitioners have not asked 
the  Court to  do so  in  this  case  or pointed  to any  serious  anomalies,  with 
respect to the Jones Act or otherwise, that our holding may create.  Nor 
have petitioners argued that the size of punitive damages awards in main-
tenance  and  cure  cases  necessitates  a  recovery  cap,  which  the  Court  has 
elsewhere imposed.  See Exxon Shipping Co. v.  Baker, 554 U. S. 471, 514- 
515 (2008) (imposing a punitive-to-compensatory ratio of 1:1).  We do not 
decide these issues. 

12 Because we hold that Miles does not render the Jones Act's damages 

provision  determinative  of  respondent's  remedies,  we  do  not  address  the 
dissent's argument that the Jones  Act, by incorporating the provisions of 
the Federal  Employers'  Liability Act,  see 46  U. S. C. $ 30104(a),  prohibits 
the recovery of punitive damages in actions under that statute.  See post, 
at 427-428.

tem.  Affirming, the  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that  Nogales had not 
made sufficient progress in its ELL programming to warrant relief. 

Held: 

1.  The superintendent  has standing.  To establish Article III stand-
ing,  a  plaintiff  must  present  an  injury  that  is  concrete,  particularized, 
and  actual  or  imminent;  fairly  traceable  to  the  defendant's  challenged 
action;  and  redressable  by  a  favorable  ruling.  Lujan  v.  Defenders  of 
Wildlife,  504  U. S.  555,  560-561.  Here,  the  superintendent  was  a 
named defendant, the declaratory judgment held him in violation of the 
EEOA, and the injunction runs against him.  Because the superintend-
ent has standing, the Court  need  not consider whether the  Legislators 
also have standing.  Pp. 445-447. 

2.  The lower courts did not engage in the proper analysis under Rule 
60(b)(5).  Pp. 447-470. 

(a)  Rule 60(b)(5), which permits a party to seek relief from a judg-
ment  or order  if "a  significant  change  either  in factual  conditions or  in 
law"  renders  continued  enforcement  "detrimental  to  the  public  inter-
est," Rufo v.  Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 384, serves 
a particularly important function in "institutional reform litigation," id., 
at  380.  Injunctions in  institutional  reform cases  often  remain in  force 
for many years, during which time changed circumstances may warrant 
reexamination  of  the  original  judgment.  Injunctions  of  this  sort  may 
also raise sensitive federalism concerns, which are heightened when, as 
in these cases, a federal-court decree has the effect of dictating state or 
local  budget  priorities.  Finally,  institutional  reform  injunctions  bind 
state and local officials to their predecessors' policy preferences and may 
thereby "improperly deprive future officials of their designated legisla-
tive and executive powers."  Frew v.  Hawkins, 540 U. S. 431, 441.  Be-
cause  of  these  features  of  institutional  reform  litigation,  federal  courts 
must take a "flexible approach" to Rule 60(b)(5) motions brought in this 
context, Rufo, supra, at 381, ensuring that "responsibility for discharg-
ing  the  State's  obligations  is  returned  promptly  to  the  State  and  its 
officials"  when  circumstances  warrant,  Frew,  supra,  at  442.  Courts 
must  remain  attentive  to  the  fact  that  "federal-court  decrees  exceed 
appropriate limits if they are aimed at eliminating a condition that does 
not violate [federal law] or . . . flow  from such a violation."  Milliken v. 
Bradley,  433  U. S.  267,  282.  Thus,  a  critical  question  in  this  Rule 
60(b)(5)  inquiry  is  whether  the  EEOA  violation  underlying  the  2000 
order has been remedied.  If it has, the order's continued enforcement 
is unnecessary and improper.  Pp. 447-450. 

(b)  The Court of Appeals did not engage in the Rule 60(b)(5) analy-
sis just described.  Pp. 450-455.

(i)  Its  Rule  60(b)(5)  standard  was  too  strict.  The  Court  of  Ap-
peals explained that situations in which changed circumstances warrant 
Rule  60(b)(5)  relief  are  "likely  rare,"  and  that,  to  succeed,  petitioners 
had  to  show  that  conditions  in  Nogales  had  so  changed  as  to  "sweep 
away"  the  District  Court's  incremental  funding  determination.  The 
Court  of  Appeals  also  incorrectly  reasoned  that  federalism  concerns 
were substantially lessened here because the State and the state board 
of education wanted the injunction to remain in place.  Pp. 450-452. 

(ii)  The Court  of  Appeals'  inquiry  was also  too narrow, focusing 
almost  exclusively  on  the  sufficiency  of  ELL  incremental  funding.  It 
attributed  undue  significance  to  petitioners'  failure  to  appeal  the  Dis-
trict Court's 2000 order and in doing so, failed to engage in the flexible 
changed-circumstances  inquiry  prescribed  by  Rufo.  The  Court  of  Ap-
peals'  inquiry  was,  effectively,  an  inquiry  into  whether  the  2000  order 
had been satisfied.  But satisfaction of an earlier judgment  is only one 
of Rule 60(b)(5)'s enumerated bases for relief.  Petitioners could obtain 
relief  on  the  independent  basis  that  prospective  enforcement  of  the 
order was "no longer equitable."  To determine the merits of this claim, 
the Court of Appeals should have ascertained whether the 2000 order's 
ongoing  enforcement  was  supported  by  an  ongoing  EEOA  violation. 
Although  the  EEOA  requires  a  State  to  take  "appropriate  action,"  it 
entrusts state and local authorities with choosing how to meet this obli-
gation.  By  focusing  solely  on  ELL  incremental  funding,  the  Court  of 
Appeals  misapprehended  this  mandate.  And  by  requiring  petitioners 
to demonstrate "appropriate action" through a particular funding mech-
anism,  it  improperly  substituted  its  own  policy  judgments  for  those  of 
the state and local  officials entrusted  with the decisions.  Pp. 452-455. 

(c)  The  District  Court's  opinion  reveals  similar  errors.  Rather 
than determining whether changed circumstances warranted relief from 
the 2000 order, it asked only whether petitioners had satisfied that order 
through increased ELL incremental funding.  Pp. 455-456. 

(d)  Because  the  Court  of  Appeals  and  the  District  Court  misper-
ceived the obligation imposed by the EEOA and the breadth of the Rule 
60(b)(5) inquiry, these cases must be remanded for a proper examination 
of  at  least  four  factual  and  legal  changes  that  may  warrant  relief. 
Pp. 459-470. 

(i)  After the 2000 order was entered, Arizona moved from a "bi-
lingual education" methodology of ELL instruction to "structured Eng-
lish  immersion"  (SEI).  Research  on  ELL  instruction  and  findings  by 
the state department of education support the view that SEI is signifi-
cantly more effective than bilingual education.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) 
analysis  should  entail  further  factual  findings  regarding  whether  No-

Syllabus 
gales'  implementation  of  SEI  is  a  "changed  circumstance"  warranting 
relief.  Pp. 459-461. 

(ii)  Congress  passed  the  No  Child  Left  Behind  Act  of  2001 
(NCLB), which represents  another potentially  significant "changed cir-
cumstance."  Although compliance with NCLB will not necessarily con-
stitute  "appropriate  action"  under  the  EEOA,  NCLB  is  relevant  to 
petitioners' Rule 60(b)(5) motion in four principal ways: It prompted the 
State  to  make  significant  structural  and  programming  changes  in  its 
ELL programming; it significantly increased federal funding for educa-
tion  in  general  and  ELL  programming  in  particular;  it  provided  evi-
dence  of  the  progress  and  achievement  of  Nogales'  ELL  students 
through  its  assessment  and  reporting  requirements;  and  it  marked  a 
shift in federal education policy.  Pp. 461-465. 

(iii)  Nogales' superintendent instituted significant structural and 
management  reforms  which,  among  other  things,  reduced  class  sizes, 
improved student/teacher  ratios,  and improved the quality of  teachers. 
Entrenched  in  the  incremental  funding  framework,  the  lower  courts 
failed to recognize that these changes may have brought Nogales' ELL 
programming  into  compliance  with  the  EEOA  even  without  sufficient 
incremental  funding  to  satisfy  the  2000  order.  This  was  error.  Be-
cause the EEOA focuses on the quality of educational programming and 
services to students, not the amount of money spent, there is no statu-
tory  basis  for  precluding  petitioners  from  showing  that  Nogales  has 
achieved  EEOA-compliant  ELL  programming  in  ways  other  than 
through increased incremental funding.  A proper Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry 
should  recognize this  and should  ask whether, as a  result  of structural 
and  managerial  improvements,  Nogales  is  now  providing  equal  educa-
tional opportunities to ELL students.  Pp. 465-468. 

(iv)  There was an overall increase in education funding available 
in  Nogales.  The  Court  of  Appeals  foreclosed  the possibility  that  peti-
tioners  could  show  that  this  overall  increase  was  sufficient  to  support 
EEOA-compliant ELL programming.  This was clear legal error.  The 
EEOA's  "appropriate  action"  requirement does  not  necessarily  require 
a particular level of funding, and to the extent that funding is relevant, 
the  EEOA  does  not  require  that  the  money  come  from  a  particular 
source.  Thus,  the  District  Court  should  evaluate  whether  the  State's 
general  education  funding  budget,  in  addition  to  local  revenues,  cur-
rently supports EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales.

it  extends  beyond  Nogales,  the  lower  courts  should  consider  whether

the District Court  erred in entering statewide relief.  The record con-
tains no factual findings or evidence that any school district other than 
Nogales  failed  to  provide  equal  educational  opportunities  to  ELL  stu-
dents, and respondents have not explained how the EEOA can justify a 
statewide injunction here.  The state attorney general's concern that a 
"Nogales  only"  remedy  would  run  afoul  of  the  Arizona  Constitution's 
equal funding requirement did not provide a valid basis for a statewide 
federal injunction, for it raises a state-law question to be determined by 
state  authorities.  Unless  the  District Court  concludes  that  Arizona  is 
violating  the  EEOA  statewide,  it  should  vacate  the  injunction  insofar 
as it extends beyond Nogales.  Pp. 470-472.

Opinion of the Court 
which  requires  a  State  "to  take  appropriate  action  to  over-come  language  barriers  that  impede  equal  participation  by 

its students in its instructional programs."  In 2000, the Dis-trict  Court  entered  a  declaratory  judgment  with  respect  to 
Nogales,  and  in  2001,  the  court  extended  the  order  to  apply to  the  entire  State.  Over  the  next  eight  years,  petitioners 
repeatedly sought relief from the District Court's orders, but to  no  avail.  We  granted  certiorari  after  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the denial of petitioners' motion  for  relief  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure 
60(b)(5),  and  we  now  reverse  the  judgment  of  the  Court  of Appeals and remand for further proceedings. 

As  we  explain,  the  District  Court  and  the  Court  of  Ap-peals misunderstood both the obligation  that the  EEOA im-
poses on States and the nature of the inquiry that is required when  parties  such  as  petitioners  seek  relief  under  Rule 
60(b)(5) on the ground that enforcement of a judgment is "no longer  equitable."  Both  of  the  lower  courts  focused  exces-
sively on the narrow question of the  adequacy of the State's incremental  funding  for  ELL  instruction  instead  of  fairly 
considering the broader question whether, as a result of im-portant changes during the intervening years, the State was 
fulfilling  its  obligation  under  the  EEOA  by  other  means. The  question  at  issue  in  these  cases  is  not  whether  Arizona 
must  take  "appropriate  action"  to  overcome  the  language barriers  that  impede  ELL  students.  Of  course  it  must. 
But petitioners argue that Arizona is now fulfilling its statu-tory obligation by new means that reflect new policy insights 
and  other  changed  circumstances.  Rule  60(b)(5)  provides the vehicle for petitioners to bring such an argument.

In 1992, a group of students enrolled in the ELL program in Nogales and their parents (plaintiffs) filed suit in the Dis-

trict Court for the District of Arizona on behalf of "all minor-

ity  `at  risk'  and  limited  English  proficient  children  .  .  .  now or hereafter, enrolled in [the] Nogales Unified School District 

.  . .  as well  as their  parents  and  guardians."  Flores  v.  Ari-zona,  172  F. Supp.  2d  1225,  1226 (2000).  Plaintiffs  sought  a 
declaratory  judgment  holding  that  the  State  of  Arizona,  its board of education, and its  superintendent of public  instruc-
tion (defendants) were violating the  EEOA by providing in-adequate ELL instruction in Nogales.

1 

The relevant portion of the EEOA states: 

"No  State  shall  deny  equal  educational  opportunity  to an individual on account of his or her race, color, sex, or 

national origin, by-- . . . . . 
"(f)  the  failure  by  an  educational  agency  to  take  ap-propriate  action  to  overcome  language  barriers  that 
impede equal participation by its students in its instruc-tional  programs."  20  U. S. C.  $ 1703  (emphasis  added). 

By  simply  requiring  a  State  "to  take  appropriate  action  to overcome  language  barriers"  without  specifying  particular 
actions  that  a  State  must  take,  "Congress  intended  to  leave state  and  local  educational  authorities  a  substantial  amount 
of  latitude  in  choosing  the  programs  and  techniques  they

States'  sovereign  immunity  only  by  doing  so  (1)  unequivocally  and 
(2) pursuant to certain valid grants of constitutional authority.  See, e. g., 
Kimel v.  Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 73 (2000).  With respect to 
the  second  requirement,  we  have  held  that  statutes  enacted  pursuant  to

ent  and  proportional"  to  the  injury  that  Congress  intended  to  address. 
See  City of  Boerne v.  Flores,  521 U. S.  507, 520  (1997).  Prior  to City  of 
Boerne,  the Court  of Appeals for  the Ninth  Circuit held that the EEOA, 
which was enacted pursuant to $ 5  of the Fourteenth  Amendment, see 20 

U. S. C. $$ 1702(a)(1), (b), validly abrogates the States' sovereign immunity.

would use to meet their obligations under the EEOA."  Cas-taneda v.  Pickard, 648 F. 2d 989, 1009 (CA5 1981). 

In  August  1999,  after  seven  years  of  pretrial  proceedings and  after  settling  various  claims  regarding  the  structure  of 
Nogales'  ELL  curriculum,  the  evaluation  and  monitoring  of Nogales'  students,  and  the  provision  of  tutoring  and  other 
compensatory instruction, the parties proceeded to trial.  In January  2000,  the  District  Court  concluded  that  defendants 
were violating the EEOA because the amount of funding the State  allocated for  the  special needs  of  ELL  students  (ELL 
incremental  funding)  was  arbitrary  and  not  related  to  the actual funding needed to cover the costs of ELL instruction 
in  Nogales.  172  F.  Supp.  2d,  at  1239.  Defendants  did  not appeal the District Court's order. 

B 
In the years following, the District Court entered a series of  additional  orders  and  injunctions.  In  October  2000,  the 

court ordered the State to "prepare a cost study to establish the  proper  appropriation  to  effectively  implement"  ELL 
programs.  Flores  v.  Arizona,  160  F.  Supp.  2d  1043,  1047. In  June  2001,  the  court  applied  the  declaratory  judgment 
order  statewide  and  granted  injunctive  relief  accordingly. No.  CIV.  92-596TUCACM,  2001  WL  1028369,  *2  (June  25, 
2001).  The  court  took  this  step  even  though  the  certified class  included  only  Nogales  students  and  parents  and  even 
though  the  court  did  not  find  that  any  districts  other  than Nogales  were  in  violation  of  the  EEOA.  The  court  set  a 
deadline of January 31, 2002, for the State to provide funding that  "bear[s]  a  rational  relationship  to  the  actual  funding 
needed."  Ibid. In  January 2005,  the  court  gave  the  State  90  days  to "ap-
propriately  and  constitutionally  fun[d]  the  state's  ELL  pro-grams  taking  into  account  the  [Rule's]  previous  orders." 
No.  CIV.  92-596-TUC-ACM,  p.  5,  App.  393.  The  State failed to meet this deadline, and in December 2005, the court

Opinion of the Court 
held  the  State  in  contempt.  Although  the  legislature  was 
not then a party to the suit, the court ordered that "the legis-
lature  has  15  calendar  days  after  the  beginning  of  the  2006 
legislative session to comply with the January 28, 2005 Court 
order.  Everyday thereafter . . . that the State fails to com-
ply with this Order, [fines] will be imposed until the State is 
in  compliance."  Flores  v.  Arizona,  405  F.  Supp.  2d  1112, 
1120.  The schedule of fines that the court imposed escalated 
from $500,000 to $2 million per day.  Id., at 1120-1121. 

C 
Defendants  did  not  appeal  any  of  the  District  Court's  or-
ders,  and  the  record  suggests  that  some  state  officials  sup-
ported their continued enforcement.  In June 2001, the state 
attorney  general  acquiesced  in  the  statewide  extension  of 
the  declaratory  judgment  order,  a  step  that  the  State  has 
explained by reference to the Arizona constitutional require-
ment  of  uniform  statewide  school  funding.  See  Brief  for 
Appellee  State  of  Arizona  et  al.  in  No.  07-15603  etc.  (CA9), 
p.  60  (citing  Ariz.  Const.,  Art.  11,  $ 1(A)).  At  a  hearing  in 
February 2006, a new attorney general opposed the superin-
tendent's request for  a stay of the  December 2005  order im-
posing  sanctions  and  fines,  and  filed  a  proposed  distribution 
of the accrued fines. 

In March 2006, after accruing over $20 million in fines, the 
state  legislature  passed  HB  2064,  which  was  designed 
to  implement  a  permanent  funding  solution  to  the  prob-
lems identified by the District Court in 2000.  Among other 
things, HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding (with a 
2-year  per-student  limit  on  such  funding)  and  created  two 
new funds--a structured English immersion fund and a com-
pensatory instruction fund--to cover additional costs of ELL 
programming.  Moneys in both newly created funds were to 
be  offset  by  available  federal  moneys.  HB  2064  also  insti-
tuted several programming and structural changes.

Opinion of the Court 
The Governor did not approve of HB 2064's funding provi-sions,  but  she  allowed  the  bill  to  become  law  without  her 

signature.  Because HB 2064's incremental ELL funding in-crease required court approval to become effective, the Gov-
ernor requested the attorney general to move for accelerated consideration  by  the  District  Court.  In  doing  so,  she  ex-
plained:  " `After  nine  months  of  meetings  and  three  vetoes, 
it  is  time  to  take  this  matter  to  a  federal  judge.  I  am  con-vinced that getting this bill into court now is the most expe-

ditious  way  ultimately  to  bring  the  state  into  compliance with federal law.' " 

Flores v.  Arizona, 516 F. 3d 1140, 1153, 
n.  16  (CA9  2008).  The  state  board  of  education  joined  the 
Governor  in  opposing  HB  2064.  Together,  the  state  board 
of  education,  the  State  of  Arizona,  and  the  plaintiffs  are  re-
spondents here. 

With the principal defendants in the action siding with the 
plaintiffs, the Speaker of the State House of Representatives 
and  the  President  of  the  State  Senate  (Legislators)  filed  a 
motion  to  intervene  as  representatives  of  their  respective 
legislative  bodies.  App.  55.  In  support  of  their  motion, 
they  stated  that  although  the  attorney  general  had  a  "legal 
duty"  to  defend  HB  2064,  the  attorney  general  had  shown 
"little  enthusiasm"  for  advancing  the  legislature's  interests. 
Id.,  at  57.  Among  other  things,  the  Legislators  noted  that 
the  attorney  general  "failed  to  take  an  appeal  of  the  judg-
ment  entered  in  this  case  in  2000  and  has  failed  to  appeal 
any  of  the  injunctions  and  other  orders  issued  in  aid  of 

the judgment."  Id., at 60.  The District Court granted the 
Legislators'  motion  for  permissive  intervention,  and  the 
Legislators  and  superintendent  (together,  petitioners  here) 
moved to purge the  District Court's contempt  order in light 
of HB 2064.  Alternatively, they moved for relief under Fed-
eral  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  60(b)(5)  based  on  changed 
circumstances. 

In  April  2006,  the  District  Court  denied  petitioners'  mo-
tion,  concluding  that  HB  2064  was  fatally  flawed  in  three

Opinion of the Court 
respects.  First, while HB 2064 increased ELL incremental funding  by  approximately  $80  per  student,  the  court  held 

that this increase was not rationally related to effective ELL programming.  Second, the court concluded that imposing a 
2-year limit on funding for each ELL student was irrational. Third,  according  to  the  court,  HB  2064  violated  federal  law 
by  using  federal  funds  to  "supplant"  rather  than  "supple-
ment"  state  funds.  No.  CV-92-596-TUC-RCC,  pp.  4-8 (Apr. 25, 2006), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-294, pp. 176a, 

181a-182a.  The  court  did  not  address  petitioners'  Rule 60(b)(5)  claim  that  changed  circumstances  rendered  contin-
ued  enforcement of  the  original  declaratory judgment  order 
inequitable.  Petitioners appealed. 

In  an  unpublished  decision,  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 
Ninth  Circuit  vacated  the  District  Court's  April  2006  order, 
the  sanctions,  and  the  imposition  of  fines,  and  remanded  for 
an  evidentiary  hearing  to  determine  whether  Rule  60(b)(5) 
relief was warranted.  Flores v.  Rzeslawski, 204 Fed. Appx. 
580 (2006). 

On  remand,  the  District  Court  denied  petitioners'  Rule 
60(b)(5)  motion.  Flores  v.  Arizona,  480  F.  Supp.  2d  1157, 
1167  (Ariz.  2007).  Holding  that  HB  2064  did  not  establish 
"a funding system that rationally relates funding available to 
the  actual  costs  of  all  elements  of  ELL  instruction,"  id.,  at 
1165, the court gave the State until the end of the legislative 
session  to  comply  with  its  orders.  The  State  failed  to  do 
so, and  the  District  Court  again held  the  State  in  contempt. 
No.  CV  92-596  TUC-RCC  (Oct.  10,  2007),  App.  86.  Peti-
tioners appealed. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed.  516  F.  3d  1140.  It  ac-
knowledged that Nogales had "made significant strides since 
2000,"  id.,  at  1156,  but  concluded  that  the  progress  did 
not  warrant  Rule  60(b)(5)  relief.  Emphasizing  that  Rule 
60(b)(5) is not a substitute for a timely appeal, and character-
izing  the  original  declaratory  judgment  order  as  centering 
on  the  adequacy  of  ELL  incremental  funding,  the  Court  of

445 Cite as: 557 U. S. 433 (2009) 
Opinion of the Court 
Appeals  explained  that  relief  would  be  appropriate  only  if petitioners had shown "either that there are no longer incre-

mental  costs  associated  with  ELL  programs  in  Arizona"  or that  Arizona  had  altered  its  funding  model.  Id.,  at  1169. 
The  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that  petitioners  had  made neither  showing,  and  it  rejected  petitioners'  other  argu-
ments,  including  the  claim  that  Congress'  enactment  of  the No  Child  Left  Behind  Act  of  2001  (NCLB),  115  Stat.  1425, 
codified in Title 20 U. S. C. $ 6842, constituted a changed legal circumstance that warranted Rule 60(b)(5) relief. 

We  granted  certiorari,  555  U. S.  1092  (2009),  and  now reverse. 

II 
Before  addressing  the  merits  of  petitioners'  Rule  60(b)(5) motion, we consider the threshold issue of standing--"an es-

sential  and  unchanging  part  of  the  case-or-controversy  re-quirement  of  Article  III."  Lujan  v.  Defenders  of  Wildlife, 
504  U. S.  555,  560  (1992).  To  establish  standing,  a  plaintiff must  present  an  injury  that  is  concrete,  particularized,  and 
actual  or  imminent;  fairly  traceable  to  the  defendant's  chal-lenged  action;  and  redressable  by  a  favorable  ruling. 

Id., at  560-561.  Here,  as  in  all  standing  inquiries,  the  critical 

question is whether at least one petitioner has "alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to war-
rant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction."  Summers v.  Earth  Island  Institute,  555  U. S.  488,  493  (2009)  (quoting 
Warth  v.  Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498 (1975); internal quotation marks omitted). 

We agree with the Court of Appeals that the superintend-ent  has  standing  because  he  "is  a  named  defendant  in  the 
case[,] the Declaratory Judgment held him to be in violation of the EEOA, and the current injunction runs against him." 
516  F.  3d,  at  1164  (citation  omitted).  For  these  reasons alone,  he  has  alleged  a  sufficiently  " `personal  stake  in  the 
outcome  of  the  controversy' "  to  support  standing.  Warth, 
supra,  at  498;  see  also  United  States  v.  Sweeney,  914  F.  2d

Opinion of the Court 
1260,  1263  (CA9  1990)  (rejecting  as  "frivolous"  the  argu-ment  that  a  party  does  not  have  "standing  to  object  to  or-

ders  specifically  directing  it  to  take  or  refrain  from  taking action"). 

Respondents'  only  argument  to  the  contrary  is  that  the superintendent  answers  to  the  state  board  of  education, 
which in turn answers to the  Governor, and that the Gover-nor is the only Arizona official who "could have resolved the 
conflict within the Executive Branch by directing an appeal." Brief for Respondent Flores et al. 22.  We need not consider 
whether respondents' chain-of-command argument has merit because  the  Governor  has,  in  fact,  directed  an  appeal.  See 
App.  to  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner  Superintendent  1  ("I hereby  direct  [the  state  attorney  general]  to  file  a  brief 
at  the  [Supreme]  Court  on  behalf  of  the  State  of  Arizona adopting  and  joining  in  the  positions  taken  by  the  Superin-
tendent  of  Public  Instruction,  the  Speaker  of  the  Arizona House  of  Representatives,  and  the  President  of  the  Arizona 
Senate"). Because  the  superintendent  clearly  has  standing  to  chal-
lenge  the  lower  courts'  decisions,  we  need  not  consider whether  the  Legislators  also  have  standing  to  do  so.

2  See, 

e. g.,  Arlington  Heights  v.  Metropolitan  Housing  Devel-opment Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 264, and n. 9 (1977) ("[W]e have 

at least one individual plaintiff who has demonstrated stand-ing  .  .  .  .  Because of  the  presence  of  this  plaintiff,  we  need 
not  consider  whether  the  other  individual  and  corporate 

2 We do not agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that "the 
Superintendent's  standing  is  limited"  to  seeking  vacatur  of  the  District 
Court's orders  "only as  they run  against him."  516 F. 3d,  at 1165.  Had 
the  superintendent  sought  relief  based  on  satisfaction  of  the  judgment, 
the  Court  of  Appeals'  conclusion  might  have  been  correct.  But  as  dis-
cussed infra, at 453, petitioners' Rule 60(b)(5) claim is not based on satis-
faction  of  the  judgment.  Their  claim  is  that  continued  enforcement  of 

the  District  Court's  orders  would  be  inequitable.  This  claim  implicates 
the  orders  in  their  entirety,  and  not  solely  as  they  run  against  the 
superintendent.

Opinion of the Court 
plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit").  Accordingly, we proceed to the merits of petitioners' Rule 60(b)(5) motion. 

III  

A  

Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  60(b)(5)  permits  a  party to  obtain  relief  from  a  judgment  or  order  if,  among  other 

things, "applying [the judgment or order] prospectively is no longer  equitable."  Rule  60(b)(5)  may  not  be  used  to  chal-
lenge  the  legal  conclusions  on  which  a  prior  judgment  or order rests, but the Rule provides a means by which a party 
can  ask  a  court  to  modify  or  vacate  a  judgment  or  order  if "a  significant  change  either  in  factual  conditions  or  in  law" 
renders continued enforcement "detrimental to the public in-terest."  Rufo  v.  Inmates  of  Suffolk  County  Jail,  502  U. S. 
367,  384  (1992).  The  party  seeking  relief  bears  the  burden of  establishing  that  changed  circumstances  warrant  relief, 
id.,  at  383,  but  once  a  party  carries  this  burden,  a  court abuses its discretion "when it refuses to modify an injunction 
or  consent  decree in  light  of  such  changes,"  Agostini  v.  Fel-
ton, 521 U. S. 203, 215 (1997). Rule  60(b)(5)  serves  a  particularly  important  function  in 

what  we  have  termed  "institutional  reform  litigation." 3 Rufo,  supra,  at  380.  For  one  thing,  injunctions  issued  in 

3 The  dissent  is  quite  wrong  in  contending  that  these  are  not  institu-
tional reform cases because they involve a statutory, rather than a consti-
tutional, claim and because the orders of the District Court do not micro-
manage  the day-to-day  operation  of  the  schools.  Post,  at  496 (opinion  of

Opinion of the Court 
such  cases  often  remain  in  force  for  many  years,  and  the passage  of  time  frequently  brings  about  changed  circum-

stances--changes  in  the  nature  of  the  underlying  problem, changes in governing law or its interpretation by the courts, 
and  new  policy  insights--that  warrant  reexamination  of  the original judgment. 

Second,  institutional  reform  injunctions  often  raise  sensi-tive 

federalism concerns.  Such litigation commonly involves areas  of  core  state  responsibility,  such  as  public  education.

1a-4a. It goes without saying that  federal courts must vigilantly 
enforce federal law and must not hesitate in awarding neces-sary  relief.  But  in  recognition  of  the  features  of  institu-
tional reform decrees, we have held  that courts must take a "flexible approach" to Rule 60(b)(5) motions addressing such 
decrees.  Rufo, 502 U. S., at 381.  A flexible approach allows courts  to  ensure  that  "responsibility  for  discharging  the 
State's obligations  is  returned promptly  to the  State  and its officials"  when  the  circumstances  warrant. 

Frew,  supra,  at 442.  In applying this flexible approach, courts must remain 

attentive  to  the  fact  that  "federal-court  decrees  exceed  ap-propriate  limits  if  they  are  aimed  at  eliminating  a  condition 
that does not violate [federal law] or does not flow from such a violation." 

Milliken v.  Bradley, 433  U. S. 267, 282  (1977). "If [a federal consent decree is] not limited to reasonable and 

necessary  implementations  of  federal  law,"  it  may  "improp-erly  deprive  future  officials  of  their  designated  legislative 
and executive powers."  Frew, 540 U. S., at 441. For  these  reasons,  a  critical  question  in  this  Rule  60(b)(5) 
inquiry is whether the objective of the District Court's 2000 declaratory judgment order--i. e., satisfaction of the EEOA's 
"appropriate action" standard--has been achieved.  See id., at  442.  If  a  durable  remedy  has  been  implemented,  con-
tinued  enforcement  of  the  order  is  not  only  unnecessary, but  improper.  See 

Milliken,  supra,  at  282.  We  note  that the EEOA itself limits court-ordered remedies to those that 

"are  essential  to  correct  particular  denials  of  equal  edu-cational  opportunity  or  equal  protection  of  the  laws."  20

Opinion of the Court 
standard  that  seeks  to  return  control  to  state  and  local  offi-cials as soon as a violation of federal law has been remedied, 

the  Court  of  Appeals  used  a  heightened  standard  that  paid insufficient  attention  to  federalism  concerns.  And  rather 
than  inquiring  broadly  into  whether  changed  conditions  in Nogales provided evidence of an ELL program that complied 
with  the  EEOA,  the  Court  of  Appeals  concerned  itself  only with  determining  whether  increased  ELL  funding  complied 
with  the  original  declaratory  judgment  order.  The  court erred on both counts. 

1 
The Court of Appeals began its Rule 60(b)(5) discussion by citing the correct legal standard, see 516 F. 3d, at 1163 (not-

ing  that  relief  is  appropriate  upon  a  showing  of  " `a  sig-nificant  change  either  in  factual  conditions  or  in  law' "),  but 
it  quickly  strayed.  It  referred  to  the  situations  in  which changed circumstances warrant Rule 60(b)(5) relief as "likely 
rare,"  id.,  at  1167,  and  explained  that,  to  succeed  on  these grounds, petitioners would have to make a showing that con-
ditions  in  Nogales  had  so  changed  as  to  "sweep  away"  the District  Court's  incremental  funding  determination, 

id.,  at 1168.  The  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that  the  District 

Court had not erred in determining that "the landscape was not  so  radically  changed  as  to  justify  relief  from  judgment 
without compliance."  Id., at 1172 (emphasis added).4 Moreover,  after  recognizing  that  review  of  the  denial  of 
Rule  60(b)(5)  relief  should  generally be  "somewhat  closer  in the  context  of  institutional  injunctions  against  states  `due 
to  federalism  concerns,' "  the  Court  of  Appeals  incorrectly 

4 The  dissent  conveniently  dismisses  the  Court  of  Appeals'  statements 
by characterizing any error that exists as "one of tone, not of law," and by 
characterizing  our  discussion  as  reading  them  out  of  context.  Post,  at 
510-511.  But  we  do  read  these  statements  in  context--in  the  context 
of  the  Court  of  Appeals'  overall  treatment  of  petitioners'  Rule  60(b)(5) 
arguments--and  it  is  apparent  that  they  accurately  reflect  the  Court  of 
Appeals' excessively narrow understanding of the role of Rule 60(b)(5).

Opinion of the Court 
reasoned  that  "federalism  concerns  are  substantially  les-sened  here,  as  the  state  of  Arizona  and  the  state  Board  of 

Education  wish  the  injunction  to  remain  in  place."  Id.,  at 1164.  This  statement  is  flatly  incorrect,  as  even  respond-
ents  acknowledge.  Brief  for  Respondent  State  of  Arizona et  al.  20-21.  Precisely  because  different  state  actors  have 
taken  contrary  positions  in  this  litigation,  federalism  con-cerns  are  elevated.  And  precisely  because  federalism  con-
cerns  are  heightened,  a  flexible  approach  to  Rule  60(b)(5) relief  is  critical.  "[W]hen  the  objects  of  the  decree  have 
been  attained"--namely,  when  EEOA  compliance  has  been achieved--"responsibility  for  discharging  the  State's  obliga-
tions  [must  be]  returned  promptly  to  the  State  and  its  offi-cials."  Frew, supra, at 442. 

2 
In  addition  to  applying  a  Rule  60(b)(5)  standard  that  was too  strict,  the  Court  of  Appeals  framed  a  Rule  60(b)(5)  in-

quiry  that  was  too  narrow--one  that  focused  almost  exclu-sively  on  the  sufficiency  of  incremental  funding.  In  large 
part,  this  was  driven  by  the  significance  the  Court  of  Ap-peals  attributed to petitioners' failure to appeal the  District 
Court's original order.  The Court of Appeals explained that "the  central  idea"  of  that  order  was  that  without  sufficient 
ELL  incremental  funds,  "ELL  programs  would  necessarily be  inadequate."  516  F.  3d,  at  1167-1168.  It  felt  bound  by 
this  conclusion,  lest  it  allow  petitioners  to  "reopen  matters made  final  when  the  Declaratory  Judgment  was  not  ap-
pealed."  Id.,  at  1170.  It  repeated  this  refrain  throughout its  opinion,  emphasizing  that  the  " `interest  in  finality  must 
be  given  great  weight,' "  id.,  at  1163,  and  explaining  that petitioners  could  not  now  ask  for  relief  "on  grounds  that 
could have been raised on appeal from the Declaratory Judg-ment  and  from  earlier  injunctive  orders  but  were  not," 

id., at  1167.  "If  [petitioners]  believed  that  the  district  court 

erred  and  should  have  looked  at  all  funding  sources  differ-

Opinion of the Court 
ently  in  its  EEOA  inquiry,"  the  court  wrote,  "they  should have appealed the Declaratory Judgment."  Id., at 1171. 

In  attributing  such  significance  to  the  defendants'  failure to  appeal  the  District  Court's  original  order,  the  Court  of 
Appeals  turned  the  risks  of  institutional  reform  litigation into reality.  By confining the scope of its analysis to that of 
the  original  order,  it  insulated  the  policies  embedded  in  the order--specifically,  its  incremental  funding  requirement-- 
from  challenge  and  amendment.5  But  those  policies  were supported  by  the  very  officials  who  could  have  appealed 
them--the  state  defendants--and,  as  a  result,  were  never subject to true challenge. 

Instead  of  focusing  on  the  failure  to  appeal,  the  Court  of Appeals  should have conducted  the  type of Rule 60(b)(5) in-
quiry  prescribed  in  Rufo.  This  inquiry  makes  no  reference to  the  presence  or  absence  of  a  timely  appeal.  It  takes 
the  original  judgment  as  a  given  and  asks  only  whether "a  significant  change  either  in  factual  conditions  or  in  law" 
renders continued enforcement of the judgment "detrimental to the public interest."  Rufo, 502 U. S., at 384.  It allows a 
court  to  recognize  that  the  longer  an  injunction  or  consent decree stays in place, the greater the risk that it will improp-
erly interfere with a State's democratic processes. The  Court  of  Appeals  purported  to  engage  in  a  "changed 
circumstances"  inquiry,  but  it  asked  only  whether  changed circumstances  affected  ELL  funding  and,  more  specifically, 
ELL  incremental  funding.  Relief  was  appropriate,  in  the court's  view,  only  if  petitioners  "demonstrate[d]  either  that 

5 This  does  not mean, as the  dissent misleadingly suggests, see post, at 
492-493, that we are faulting the Court of Appeals for declining to decide 
whether the District Court's original order was correct in the first place. 
On  the  contrary,  as  we  state  explicitly  in  the  paragraph  following  this 
statement, our criticism is that the Court of Appeals did not engage in the 
changed-circumstances  inquiry  prescribed  by Rufo  v.  Inmates  of  Suffolk 
County Jail, 502 U. S. 367 (1992).  By focusing excessively on the issue of 
incremental  funding,  the  Court  of  Appeals  was  not  true  to  the  Rufo 
standard.

Opinion of the Court 
there  [we]re  no  longer  incremental  costs  associated  with ELL programs in Arizona or that Arizona's `base plus incre-

mental  costs'  educational  funding  model  was  so  altered  that focusing  on  ELL-specific  incremental  costs  funding  has  be-
come irrelevant and inequitable."  516 F. 3d, at 1169. This  was  a  Rule  60(b)(5)  "changed  circumstances"  inquiry 
in name only.  In reality, it was an inquiry into whether the 
deficiency  in  ELL  incremental  funding  that  the  District Court identified in 2000 had been remedied.  And this, effec-

tively,  was  an  inquiry  into  whether  the  original  order  had been satisfied.  Satisfaction of an earlier judgment is 

one of 
the  enumerated  bases  for  Rule  60(b)(5)  relief--but  it  is  not 
the only basis for such relief. 

Rule  60(b)(5)  permits  relief  from  a  judgment  where  "[i] 
the  judgment  has  been  satisfied,  released  or  discharged;  [ii] 
it is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or 
vacated;  or  [iii]  applying  it  prospectively  is  no  longer  equi-
table."  (Emphasis  added.)  Use  of  the  disjunctive  "or" 
makes it  clear  that each  of the  provision's  three grounds for 
relief  is  independently  sufficient  and  therefore  that  relief 
may be warranted even if petitioners have not "satisfied" the 
original  order.  As  petitioners  argue,  they  may  obtain  re-
lief  if  prospective  enforcement  of  that  order  "is  no  longer 
equitable." 

To  determine  the  merits  of  this  claim,  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals  needed  to  ascertain  whether  ongoing  enforcement  of 
the  original  order  was  supported  by  an  ongoing  violation  of 
federal  law  (here,  the  EEOA).  See  Milliken,  433  U. S.,  at 
282.  It failed to do so. 

As  previously  noted,  the  EEOA,  while  requiring  a  State 
to take  "appropriate action  to  overcome language  barriers," 
20  U. S. C. $ 1703(f ),  "leave[s]  state  and local  educational  au-
thorities  a  substantial  amount  of  latitude  in  choosing"  how 
this  obligation  is  met.  Castaneda,  648  F.  2d,  at  1009.  Of 
course,  any educational  program, including  the  "appropriate 
action" mandated by the EEOA, requires funding, but fund-

ing  is  simply  a  means,  not  the  end.  By  focusing  so  inten-sively  on  Arizona's  incremental  ELL  funding,  the  Court  of 

Appeals  misapprehended  the  EEOA's  mandate.  And  by requiring  petitioners  to  demonstrate  "appropriate  action" 
through  a  particular  funding  mechanism,  the  Court  of  Ap-peals  improperly  substituted  its  own  educational  and  bud-
getary  policy  judgments  for  those  of  the  state  and  local officials to whom such decisions are properly entrusted.  Cf.

2064  is  the  same,  the  problems  themselves  are  the  same."6 Id., at 1161.  The District Court thus rested its postremand 

decision  on  its  preremand  analysis  of  HB  2064.  It  disre-garded  the  remand  instructions  to  engage  in  a  broad  and 
flexible Rule 60(b)(5) analysis as to whether changed circum-stances  warranted  relief.  In  taking  this  approach,  the  Dis-
trict Court abused its discretion. 

D 
The  dissent  defends  the  narrow  approach  of  the  lower courts with four principal conclusions that it draws from the 

record.  All of these conclusions, however, are incorrect and mirror the fundamental error of the lower courts--a fixation 
on the issue of incremental funding and a failure to recognize the proper scope of a Rule 60(b)(5) inquiry. 

First,  the  dissent  concludes  that  " the  Rule  60( b)(5) `changes'  upon  which  the  District  Court  focused"  were  not 

6 In  addition  to  concluding  that  the  law's  increase  in  incremental  fund-
ing was insufficient and that 2-year cutoff was irrational, both the District 
Court  and  the  Court  of  Appeals  held  that  HB  2064's  funding  mecha-
nism  violates  NCLB,  which  provides  in  relevant  part:  "A  State  shall  not 
take  into  consideration  payments  under  this  chapter . . . in  determining 
the  eligibility  of  any  local  educational  agency  in  that  State  for  State  aid, 
or  the  amount  of  State  aid,  with  respect  to  free  public  education  of  chil-
dren."  20 U. S. C. $ 7902.  See 480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1166 (HB 2064's fund-
ing mechanism is "absolutely forbidden" by $ 7902); 516 F. 3d, at 1178 ("HB 
2064 . . . violates [$ 7902] on its face").  Whether or not HB 2064 violates 

$ 7902, see Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31-32, and n. 8 (sug-
gesting it  does), neither  court  below  was empowered  to decide  the issue. 
As the Court of Appeals itself recognized, NCLB does not provide a pri-
vate right of action.  See 516 F. 3d, at 1175.  "Without [statutory intent], 
a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter 
how  desirable  that  might  be  as  a  policy  matter,  or  how  compatible  with 
the  statute."  Alexander  v.  Sandoval,  532  U. S.  275,  286-287  (2001). 
Thus, NCLB is enforceable only by the agency charged with administering 
it.  See  id.,  at  289-290;  see  also  App.  to  Brief  for  Respondent  State  of 
Arizona et al. 1-4 (letter from U. S. Department of Education to petitioner 
superintendent concerning the legality vel non of HB 2064).

Opinion of the Court 
limited to changes in funding, and included " `changed teach-ing methods' " and " `changed administrative systems. ' " 

Post, at 483.  The District Court did note a range of changed circumstances,  concluding  that  as  a  result  of  these  changes, 
Nogales  was  "doing  substantially  better."  480  F.  Supp.  2d, at  1160.  But  it  neither  focused  on  these  changes  nor  made 
up-to-date factual findings.  To the contrary, the District 
Court explained that "it would be premature to make an as-sessment of some of these changes." 

Ibid.  Accordingly, of 
the 28 findings of fact that the court proceeded to make, the first 20 addressed funding directly and exclusively.  See 

id., 
at 1161-1163.  The last eight addressed funding indirectly-- 
discussing reclassification rates because of their relevance to 
HB 2064's funding restrictions for  ELL and reclassified stu-
dents.  See  id.,  at  1163-1165.  None  of  the  District  Court's 
findings  of  fact  addressed  either  " `changed  teaching  meth-
ods' " or " `changed administrative systems.' " 

The dissent's second conclusion is that " `incremental fund-
ing'  costs  .  .  .  [were]  the  basic  contested  issue  at  the  2000 
trial  and  the  sole  basis  for  the  District  Court's  finding  of  a 
statutory  violation."  Post,  at  483.  We  fail  to  see  this  con-
clusion's  relevance  to  this  Rule  60(b)(5)  motion,  where  the 
question  is  whether  any  change  in  factual  or  legal  circum-
stances renders continued enforcement of the original  order 
inequitable.  As the  dissent itself acknowledges, petitioners 
"pointed to three sets of changed circumstances [in their 
Rule  60(b)(5)  motion]  which,  in  their  view,  showed  that  the 
judgment and the related orders were no longer necessary." 
Post, at  482.  In addition  to  "increases  in  the amount of 
funding available to Arizona school districts," these included 
"changes in the method of English-learning instruction," and 
"changes in the  administration  of  the Nogales  school  dis-
trict."  Ibid. 

Third,  the  dissent  concludes  that  "the  type  of  issue  upon 
which the District Court and Court of Appeals focused"--the 
incremental funding issue--"lies at the heart of the statutory

Opinion of the Court 
demand for equal educational opportunity."  Post,  at  484. In  what  we  interpret  to  be  a  restatement  of  this  point,  the 

dissent also concludes that sufficient funding ("the `resource' issue")  and  the  presence  or  absence  of  an  EEOA  violation 
(" the statutory subsection ( f )  issue") "are one and the 
same."  Post, at  485  (emphasis in original).  "In focusing upon  the  one,"  the  dissent  asserts,  "the  District  Court  and 

Court of Appeals were focusing upon the other."  Ibid. Contrary  to  the  dissent's  assertion,  these  two  issues  are 
decidedly not "one and the same." 7  Ibid.  Nor is it the  case, as the dissent suggests, that the EEOA targets States' 
provision of resources for ELL programming.8  Post, at 484. 

7 The extent to which the dissent repeats the errors of the courts below 
is evident  in  its statement that "[t]he question here  is whether  the State 
has shown that its new funding program amounts to a `change' that satis-
fies  subsection  (f)'s  requirement."  Post,  at  510  (emphasis  added).  The 
proper  inquiry  is  not  limited  to  the  issue  of  funding.  Rather,  it  encom-
passes  the  question  whether  the  State  has  shown  any  factual  or  legal 
changes that establish compliance with the EEOA. 

8 The  dissent  cites  two  sources  for  this  proposition.  The  first--Cas-

taneda  v.  Pickard,  648  F.  2d  989  (CA5  1981)--sets  out  a  three-part  test 
for  "appropriate  action."  Under  that  test,  a  State  must  (1)  formulate  a 
sound  English  language  instruction  educational  plan,  (2)  implement  that 
plan,  and  (3)  achieve  adequate  results.  See  id.,  at  1009-1010.  Whether 
or  not  this  test  provides  much  concrete  guidance  regarding  the  meaning 
of "appropriate action," the test does not focus on incremental funding or 
on the provision of resources more generally. 

The second source cited by the dissent--curiously--is a speech given by 
President Nixon in which he urged prompt action by Congress on legisla-
tion imposing a moratorium on new busing orders and on the Equal Educa-
tional Opportunities Act  of  1972.  See post, at  484  (citing Address to  the 
Nation on Equal Educational Opportunity and Busing, 8 Weekly Comp. of 
Pres.  Doc.  590,  591  (1972)).  In  the  speech,  President  Nixon  said  that 
schools  in  poor  neighborhoods  should  receive  the  "financial  support  .  .  . 
that we know can make all the difference."  Id., at 593.  It is likely that 
this  statement  had  nothing  to  do  with  the  interpretation  of  the  EEOA's 
"appropriate  action"  requirement  and  instead  referred  to  his  proposal  to 
"direc[t]  over $21/2  billion in  the next year  mainly towards improving the

Opinion of the Court 
What  the  statute  forbids  is  a  failure  to  take  "appropriate action to overcome language barriers."  20 U. S. C. $ 1703(f). 

Funding is merely one tool that may be employed to achieve the statutory objective. 

Fourth,  the  dissent  concludes  that  the  District  Court  did not  order  increased  ELL  incremental  funding  and  did  not 
dictate state and local budget priorities.  Post, at 486.  The dissent's  point--and  it  is  a  very  small  one--is  that  the  Dis-
trict Court did not set a specific amount that the legislature was  required  to  appropriate.  The  District  Court  did,  how-
ever, hold the State in contempt  and impose heavy  fines  be-cause the legislature did not provide  sufficient funding. 
These orders unquestionably imposed important restrictions on the legislature's ability to set budget priorities. 

E 
Because the  lower courts--like  the dissent--misperceived both the nature of the obligation imposed by the EEOA and 

the  breadth  of  the  inquiry  called  for  under  Rule  60(b)(5), these  cases  must  be  remanded  for  a  proper  examination  of 
at  least  four  important  factual  and  legal  changes  that  may warrant the granting of relief from the judgment: the State's 
adoption of a new ELL instructional methodology, Congress' enactment of NCLB, structural and management reforms in 
Nogales, and increased overall education funding. 

1 
At  the  time  of  the  District  Court's  original  declaratory judgment order,  ELL  instruction  in  Nogales  was based pri-

marily  on  "bilingual  education,"  which  teaches  core  content areas in a student's native language while providing English 
instruction  in  separate  language  classes.  In  November 2000,  Arizona  voters  passed  Proposition  203,  which  man-

to  the  enactment  of  the  EEOA,  surely  sheds  little  light  on  the  proper 
interpretation of the statute.

460  HORNE  v.  FLORES 

Opinion of the Court 
dated statewide implementation of a "structured English im-mersion"  (SEI)  approach.  See  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  in 

No. 08-294, at 369a.  Proposition 203  defines this  methodol-ogy as follows: 

" `Sheltered  English  immersion'  or  `structured  English immersion' means an English language acquisition proc-
ess  for  young  children  in  which  nearly  all  classroom  in-struction  is  in  English  but  with  the  curriculum  and 
presentation designed for children who are learning the language. . . .  Although  teachers  may  use  a  minimal 
amount  of  the  child's  native  language  when  necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any language other 
than English, and children in this program learn to read and  write  solely  in  English."  Ariz.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann. 

$ 15-751(5) (West 2009). 
In HB 2064,  the  state  legislature attended  to the  success-ful and uniform implementation of SEI in a variety of ways.

9 

It created an "Arizona English language learners task force" within  the  state  department  of  education  to  "develop  and 

adopt  research  based  models  of  structured  English  immer-si on  programs  for  use  by  school  districts  and  charter 
schools."  $ 15-756.01(C).  It  required  that  all  school  dis-tricts  and  charter  schools  select  one  of  the  adopted  SEI 
models,  $ 15-756.02(A),  and  it  created  an  "Office  of  English language  acquisition  services"  to  aid  school  districts  in 
implementation  of  the  models,  $ 15-756.07(1).  It  also  re-quired  the  state  board  of  education  to  institute  a  uniform 
and  mandatory  training  program  for  all  SEI  instructors. $ 15-756.09. 

Research  on  ELL  instruction  indicates  there  is  docu-mented,  academic  support  for  the  view  that  SEI  is  signifi-

9 By  focusing  on  the  adequacy  of  HB  2064's  funding  provisions,  the 
courts  below  neglected  to  address  adequately  the  potential  relevance  of 
these programming provisions, which became effective immediately upon 
enactment of the law.

Opinion of the Court 
cantly  more  effective  than  bilingual  education.10  Findings of  the  Arizona  State  Department  of  Education  in  2004 

strongly support this conclusion.11  In light of this, a proper analysis  of  petitioners'  Rule  60(b)(5)  motion  should  include 
further  factual  findings  regarding  whether  Nogales'  imple-mentation  of  SEI  methodology--completed  in  all  of  its 
schools by 2005--constitutes a "significantly changed circum-stance" that warrants relief. 

2 
Congress'  enactment  of  NCLB  represents  another  poten-tially  significant  "changed  circumstance."  NCLB  marked  a 

dramatic  shift  in  federal  education  policy.  It  reflects  Con-gress'  judgment  that  the  best  way  to  raise  the  level  of  edu-
cation  nationwide  is  by  granting  state  and  local  officials flexibility  to  develop  and  implement  educational  programs 
that address local needs, while holding them accountable for the  results.  NCLB  implements  this  approach  by  requiring 
States  receiving  federal  funds  to  define  performance  stand-ards  and  to  make  regular  assessments  of  progress  toward 
the  attainment  of  those  standards.  20  U. S. C.  $ 6311(b)(2). NCLB  conditions  the  continued  receipt  of  funds  on  demon-
strations of "adequate yearly progress."  Ibid.

Opinion of the Court 
As  relevant  here,  Title  III  (which  includes  the  English Language  Acquisition,  Language  Enhancement,  and  Aca-

demic Achievement Act) requires States to ensure that ELL students  "attain  English  proficiency,  develop  high  levels  of 
academic attainment in English, and meet the same challeng-ing  State  academic  content  and  student  academic  achieve-
ment  standards  as  all  children  are  expected  to  meet." 

$ 6812(1).  It requires States to set annual objective achieve-ment  goals  for  the  number  of  students  who  will  annually 

progress  toward  proficiency,  achieve  proficiency,  and  make "adequate  yearly  progress"  with  respect  to  academic 
achievement, $ 6842(a), and it holds local schools and agencies accountable for meeting these objectives, $ 6842(b). 

Petitioners  argue  that  through  compliance  with  NCLB, the State has established compliance with the EEOA.  They 
note  that  when  a  State  adopts  a  compliance  plan  under NCLB--as  the  State  of  Arizona  has--it  must  provide  ade-
quate  assurances  that  ELL  students  will  receive  assistance 
"to  achieve  at  high  levels  in  the  core  academic  subjects  so that  those  children  can  meet  the  same  .  .  .  standards  as  all 

children are expected to meet."  $ 6812(2).  They argue that when  the  Federal  Department  of  Education  approves  a 
State's  plan--as  it  has  with  respect  to  Arizona's--it  offers 
definitive evidence that the State has taken "appropriate ac-
tion  to  overcome  language  barriers"  within  the  meaning  of 
the EEOA.  $ 1703(f). 

The  Court  of  Appeals  concluded,  and  we  agree,  that  be-
cause of significant differences in the two statutory schemes, 
compliance  with  NCLB  will  not  necessarily  constitute  "ap-
propriate action" under the EEOA.  516 F. 3d, at 1172-1176. 
Approval of an NCLB plan does not entail substantive review 
of  a  State's  ELL  programming  or  a  determination  that  the 
programming  results  in  equal  educational  opportunity  for 
ELL  students.  See  $ 6823.  Moreover,  NCLB  contains  a 
saving  clause,  which  provides  that  "[n]othing  in  this  part 
shall be construed in a manner inconsistent with any Federal 
law guaranteeing a civil right."  $ 6847.

Opinion of the Court 
This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  NCLB  is  not  relevant to  petitioners'  Rule  60(b)(5)  motion.  To  the  contrary,  we 

think  it  is  probative  in  four  principal  ways.12  First,  it prompted  the  State  to  institute  significant  structural  and 
programming  changes  in  its  delivery  of  ELL  education,13 leading  the  Court  of  Appeals  to  observe  that  "Arizona  has 
significantly  improved  its  ELL  infrastructure."  516  F.  3d, 
at  1154.  These  changes  should  not  be  discounted  in  the 
Rule  60(b)(5)  analysis  solely  because  they  do  not  require  or 
result  from  increased  funding.  Second,  NCLB  significantly 
increased  federal  funding  for  education  in  general  and  ELL 
programming in particular.14  These funds should not be dis-
regarded  just  because  they  are  not  state  funds.  Third, 
through  its  assessment  and  reporting  requirements,  NCLB 

12 Although  the  dissent  contends  that  the  sole  argument  raised  below 
regarding  NCLB  was  that  compliance  with  that  Act  necessarily  consti-
tuted  compliance  with  the  EEOA,  the  Court  of  Appeals  recognized  that 
NCLB is a relevant factor that should be considered under Rule 60(b)(5). 
It  acknowledged  that  compliance  with  NCLB  is  at  least  "somewhat  pro-
bative"  of  compliance  with  the  EEOA.  516  F.  3d,  at  1175,  n.  46.  The 
United States, in its brief as amicus curiae supporting respondents, simi-
larly observed that, "[e]ven though Title III participation is not a complete 
defense under the EEOA, whether a State is reaching its own goals under 
Title  III  may  be  relevant  in  an  EEOA  suit."  Brief  for  United  States 
24.  And  the  District  Court  noted  that,  "[b]y  increasing  the  standards 
of  accountability,  [NCLB] has  to  some  extent significantly  changed  State 
educators  approach  to  educating  students  in  Arizona."  Flores  v.  Ari-
zona, 480 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1160-1161 (Ariz. 2007). 

13 Among other  things,  the state department of  education  formulated  a 

compliance  plan,  approved  by  the  U.  S.  Department  of  Education.  The 
state  board  of  education  promulgated  statewide  ELL  proficiency  stand-
ards,  adopted  uniform  assessment  standards,  and  initiated  programs  for 
monitoring  school  districts  and  training  structured  English  immersion 
teachers.  See  516  F.  3d,  at  1154;  see  also  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner 
Superintendent 29-31. 

14 See Brief for Petitioner Superintendent 22, n. 13 ("At [Nogales], Title

Fourth  and  finally,  NCLB  marks  a  shift  in  federal  edu-cation  policy.  See  Brief  for  Petitioner  Speaker  of  the  Ari-

zona  House  of  Representatives  et  al.  7-16.  NCLB  grants States  "flexibility"  to  adopt ELL  programs  they  believe  are 
"most  effective  for  teaching  English."  $ 6812(9).  Reflect-ing a growing consensus in education research that increased 
funding alone does not improve student achievement,17 

15 See, e. g., App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-289, pp. 310-311 (2005-2006 
testing  data  for  ELL  students,  reclassified  ELL  students,  and  non-ELL 
students  on  statewide achievement  tests);  id.,  at  312 (2005-2006  data  re-
garding  Nogales'  achievement  of  the  State's  annual  measurable  account-
ability objectives for ELL students). 

16 The  Court  of  Appeals  interpreted  the  testing  data  in  the  record  to 

weigh against a finding of effective programming in Nogales.  See 516 F. 
3d, at 1157 (noting that "[t]he limits of [Nogales'] progress . . . are apparent 
in  the  AIMS  test  results  and  reclassification  test  results");  id.,  at  1169- 
1170  (citing  "the  persistent  achievement  gaps  documented  in  [Nogales'] 
AIMS test data" between ELL students and native speakers).  We do not 
think  the  District  Court  made  sufficient  factual  findings  to  support  its 
conclusions about the effectiveness of Nogales' ELL programming, and we 
question the Court of Appeals' interpretation of the data for three reasons. 
First, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the absence of longitudinal data 
in  the  record  precludes  useful  comparisons.  See  id.,  at  1155.  Second, 
the  AIMS  tests--the  statewide  achievement  tests  on  which  the  Court  of 
Appeals primarily relied and to which the dissent cites in Appendix A of 
its  opinion--are administered  in  English.  It  is inevitable  that ELL  stu-
dents (who, by definition, are not yet proficient in English) will underper-
form  as  compared  to  native  speakers.  Third,  the  negative  data  that  the 
Court of Appeals highlights is balanced by positive data.  See, e. g., App. 
97  (reporting  that  for  the  2005-2006  school  year,  on  average,  reclassified 
students did as well as, if not better than, native English speakers on the 
AIMS tests).

Opinion of the Court 
NCLB expressly refrains from dictating funding levels.  In-stead,  it  focuses  on  the  demonstrated  progress  of  students 

through  accountability  reforms.18  The  original  declaratory judgment order, in contrast, withdraws the authority of state 
and local officials to fund and implement ELL programs that best  suit  Nogales'  needs,  and  measures  effective  program-
ming solely in terms of adequate incremental funding.  This 
conflict  with  Congress'  determination  of  federal  policy  may constitute  a  significantly  changed  circumstance,  warranting 

relief.  See Railway Employees v.  Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 651 (1961)  (noting  that  a  court  decree  should  be  modified  when 
"a  change  in  law  brings  [the  decree]  in  conflict  with  statu-

Opinion of the Court 
were  led  by  Kelt  Cooper,  the  Nogales  superintendent  from 
2000 to 2005, who "adopted policies that ameliorated or elimi-
nated  many  of  the  most  glaring  inadequacies  discussed 
by  the  district  court."  516  F.  3d,  at  1156.  Among  other 
things,  Cooper  "reduce[d]  class  sizes,"  "significantly  im-
prov[ed] student/teacher ratios," "improved teacher quality," 
"pioneered  a  uniform  system  of  textbook  and  curriculum 
planning,"  and  "largely  eliminated  what  had  been  a  severe 
shortage  of  instructional  materials."  Id.,  at  1156-1157. 
The  Court  of  Appeals  recognized  that  by  "[u]sing  careful  fi-
nancial  management  and  applying  for  `all  funds  available,' 
Cooper  was  able  to  achieve  his  reforms  with  limited  re-
sources."  Id.,  at  1157.  But  the  Court  of  Appeals  missed 
the  legal  import  of  this  observation--that  these  reforms 
might have brought Nogales' ELL programming into compli-
ance with the EEOA even without sufficient ELL incremen-
tal funding to satisfy the District Court's original order.  In-
stead, the Court of Appeals concluded that to credit Cooper's 
reforms  would  "penaliz[e]"  Nogales  "for  doing  its  best  to 
make do,  despite  Arizona's  failure to  comply with  the  terms 
of the judgment," and would "absolve the state from provid-
ing  adequate  ELL  incremental  funding  as  required  by  the 
judgment."  Id.,  at  1168.  The  District  Court  similarly  dis-
counted Cooper's achievements, acknowledging that Nogales 
was "doing substantially better than it was in 2000," but con-
cluding that because the progress resulted from management 
efforts  rather  than  increased  funding,  its  progress  was 
"fleeting at best."  480 F. Supp. 2d, at 1160. 

Entrenched in the framework of incremental funding, both 
courts refused to consider that Nogales could be taking "ap-
propriate action" to address language barriers even without 
having  satisfied  the  original  order.  This  was  error.  The 
EEOA  seeks  to  provide  "equal  educational  opportunity"  to 
"all children enrolled in public schools."  $ 1701(a).  Its ulti-
mate focus is on the quality of educational programming and

Opinion of the Court 
services  provided  to  students,  not  the  amount  of  money spent  on  them.  Accordingly,  there  is  no  statutory  basis 

for  precluding  petitioners  from  showing  that  Nogales  has achieved  EEOA-compliant  programming  by  means  other 

than increased funding--for example, through Cooper's struc-tural,  curricular,  and  accountability-based  reforms.  The 
weight  of  research  suggests  that  these  types  of  local  re-forms,  much  more  than  court-imposed  funding  mandates, 
lead  to  improved  educational  opportunities.19  Cooper  even testified  that,  without  the  structural  changes  he  imposed, 
"additional  money"  would  not  "have  made  any  difference  to th[e]  students"  in  Nogales.  Addendum  to  Reply  Brief  for 
Petitioner  Speaker  of  the  Arizona  House  of  Representa-tives et al. 15. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  discounted  Cooper's  reforms  for other  reasons  as  well.  It  explained  that  while  they  "did 
ameliorate  many  of  the  specific  examples  of  resource  short-ages  that  the  district  court  identified  in  2000,"  they  did  not 
"result  in  such  success  as  to  call  into  serious  question  [No-gales'] need for increased incremental funds."  516 F. 3d, at 
1169.  Among other things, the Court of Appeals referred to "the  persistent  achievement  gaps  documented  in  [Nogales'] 
AIMS  test  data"  between  ELL  students  and  native  speak-ers,  id.,  at  1170,  but  any  such  comparison  must  take  into 
account  other  variables  that  may  explain  the  gap.  In  any event,  the  EEOA  requires  "appropriate  action"  to  remove 
language  barriers,  $ 1703(f ),  not  the  equalization  of  results between  native  and  nonnative  speakers  on  tests  adminis-
tered  in  English--a  worthy  goal,  to  be  sure,  but  one  that may  be  exceedingly  difficult  to  achieve,  especially  for  older 
ELL students.

Opinion of the Court 
The Court of Appeals also referred to the subpar perform-ance  of  Nogales'  high  schools.  There  is  no  doubt  that  No-

gales'  high  schools  represent  an  area  of  weakness,  but  the District  Court  made  insufficient  factual  findings  to  support 
a conclusion that the high schools' problems stem from a fail-ure  to  take  "appropriate  action,"  and  constitute  a  violation 
of the EEOA.20 The EEOA's "appropriate action" requirement grants 
States  broad  latitude  to  design,  fund,  and  implement  ELL programs  that  suit  local  needs  and  account  for  local  condi-
tions.  A  proper Rule  60(b)(5)  inquiry should recognize this and  should  ask  whether,  as  a  result  of structural  and  mana-
gerial improvements, Nogales is now providing equal educa-tional opportunities to ELL students. 

4 
A  fourth  potentially  important  change  is  an  overall  in-crease  in  the  education  funding  available  in  Nogales.  The 

original  declaratory  judgment  order  noted  five  sources  of funding  that  collectively  financed  education  in  the  State:

20 There  are  many  possible  causes  for  the  performance  of  students  in 
Nogales'  high  school  ELL  programs.  These  include  the  difficulty  of 
teaching English to older students (many of whom, presumably, were not 
in  English-speaking  schools  as  younger  students)  and  problems  such  as 
drug  use  and  the  prevalence  of  gangs.  See  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioner 
Speaker of the Arizona House of Representatives et al. 14-15; Reply Brief 
for  Petitioner  Superintendent  16-17;  App.  116-118.  We  note  that  no 
court has made particularized findings as to the effectiveness of ELL pro-
gramming offered at Nogales' high schools. 

21 The  Court  of  Appeals  reported,  and  it  is  not  disputed,  that  "[o]n  an 

inflation-adjusted statewide basis, including all sources of funding, support 
for education has increased from $3,139 per pupil in 2000 to an estimated

Opinion of the Court 
ing  these  increases,  the  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  petition-
ers' claim that overall education funds were sufficient to sup-
port  EEOA-compliant programming  in Nogales.  The  court 
reasoned  that  diverting  base-level  education  funds  would 
necessarily  hurt  other  state  educational  programs,  and  was 
not,  therefore,  an  " `appropriate'  step."  516  F.  3d,  at  1171. 
In so doing, it foreclosed the possibility that petitioners could 
establish  changed  circumstances  warranting  relief  through 
an overall increase in education funding available in Nogales. 

This was clear legal error.  As we have noted, the EEOA's 
"appropriate  action"  requirement  does  not  necessarily  re-
quire  any  particular  level  of  funding,  and  to  the  extent  that 
funding  is  relevant,  the  EEOA  certainly  does  not  require 
that  the  money  come  from  any  particular  source.  In  addi-
tion,  the  EEOA  plainly  does  not  give  the  federal  courts  the 
authority  to  judge  whether  a  State  or  a  school  district  is 
providing "appropriate" instruction in other subjects.  That 
remains the province of the States and the local schools.  It 
is  unfortunate  if  a  school,  in  order  to  fund  ELL  programs, 
must  divert  money  from  other  worthwhile  programs,  but 
such decisions fall outside the scope of the EEOA.  Accord-
ingly, the analysis of petitioners' Rule 60(b)(5) motion should 
evaluate  whether  the  State's  budget  for  general  education 
funding, in addition to any local revenues,22  is currently sup-
porting EEOA-compliant ELL programming in Nogales. 

Because  the  lower  courts  engaged  in  an  inadequate  Rule 
60(b)(5)  analysis,  and  because  the  District  Court  failed  to 
make  up-to-date  factual  findings,  the  analysis  of  the  lower 

$3,570 per pupil in 2006.  Adding in all county and local sources, funding 
has gone from $5,677 per pupil in 2000 to an estimated $6,412 per pupil in 
2006.  Finally,  federal  funding  has  increased.  In  2000,  the  federal  gov-
ernment  provided  an  additional  $526  per  pupil;  in  2006,  it  provided  an 
estimated $953."  516 F. 3d, at 1155. 

22 Each year since 2000, Nogales voters have passed an override.  Reve-

nues  from  Nogales'  override  have  increased  from  $895,891  in  2001  to 
$1,674,407 in 2007.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-294, p. 431a.

Opinion of the Court 
courts  was  incomplete  and  inadequate  with  respect  to  all  of the  changed  circumstances  just  noted.  These  changes  are 

critical  to  a  proper  Rule  60(b)(5)  analysis,  however,  as  they may  establish  that  Nogales  is  no  longer  in  violation  of  the 
EEOA and, to the contrary, is taking "appropriate action" to remove language  barriers  in its  schools.  If  this  is  the  case, 
continued enforcement of the  District Court's  original order is inequitable within the meaning of Rule 60(b)(5), and relief 
is warranted.  IV 

We turn, finally, to the District Court's entry of statewide relief.

23  The  Nogales  district,  which  is  situated  along  the 

Mexican  border,  is  one  of  239  school  districts  in  the  State of  Arizona.  Nogales  students  make  up  about  one-half  of  1 

percent of the entire State's school population.24  The record contains  no  factual  findings  or  evidence  that  any  school  dis-
trict  other  than  Nogales  failed  (much  less  continues  to  fail) to provide equal educational opportunities to ELL students. 
See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 08-294, at 177a-178a.  Nor have  respondents  explained  how  the  EEOA  could  justify  a 
statewide  injunction  when  the  only  violation  claimed  or 

23 The dissent contends that this issue was not raised below, but what is 
important  for  present  purposes  is  that,  for  the  reasons  explained  in  the 
previous parts  of  this  opinion,  these cases  must  be remanded  to  the Dis-
trict Court for a proper Rule 60(b)(5) analysis.  Petitioners made it clear 
at oral argument that they wish to argue that the extension of the remedy 
to  districts  other  than  Nogales  should  be  vacated.  See  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg. 
63  ("Here  the  EEOA  has  been  transmogrified  to  apply  statewide.  That 
has  not  been  done  before.  It  should  not  have  been  done  in  the  first  in-
stance  but  certainly  in  light  of  the  changed  circumstances");  see  also  id., 
at  17-18,  21,  26.  Accordingly,  if  petitioners  raise  that  argument  on  re-
mand, the District Court must consider whether there is any legal or fac-
tual basis for denying that relief.

Opinion of the Court 
proved  was  limited  to  a  single  district.  See  Jenkins,  515 U. S.,  at  89-90; 

Milliken,  433  U. S.,  at  280.  It  is  not  even 
clear that the District Court had jurisdiction to issue a state-wide  injunction  when  it  is  not  apparent  that  plaintiffs--a 

class of Nogales students and their parents--had standing to seek such relief. 

The  only  explanation  proffered  for  the  entry  of  statewide rel

ief  was based on  an  interpretation  of the  Arizona  Consti-tution.  We  are  told  that  the  former  attorney  general  "af-

firmatively  urged  a  statewide  remedy  because  a  `Nogales only'  remedy  would  run  afoul  of  the  Arizona  Constitu-
tion's  requirement  of  `a  general  and  uniform  public  school 
system.' "  Brief  for  Respondent  Flores  et  al.  38  (quoting 
Ariz.  Const.,  Art.  11,  $ 1(A);  some  internal  quotation  marks 
omitted). 

This  concern  did  not  provide  a valid  basis for  a  statewide 
federal  injunction.  If  the  state  attorney  general  believed 
that  a  federal  injunction  requiring  increased  ELL  spending 
in one district necessitated, as a matter of state law, a similar 
increase  in  every  other  district  in  the  State,  the  attorney 
general could have  taken  the matter to  the state legislature 
or the state courts.  But the attorney general did not do so. 
Even  if  she  had,  it  is  not  clear  what  the  result  would  have 
been.  It  is  a  question  of  state  law,  to  be  determined  by 
state authorities, whether the equal funding provision of the 
Arizona  Constitution  would  require  a  statewide  funding 

increase  to  match  Nogales'  ELL  funding,  or  would  leave 
Nogales  as  a  federally  compelled  exception.  By  failing  to 
recognize  this,  and  by  entering  a  statewide  injunction  that 
intruded  deeply  into  the  State's  budgetary  processes  based 
solely  on  the  attorney  general's  interpretation  of  state  law, 
the  District  Court  obscured  accountability  for  the  drastic 
remedy that it entered. 

When  it  is  unclear  whether  an  onerous  obligation  is  the 
work  of  the  Federal  or  State  Government,  accountability  is 
diminished.  See  New  York  v.  United  States,  505  U.  S.  144,

Because  such  a  lawsuit  is  not  an  exercise  of  "visitorial  powers,"  the 
Comptroller  erred  by  extending  that  term  to  include  "prosecuting  en-
forcement actions" in state courts.  In this case, the Attorney General's 
threatened  action was  not  the bringing  of  a  civil  suit,  or  the  obtaining 
of  a  judicial  search  warrant  based  on  probable  cause,  but  the  issuance 
of subpoena on his own authority if his request for information was not 
voluntarily  honored.  That  is  not  the  exercise  of  the  law-enforcement 
power  "vested  in  the  courts  of  justice,"  which  the  NBA  exempts  from 
the  ban  on  the  exercise  of  supervisory  power.  Accordingly,  the  in-
junction  below  is  affirmed as  applied  to  the  Attorney General's  threat-
ened  issuance of executive  subpoenas, but vacated insofar  as it prohib-
its  the  Attorney  General  from  bringing  judicial  enforcement  actions.

Opinion of the Court 
On a pragmatic level, the difference between visitation and law  enforcement  is  clear.  If  a  State  chooses  to  pursue  en-

forcement  of  its  laws  in  court,  then  it  is  not  exercising  its power  of  visitation  and  will  be  treated  like  a  litigant.  An 
attorney general acting as a civil litigant must file a lawsuit, survive  a  motion  to  dismiss,  endure  the  rules  of  procedure 
and  discovery,  and  risk  sanctions  if  his  claim  is  frivolous  or his discovery tactics abusive.  Judges are trusted to prevent

lieutenants  in  the  Department.  At  every  stage  of  the  job analyses,  IOS,  by  deliberate  choice,  oversampled  minority 

firefighters  to  ensure  that  the  results--which  IOS  would use  to  develop  the  examinations--would  not  unintentionally 
favor white candidates. With  the  job-analysis  information  in  hand,  IOS  developed 
the  written  examinations  to  measure  the  candidates'  job-
related  knowledge.  For  each  test,  IOS  compiled  a  list  of training manuals, Department procedures, and other materi-

als  to  use  as  sources  for  the  test  questions.  IOS  presented the proposed sources to the New Haven fire chief and assist-
ant  fire  chief  for  their  approval.  Then,  using  the  approved 
sources, IOS drafted a multiple-choice test for each position. 
Each  test  had  100  questions,  as  required  by  CSB  rules,  and 
was  written  below  a  10th-grade  reading  level.  After  IOS 
prepared the tests, the City opened a 3-month study period. 
It  gave  candidates  a  list  that  identified  the  source  material 
for the questions, including the specific chapters from which 
the questions were taken. 

IOS developed the oral examinations as well.  These con-
centrated on job skills and abilities.  Using the job-analysis 
information, IOS wrote hypothetical situations to test 
incident-command  skills,  firefighting  tactics,  interpersonal 
skills,  leadership,  and  management  ability,  among  other 
things.  Candidates  would  be  presented  with  these  hypo-
theticals  and  asked  to  respond  before  a  panel  of  three 
assessors. 

IOS assembled a pool of 30 assessors who were superior in 
rank  to  the  positions  being  tested.  At  the  City's  insistence 
(because of controversy surrounding previous examinations), 
all  the  assessors  came  from  outside  Connecticut.  IOS  sub-
mitted  the  assessors'  resumes  to  City  officials  for  approval. 
They  were battalion  chiefs,  assistant  chiefs,  and chiefs  from 
departments of similar sizes to New Haven's throughout the 
country.  Sixty-six percent  of the panelists were minorities, 
and  each  of  the  nine  three-member  assessment  panels  con-

Several  days  after  the  meeting,  Ude  sent  a  letter  to  the CSB  purporting  to  outline  its  duties  with  respect  to  the 
examination  results.  Ude  stated  that  under  federal  law, "a  statistical  demonstration  of  disparate  impact,"  standing 
alone,  "constitutes  a  sufficiently  serious  claim  of  racial  dis-crimination  to  serve  as  a  predicate  for  employer-initiated, 
voluntar[y]  remedies--even  .  .  .  race-conscious  remedies." App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  in  No.  07-1428,  p.  443a;  see  also  554

The  CSB  first  met  to  consider  certifying  the  results  on January  22,  2004.  Tina  Burgett,  director  of  the  City's  De-

these two exams."  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 07-1428, at 466a.  She  distributed  lists  showing  the  candidates'  races

At  a  third  meeting,  on  February  11,  Legel  addressed  the CSB on behalf of IOS.  Legel stated that IOS had previously 

prepared  entry-level  firefighter  examinations  for  the  City but  not  a  promotional  examination.  He  explained  that  IOS 
had developed examinations for departments in communities with demographics similar to New Haven's, including Orange 
County, Florida; Lansing, Michigan; and San Jose, California. Legel  explained  the  exam-development  process  to  the 
CSB.  He  began  by  describing  the  job  analyses  IOS  per-formed  of  the  captain  and  lieutenant  positions--the  inter-
views, ride-alongs, and questionnaires IOS designed to "gen-erate  a  list  of  tasks,  knowledge,  skills  and  abilities  that  are 
considered  essential  to  performance"  of  the  jobs.  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 
Petitioners sued the City, Mayor DeStefano, DuBois-Walton, Ude, Burgett, and the two CSB members who voted 

against certification.  Petitioners also named as a defendant Boise Kimber, a New  Haven resident who  voiced strong  op-
position to certifying the  results.  Those individuals are re-spondents  in  this  Court.  Petitioners  filed  suit  under  Rev. 
Stat.  $$ 1979  and  1980,  42  U. S. C.  $$ 1983  and  1985,  alleging 
that respondents, by arguing or voting against certifying the results,  violated  and  conspired  to  violate  the  Equal  Protec-

tion Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Petitioners also filed  timely  charges  of  discrimination  with  the  Equal  Em-
ployment  Opportunity  Commission  (EEOC);  upon  the 
EEOC's  issuing  right-to-sue  letters,  petitioners  amended 
their  complaint  to  assert  that  the  City  violated  the 
disparate-treatment prohibition contained in Title VII of the 
Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  as  amended.  See  42  U. S. C. 

$ 2000e-2(a). 

The  parties  filed  cross-motions  for  summary  judgment. 
Respondents asserted  they had  a  good-faith belief  that they 
would have violated the disparate-impact prohibition in Title 
VII, $ 2000e-2(k), had they certified the examination results. 
It  follows,  they  maintained,  that  they  cannot  be  held  liable 
under Title VII's disparate-treatment provision for attempt-
ing  to  comply  with  Title  VII's  disparate-impact  bar.  Peti-
tioners countered that respondents' good-faith belief was not 
a valid defense to allegations of disparate treatment and un-
constitutional discrimination. 

The  District  Court  granted  summary  judgment  for  re-
spondents.  554  F.  Supp.  2d  142.  It  described  petitioners' 
argument as "boil[ing] down to the assertion that if [respond-
ents] cannot prove that the disparities on the Lieutenant and 
Captain  exams  were  due  to  a  particular  flaw  inherent  in 
those exams,  then  they should  have  certified the  results be-
cause  there  was  no  other  alternative  in  place."  Id.,

the  successful  candidates,  it  discriminated  against  them  in violation  of  Title  VII's  disparate-treatment  provision.  The 

City  counters  that  its  decision  was  permissible  because  the tests "appear[ed] to violate Title VII's disparate-impact pro-
visions."  Brief for Respondents 12. Our  analysis  begins  with  this  premise:  The  City's  actions 
would  violate  the  disparate-treatment  prohibition  of  Title 
VII  absent  some  valid  defense.  All  the  evidence  demon-strates  that  the  City  chose  not  to  certify  the  examination

Opinion of the Court 
Nor  do  we  question  an  employer's  affirmative  efforts  to ensure  that  all  groups  have  a  fair  opportunity  to  apply  for 

promotions and to participate in the process by which promo-tions  will  be  made.  But  once  that  process  has  been  estab-
lished and employers have made clear their selection criteria, they may not then invalidate the test results, thus upsetting 
an employee's legitimate expectation not to be judged on the basis of race.  Doing so, absent a strong basis in evidence of 
an  impermissible  disparate  impact,  amounts  to  the  sort  of racial preference that Congress has  disclaimed, $ 2000e-2( j), 
and is antithetical to the notion of a workplace where individ-uals are guaranteed equal opportunity regardless of race. 

Title  VII does  not prohibit an employer from considering, before  administering  a  test  or  practice,  how  to  design  that 
test or practice in order to provide a fair opportunity for all individuals, regardless of their  race.  And when,  during the 
test-design  stage,  an  employer  invites  comments  to  ensure the  test  is  fair,  that  process  can  provide  a  common  ground 
for  open  discussions  toward  that  end.  We  hold  only  that, under  Title  VII,  before  an  employer  can  engage  in  inten-
tional discrimination for the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying  an  unintentional  disparate  impact,  the  employer 
must  have  a  strong  basis  in  evidence  to  believe  it  will  be subject  to  disparate-impact  liability  if  it  fails  to  take  the 
race-conscious, discriminatory action. 

C 
The  City  argues  that,  even  under  the  strong-basis-in-evidence  standard,  its  decision  to  discard  the  examination 

results  was  permissible  under  Title  VII.  That  is  incorrect. Even  if  respondents  were  motivated  as  a  subjective  matter 
by a desire to avoid committing disparate-impact discrimina-tion, the  record makes  clear there  is no  support for  the con-
clusion  that  respondents  had  an  objective,  strong  basis  in evidence  to find the  tests  inadequate, with some consequent 
disparate-impact liability in violation of Title VII.

Opinion of the Court 
The  City,  moreover,  turned  a  blind  eye  to  evidence  that supported the exams' validity.  Although the City's contract 

with  IOS  contemplated  that  IOS  would  prepare  a  technical report  consistent  with  EEOC  guidelines  for  examination-
validity  studies,  the  City  made  no  request  for  its  report. After the January 2004 meeting between Legel and some of 
the  City-official  respondents,  in  which  Legel  defended  the examinations,  the  City  sought  no  further  information  from 
IOS,  save  its  appearance  at  a  CSB  meeting  to  explain  how it developed and administered the examinations.  IOS stood 
ready  to  provide  respondents  with  detailed  information  to establish  the  validity  of  the  exams,  but  respondents  did  not 
accept that offer.  2 

Respondents  also  lacked  a  strong  basis  in  evidence  of  an equally valid, less discriminatory testing alternative that the 
City,  by  certifying  the  examination  results,  would  necessar-ily  have  refused  to  adopt.  Respondents  raise  three  argu-
ments  to  the  contrary,  but  each  argument  fails.  First,  re-spondents refer to testimony before the CSB that a different 
composite-score calculation--weighting  the  written  and oral examination  scores  30/70--would  have  allowed  the  City  to 
consider  two black  candidates  for then-open  lieutenant  posi-tions and one black candidate for then-open captain positions. 
(The City used a 60/40 weighting as required by its contract with  the  New  Haven  firefighters'  union.)  But  respondents 
have produced no evidence to show that the 60/40 weighting was indeed arbitrary.  In fact, because that formula was the 
result of a union-negotiated collective-bargaining agreement, we  presume  the  parties  negotiated  that  weighting  for  a  ra-
tional  reason.  Nor  does  the  record  contain  any  evidence that  the  30/70  weighting  would  be  an  equally  valid  way 
to  determine  whether  candidates  possess  the  proper  mix  of job  knowledge  and  situational  skills  to  earn  promotions. 
Changing  the weighting  formula,  moreover,  could well  have violated Title VII's prohibition of altering test scores on the

Third, and finally, respondents refer to statements by Hor-nick  in  his  telephone  interview  with  the  CSB  regarding  al-

ternatives  to  the  written  examinations.  Hornick  stated  his "belie[f]"  that  an  "assessment  center  process,"  which  would 
have  evaluated  candidates'  behavior  in  typical  job  tasks, "would  have  demonstrated  less  adverse  impac[t]."  CA2 
App.  A1039.  But  Hornick's  brief  mention  of  alternative 
testing  methods,  standing  alone,  does  not  raise  a  genuine issue of material fact that assessment centers were available 

to  the  City  at  the  time  of  the  examinations  and  that  they would  have  produced  less  adverse  impact.  Other  state-

Opinion of the Court 
spondents  thought  about  promotion  qualifications  and  rele-
vant  experience  in  neutral  ways.  They  were  careful  to  en-
sure broad racial participation in the design of the test itself 
and its administration.  As we have discussed at length, the 
process was open and fair. 

The  problem,  of  course,  is  that  after  the  tests  were  com-
pleted,  the  raw  racial  results  became  the  predominant  ra-
tionale  for  the  City's  refusal  to  certify  the  results.  The  in-
jury arises in part from the high, and justified, expectations 
of the candidates who had participated in the testing process 
on  the  terms  the  City  had  established  for  the  promotional 
process.  Many of the candidates had studied for months, at 
considerable personal and financial expense, and thus the in-
jury  caused  by  the  City's  reliance  on  raw  racial  statistics  at 
the end of the process was all the more severe.  Confronted 
with  arguments  both  for  and  against  certifying  the  test 
results--and  threats  of  a  lawsuit  either  way--the  City  was 
required  to  make  a  difficult  inquiry.  But  its  hearings 
produced no strong evidence of a disparate-impact violation, 
and  the  City  was  not  entitled  to  disregard  the  tests  based 
solely on the racial disparity in the results. 

Our holding today clarifies how Title VII applies to resolve 
competing  expectations  under  the  disparate-treatment  and 
disparate-impact provisions.  If, after it certifies the test re-
sults,  the  City  faces  a  disparate-impact  suit,  then  in  light  of 
our holding today it should be clear that the City would avoid 
disparate-impact  liability  based  on  the  strong  basis  in  evi-
dence  that,  had  it  not  certified  the  results,  it  would  have 
been subject to disparate-treatment liability. 

Petitioners  are  entitled  to  summary  judgment  on  their 
Title VII claim, and we therefore need not decide the under-
lying constitutional question.  The judgment of the Court of 
Appeals is reversed, and the cases are remanded for further 
proceedings consistent with this opinion.

persuade the District Court, cannot (as far as anyone knows) form the basis for any relief.  I truly do not see how the District Court 
can discern what is expected of it.  If this Court thinks it possible that  capital  convictions  obtained  in  full  compliance  with  law  can 
never be final, but are always subject to being set aside by federal courts  for  the reason  of "actual  innocence,"  it  should set  this case 
on  our  own  docket  so  that  we  can  (if  necessary)  resolve  that question.  Sending  it  to  a  district  court  that  "might"  be  author-
ized to  provide  relief, but then again  "might" be reversed if  it did so,  is  not  a  sensible  way  to  proceed.

Opinion in Chambers 
vote  to  grant  a  petition  for  certiorari  to  decide  this  case,  or that there is  a fair prospect that this  Court  will reverse the 

decision  below.  The  remaining  factors  weigh  respondent's liberty  interest  in  release  against  the  Commonwealth's  in-
terests  in  continuing  custody  and  preventing  respondent's flight,  as  well  as  the  interest  in  preventing  danger  to  the 
public.  The Commonwealth's interest in continuing custody is strong given that respondent has a lengthy remaining sen-
tence  extending  to  2050.  However,  the  Commonwealth  has made no showing that he poses an especial flight risk or dan-
ger  to  the  public.  Respondent's  liberty  interest  in  release is  particularly  substantial  given  that  it  is  not  reasonably 
likely  that  this  Court  would  grant  a  petition  for  certiorari filed by the Commonwealth.  In sum, principally because of 
the  unlikelihood  that  certiorari  will  be  granted  in  this  case, I do not find that the presumption in favor of release is over-
come  by  the  traditional  stay  factors.  I  will  therefore  deny the Commonwealth's application for a stay. 

I  will,  however,  order  imposition  of  bail  and  other  condi-tions of release to be determined by the District Court.  As 
I  have  said,  the  parties  agree  as  to  eight  of  the  Common-wealth's  proposed  conditions  of  release.  The  bail  imposed 
must be a practicable amount that respondent can reasonably be expected to raise.  Absent further order from this Court 
or  the  undersigned,  the  conditions  and  bail  determined  by the  District  Court  shall  remain  in  effect  until  the  deadline 
for  filing  a  petition  for  certiorari  has  passed  or,  if  such  a petition  is  filed,  until  final  resolution  of  the  case  by  this 
Court.  See this Court's Rule 36.4. Accordingly, the application for a stay is denied.  The stay 
issued on August 24, 2009, is hereby vacated.
