CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 2001

DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTI et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 01-417. Argued March 26, 2002--Decided June 10, 2002
Petitioner retiree participates in a defined benefits pension plan (Plan)

that was amended in 1991 to add a cost of living increase (COLA).
Because the Plan could not support such a large benefits increase, its
trustees ultimately eliminated the COLA in 1997 and filed a class action
in the Maryland Federal District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the 1997 amendment was binding on all Plan members or that
the 1991 COLA was void. Petitioner's separate challenge to the 1997
amendment was dismissed by a New York Federal District Court, which
found that the Maryland court should resolve the matter. By this time,
the Maryland court had already conditionally certified a class under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1). After the trustees asked the
court to approve their settlement with the class representatives, petitioner moved to intervene. The District Court denied his motion
as untimely. It then heard objections to the settlement, including

those advanced by petitioner, and approved the settlement. Petitioner
appealed. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's denial of
intervention and held that, because petitioner was not a named class
representative and because he had been properly denied the right to
intervene, he lacked standing to challenge the settlement.

Held: Nonnamed class members like petitioner who have objected in a

timely manner to approval of a settlement at a fairness hearing have
the power to bring an appeal without first intervening. Pp. 6-14.

2 DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTI

Syllabus
(a) This issue, though framed by the Fourth Circuit as one of standing, does not implicate the jurisdiction of the courts, as petitioner satisfies both constitutional and prudential standing requirements. What is
at issue is whether petitioner is a "party" for purposes of appealing the
settlement approval, for only a lawsuit's parties, or those that properly
become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment. This Court has
never restricted the right to appeal to named parties. Petitioner's
interest in the settlement approval is similar to those of the nonnamed
parties this Court has allowed to appeal in the past. He objected to the
settlement at the fairness hearing, as permitted by the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure. And the settlement's approval notwithstanding his
objections amounted to a final decision of his right or claim sufficient
to trigger his right to appeal. That right cannot be effectively accomplished through the named class representative--once the named parties reach a settlement that is approved over the petitioner's objections,
petitioner's interests diverge from those of the class representative.
Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U. S. 301, in which white police officers who were
not members of the class of minority officers who had brought a racial
discrimination suit were not allowed to appeal the settlement, is not to
the contrary. Although the settlement affected them, the District
Court's decision did not dispose of any right or claim they might have
had because they were not class members. Nor does considering nonnamed class members as parties for the purpose of bringing an appeal
conflict with any other aspect of class action procedure. Such members
may be parties for some purposes and not for others. What is important here is that they are parties in the sense of being bound by the
settlement. Allowing them to appeal a settlement approval when they
have objected at the fairness hearing preserves their own interests in a
settlement that will bind them, despite their expressed objections before the trial court. Allowing such appeals will not undermine the class
action goal of preventing multiple suits. Restricting the power to appeal to those members who objected at the fairness hearing limits the
class of potential appellants considerably. Pp. 6-11.

(b) This Court rejects the Government's argument that class members should be required to intervene for purposes of appeal. Nor does
the Court agree with the Government that the structure of class action
procedural rules requires intervention for purposes of appeal. A procedure that allows nonnamed class members to object to a settlement at
the fairness hearing without first intervening should similarly allow
them to appeal the district court's decision to disregard their objections.
Moreover, no statute or procedural rule directly addresses the question
of who may appeal from approval of class action settlements, while the

Opinion of the Court
he had not successfully moved to intervene in the litigation.We now reverse.

I
Petitioner Robert Devlin, a retired worker representedby the Transportation Communications International Union

(Union), participates in a defined benefits pension plan (Plan)administered by the Union. In 1991, on the recommendation of the Plan's trustees, the Plan was amended to add acost of living adjustment (COLA) for retired and active employees. As it turned out, however, the Plan was not ableto support such a large benefits increase. To address this
problem, the Plan's new trustees sought to freeze the COLA.Because they were concerned about incurring Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) liability byeliminating the COLA for retired workers, see 29 U. S. C.

$ 1054(g)(1) (1994 ed.) (providing that accrued benefits "maynot be decreased by an amendment of the plan"), the trustees
froze the COLA only as to active employees. Because thePlan still lacked sufficient funds, the new trustees obtained
an equitable decree from the United States District Courtfor the District of Maryland in 1995 declaring that the former
trustees had breached their fiduciary duties and that endingthe COLA for retired workers would not violate ERISA.
Scardelletti v. Bobo, 897 F. Supp. 913 (Md. 1995); Scardellettiv.

Bobo, No. JFM-95-52 (D. Md., Sept. 8, 1997). Accord-ingly, in a 1997 amendment, the new trustees eliminated the

COLA for all Plan members.In October 1997, those trustees filed the present class action in the United States District Court for the District ofMaryland, seeking a declaratory judgment that the 1997
amendment was binding on all Plan members or, alterna-tively, that the 1991 COLA amendment was void. Originally, petitioner was proposed as a class representative for asubclass of retired workers because of his previous involvement in the issue. He refused to become a named repre-sentative, however, preferring to bring a separate action in

Opinion of the Court
the United States District Court for the Southern District ofNew York, arguing, among other things, that the 1997 Plan

amendment violated the Age Discrimination in EmploymentAct of 1967, 81 Stat. 602, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 621

et seq.
(1994 ed. and Supp. V). The New York District Court dis-missed petitioner's claim involving the 1997 amendment,

which was later affirmed by the Second Circuit because:

"The exact COLA issue that the appellants are pursuing . . . is being addressed by the district court inMaryland. . . . It seems eminently sensible that the

Maryland district court should resolve fully the COLAamendment issue."

Devlin v. Transportation Communications Int'l Union, 175 F. 3d 121, 132 (CA2 1999).

At the time petitioner's claim was dismissed, the District
Court in Maryland had already conditionally certified a classunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(1), dividing it

into two subclasses: a subclass of active employees and a sub-class of retirees. On April 20, 1999, petitioner's attorney
sent a letter to the District Court informally seeking to in-tervene in the class action. On May 12, 1999, petitioner sent
another letter repeating this request. He did not, however,
formally move to intervene at that time.Also in May, the Plan's trustees and the class representatives agreed on a settlement whereby the COLA benefitswould be eliminated in exchange for the addition of other
benefits. On August 27, 1999, the trustees filed a motion forpreliminary approval of the settlement. On September 10,
1999, petitioner formally moved to intervene pursuant toFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. On November 12, 1999,
the District Court denied petitioner's intervention motion as
"absolutely untimely." Scardelletti v. Debarr, 265 F. 3d 195,
201 (CA4 2001). It then heard objections to the settlement,
including those advanced by petitioner, and, concluding that
the settlement was fair, approved it. App. C to Pet. for
Cert. 1-3.

6 DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTI

Opinion of the Court
Shortly thereafter, petitioner noted his appeal, challengingthe District Court's dismissal of his intervention motion as

well as its decision to approve the settlement. The Court ofAppeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the District Court's
denial of intervention under an abuse of discretion standard.265 F. 3d, at 203-204. It further held that, because petitioner was not a named representative of the class and be-cause he had been properly denied the right to intervene, he
lacked standing to challenge the fairness of the settlementon appeal.

Id., at 208-210.Petitioner sought review of the Fourth Circuit's holding

that he lacked the ability to appeal the District Court's ap-proval of the settlement. We granted certiorari, 534 U. S.
1064 (2001), to resolve a disagreement among the Circuits asto whether nonnamed class members who fail to properly
intervene may bring an appeal of the approval of a settle-ment. Compare Cook v. Powell Buick, Inc., 155 F. 3d 758,
761 (CA5 1998) (holding that nonnamed class members whohave not successfully intervened may not appeal settlement
approval); Gottlieb v. Wiles, 11 F. 3d 1004, 1008-1009 (CA101993) (same);

Guthrie v. Evans, 815 F. 2d 626, 628-629 (CA111987) (same); Shults v. Champion Int'l Corp., 35 F. 3d 1056,

1061 (CA6 1994) (same), with In re PaineWebber Inc. Ltd.Partnerships Litigation, 94 F. 3d 49, 53 (CA2 1996) (any nonnamed class member who objected at the fairness hearingmay appeal); Carlough v. Amchem Prods., Inc., 5 F. 3d 707,
710 (CA3 1993) (same); Marshall v. Holiday Magic, Inc., 550F. 2d 1173, 1176 (CA9 1977) (same).

II
Although the Fourth Circuit framed the issue as one ofstanding, 265 F. 3d, at 204, we begin by clarifying that this

issue does not implicate the jurisdiction of the courts underArticle III of the Constitution. As a member of the retiree
class, petitioner has an interest in the settlement that createsa "case or controversy" sufficient to satisfy the constitutional

Nor do appeals by nonnamed class members raise thesorts of concerns that are ordinarily addressed as a matter
of prudential standing. Prudential standing requirements
include:

"[T]he general prohibition on a litigant's raising anotherperson's legal rights, the rule barring adjudication of

generalized grievances more appropriately addressed inthe representative branches, and the requirement that
a plaintiff 's complaint fall within the zone of interests
protected by the law invoked." Allen v. Wright, 468U. S. 737, 751 (1984).

Because petitioner is a member of the class bound by the
judgment, there is no question that he satisfies these threerequirements. The legal rights he seeks to raise are his

own, he belongs to a discrete class of interested parties, andhis complaint clearly falls within the zone of interests of the
requirement that a settlement be fair to all class members.
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e).What is at issue, instead, is whether petitioner should be

considered a "party" for the purposes of appealing the ap-proval of the settlement. We have held that "only parties
to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may ap-peal an adverse judgment."

Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U. S. 301,
304 (1988) (per curiam). Respondents argue that, becausepetitioner is not a named class representative and did not

successfully move to intervene, he is not a party for the purposes of taking an appeal.

We have never, however, restricted the right to appeal to
named parties to the litigation. In Blossom v. Milwaukee &
Chicago R. Co., 1 Wall. 655 (1864), for instance, we allowed
a bidder for property at a foreclosure sale, who was not a

Opinion of the Court
named party in the foreclosure action, to appeal the refusalof a request he made during that action to compel the sale.

In Hinckley v. Gilman, C., & S. R. Co., 94 U. S. 467 (1877),we allowed a receiver, who was an officer of the court rather
than a named party to the case, to appeal from an order"relat[ing] to the settlement of his accounts," reasoning that
"[f]or this purpose he occupies the position of a party to
the suit." Id., at 469. More recently, we have affirmed that"[t]he right of a nonparty to appeal an adjudication of contempt cannot be questioned," United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U. S. 72, 76
(1988), given the binding nature of that adjudication upon
the interested nonparty.

Justice Scalia attempts to distinguish these cases by
characterizing them as appeals from collateral orders to
which the appellants "were parties." Post, at 16 (dissenting
opinion). But it is difficult to see how they were parties in
the sense in which Justice Scalia uses the term--those
" `named as a party to an action,' " usually " `in the caption
of the summons or complaint.' " Post, at 15 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 34(1), p. 345 (1980); id.,
Comment a, Reporter's Note, at 347). Because they were
not named in the action, the appellants in these cases were
parties only in the sense that they were bound by the order
from which they were seeking to appeal.

Petitioner's interest in the District Court's approval of the
settlement is similar. Petitioner objected to the settlement
at the District Court's fairness hearing, as nonnamed parties
have been consistently allowed to do under the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(e)
("A class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed
dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the
class in such manner as the court directs"); see also 2 H.
Newberg & A. Conte, Class Actions $ 11.55, p. 11-132 (3d ed.
1992) (explaining that Rule 23(e) entitles all class members

Opinion of the Court
to an opportunity to object). The District Court's approvalof the settlement--which binds petitioner as a member of

the class--amounted to a "final decision of [petitioner's] rightor claim" sufficient to trigger his right to appeal. See

Williams v. Morgan, 111 U. S. 684, 699 (1884) (describing thecases discussed above). And like the appellants in the prior

cases, petitioner will only be allowed to appeal that aspect
of the District Court's order that affects him--the DistrictCourt's decision to disregard his objections. Cf.

supra, at 6.
Petitioner's right to appeal this aspect of the District Court'sdecision cannot be effectively accomplished through the

named class representative--once the named parties reach
a settlement that is approved over petitioner's objections,
petitioner's interests by definition diverge from those of the
class representative.

Marino v. Ortiz, supra, is not to the contrary. In that
case, we refused to allow an appeal of a settlement by a
group of white police officers who were not members of the
class of minority officers that had brought a racial discrimination claim against the New York Police Department. Although the settlement affected them, the District Court's decision did not finally dispose of any right or claim they might
have had because they were not members of the class.

Nor does considering nonnamed class members parties for
the purposes of bringing an appeal conflict with any other
aspect of class action procedure. In a related case, the Seventh Circuit has argued that nonnamed class members cannot be considered parties for the purposes of bringing an
appeal because they are not considered parties for the purposes of the complete diversity requirement in suits under
28 U. S. C. $ 1332. See Navigant Consulting, 275 F. 3d, at
619; see also Snyder v. Harris, 394 U. S. 332, 340 (1969). According to the Seventh Circuit, "[c]lass members cannot have
it both ways, being non-parties (so that more cases can come
to federal court) but still having a party's ability to litigate
independently." 275 F. 3d, at 619. Nonnamed class mem536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
bers, however, may be parties for some purposes and not
for others. The label "party" does not indicate an absolute
characteristic, but rather a conclusion about the applicability
of various procedural rules that may differ based on context.

Nonnamed class members are, for instance, parties in the
sense that the filing of an action on behalf of the class tolls
a statute of limitations against them. See American Pipe
& Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974). Otherwise, all
class members would be forced to intervene to preserve their
claims, and one of the major goals of class action litigation--
to simplify litigation involving a large number of class members with similar claims--would be defeated. The rule that
nonnamed class members cannot defeat complete diversity

is likewise justified by the goals of class action litigation.
Ease of administration of class actions would be compromised by having to consider the citizenship of all class members, many of whom may even be unknown, in determining
jurisdiction. See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1755, pp. 63-64 (2d ed. 1986).
Perhaps more importantly, considering all class members for
these purposes would destroy diversity in almost all class
actions. Nonnamed class members are, therefore, not parties in that respect.

What is most important to this case is that nonnamed class
members are parties to the proceedings in the sense of being
bound by the settlement. It is this feature of class action
litigation that requires that class members be allowed to appeal the approval of a settlement when they have objected
at the fairness hearing. To hold otherwise would deprive
nonnamed class members of the power to preserve their own
interests in a settlement that will ultimately bind them, despite their expressed objections before the trial court. Particularly in light of the fact that petitioner had no ability to
opt out of the settlement, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(b)(1),
appealing the approval of the settlement is petitioner's only

Opinion of the Court
means of protecting himself from being bound by a disposi-tion of his rights he finds unacceptable and that a reviewing

court might find legally inadequate.

Justice Scalia rightly notes that other nonnamed par-ties may be bound by a court's decision, in particular, those

in privity with the named party. See post, at 18. Trueenough. It is not at all clear, however, that such parties
may not themselves appeal. Although this Court has neveraddressed the issue, nonnamed parties in privity with a
named party are often allowed by other courts to appealfrom the order that affects them. 5 Am. Jur. 2d, Appellate
Review $ 265 (1995).Respondents argue that, nonetheless, appeals from nonnamed parties should not be allowed because they would un-dermine one of the goals of class action litigation, namely,
preventing multiple suits. See Guthrie v. Evans, 815 F. 2d,at 629 (arguing that allowing nonnamed class members' appeals would undermine a "fundamental purpose of the classaction": "to render manageable litigation that involves numerous members of a homogenous class, who would all other-wise have access to the court through individual lawsuits").
Allowing such appeals, however, will not be as problematicas respondents claim. For one thing, the power to appeal is
limited to those nonnamed class members who have objectedduring the fairness hearing. This limits the class of potential appellants considerably. As the longstanding practice ofallowing nonnamed class members to object at the fairness
hearing demonstrates, the burden of considering the claimsof this subset of class members is not onerous.

III
The Government, as amicus curiae, admits that nonnamed
class members are parties who may appeal the approval of asettlement, but urges us nonetheless to require class members to intervene for purposes of appeal. See Brief for

12 DEVLIN v. SCARDELLETTI

Opinion of the Court
United States et al. as Amici Curiae 12-27. To address thefairness concerns to objecting nonnamed class members

bound by the settlement they wish to appeal, however, theGovernment also asserts that such a limited purpose intervention generally should be available to all those, like peti-tioner, whose objections at the fairness hearing have been
disregarded. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2) provides for intervention as of right:

"Upon timely application . . . when the applicant claimsan interest relating to the property or transaction which

is the subject of the action and the applicant is so situ-ated that the disposition of the action may as a practical
matter impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest, unless the applicant's interest is ade-quately represented by existing parties."

According to the Government, nonnamed class members who
state objections at the fairness hearing should easily meetthese three criteria. For one thing, it claims, a settlement

binding on them will establish the requisite interest in the
action. Moreover, it argues, any intervention motion filed
"within the time period in which the named plaintiffs could
have taken an appeal" should be considered "timely filed" for
the purposes of such limited intervention. United Airlines,
Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U. S. 385, 396 (1977). Finally, it asserts, the approval of a settlement over a nonnamed class
member's objection, and the failure of a class representative
to appeal such an approval, should "invariably" show that
the class representative does not adequately represent the
nonnamed class member's interests on appeal. Brief for
United States et al. as Amici Curiae 20.

Given the ease with which nonnamed class members who
have objected at the fairness hearing could intervene for
purposes of appeal, however, it is difficult to see the value of
the Government's suggested requirement. It identifies only

Opinion of the Court
a limited number of instances where the initial intervention
motion would be of any use: where the objector is not actually a member of the settlement class or is otherwise not
entitled to relief from the settlement, where an objector
seeks to appeal even though his objection was successful,
where the objection at the fairness hearing was untimely, or
where there is a need to consolidate duplicative appeals from
class members. Id., at 23-25. In such situations, the Government argues, a district court can disallow such problematic and unnecessary appeals.

This seems to us, however, of limited benefit. In the first
two of these situations, the objector stands to gain nothing
by appeal, so it is unlikely such situations will arise with any
frequency. Justice Scalia argues that if such objectors
were undeterred by this fact at the time they filed their original objections, they will be undeterred at the appellate level.
See post, at 21-22. This misunderstands the point. As to
the first group--those who are not actually entitled to relief--one would not expect them to have filed objections in
the district court in the first place. The few irrational persons who wish to pursue one round of meaningless relief will,
we agree, probably be irrational enough to pursue a second.
But there should not be many of such persons in any case.
As for the second--those whose objections were successful
at the district court level--they were far from irrational in
the filing of their initial objections, and they should not generally be expected to lose this level of sensibility when faced
with the prospect of a meaningless appeal. Moreover, even
if such cases did arise with any frequency, such concerns
could be addressed by a standing inquiry at the appellate
level.

The third situation--dealing with untimely objections--
implicates basic concerns about waiver and should be easily
addressable by a court of appeals. A court of appeals also
has the ability to avoid the fourth by consolidating cases rais536US1 Unit: $U57 [12-16-03 19:06:55] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing duplicative appeals. Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(b)(2). Ifthe resolution of any of these issues should turn out to be

complex in a given case, there is little to be gained by requir-ing a district court to consider these issues, which are the
type of issues (standing to appeal, waiver of objections below,and consolidation of appeals) typically addressed only by an
appellate court. As such determinations still would mostlikely lead to an appeal, such a requirement would only add
an additional layer of complexity before the appeal of thesettlement approval may finally be heard.

Nor do we agree with the Government that, regardless ofthe desirability of an intervention requirement for effective
class management, the structure of the rules of class actionprocedure requires intervention for the purposes of appeal.
According to the Government, intervention is the methodcontemplated under the rules for nonnamed class members
to gain the right to participate in class action proceedings.We disagree. Just as class action procedure allows nonnamed class members to object to a settlement at the fair-ness hearing without first intervening, see supra, at 8-9, it
should similarly allow them to appeal the District Court'sdecision to disregard their objections. Moreover, no federal
statute or procedural rule directly addresses the question ofwho may appeal from approval of class action settlements,
while the right to appeal from an action that finally disposesof one's rights has a statutory basis. 28 U. S. C. $ 1291.

IV
We hold that nonnamed class members like petitioner whohave objected in a timely manner to approval of the settlement at the fairness hearing have the power to bring anappeal without first intervening. We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuitand remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and
Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

"The rule that only parties to a lawsuit, or those that prop-erly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment, is

well settled." Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U. S. 301, 304 (1988)(per curiam); Fed. Rule App. Proc. 3(c)(1) ("The notice
of appeal must . . . specify the party or parties taking theappeal"). This is one well-settled rule that, thankfully,
the Court leaves intact. Other chapters in the hornbooksare not so lucky.

I
The Court holds that petitioner, a nonnamed member ofthe class in a class action litigated by a representative member of the class, is a "party" to the judgment approving theclass settlement. This is contrary to well-established law.
The "parties" to a judgment are those named as such--whether as the original plaintiff or defendant in the complaint giving rise to the judgment, or as "[o]ne who [though]not an original party . . . become[s] a party by intervention,
substitution, or third-party practice," Karcher v. May, 484U. S. 72, 77 (1987). As the Restatement puts it, "[a] person
who is named as a party to an action and subjected to thejurisdiction of the court is a party to the action," Restatement (Second) of Judgments $ 34(1), p. 345 (1980) (herein-after Restatement); "[t]he designation of persons as parties
is usually made in the caption of the summons or complaintbut additional parties may be named in such pleadings as a
counterclaim, a complaint against a third party filed by adefendant, or a complaint in intervention,"

id., $ 34, Com-ment a, Reporter's Note, at 347. As was the case here, the

only members of a class who are typically named in the com-plaint are the class representatives; thus, it is only these
members of the class, and those who intervene or otherwiseenter through third-party practice, who are parties to the
class judgment. This is confirmed by the application ofthose Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that confer upon

"parties" to the litigation the rights to take such actions asconducting discovery and moving for summary judgment,

e. g., Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 30(a)(1), 31(a)(1), 33(a), 34(a), 36(a),45(a)(3), 56(a), 56(b), 56(e). It is undisputed that the class
representatives are the only members of the class who havesuch rights.

Petitioner was offered the opportunity to be named the
class representative, but he declined; nor did he successfullyintervene.

Ante, at 4, 5. Accordingly, he is not a party to
the class judgment. A

The Court does not deny that, at least as a general matter,
only those persons named as such are the "parties." Rather,
it contends that persons "may be parties for some purposes
and not for others," ante, at 10, and that petitioner is a party
to the class judgment at least for the "purposes of appealing," ante, at 7.1 The Court bases these contentions on
three of our precedents, which it says stand for the proposition that "[w]e have never . . . restricted the right to appeal
to named parties to the litigation." Ibid. These precedents stand for nothing of the sort.

All of these precedents are perfectly consistent with the
rule that only named parties to a judgment can appeal the
judgment because they involved appeals not from judgments
but from collateral orders. The appellants were allowed to
appeal from the collateral orders to which they were parties,

1 The Court provides only one other example of a purpose for which a
nonnamed class member is purportedly a "party": we have, it says, tolled
the statute of limitations for such a person between the time the class
action is filed and the time class certification is denied. Ante, at 10 (citing
American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538 (1974)). Not even
petitioner, however, is willing to advance the novel and surely erroneous
argument that a nonnamed class member is a party to the class-action
litigation before the class is certified. Brief for Petitioner 24-26. This
lonesome example is, in other words, entirely irrelevant to the question of
party status.

even though they were not named parties to (and hencewould not have been able to appeal from) the underlying

judgments. We made this distinction between appealingthe judgment and appealing a collateral order quite explicit
in Blossom v. Milwaukee & Chicago R. Co., 1 Wall. 655(1864). In that case, the appellant was not a named party
to the underlying foreclosure decree, from which it wastherefore "certainly true that he [could not] appeal," yet he
was a party (obviously, as the movant) to the motion he filedasking the court to complete the foreclosure sale, and therefore could appeal from the order denying that motion. Ibid.Our decisions in

Hinckley v. Gilman, C., & S. R. Co., 94 U. S.467 (1877), and United States Catholic Conference v. Abortion Rights Mobilization, Inc., 487 U. S. 72 (1988), are to thesame effect. In the former, the appellant was not a named
party to the underlying foreclosure decree, from which wesaid he "cannot and does not attempt to appeal," but he was
obviously a party to the collateral order directing him byname to transfer funds to the court, from which we said he
could appeal. 94 U. S., at 469. In the latter, witnesses whohad been dismissed as named parties to the underlying litigation, 487 U. S., at 75, were allowed to appeal from a collateralorder holding them in contempt for their failure to comply
with a subpoena addressed to them (and to which they weretherefore obviously parties),

id., at 76. These cases dem-onstrate why, even though petitioner should not be able to

appeal the District Court's judgment approving the classsettlement, there is no dispute that petitioner could (and
did) appeal the District Court's collateral order denying hismotion to intervene; as the movant, he was a party to the
latter. See Marino, 484 U. S., at 304 ("[S]uch motions are,of course, appealable").

The Court's other grounds for holding that petitioner is aparty to the class judgment are equally weak. First, it contends that petitioner should be considered a party to thejudgment because, as a member of the class, he is bound by
it. Ante, at 10 ("What is most important to this case is thatnonnamed class members are parties to the proceedings in
the sense of being bound by the settlement"). This willcome as news to law students everywhere. There are any
number of persons who are not parties to a judgment yet arenonetheless bound by it. See Restatement $ 41(1), at 393
(listing examples); id., $ 75, Comment a, at 210 ("A person isbound by a judgment in an action to which he is not a party
if he is in `privity' with a party"). Perhaps the most promi-nent example is precisely the one we have here. Nonnamed
members of a class are bound by the class judgment, eventhough they are not parties to the judgment, because they
are represented by class members who are parties:

"A person who is not a party to an action but who isrepresented by a party is bound by and entitled to the

benefits of a judgment as though he were a party. Aperson is represented by a party who is . . . [t]he representative of a class of persons similarly situated, desig-nated as such with the approval of the court, of which
the person is a member." Id., $ 41(1)(e), at 393.
Accord, id., $ 75, Comment a, at 210 ("Persons bound throughrepresentation by virtue of a relationship with a party are

to be contrasted with persons bound by a judgment becausethey are parties . . ."). Petitioner here, in the words of the
Restatement, "is not a party" but "is bound by [the] judgcollateral order, one need not be a party to the underlying litigation (and
therefore need not be named in the complaint giving rise to that litigation),
but need only be a party to the collateral proceedings (and therefore need
only be named in the filings giving rise to those proceedings).

ment as though he were a party." Because our "well-settled" rule allows only "parties" to appeal from a judgment, petitioner may not appeal the class settlement.3Second, the Court contends that petitioner should be considered a party to the judgment because he filed an objectionto the class settlement. We have already held, however,
that filing an objection does not make one a party if he doesnot also intervene.

Marino, supra, at 304.

II
The most pernicious aspect of today's decision, however, isnot its result, but its reasoning. I mentioned in a recent

dissent the Court's "penchant for eschewing clear rules thatmight avoid litigation,"

US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535U. S. 391, 412 (2002). Today's opinion not only eschews such

3 The Court contends that those in privity with the parties to a judgment are "often allowed by other courts" to appeal by mere virtue of the
fact that they are bound by the judgment. Ante, at 11 (citing 5 Am. Jur.
2d $ 265 (1995)). I should think that the significant datum on this point is
not that such appeals have been "often allowed by other courts," but that
they have never been allowed by this Court. Indeed, the "other courts"
whose opinions are cited by the authority on which the Court relies consist
entirely of state courts, with the exception of one federal case decided
before our decision in Marino v. Ortiz, 484 U. S. 301 (1988) (per curiam),
which affirmed the "well-settled" rule that in federal court "only parties
to a lawsuit . . . may appeal an adverse judgment." Id., at 304. While
this difference between the procedures of federal and state courts seemingly escapes the Court's attention, it was well enough recognized (and
the clear federal rule acknowledged) in the very next paragraph of the
American Jurisprudence annotation on which the Court relies:

"Caution: Applicable rules of procedure may bar a nonparty from taking
an appeal notwithstanding his or her interest in the subject matter of the
case. Thus, the United States Supreme Court has, under the Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure, rejected the principle of permitting appeal
by a nonparty who has an interest affected by the trial court's judgment,
stating that the better practice is for such nonparty to seek intervention
for the purposes of appeal." 5 Am. Jur. 2d, Appellate Review $ 265, at 40

Scalia, J., dissenting
a rule; it destroys one that previously existed. It abandonsthe bright-line rule that only those persons named as such

are parties to a judgment, in favor of a vague inquiry "basedon context." Ante, at 10 ("The label `party' does not indicate an absolute characteristic, but rather a conclusion aboutthe applicability of various procedural rules that may differ
based on context"). Although the Court does not say howone goes about selecting the result-determinative "context"
for its oh-so-sophisticated new inquiry, I gather from its re-peated invocation of this phrase that the relevant context in
the present case is the "goals of class action litigation," ante,at 10, 11. This means, I suppose, that, in a labor case, who
are the parties to a judgment will depend on the goals of thelabor laws, and, in a First Amendment case, who are the
parties to a judgment will depend on the goals of the FirstAmendment. Or perhaps not.

What makes this exponential increase in indeterminacy es-pecially unfortunate is the fact that it is utterly unnecessary.
Despite the Court's assertion in one breath that treatingnonnamed class members as parties is the "only means" by
which they would not be "deprive[d] . . . of the power topreserve their . . . interests," ante, at 10, the Court in the
next breath concedes that there is another--and very easy--means for nonnamed class members to do just that: becoming
parties to the judgment by moving to intervene. Ante, at12 (noting "the ease with which nonnamed class members
who have objected at the fairness hearing could intervenefor purposes of appeal"). The Court does not dispute that
nonnamed class members will typically meet the require-ments for intervention as of right under Federal Rule of
Civil Procedure 24, including intervention only for the pur-pose of appeal, and even after the class judgment has been
entered.4 Ante, at 11-12.

4 It is true that petitioner's motion to intervene was denied as untimely
by the District Court. Even if this decision was correct, a question on
which petitioner did not seek certiorari, it does not cast doubt on the

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Court does dispute whether there is any "value" in
requiring nonnamed class members who object to the settlement to intervene in order to take an appeal. Ante, at 12.
In my view, avoiding the reduction to indeterminacy of the
hitherto clear rule regarding who is a party is "value"
enough. But beyond that, it makes sense to require objectors to intervene before appealing, for the reason advanced
by the Government: to enable district courts "to perform an
important screening function." Brief for United States
et al. as Amici Curiae 23. For example, when considering
whether to allow an objector to intervene, a district court
can verify that the objector does not fall outside the definition of the settlement class and is otherwise entitled to relief
in the class action, that the objection has not already been
resolved in favor of the objector in the approved settlement,
and that the objection was presented in a timely manner.
Id., at 23-24. The Court asserts that there is no "value" to
these screening functions because a court of appeals can pass
on those matters just as easily, and in any event an objector
who is unable to obtain relief from the class settlement will
not seek to appeal "with any frequency," as he "stands to

As to the last point: The person who has nothing to gain
from an appeal also had nothing to gain from filing his objection in the first place, but was undeterred (as many are), see,
e. g., Shaw v. Toshiba American Information Systems, Inc.,
91 F. Supp. 2d 942, 973-974, and nn. 17-18 (ED Tex. 2000).
The belief that meritless objections, undeterred the first
time, will be deterred the second, surely suggests the triability of the ordinary nonnamed class member to intervene for purposes
of appeal. Petitioner was not the ordinary nonnamed class member seeking intervention for purposes of appeal. He moved to intervene generally, Brief for Petitioner 6, despite having rejected invitations to participate in the litigation until after the settlement was preliminarily
approved.

umph of hope over experience.5 And as for the suggestionthat the court of appeals can pass on these questions just as

easily: Since when has it become a principle of our judicialadministration that what can be left to the appellate level
should be left to the appellate level? Quite the opposite istrue. District judges, who issue their decrees in splendid
isolation, can be multiplied ad infinitum. Courts of appealscannot be staffed with too many judges without destroying
their ability to maintain, through en banc rehearings, a pre-dictable law of the circuit. In any event, the district court,
being intimately familiar with the facts, is in a better posi-tion to rule initially upon such questions as whether the objections to the settlement were procedurally deficient, latefiled, or simply inapposite to the case. If it denies interventions on such grounds, and if the denials are not appealed,the court of appeals will be spared the trouble of considering
those objections altogether. And even when the denials areappealed, the court of appeals will have the benefit of the
district court's opinion on these often fact-bound questions.(Typically, the only occasion the district court would have
had to pass on these questions is in the course of consideringthe motion to intervene; when considering whether to approve the class settlement, district courts typically do nottreat objections individually even on substance, let alone
form. E. g., id., at 973-974.) Finally, it is worth observingthat the Court's assertions regarding the merits of allowing
objectors to appeal a class settlement without interveningapply with equal force to the objectors who sought to appeal

5 The Court assures us that these appeals will be "few" because, like
the objections on which they are based, they are "irrational." Ante, at
13. To say that the substance of an objection (and of the corresponding
appeal) is irrational is not to say that it is irrational to make the objection
and file the appeal. See Shaw, 91 F. Supp. 2d, at 973-974, and n. 18 (noting " `canned' objections filed by professional objectors who seek out class
actions to simply extract a fee by lodging generic, unhelpful protests").
The Court cites nothing to support its sunny surmise that the appeals
will be few.

McKUNE, WARDEN, et al. v. LILE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 00-1187. Argued November 28, 2001--Decided June 10, 2002
Respondent was convicted of rape and related crimes. A few years before his scheduled release, Kansas prison officials ordered respondent to
participate in a Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (SATP). As part of
the program, participating inmates are required to complete and sign
an "Admission of Responsibility" form, in which they accept responsibility for the crimes for which they have been sentenced, and complete a
sexual history form detailing all prior sexual activities, regardless of
whether the activities constitute uncharged criminal offenses. The information obtained from SATP participants is not privileged, and might
be used against them in future criminal proceedings. There is no evidence, however, that incriminating information has ever been disclosed
under the SATP. Officials informed respondent that if he refused to
participate in the SATP, his prison privileges would be reduced, resulting in the automatic curtailment of his visitation rights, earnings, work
opportunities, ability to send money to family, canteen expenditures,
access to a personal television, and other privileges. He also would
be transferred to a potentially more dangerous maximum-security
unit. Respondent refused to participate in the SATP on the ground
that the required disclosures of his criminal history would violate his
Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled self-incrimination. He
brought this action for injunctive relief under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The
District Court granted him summary judgment. Affirming, the Tenth
Circuit held that the compelled self-incrimination prohibited by the
Fifth Amendment can be established by penalties that do not constitute
deprivations of protected liberty interests under the Due Process
Clause; ruled that the automatic reduction in respondent's prison privileges and housing accommodations was such a penalty because of its
substantial impact on him; declared that respondent's information would
be sufficiently incriminating because an admission of culpability regarding his crime of conviction would create a risk of a perjury prosecution;
and concluded that, although the SATP served Kansas' important interests in rehabilitating sex offenders and promoting public safety, those
interests could be served without violating the Constitution by treating
inmate admissions as privileged or by granting inmates use immunity.

Held: The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded.
224 F. 3d 1175, reversed and remanded.

Syllabus
Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Thomas, concluded that the SATP serves a vital penological purpose, and that offering inmates minimal incentives to participate
does not amount to compelled self-incrimination prohibited by the Fifth
Amendment. Pp. 32-48.

(a) The SATP is supported by the legitimate penological objective of
rehabilitation. The SATP lasts 18 months; involves substantial daily
counseling; and helps inmates address sexual addiction, understand the
thoughts, feelings, and behavior dynamics that precede their offenses,
and develop relapse prevention skills. Pp. 32-34.

(b) The mere fact that Kansas does not offer legal immunity from
prosecution based on statements made in the course of the SATP does
not render the program invalid. No inmate has ever been charged or
prosecuted for any offense based on such information, and there is no
contention that the program is a mere subterfuge for the conduct of
a criminal investigation. Rather, the refusal to offer use immunity
serves two legitimate state interests: (1) The potential for additional
punishment reinforces the gravity of the participants' offenses and
thereby aids in their rehabilitation; and (2) the State confirms its valid
interest in deterrence by keeping open the option to prosecute a particularly dangerous sex offender. Pp. 34-35.

(c) The SATP, and the consequences for nonparticipation in it, do not
combine to create a compulsion that encumbers the constitutional right
not to incriminate oneself. Pp. 35-47.

(1) The prison context is important in weighing respondent's constitutional claim: A broad range of choices that might infringe constitutional rights in a free society fall within the expected conditions of
confinement of those lawfully convicted. The limitation on prisoners'
privileges and rights also follows from the need to grant necessary
authority and capacity to officials to administer the prisons. See, e. g.,
Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78. The Court's holding in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 484, that challenged prison conditions cannot give rise
to a due process violation unless they constitute "atypical and significant
hardship[s] on [inmates] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison
life," may not provide a precise parallel for determining whether there
is compelled self-incrimination, but does provide useful instruction. A
prison clinical rehabilitation program, which is acknowledged to bear a
rational relation to a legitimate penological objective, does not violate
the privilege against compelled self-incrimination if the adverse consequences an inmate faces for not participating are related to the program
objectives and do not constitute atypical and significant hardships in
relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life. Cf., e. g., Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308, 319-320. Pp. 35-38.

Syllabus
(2) Respondent's decision not to participate in the SATP did not
extend his prison term or affect his eligibility for good-time credits or
parole. He instead complains about his possible transfer from the
medium-security unit where the program is conducted to a less desirable
maximum-security unit. The transfer, however, is not intended to punish prisoners for exercising their Fifth Amendment rights. Rather, it
is incidental to a legitimate penological reason: Due to limited space,
inmates who do not participate in their respective programs must be
moved out of the facility where the programs are held to make room for
other inmates. The decision where to house inmates is at the core of
prison administrators' expertise. See Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215,
225. Respondent also complains that his privileges will be reduced.
An essential tool of prison administration, however, is the authority to
offer inmates various incentives to behave. The Constitution accords
prison officials wide latitude to bestow or revoke these perquisites as
they see fit. See Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 467, n. 4. Respondent
fails to cite a single case from this Court holding that the denial of
discrete prison privileges for refusal to participate in a rehabilitation
program amounts to unconstitutional compulsion. Instead, he relies on
the so-called penalty cases, see, e. g., Spevack v. Klein, 385 U. S. 511,
which involved free citizens given the choice between invoking the Fifth
Amendment privilege and sustaining their economic livelihood, see, e. g.,
id., at 516. Those cases did not involve legitimate rehabilitative programs conducted within prison walls, and they are not easily extended
to the prison context, where inmates surrender their rights to pursue a
livelihood and to contract freely with the State. Pp. 38-41.

(3) Determining what constitutes unconstitutional compulsion involves a question of judgment: Courts must decide whether the consequences of an inmate's choice to remain silent are closer to the physical torture against which the Constitution clearly protects or the
de minimis harms against which it does not. The Sandin framework
provides a reasonable means of assessing whether the response of prison
administrators to correctional and rehabilitative necessities are so out
of the ordinary that one could sensibly say they rise to the level of
unconstitutional compulsion. P. 41.

(d) Prison context or not, respondent's choice is marked less by compulsion than by choices the Court has held give no rise to a selfincrimination claim. The cost to respondent of exercising his Fifth
Amendment privilege--denial of certain perquisites that make his life
in prison more tolerable--is much less than that borne by the defendant
in, e. g., McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183, 217, where the Court
upheld a procedure that allowed statements made by a criminal defend536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ant to mitigate his responsibility and avoid the death penalty to be used
against him as evidence of his guilt. The hard choices faced by the
defendants in, e. g., Baxter v. Palmigiano, supra, at 313; Ohio Adult
Parole Authority v. Woodard, 523 U. S. 272, 287-288; and Minnesota
v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 422, further illustrate that the consequences
respondent faced did not amount to unconstitutional compulsion. Respondent's attempt to distinguish the latter cases on dual grounds--that
(1) the penalty here followed automatically from his decision to remain
silent, and (2) his participation in the SATP was involuntary--is unavailing. Neither distinction would justify departing from this Court's precedents. Pp. 41-45.

(e) Were respondent's position to prevail, there would be serious
doubt about the constitutionality of the federal sex offender treatment
program, which is comparable to the Kansas program. Respondent is
mistaken as well to concentrate on a so-called reward/penalty distinction and an illusory baseline against which a change in prison conditions
must be measured. Finally, respondent's analysis would call into question the constitutionality of an accepted feature of federal criminal law,
the downward adjustment of a sentence for acceptance of criminal responsibility. Pp. 45-47.

Justice O'Connor acknowledged that the Court is divided on the
appropriate standard for evaluating compulsion for purposes of the
Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in a prison setting, but concluded that she need not resolve this dilemma because this
case indisputably involves burdens rather than benefits, and because
the penalties assessed against respondent as a result of his failure to
participate in the Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) are not
compulsive on any reasonable test. The Fifth Amendment's text does
not prohibit all penalties levied in response to a person's refusal to incriminate himself or herself--it prohibits only the compulsion of such
testimony. The Court's so-called "penalty cases" establish that the potential loss of one's livelihood through, e. g., the loss of employment, Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation of
City of New York, 392 U. S. 280, and the loss of the right to participate
in political associations and to hold public office, Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801, are capable of coercing incriminating testimony.
Such penalties, however, are far more significant that those facing respondent: a reduction in incentive level and a corresponding transfer
from medium to maximum security. In practical terms, these changes
involve restrictions on respondent's prison privileges and living conditions that seem minor. Because the prison is responsible for caring for
respondent's basic needs, his ability to support himself is not implicated

by the reduction of his prison wages. While his visitation is reduced,
he still retains the ability to see his attorney, his family, and clergy.
The limitation on his possession of personal items, as well as the amount
he is allowed to spend at the canteen, may make his prison experience
more unpleasant, but seems very unlikely to actually compel him to
incriminate himself. Because it is his burden to prove compulsion, it
may be assumed that the prison is capable of controlling its inmates so
that respondent's personal safety is not jeopardized by being placed in
maximum security, at least in the absence of proof to the contrary. Finally, the mere fact that the penalties facing respondent are the same
as those imposed for prison disciplinary violations does not make them
coercive. Thus, although the plurality's failure to set forth a comprehensive theory of the Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination is troubling, its determination that the decision below
should be reversed is correct. Pp. 48-54.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join.

Respondent Robert G. Lile is a convicted sex offender inthe custody of the Kansas Department of Corrections (Department). A few years before respondent was scheduledto reenter society, Department officials recommended that he
enter a prison treatment program so that he would not rapeagain upon release. While there appears to be some difference of opinion among experts in the field, Kansas officialsand officials who administer the United States prison system
have made the determination that it is of considerable impor-tance for the program participant to admit having committed
the crime for which he is being treated and other past of-fenses. The first and in many ways most crucial step in the
Kansas rehabilitation program thus requires the participantto confront his past crimes so that he can begin to understand his own motivations and weaknesses. As this initialstep can be a most difficult one, Kansas offers sex offenders
incentives to participate in the program.Respondent contends this incentive system violates his
Fif th Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.Kansas' rehabilitation program, however, serves a vital penological purpose, and offering inmates minimal incentives toparticipate does not amount to compelled self-incrimination
prohibited by the Fifth Amendment.

and then drove to a field where he raped her. After thesexual assault, the victim went to her school, where, crying

and upset, she reported the crime. The police arrested re-spondent and recovered on his person the weapon he used to
facilitate the crime. State v. Lile, 237 Kan. 210, 211-212, 699P. 2d 456, 457-458 (1985). Although respondent maintained
that the sexual intercourse was consensual, a jury convicted
him of rape, aggravated sodomy, and aggravated kidnaping.Both the Kansas Supreme Court and a Federal District

Court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to sustainrespondent's conviction on all charges. See

id., at 211, 699
P. 2d, at 458; 45 F. Supp. 2d 1157, 1161 (Kan. 1999).

In 1994, a few years before respondent was scheduled to
be released, prison officials ordered him to participate in
a Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (SATP). As part of

the program, participating inmates are required to complete
and sign an "Admission of Responsibility" form, in which
they discuss and accept responsibility for the crime for which
they have been sentenced. Participating inmates also are
required to complete a sexual history form, which details all
prior sexual activities, regardless of whether such activities
constitute uncharged criminal offenses. A polygraph examination is used to verify the accuracy and completeness of the
offender's sexual history.

While information obtained from participants advances
the SATP's rehabilitative goals, the information is not privileged. Kansas leaves open the possibility that new evidence
might be used against sex offenders in future criminal proceedings. In addition, Kansas law requires the SATP staff
to report any uncharged sexual offenses involving minors to
law enforcement authorities. Although there is no evidence
that incriminating information has ever been disclosed under
the SATP, the release of information is a possibility.

Department officials informed respondent that if he refused to participate in the SATP, his privilege status would
be reduced from Level III to Level I. As part of this reduc536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion, respondent's visitation rights, earnings, work opportu-nities, ability to send money to family, canteen expenditures,

access to a personal television, and other privileges automat-ically would be curtailed. In addition, respondent would be
transferred to a maximum-security unit, where his move-ment would be more limited, he would be moved from a twoperson to a four-person cell, and he would be in a potentially
more dangerous environment.Respondent refused to participate in the SATP on the

ground that the required disclosures of his criminal historywould violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination. He brought this action under Rev. Stat.

$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, against the warden and the secretary of the Department, seeking an injunction to prevent
them from withdrawing his prison privileges and transferring him to a different housing unit.

After the parties completed discovery, the United States
District Court for the District of Kansas entered summary
judgment in respondent's favor. 24 F. Supp. 2d 1152 (1998).
The District Court noted that because respondent had testified at trial that his sexual intercourse with the victim was
consensual, an acknowledgment of responsibility for the rape
on the "Admission of Guilt" form would subject respondent
to a possible charge of perjury. Id., at 1157. After reviewing the specific loss of privileges and change in conditions
of confinement that respondent would face for refusing to
incriminate himself, the District Court concluded that these
consequences constituted coercion in violation of the Fifth
Amendment.

The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 224
F. 3d 1175 (2000). It held that the compulsion element of a
Fifth Amendment claim can be established by penalties that
do not constitute deprivations of protected liberty interests
under the Due Process Clause. Id., at 1183. It held that
the reduction in prison privileges and housing accommodations was a penalty, both because of its substantial impact

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
on the inmate and because that impact was identical to thepunishment imposed by the Department for serious disciplinary infractions. In the Court of Appeals' view, the factthat the sanction was automatic, rather than conditional, supported the conclusion that it constituted compulsion. More-over, because all SATP files are subject to disclosure by subpoena, and an admission of culpability regarding the crimeof conviction would create a risk of a perjury prosecution,
the court concluded that the information disclosed by re-spondent was sufficiently incriminating.

Id., at 1180. TheCourt of Appeals recognized that the Kansas policy served

the State's important interests in rehabilitating sex offend-ers and promoting public safety. It concluded, however,
that those interests could be served without violating theConstitution, either by treating the admissions of the inmates as privileged communications or by granting inmatesuse immunity. Id., at 1192.

We granted the warden's petition for certiorari becausethe Court of Appeals has held that an important Kansas
prison regulation violates the Federal Constitution. 532U. S. 1018 (2001).

Sex offenders are a serious threat in this Nation. In 1995,an estimated 355,000 rapes and sexual assaults occurred nationwide. U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics,Sex Offenses and Offenders 1 (1997) (hereinafter Sex Offenses); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investiga-tion, Crime in the United States, 1999, Uniform Crime
Reports 24 (2000). Between 1980 and 1994, the populationof imprisoned sex offenders increased at a faster rate than
for any other category of violent crime. See Sex Offenses18. As in the present case, the victims of sexual assault are
most often juveniles. In 1995, for instance, a majority ofreported forcible sexual offenses were committed against
persons under 18 years of age. University of New Hamp-shire, Crimes Against Children Research Center, Fact Sheet

sex offenders said their victims were 12 or younger. Id.,at

iii.
When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they aremuch more likely than any other type of offender to be

rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault. See id., at 27;U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1983, p. 6 (1997). States
thus have a vital interest in rehabilitating convicted sexoffenders.

Therapists and correctional officers widely agree that clini-cal rehabilitative programs can enable sex offenders to manage their impulses and in this way reduce recidivism. SeeU. S. Dept. of Justice, Nat. Institute of Corrections, A Practitioner's Guide to Treating the Incarcerated Male Sex Of-fender xiii (1988) ("[T]he rate of recidivism of treated sex
offenders is fairly consistently estimated to be around 15%,"whereas the rate of recidivism of untreated offenders has
been estimated to be as high as 80%. "Even if both of thesefigures are exaggerated, there would still be a significant
difference between treated and untreated individuals"). An
important component of those rehabilitation programs re-quires participants to confront their past and accept responsibility for their misconduct. Id., at 73. "Denial is generally regarded as a main impediment to successful therapy,"
and "[t]herapists depend on offenders' truthful descriptions of events leading to past offences in order to determine which behaviours need to be targeted in therapy."
H. Barbaree, Denial and Minimization Among Sex Offenders:
Assessment and Treatment Outcome, 3 Forum on Corrections Research, No. 4, p. 30 (1991). Research indicates that
offenders who deny all allegations of sexual abuse are three
times more likely to fail in treatment than those who admit
even partial complicity. See B. Maletzky & K. McGovern,
Treating the Sexual Offender 253-255 (1991).

The critical first step in the Kansas SATP, therefore, is
acceptance of responsibility for past offenses. This gives inmates a basis to understand why they are being punished

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
and to identify the traits that cause such a frightening andhigh risk of recidivism. As part of this first step, Kansas

requires each SATP participant to complete an "Admissionof Responsibility" form, to fill out a sexual history form discussing their offending behavior, and to discuss their pastbehavior in individual and group counseling sessions.

The District Court found that the Kansas SATP is a valid
"clinical rehabilitative program," supported by a "legitimatepenological objective" in rehabilitation. 24 F. Supp. 2d,

at 1163. The SATP lasts for 18 months and involves sub-stantial daily counseling. It helps inmates address sexual
addiction; understand the thoughts, feelings, and behavior
dynamics that precede their offenses; and develop relapse
prevention skills. Although inmates are assured of a significant level of confidentiality, Kansas does not offer legal
immunity from prosecution based on any statements made
in the course of the SATP. According to Kansas, however,
no inmate has ever been charged or prosecuted for any offense based on information disclosed during treatment.
Brief for Petitioners 4-5. There is no contention, then, that
the program is a mere subterfuge for the conduct of a criminal investigation.

As the parties explain, Kansas' decision not to offer immunity to every SATP participant serves two legitimate state
interests. First, the professionals who design and conduct
the program have concluded that for SATP participants to
accept full responsibility for their past actions, they must
accept the proposition that those actions carry consequences.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 11. Although no program participant has
ever been prosecuted or penalized based on information revealed during the SATP, the potential for additional punishment reinforces the gravity of the participants' offenses and
thereby aids in their rehabilitation. If inmates know society
will not punish them for their past offenses, they may be left
with the false impression that society does not consider those
crimes to be serious ones. The practical effect of guaran536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

35Cite as: 536 U. S. 24 (2002)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
teed immunity for SATP participants would be to absolvemany sex offenders of any and all cost for their earlier

crimes. This is the precise opposite of the rehabilitativeobjective.

Second, while Kansas as a rule does not prosecute inmatesbased upon information revealed in the course of the program, the State confirms its valid interest in deterrence by
keeping open the option to prosecute a particularly danger-ous sex offender. Brief for 18 States as

Amici Curiae 11.
Kansas is not alone in declining to offer blanket use immu-nity as a condition of participation in a treatment program.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons and other States conduct similar sex offender programs and do not offer immunity to the
participants. See, e. g., Ainsworth v. Risley, 244 F. 3d 209,
214 (CA1 2001) (describing New Hampshire's program).

The mere fact that Kansas declines to grant inmates use
immunity does not render the SATP invalid. Asking at the
outset whether prison administrators can or should offer

immunity skips the constitutional inquiry altogether. If the
State of Kansas offered immunity, the self-incrimination
privilege would not be implicated. See, e. g., Kastigar v.
United States, 406 U. S. 441, 453 (1972); Brown v. Walker,
161 U. S. 591, 610 (1896). The State, however, does not offer
immunity. So the central question becomes whether the
State's program, and the consequences for nonparticipation
in it, combine to create a compulsion that encumbers the constitutional right. If there is compulsion, the State cannot
continue the program in its present form; and the alternatives, as will be discussed, defeat the program's objectives.

The SATP does not compel prisoners to incriminate themselves in violation of the Constitution. The Fifth Amendment Self-Incrimination Clause, which applies to the States
via the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S.
1 (1964), provides that no person "shall be compelled in
any criminal case to be a witness against himself." The
"Amendment speaks of compulsion," United States v. Monia,

317 U. S. 424, 427 (1943), and the Court has insisted that the
"constitutional guarantee is only that the witness not be
compelled to give self-incriminating testimony." United
States v. Washington, 431 U. S. 181, 188 (1977). The consequences in question here--a transfer to another prison
where television sets are not placed in each inmate's cell,
where exercise facilities are not readily available, and where
work and wage opportunities are more limited--are not ones
that compel a prisoner to speak about his past crimes despite
a desire to remain silent. The fact that these consequences
are imposed on prisoners, rather than ordinary citizens,
moreover, is important in weighing respondent's constitutional claim.

The privilege against self-incrimination does not terminate
at the jailhouse door, but the fact of a valid conviction and
the ensuing restrictions on liberty are essential to the Fifth
Amendment analysis. Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472, 485
(1995) ("[L]awful incarceration brings about the necessary
withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by the considerations underlying our penal
system" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). A
broad range of choices that might infringe constitutional
rights in a free society fall within the expected conditions of
confinement of those who have suffered a lawful conviction.

The Court has instructed that rehabilitation is a legitimate
penological interest that must be weighed against the exercise of an inmate's liberty. See, e. g., O'Lone v. Estate of
Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 348, 351 (1987). Since "most offenders will eventually return to society, [a] paramount objective
of the corrections system is the rehabilitation of those committed to its custody." Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 823
(1974). Acceptance of responsibility in turn demonstrates
that an offender "is ready and willing to admit his crime and
to enter the correctional system in a frame of mind that affords hope for success in rehabilitation over a shorter period

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
of time than might otherwise be necessary." Brady v.
United States, 397 U. S. 742, 753 (1970).

The limitation on prisoners' privileges and rights also follows from the need to grant necessary authority and capacity
to federal and state officials to administer the prisons. See,
e. g., Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987). "Running a
prison is an inordinately difficult undertaking that requires
expertise, planning, and the commitment of resources, all
of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government." Id., at 84-85.
To respect these imperatives, courts must exercise restraint
in supervising the minutiae of prison life. Ibid. Where, as
here, a state penal system is involved, federal courts have
"additional reason to accord deference to the appropriate
prison authorities." Ibid.

For these reasons, the Court in Sandin held that challenged prison conditions cannot give rise to a due process
violation unless those conditions constitute "atypical and significant hardship[s] on [inmates] in relation to the ordinary
incidents of prison life." See 515 U. S., at 484. The determination under Sandin whether a prisoner's liberty interest
has been curtailed may not provide a precise parallel for
determining whether there is compelled self-incrimination,
but it does provide useful instruction for answering the latter inquiry. Sandin and its counterparts underscore the
axiom that a convicted felon's life in prison differs from that
of an ordinary citizen. In the context of a legitimate rehabilitation program for prisoners, those same considerations
are relevant to our analysis. The compulsion inquiry must
consider the significant restraints already inherent in prison
life and the State's own vital interests in rehabilitation goals
and procedures within the prison system. A prison clinical
rehabilitation program, which is acknowledged to bear a rational relation to a legitimate penological objective, does not
violate the privilege against self-incrimination if the adverse

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
consequences an inmate faces for not participating are re-lated to the program objectives and do not constitute atypical and significant hardships in relation to the ordinary inci-dents of prison life.

Along these lines, this Court has recognized that lawfulconviction and incarceration necessarily place limitations
on the exercise of a defendant's privilege against selfincrimination. See, e. g., Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S.308 (1976).

Baxter declined to extend to prison disciplinary
proceedings the rule of Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609(1965), that the prosecution may not comment on a defendant's silence at trial. 425 U. S., at 319-320. As the Court
explained, "[d]isciplinary proceedings in state prisons . . .
involve the correctional process and important state interests other than conviction for crime." Id., at 319. The inmate in Baxter no doubt felt compelled to speak in one sense
of the word. The Court, considering the level of compulsion
in light of the prison setting and the State's interests in rehabilitation and orderly administration, nevertheless rejected
the inmate's self-incrimination claim.

In the present case, respondent's decision not to participate in the Kansas SATP did not extend his term of incarceration. Nor did his decision affect his eligibility for goodtime credits or parole. 224 F. 3d, at 1182. Respondent
instead complains that if he remains silent about his past
crimes, he will be transferred from the medium-security
unit--where the program is conducted--to a less desirable
maximum-security unit.

No one contends, however, that the transfer is intended
to punish prisoners for exercising their Fifth Amendment
rights. Rather, the limitation on these rights is incidental
to Kansas' legitimate penological reason for the transfer:
Due to limited space, inmates who do not participate in their
respective programs will be moved out of the facility where
the programs are held to make room for other inmates. As
the Secretary of Corrections has explained, "it makes no

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
sense to have someone who's not participating in a programtaking up a bed in a setting where someone else who may be

willing to participate in a program could occupy that bed andparticipate in a program." App. 99.

It is well settled that the decision where to house inmatesis at the core of prison administrators' expertise. See

Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 225 (1976). For this reason the
Court has not required administrators to conduct a hearingbefore transferring a prisoner to a bed in a different prison,

even if "life in one prison is much more disagreeable than inanother."

Ibid. The Court has considered the proposition
that a prisoner in a more comfortable facility might begin
to feel entitled to remain there throughout his term of incarceration. The Court has concluded, nevertheless, that this
expectation "is too ephemeral and insubstantial to trigger
procedural due process protections as long as prison officials
have discretion to transfer him for whatever reason or for
no reason at all." Id., at 228. This logic has equal force in
analyzing respodent's self-incrimination claim.

Respondent also complains that he will be demoted from
Level III to Level I status as a result of his decision not to
participate. This demotion means the loss of his personal
television; less access to prison organizations and the gym
area; a reduction in certain pay opportunities and canteen
privileges; and restricted visitation rights. App. 27-28.
An essential tool of prison administration, however, is the
authority to offer inmates various incentives to behave.
The Constitution accords prison officials wide latitude to bestow or revoke these perquisites as they see fit. Accordingly, Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U. S. 460, 467, n. 4 (1983), held
that an inmate's transfer to another facility did not in itself
implicate a liberty interest, even though that transfer resulted in the loss of "access to vocational, educational, recreational, and rehabilitative programs." Respondent concedes that no liberty interest is implicated in this case.
Tr. of Oral Arg. 45. To be sure, cases like Meachum and

536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
40 McKUNE v. LILE

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Hewitt involved the Due Process Clause rather than theprivilege against compelled self-incrimination. Those cases

nevertheless underscore the axiom that, by virtue of theirconvictions, inmates must expect significant restrictions, inherent in prison life, on rights and privileges free citizenstake for granted.

Respondent fails to cite a single case from this Court holding that the denial of discrete prison privileges for refusalto participate in a rehabilitation program amounts to unconstitutional compulsion. Instead, relying on the so-calledpenalty cases, respondent treats the fact of his incarceration
as if it were irrelevant. See, e. g., Garrity v. New Jersey,
385 U. S. 493 (1967); Spevack v. Klein, 385 U. S. 511 (1967).
Those cases, however, involved free citizens given the choice
between invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege and sustaining their economic livelihood. See, e. g., id., at 516
("[T]hreat of disbarment and the loss of professional standing, professional reputation, and of livelihood are powerful
forms of compulsion"). Those principles are not easily extended to the prison context, where inmates surrender upon
incarceration their rights to pursue a livelihood and to contract freely with the State, as well as many other basic freedoms. The persons who asserted rights in Garrity and
Spevack had not been convicted of a crime. It would come
as a surprise if Spevack stands for the proposition that when
a lawyer has been disbarred by reason of a final criminal
conviction, the court or agency considering reinstatement of
the right to practice law could not consider that the disbarred attorney has admitted his guilt and expressed contrition. Indeed, this consideration is often given dispositive
weight by this Court itself on routine motions for reinstatement. The current case is more complex, of course, in that
respondent is also required to discuss other criminal acts for
which he might still be liable for prosecution. On this point,
however, there is still a critical distinction between the
instant case and Garrity or Spevack. Unlike those cases,

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
respondent here is asked to discuss other past crimes aspart of a legitimate rehabilitative program conducted within

prison walls.To reject out of hand these considerations would be to ignore the State's interests in offering rehabilitation programsand providing for the efficient administration of its prisons.
There is no indication that the SATP is an elaborate attempt
to avoid the protections offered by the privilege against com-pelled self-incrimination. Rather, the program serves an

important social purpose. It would be bitter medicine totreat as irrelevant the State's legitimate interests and to invalidate the SATP on the ground that it incidentally burdens
an inmate's right to remain silent.

Determining what constitutes unconstitutional compulsion
involves a question of judgment: Courts must decide whether
the consequences of an inmate's choice to remain silent are
closer to the physical torture against which the Constitution
clearly protects or the de minimis harms against which it
does not. The Sandin framework provides a reasonable
means of assessing whether the response of prison administrators to correctional and rehabilitative necessities are so
out of the ordinary that one could sensibly say they rise to
the level of unconstitutional compulsion.

Prison context or not, respondent's choice is marked less
by compulsion than by choices the Court has held give no
rise to a self-incrimination claim. The "criminal process,
like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations
requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which
course to follow. Although a defendant may have a right,
even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course
he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always
forbid requiring him to choose." McGautha v. California,
402 U. S. 183, 213 (1971) (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted). It is well settled that the government need
not make the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege cost
free. See, e. g., Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231, 238

536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
(1980) (a criminal defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amend-ment privilege prior to arrest may be used to impeach his

credibility at trial); Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78, 84-85(1970) (a criminal defendant may be compelled to disclose
the substance of an alibi defense prior to trial or be barredfrom asserting it).

The cost to respondent of exercising his Fifth Amendment
privilege--denial of certain perquisites that make his life inprison more tolerable--is much less than that borne by the

defendant in McGautha. There, the Court upheld a proce-dure that allowed statements, which were made by a criminal defendant to mitigate his responsibility and avoid the
death penalty, to be used against him as evidence of his guilt.
402 U. S., at 217. The Court likewise has held that plea bargaining does not violate the Fifth Amendment, even though
criminal defendants may feel considerable pressure to admit
guilt in order to obtain more lenient treatment. See, e. g.,
Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357 (1978); Brady, 397
U. S., at 751.

Nor does reducing an inmate's prison wage and taking
away personal television and gym access pose the same hard
choice faced by the defendants in Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425
U. S. 308 (1976), Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard,
523 U. S. 272 (1998), and Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420
(1984). In Baxter, a state prisoner objected to the fact that
his silence at a prison disciplinary hearing would be held
against him. The Court acknowledged that Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), held that the Fifth Amendment
prohibits courts from instructing a criminal jury that it may
draw an inference of guilt from a defendant's failure to testify. The Court nevertheless refused to extend the Griffin
rule to the context of state prison disciplinary hearings because those proceedings "involve the correctional process
and important state interests other than conviction for
crime." 425 U. S., at 319. Whereas the inmate in the present case faces the loss of certain privileges, the prisoner in

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Baxter faced 30 days in punitive segregation as well as thesubsequent downgrade of his prison classification status.

Id., at 313.In

Murphy, the defendant feared the possibility of additional jail time as a result of his decision to remain silent.The defendant's probation officer knew the defendant had

committed a rape and murder unrelated to his probation.
One of the terms of the defendant's probation required himto be truthful with the probation officer in all matters. Seizing upon this, the officer interviewed the defendant aboutthe rape and murder, and the defendant admitted his guilt.
The Court found no Fifth Amendment violation, despite the
defendant's fear of being returned to prison for 16 months if
he remained silent. 465 U. S., at 422, 438.

In Woodard, the plaintiff faced not loss of a personal television and gym access, but loss of life. In a unanimous opinion
just four Terms ago, this Court held that a death row inmate
could be made to choose between incriminating himself at
his clemency interview and having adverse inferences drawn
from his silence. The Court reasoned that it "is difficult to
see how a voluntary interview could `compel' respondent to
speak. He merely faces a choice quite similar to the sorts
of choices that a criminal defendant must make in the course
of criminal proceedings, none of which has ever been held to
violate the Fifth Amendment." 523 U. S., at 286. As here,
the inmate in Woodard claimed to face a Hobson's choice: He
would damage his case for clemency no matter whether he
spoke and incriminated himself, or remained silent and the
clemency board construed that silence against him. Unlike
here, the Court nevertheless concluded that the pressure the
inmate felt to speak to improve his chances of clemency did
not constitute unconstitutional compulsion. Id., at 287-288.

Woodard, Murphy, and Baxter illustrate that the consequences respondent faced here did not amount to unconstitutional compulsion. Respondent and the dissent attempt
to distinguish Baxter, Murphy, and Woodard on the dual

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
grounds that (1) the penalty here followed automaticallyfrom respondent's decision to remain silent, and (2) respondent's participation in the SATP was involuntary. Neitherdistinction would justify departing from this Court's precedents, and the second is question begging in any event.It is proper to consider the nexus between remaining silent and the consequences that follow. Plea bargains are not
deemed to be compelled in part because a defendant whopleads not guilty still must be convicted. Cf.

Brady, supra,
at 751-752. States may award good-time credits and earlyparole for inmates who accept responsibility because silence

in these circumstances does not automatically mean the parole board, which considers other factors as well, will deny
them parole. See Baxter, supra, at 317-318. While the automatic nature of the consequence may be a necessary condition to finding unconstitutional compulsion, however, that is
not a sufficient reason alone to ignore Woodard, Murphy,
and Baxter. Even if a consequence follows directly from a
person's silence, one cannot answer the question whether the
person has been compelled to incriminate himself without
first considering the severity of the consequences.

Nor can Woodard be distinguished on the alternative
ground that respondent's choice to participate in the SATP
was involuntary, whereas the death row inmate in Woodard
chose to participate in clemency proceedings. This distinction assumes the answer to the compulsion inquiry. If respondent was not compelled to participate in the SATP, his
participation was voluntary in the only sense necessary for
our present inquiry. Kansas asks sex offenders to participate in SATP because, in light of the high rate of recidivism,
it wants all, not just the few who volunteer, to receive treatment. Whether the inmates are being asked or ordered to
participate depends entirely on the consequences of their decision not to do so. The parties in Woodard, Murphy, and
Baxter all were faced with ramifications far worse than respondent faces here, and in each of those cases the Court

45Cite as: 536 U. S. 24 (2002)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
determined that their hard choice between silence and theconsequences was not compelled. It is beyond doubt, of

course, that respondent would prefer not to choose betweenlosing prison privileges and accepting responsibility for his
past crimes. It is a choice, nonetheless, that does notamount to compulsion, and therefore one Kansas may require
respondent to make.

The Federal Government has filed an amicus brief de-scribing its sex offender treatment program. Were respondent's position to prevail, the constitutionality of thefederal program would be cast into serious doubt. The fact
that the offender in the federal program can choose to participate without being given a new prisoner classification is not
determinative. For, as the Government explains, its program is conducted at a single, 112-bed facility that is more
desirable than other federal prisons. Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.
Inmates choose at the outset whether to enter the federal
program. Once accepted, however, inmates must continue
to discuss and accept responsibility for their crimes if they
wish to maintain the status quo and remain in their more
comfortable accommodations. Otherwise they will be expelled from the program and sent to a less desirable facility.
Id., at 27. Thus the federal program is different from Kansas' SATP only in that it does not require inmates to sacrifice privileges besides housing as a consequence of nonparticipation. The federal program is comparable to the Kansas
program because it does not offer participants use immunity
and because it conditions a desirable housing assignment on
inmates' willingness to accept responsibility for past behavior. Respondent's theory cannot be confined in any meaningful way, and state and federal courts applying that view
would have no principled means to determine whether these
similarities are sufficient to render the federal program
unconstitutional.

Respondent is mistaken as well to concentrate on the socalled reward/penalty distinction and the illusory baseline

536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
46 McKUNE v. LILE

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
against which a change in prison conditions must be meas-ured. The answer to the question whether the government

is extending a benefit or taking away a privilege restsentirely in the eye of the beholder. For this reason, emphasis of any baseline, while superficially appealing, would bean inartful addition to an already confused area of jurisprudence. The prison warden in this case stated that it is
largely a matter of chance where in a prison an inmateis assigned. App. 59-63. Even if Inmates A and B are

serving the same sentence for the same crime, Inmate Acould end up in a medium-security unit and Inmate B in a
maximum-security unit based solely on administrative factors beyond their control. Under respondent's view, however, the Constitution allows the State to offer Inmate B the
opportunity to live in the medium-security unit conditioned
on his participation in the SATP, but does not allow the State
to offer Inmate A the opportunity to live in that same
medium-security unit subject to the same conditions. The
consequences for Inmates A and B are identical: They may
participate and live in medium security or refuse and live
in maximum security. Respondent, however, would have
us say the Constitution puts Inmate A in a superior position
to Inmate B solely by the accident of the initial assignment
to a medium-security unit.

This reasoning is unsatisfactory. The Court has noted before that "[w]e doubt that a principled distinction may be
drawn between `enhancing' the punishment imposed upon
the petitioner and denying him the `leniency' he claims would
be appropriate if he had cooperated." Roberts v. United
States, 445 U. S. 552, 557, n. 4 (1980). Respondent's reasoning would provide States with perverse incentives to assign
all inmates convicted of sex offenses to maximum security
prisons until near the time of release, when the rehabilitation
program starts. The rule would work to the detriment of
the entire class of sex offenders who might not otherwise be
placed in maximum-security facilities. And prison adminis536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
trators would be forced, before making routine prison hous-ing decisions, to identify each inmate's so-called baseline

and determine whether an adverse effect, however marginal,will result from the administrative decision. The easy alternatives that respondent predicts for prison administratorswould turn out to be not so trouble free.

Respondent's analysis also would call into question theconstitutionality of an accepted feature of federal criminal
law: the downward adjustment for acceptance of criminalresponsibility provided in $ 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2002). If theConstitution does not permit the government to condition
the use of a personal television on the acceptance of responsi-bility for past crimes, it is unclear how it could permit the
government to reduce the length of a prisoner's term of in-carceration based upon the same factor. By rejecting respondent's theory, we do not, in this case, call these policiesinto question.

* * *
Acceptance of responsibility is the beginning of rehabilita-tion. And a recognition that there are rewards for those

who attempt to reform is a vital and necessary step towardcompletion. The Court of Appeals' ruling would defeat
these objectives. If the State sought to comply with theruling by allowing respondent to enter the program while
still insisting on his innocence, there would be little incentivefor other SATP participants to confess and accept counseling;
indeed, there is support for Kansas' view that the dynamicsof the group therapy would be impaired. If the State had
to offer immunity, the practical effect would be that serialoffenders who are incarcerated for but one violation would
be given a windfall for past bad conduct, a result potentiallydestructive of any public or state support for the program
and quite at odds with the dominant goal of acceptance ofresponsibility. If the State found it was forced to graduate
prisoners from its rehabilitation program without knowing

536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN
48 McKUNE v. LILE

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
what other offenses they may have committed, the integrityof its program would be very much in doubt. If the State

found it had to comply by allowing respondent the same per-quisites as those who accept counseling, the result would be
a dramatic illustration that obduracy has the same rewardsas acceptance, and so the program itself would become selfdefeating, even hypocritical, in the eyes of those whom
it seeks to help. The Fifth Amendment does not require theState to suffer these programmatic disruptions when it seeks

to rehabilitate those who are incarcerated for valid, finalconvictions.

The Kansas SATP represents a sensible approach to reduc-ing the serious danger that repeat sex offenders pose to
many innocent persons, most often children. The State's
interest in rehabilitation is undeniable. There is, furthermore, no indication that the SATP is merely an elaborate
ruse to skirt the protections of the privilege against
compelled self-incrimination. Rather, the program allows
prison administrators to provide to those who need treatment the incentive to seek it.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring in the judgment.
The Court today is divided on the question of what standard to apply when evaluating compulsion for the purposes
of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination
in a prison setting. I write separately because, although I
agree with Justice Stevens that the Fifth Amendment
compulsion standard is broader than the "atypical and significant hardship" standard we have adopted for evaluating
due process claims in prisons, see post, at 58-60 (dissenting
opinion) (citing Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976)), I do
not believe that the alterations in respondent's prison conditions as a result of his failure to participate in the Sexual

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Abuse Treatment Program (SATP) were so great as to con-stitute compulsion for the purposes of the Fifth Amendment

privilege against self-incrimination. I therefore agree withthe plurality that the decision below should be reversed.

The text of the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit allpenalties levied in response to a person's refusal to incriminate himself or herself--it prohibits only the compulsion
of such testimony. Not all pressure necessarily "compel[s]"incriminating statements.

For instance, in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 455(1966), we found that an environment of police custodial interrogation was coercive enough to require prophylactic
warnings only after observing that such an environment exerts a "heavy toll on individual liberty." But we have not
required Miranda warnings during noncustodial police questioning. See, e. g., Beckwith v. United States, 425 U. S. 341
(1976). In restricting Miranda's applicability, we have not
denied that noncustodial questioning imposes some sort of
pressure on suspects to confess to their crimes. See Oregon
v. Mathiason, 429 U. S. 492, 495 (1977) (per curiam) ("Any
interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will
have coercive aspects to it . . ."); Berkemer v. McCarty,
468 U. S. 420, 440 (1984) (describing the "comparatively
nonthreatening character of [noncustodial] detentions" (emphasis added)). Rather, as suggested by the text of the
Fifth Amendment, we have asked whether the pressure imposed in such situations rises to a level where it is likely
to "compe[l]" a person "to be a witness against himself."

The same analysis applies to penalties imposed upon a person as a result of the failure to incriminate himself--some
penalties are so great as to "compe[l]" such testimony, while
others do not rise to that level. Our precedents establish
that certain types of penalties are capable of coercing incriminating testimony: termination of employment, Uniformed
Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation
of City of New York, 392 U. S. 280 (1968), the loss of a profes536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sional license, Spevack v. Klein, 385 U. S. 511 (1967), ineligi-bility to receive government contracts,

Lefkowitz v. Turley,
414 U. S. 70 (1973), and the loss of the right to participate inpolitical associations and to hold public office,

Lefkowitz v.
Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801 (1977). All of these penalties,however, are far more significant than those facing respondent here.

The first three of these so-called "penalty cases" involvedthe potential loss of one's livelihood, either through the loss

of employment, loss of a professional license essential to em-ployment, or loss of business through government contracts.
In Lefkowitz, we held that the loss of government contracts
was constitutionally equivalent to the loss of a profession
because "[a government contractor] lives off his contracting
fees just as surely as a state employee lives off his salary."
414 U. S., at 83; contra, post, at 68, n. 11. To support oneself
in one's chosen profession is one of the most important abilities a person can have. A choice between incriminating oneself and being deprived of one's livelihood is the very sort of
choice that is likely to compel someone to be a witness
against himself. The choice presented in the last case, Cunningham, implicated not only political influence and prestige,
but also the First Amendment right to run for office and to
participate in political associations. 431 U. S., at 807-808.
In holding that the penalties in that case constituted compulsion for Fifth Amendment purposes, we properly referred to
those consequences as "grave." Id., at 807.

I do not believe the consequences facing respondent in
this case are serious enough to compel him to be a witness
against himself. These consequences involve a reduction
in incentive level, and a corresponding transfer from a
medium-security to a maximum-security part of the prison.
In practical terms, these changes involve restrictions on the
personal property respondent can keep in his cell, a reduction in his visitation privileges, a reduction in the amount of
money he can spend in the canteen, and a reduction in the

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
wage he can earn through prison employment. See ante,at 30-31. These changes in living conditions seem to me

minor. Because the prison is responsible for caring for re-spondent's basic needs, his ability to support himself is not
implicated by the reduction in wages he would suffer as aresult. While his visitation is reduced as a result of his failure to incriminate himself, he still retains the ability to see
his attorney, his family, and members of the clergy. App.27. The limitation on the possession of personal items, as

well as the amount that respondent is allowed to spend atthe canteen, may make his prison experience more unpleasant, but seems very unlikely to actually compel him to incriminate himself.

Justice Stevens also suggests that the move to the
maximum-security area of the prison would itself be coercive. See post, at 63-64. Although the District Court
found that moving respondent to a maximum-security section of the prison would put him "in a more dangerous environment occupied by more serious offenders," 24 F. Supp. 2d
1152, 1155 (Kan. 1998), there was no finding about how great
a danger such a placement posed. Because it is respondent's
burden to prove compulsion, we may assume that the prison
is capable of controlling its inmates so that respondent's personal safety is not jeopardized by being placed in the
maximum-security area of the prison, at least in the absence
of proof to the contrary.

Justice Stevens argues that the fact that the penalties
facing respondent for refusal to incriminate himself are the
same as those imposed for prison disciplinary violations also
indicates that they are coercive. See post, at 62-63. I do
not agree. Insofar as Justice Stevens' claim is that these
sanctions carry a stigma that might compel respondent to
incriminate himself, it is incorrect. Because the same sanctions are also imposed on all prisoners who refuse to participate in any recommended program, App. 19-20, any stigma
attached to the reduction would be minimal. Insofar as

52 McKUNE v. LILE

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Stevens' claim is that these sanctions are designedto compel behavior because they are used as disciplinary

tools, it is also flawed. There is a difference between thesorts of penalties that would give a prisoner a reason not
to violate prison disciplinary rules and what would compelhim to expose himself to criminal liability. Therefore, on
this record, I cannot conclude that respondent has shown
that his decision to incriminate himself would be compelledby the imposition of these penalties.

Although I do not think the penalties respondent facedwere sufficiently serious to compel his testimony,

I do not
agree with the suggestion in the plurality opinion that these
penalties could permissibly rise to the level of those in cases
like McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183 (1971) (holding
that statements made in the mitigation phase of a capital
sentencing hearing may be used as evidence of guilt), Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357 (1978) (holding that plea
bargaining does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination), and Ohio Adult Parole Authority
v. Woodard, 523 U. S. 272 (1998) (holding that there is no
right to silence at a clemency interview). See ante, at 41-
43. The penalties potentially faced in these cases--longer
incarceration and execution--are far greater than those we
have already held to constitute unconstitutional compulsion
in the penalty cases. Indeed, the imposition of such outcomes as a penalty for refusing to incriminate oneself would
surely implicate a "liberty interest."

Justice Stevens attempts to distinguish these cases because, in each, the negative outcome did not follow directly
from the decision to remain silent, and because none of these
cases involved a direct order to testify. See post, at 60. As
the plurality's opinion makes clear, however, these two factors do not adequately explain the difference between these
cases and the penalty cases, where we have found compulsion based on the imposition of penalties far less onerous.
See ante, at 43-45.

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
I believe the proper theory should recognize that it is gen-erally acceptable to impose the risk of punishment, however

great, so long as the actual imposition of such punishmentis accomplished through a fair criminal process. See,

e. g.,
McGautha v. California, supra, at 213 ("The criminal proc-ess, like the rest of the legal system, is replete with situations requiring the making of difficult judgments as to which
course to follow. Although a defendant may have a right,even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course

he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token alwaysforbid requiring him to choose" (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Forcing defendants to accept such
consequences seems to me very different from imposing penalties for the refusal to incriminate oneself that go beyond
the criminal process and appear, starkly, as government attempts to compel testimony; in the latter context, any penalty that is capable of compelling a person to be a witness
against himself is illegitimate. But even this explanation of
the privilege is incomplete, as it does not fully account for
all of the Court's precedents in this area. Compare Griffin
v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965) (holding that prosecutor
may not comment on a defendant's failure to testify), with
Ohio Adult Parole Authority v. Woodard, supra (holding
that there is no right to silence at a clemency interview).

Complicating matters even further is the question of
whether the denial of benefits and the imposition of burdens
ought to be analyzed differently in this area. Compare ante,
at 45-47, with post, at 64-65. This question is particularly
important given the existence of United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 3E1.1 (Nov. 2000), which
can be read to offer convicted criminals the benefit of a lower
sentence in exchange for accepting responsibility for their
crimes. See ante, at 47.

I find the plurality's failure to set forth a comprehensive theory of the Fifth Amendment privilege against selfincrimination troubling. But because this case indisputably

Stevens, J., dissenting
involves burdens rather than benefits, and because I do notbelieve the penalties assessed against respondent in response to his failure to incriminate himself are compulsiveon any reasonable test, I need not resolve this dilemma to
make my judgment in this case.Although I do not agree that the standard for compulsion
is the same as the due process standard we identified in Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S. 472 (1995), I join in the judgmentreached by the plurality's opinion.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

No one could possibly disagree with the plurality's statement that "offering inmates minimal incentives to partic-ipate [in a rehabilitation program] does not amount to

compelled self-incrimination prohibited by the Fifth Amendment." Ante, at 29. The question that this case presents,
however, is whether the State may punish an inmate's assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege with the same mandatory sanction that follows a disciplinary conviction for an offense such as theft, sodomy, riot, arson, or assault. Until
today the Court has never characterized a threatened harm
as "a minimal incentive." Nor have we ever held that a person who has made a valid assertion of the privilege may nevertheless be ordered to incriminate himself and sanctioned
for disobeying such an order. This is truly a watershed
case.

Based on an ad hoc appraisal of the benefits of obtaining
confessions from sex offenders, balanced against the cost of
honoring a bedrock constitutional right, the plurality holds
that it is permissible to punish the assertion of the privilege
with what it views as modest sanctions, provided that those
sanctions are not given a "punitive" label. As I shall explain, the sanctions are in fact severe, but even if that were
not so, the plurality's policy judgment does not justify the
evisceration of a constitutional right. Despite the plurality's

meandering attempt to justify its unprecedented departurefrom a rule of law that has been settled since the days of

John Marshall, I respectfully dissent.

I
The text of the Fifth Amendment provides that no person"shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness

against himself." It is well settled that the prohibition "notonly permits a person to refuse to testify against himself at
a criminal trial in which he is a defendant, but also `privi-leges him not to answer official questions put to him in any
other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, wherethe answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.' " Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S. 420, 426 (1984)(quoting Lefkowitz v. Turley, 414 U. S. 70, 77 (1973)). If a
person is protected by the privilege, he may "refuse to an-swer unless and until he is protected at least against the use
of his compelled answers and evidence derived therefrom inany subsequent criminal case in which he is a defendant."
Id., at 78 (citing Kastigar v. United States, 406 U. S. 441(1972)). Prison inmates--including sex offenders--do not
forfeit the privilege at the jailhouse gate. Murphy, 465U. S., at 426.

It is undisputed that respondent's statements on the ad-mission of responsibility and sexual history forms could incriminate him in a future prosecution for perjury or anyother offense to which he is forced to confess.

1 It is also

1 As a participant in the Sexual Abuse Treatment Program (SATP),
respondent would be required to sign an "Admission of Responsibility"
form setting forth the details of the offense for which he was convicted.
Because he had testified at trial that his sexual intercourse with the victim before driving her back to her car was consensual, the District
Court found that a written admission on this form would subject respondent to a possible charge of perjury. 24 F. Supp. 2d 1152, 1157 (Kan. 1998).
In addition, the SATP requires participants to "generate a written sexual history which includes all prior sexual activities, regardless of
whether such activities constitute uncharged criminal offenses." Id., at

clear that he invoked his Fifth Amendment right by refusingto participate in the SATP on the ground that he would be

required to incriminate himself. Once he asserted thatright, the State could have offered respondent immunity
from the use of his statements in a subsequent prosecution.Instead, the Kansas Department of Corrections (Department) ordered respondent either to incriminate himself or to
lose his medium-security status. In my opinion that order,coupled with the threatened revocation of respondent's Level

III privileges, unquestionably violated his Fifth Amend-ment rights.

Putting to one side the plurality's evaluation of the policyjudgments made by Kansas, its central submission is that
the threatened withdrawal of respondent's Level III andmedium-security status is not sufficiently harmful to qualify
as unconstitutional compulsion. In support of this position,neither the plurality nor

Justice O'Connor cites a single
Fifth Amendment case in which a person invoked the privilege and was nevertheless required to answer a potentially
incriminating question.2

The privilege against self-incrimination may have been
born of the rack and the Star Chamber, see L. Levy, Origins
of the Fifth Amendment 42 (I. Dee ed. 1999); Andresen v.
Maryland, 427 U. S. 463, 470 (1976), but the Framers had a

1155. The District Court found that the form "clearly seeks information
that could incriminate the prisoner and subject him to further criminal
charges." Id., at 1157.

2 Petitioners relied on two cases, Fisher v. United States, 425 U. S. 391

(1976), and United States v. Washington, 431 U. S. 181, 187-188 (1977). In
Fisher, we held that the privilege does not permit the target of a criminal
investigation to prevent his lawyer from answering a subpoena to produce
incriminating documents. We reached that conclusion because the person
asserting the privilege was not the one being compelled. In Washington,
cited ante, at 36, a grand jury witness voluntarily answered questions
after being advised of the privilege, though not of the fact that he was a
potential defendant in danger of being indicted. In neither case did the
witness assert the privilege against incriminating himself.

broader view of compulsion in mind when they drafted theFifth Amendment.

3 We know, for example, that the privilege was thought to protect defendants from the moral com-pulsion associated with any statement made under oath.

4 In

addition, the language of the Amendment, which focuses ona courtroom setting in which a defendant or a witness in a

criminal trial invokes the privilege, encompasses the compul-sion inherent in any judicial order overruling an assertion of
the privilege. As Chief Justice Marshall observed in United
States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 38, 40 (No. 14,692e) (CC Va. 1807):"If, in such a case, he say upon his oath that his answer

would incriminate himself, the court can demand no othertestimony of the fact."

Our holding in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), thatthe privilege applies to the States through the Fourteenth
Amendment, determined that the right to remain silent isitself a liberty interest protected by that Amendment. We
explained that "[t]he Fourteenth Amendment secures againststate invasion the same privilege that the Fifth Amendment
guarantees against federal infringement--the right of a per-son to remain silent unless he chooses to speak

in the unfet-tered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty . . .

3 The origins and evolution of the privilege have received significant
scholarly attention and debate in recent years. See, e. g., Hazlett, Nineteenth Century Origins of the Fifth Amendment Privilege Against SelfIncrimination, 42 Am. J. Legal Hist. 235 (1998); Amar & Lettow, Fifth
Amendment First Principles: The Self-Incrimination Clause, 93 Mich. L.
Rev. 857 (1995). The historical account is complicated by the fact that
before Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 (1886), the privilege was
treated as a common-law evidentiary doctrine separate from the Fifth
Amendment. During that time, the privilege was also subsumed within
general discussions of the voluntariness of confessions.

(discussing historical sources which indicate that the "privilege prohibited
(1) incriminating interrogation under oath, (2) torture, and (3) probably
other forms of coercive interrogation such as threats of future punishment
and promises of leniency" (footnotes omitted)).

for such silence." Id., at 8 (emphasis added). Since Malloy,we have construed the text to prohibit not only direct orders

to testify, but also indirect compulsion effected by commentson a defendant's refusal to take the stand,

Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 613-614 (1965), and we have recognizedthat compulsion can be presumed from the circumstances

surrounding custodial interrogation, see Dickerson v. United
States, 530 U. S. 428, 435 (2000) ("[T]he coercion inherent incustodial interrogation blurs the line between voluntary and

involuntary statements, and thus heightens the risk that anindividual will not be `accorded his privilege under the Fifth
Amendment . . . not to be compelled to incriminate himself ' ")
(quoting Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 439 (1966)).
Without requiring the deprivation of any other liberty interest, we have found prohibited compulsion in the threatened
loss of the right to participate in political associations,
Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, 431 U. S. 801 (1977), forfeiture
of government contracts, Turley, 414 U. S., at 82, loss of employment, Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation of City of New York, 392 U. S. 280
(1968), and disbarment, Spevack v. Klein, 385 U. S. 511, 516
(1967). None of our opinions contains any suggestion that
compulsion should have a different meaning in the prison
context. Nor is there any support in our Fifth Amendment
jurisprudence for the proposition that nothing short of losing
one's livelihood is sufficient to constitute compulsion. Accord, Turley, 414 U. S., at 83.

The plurality's suggestion that our decision in Meachum
v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976), supports a novel interpretation
of the Fifth Amendment, see ante, at 39, is inconsistent with
the central rationale of that case. In Meachum, a group of
prison inmates urged the Court to hold that the Due Process
Clause entitled them to a hearing prior to their transfer
to a substantially less favorable facility. Relying on the
groundbreaking decisions in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S.
471 (1972), and Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974),

Stevens, J., dissenting
which had rejected the once-prevailing view that a prison
inmate had no more rights than a "slave of the State," 5 the
prisoners sought to extend those holdings to require judicial
review of "any substantial deprivation imposed by prison
authorities." The Court recognized that after Wolff and
its progeny, convicted felons retain "a variety of important
rights that the courts must be alert to protect." Although
Meachum refused to expand the constitutional rights of inmates, we did not narrow the protection of any established
right. Indeed, Justice White explicitly limited the holding
to prison conditions that "do not otherwise violate the Constitution," 427 U. S., at 224.6

Not a word in our discussion of the privilege in Ohio Adult
Parole Authority v. Woodard, 523 U. S. 272 (1998), ante, at
43, requires a heightened showing of compulsion in the
prison context to establish a Fifth Amendment violation.
That case is wholly unlike this one because Woodard was
not ordered to incriminate himself and was not punished for
refusing to do so. He challenged Ohio's clemency procedures, arguing, inter alia, that an interview with members
of the clemency board offered to inmates one week before
their clemency hearing presented him with a Hobson's choice
that violated the privilege against self-incrimination. He
could either take advantage of the interview and risk incriminating himself, or decline the interview, in which case the
clemency board might draw adverse inferences from his decision not to testify. We concluded that the prisoner who was
offered "a voluntary interview" is in the same position as

5 See Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 231 (1976) (Stevens, J.,
dissenting).

6 In his opinion for the Court in the companion case, Montanye v.

Haymes, 427 U. S. 236, 242 (1976), Justice White reiterated this point: "As
long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is
subjected are within the sentence imposed upon him and [are] not otherwise violative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not in itself
subject an inmate's treatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight."

any defendant faced with the option of either testifying oraccepting the risk that adverse inferences may be drawn

from his silence. 523 U. S., at 286.Respondent was directly ordered by prison authorities to
participate in a program that requires incriminating disclo-sures, whereas no one ordered Woodard to do anything.
Like a direct judicial order to answer questions in the courtroom, an order from the State to participate in the SATP isinherently coercive. Cf.

Turley, 414 U. S., at 82 ("The
waiver sought by the State, under threat of loss of contracts,would have been no less compelled than a direct request for

the testimony without resort to the waiver"). Moreover,
the penalty for refusing to participate in the SATP is automatic. Instead of conjecture and speculation about the indirect consequences that may flow from a decision to remain
silent, we can be sure that defiance of a direct order carries
with it the stigma of being a lawbreaker or a problem inmate,
as well as other specified penalties. The penalty involved in
this case is a mandated official response to the assertion of
the privilege.

In Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U. S. 308 (1976), ante, at
42-43, we held that a prison disciplinary proceeding did not
violate the privilege, in part, because the State had not
"insisted [nor] asked that Palmigiano waive his Fifth
Amendment privilege," and it was "undisputed that an inmate's silence in and of itself [was] insufficient to support an
adverse decision by the Disciplinary Board." 425 U. S., at
317-318. We distinguished the "penalty cases," Garrity v.
New Jersey, 385 U. S. 493 (1967), and Turley, not because
they involved civilians as opposed to prisoners, as the plurality assumes, ante, at 40, but because in those cases the
"refusal to submit to interrogation and to waive the Fifth
Amendment privilege, standing alone and without regard to
other evidence, resulted in loss of employment or opportunity to contract with the State," whereas Palmigiano's silence "was given no more evidentiary value than was war536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ranted by the facts surrounding his case." 425 U. S., at 318
(emphasis added). And, in a subsequent "penalty" case, we
distinguished Baxter on the ground that refusing to incriminate oneself "was only one of a number of factors to be considered by the finder of fact in assessing a penalty, and was
given no more probative value than the facts of the case warranted," while in Cunningham "refusal to waive the Fifth
Amendment privilege [led] automatically and without more
to imposition of sanctions." 431 U. S., at 808, n. 5.

Similarly, in Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S., at 438, 439,
while "the State could not constitutionally carry out a threat
to revoke probation for the legitimate exercise of the Fifth
Amendment privilege," because revocation was not automatic under the Minnesota statute, we concluded that "Murphy could not reasonably have feared that the assertion of
the privilege would have led to revocation." 7 These decisions recognized that there is an appreciable difference between an official sanction for disobeying a direct order and a
mere risk of adverse consequences stemming from a voluntary choice. The distinction is not a novel one, nor is it simply offered to "justify departing from this Court's precedents," ante, at 44. Rather it is a distinction that we have
drawn throughout our cases; therefore, it is the plurality's

7 The plurality is quite wrong to rely on Murphy for the proposition that
an individual is not compelled to incriminate himself when faced with the
threat of return to prison. Ante, at 43. In Murphy, we did not have
occasion to decide whether such a threat constituted compulsion because
we held that "since Murphy revealed incriminating information instead of
timely asserting his Fifth Amendment privilege, his disclosures were not
compelled incriminations." 465 U. S., at 440. As we explained, "a witness confronted with questions that the government should reasonably
expect to elicit incriminating evidence ordinarily must assert the privilege
rather than answer if he desires not to incriminate himself. . . . But if

he chooses to answer, his choice is considered to be voluntary since he
was free to claim the privilege and would suffer no penalty as the result
of his decision to do so." Id., at 429. In contrast to Murphy, respondent
has consistently asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege.

disregard for both factors that represents an unjustified de-parture. Unlike Woodard, Murphy, and Baxter, respondent

cannot invoke his Fifth Amendment rights and then gambleon whether the Department will revoke his Level III status;
the punishment is mandatory. The fact that this case in-volves a prison inmate, as did Woodard and Baxter, is not
enough to render those decisions controlling authority.Since we have already said inmates do not forfeit their Fifth
Amendment rights at the jailhouse gate, Murphy, 465 U. S.,at 426, the plurality must point to something beyond respondent's status as a prisoner to justify its departure fromour precedent.

II
The plurality and Justice O'Connor hold that the conse-quences stemming from respondent's invocation of the privilege are not serious enough to constitute compulsion. Thethreat of transfer to Level I and a maximum-security unit
is not sufficiently coercive in their view--either becausethe consequence is not really a penalty, just the loss of a
benefit, or because it is a penalty, but an insignificant one.I strongly disagree.

It took respondent several years to acquire the status thathe occupied in 1994 when he was ordered to participate in
the SATP. Because of the nature of his convictions, in 1983the Department initially placed him in a maximum-security
classification. Not until 1989 did the Department change his"security classification to `medium by exception' because of
his good behavior." Lile v. Simmons, 23 Kan. App. 2d 1, 2,929 P. 2d 171, 172 (1996). Thus, the sanction at issue threatens to deprive respondent of a status in the prison commu-nity that it took him six years to earn and which he had
successfully maintained for five more years when he was or-dered to incriminate himself. Moreover, abruptly "busting"
his custody back to Level I, App. 94, would impose the samestigma on him as would a disciplinary conviction for any of
the most serious offenses described in petitioners' formal

statement of Internal Management Policy and Procedure
(IMPP). As the District Court found, the sanctions imposed
on respondent "mirror the consequences imposed for serious
disciplinary infractions." 24 F. Supp. 2d 1152, 1155 (Kan.
1998). This same loss of privileges is considered serious
enough by prison authorities that it is used as punishment
for theft, drug abuse, assault, and possession of dangerous
contraband.8

The punitive consequences of the discipline include not
only the dignitary and reputational harms flowing from the
transfer, but a serious loss of tangible privileges as well.
Because he refused to participate in the SATP, respondent's
visitation rights will be restricted. He will be able to earn
only $0.60 per day, as compared to Level III inmates, who
can potentially earn minimum wage. His access to prison
organizations and activities will be limited. He will no
longer be able to send his family more than $30 per pay period. He will be prohibited from spending more than $20
per payroll period at the canteen, rather than the $140 he
could spend at Level III, and he will be restricted in what
property he can keep in his cell. App. 27-28. In addition,
because he will be transferred to a maximum-security unit,
respondent will be forced to share a cell with three other

review cycle").The plurality's glib attempt to characterize these consequences as a loss of potential benefits rather than a penaltyis wholly unpersuasive. The threatened transfer to Level I
and to a maximum-security unit represents a significant,adverse change from the status quo. Respondent achieved
his medium-security status after six years of good behaviorand maintained that status during five more years. During
that time, an inmate unquestionably develops settled expec-tations regarding the conditions of his confinement. These
conditions then form the baseline against which any changemust be measured, and rescinding them now surely constitutes punishment.Paying attention to the baseline is not just "superficially
appealing," ante, at 46. We have recognized that the gov9 Respondent attested to the fact that in his experience maximum security "is a very hostile, intimidating environment because most of the inmates in maximum tend to have longer sentences and are convicted of
more serious crimes, and, as a consequence, care less how they act or treat
others." Id., at 41-42. He explained that in the maximum-security unit
"there is far more gang activity," "reported and unreported rapes and
assaults of inmates are far more prevalent," and "sex offenders . . . are
seen as targets for rape and physical and mental assault[s]," whereas in
medium security, "because the inmates want to maintain their medium
security status, they are less prone to breaking prison rules or acting
violently." Id., at 42-43.

ernment can extend a benefit in exchange for incriminatingstatements, see Woodard, 523 U. S., at 288 ("[T]his pressure

to speak in the hope of improving [one's] chance of beinggranted clemency does not make the interview compelled"),
but cannot threaten to take away privileges as the cost ofinvoking Fifth Amendment rights, see, e. g., Turley, 414
U. S., at 82; Spevack, 385 U. S., at 516. Based on this dis-tinction, nothing that I say in this dissent calls into question
the constitutionality of downward adjustments for accept-ance of responsibility under the United States Sentencing
Guidelines, ante, at 47. Although such a reduction in sen-tence creates a powerful incentive for defendants to confess,
it completely avoids the constitutional issue that would bepresented if the Guidelines operated like the scheme here
and authorized an upward adjustment whenever a defendantrefused to accept responsibility. Similarly, taking into account an attorney's acceptance of responsibility or contritionin deciding whether to reinstate his membership to the bar
of this Court, see ante, at 40, is obviously different from dis-barring an attorney for invoking his privilege. By obscuring the distinction between penalties and incentives, it is theplurality that calls into question both the Guidelines and plea
bargaining. See Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 U. S. 212, 223-224 (1978) ("Nor does this record indicate that he was being
punished for exercising a constitutional right. . . . [H]omicidedefendants who are willing to plead

non vult may be treated
more leniently than those who go to trial, but withholdingthe possibility of leniency from the latter cannot be equated

with impermissible punishment as long as our cases sustain-ing plea bargaining remain undisturbed").

10 The plurality quotes a footnote in Roberts v. United States, 445 U. S.

drawn between enhancing punishment and denying leniency, ante, at 46.
This quote is misleading because, as in Minnesota v. Murphy, 465 U. S.
420 (1984), see n. 7, supra, Roberts failed to assert his privilege against

Even if the change in respondent's status could properlybe characterized as a loss of benefits to which he had no

entitlement, the question at hand is not whether the Depart-ment could have refused to extend those benefits in the first
place, but rather whether revoking them at this point consti-tutes a penalty for asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege.
See Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 597 (1972). Theplurality contends that the transfer from medium to maximum security and the associated loss of Level III status isnot intended to punish prisoners for asserting their Fifth
Amendment rights, but rather is merely incidental to theprison's legitimate interest in making room for participants

self-incrimination, and we reiterated that the privilege is not selfexecuting, 445 U. S., at 559. Furthermore, the passage quoted by the plurality, id., at 557, n. 4, was in reference to Roberts' claim that the sentencing judge could not consider his refusal to incriminate a co-conspirator in
deciding whether to impose his sentences consecutively. In that context,
the privilege is not implicated and compulsion is not constitutionally significant. While it is true that in some cases the line between enhancing
punishment and refusing leniency may be difficult to draw, that does not
mean the distinction is irrelevant for Fifth Amendment purposes.

It is curious that the plurality asserts the impracticality of drawing such
a distinction, given that in this case a majority of the Court agrees that it
is perfectly clear the consequences facing respondent represent a burden,
rather than the denial of a benefit. Ante, at 53-54 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). Our cases reveal that it is not only possible, but necessary to draw the distinction. For even Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S.
357 (1978), conditioned its entire analysis of plea bargaining on the assumption that the defendant had been charged with the greater offense
prior to plea bargaining and, therefore, faced the denial of leniency rather
than an enhanced penalty. Id., at 360-361 ("While the prosecutor did not
actually obtain the recidivist indictment until after the plea conferences
had ended, his intention to do so was clearly expressed at the outset of
plea negotiations. . . . This is not a situation, therefore, where the prosecutor without notice brought an additional and more serious charge after
plea negotiations relating only to the original indictment had ended with
the defendant's insistence on pleading not guilty. As a practical matter,
in short, this case would be no different if the grand jury had indicted [the
defendant] as a recidivist from the outset, and the prosecutor had offered
to drop that charge as part of the plea bargain").

in the program. Ante, at 38. Of course, the Departmentcould still house participants together without moving those

who refuse to participate to more restrictive conditions ofconfinement and taking away their privileges. Moreover,
petitioners have not alleged that respondent is taking up abed in a unit devoted to the SATP; therefore, all the Department would have to do is allow respondent to stay in his
current medium-security cell. If need be, the Departmentcould always transfer respondent to another mediumsecurity unit. Given the absence of evidence in the recordthat the Department has a shortage of medium-security
beds, or even that there is a separate unit devoted to participants in the SATP, the only plausible explanation for the
transfer to maximum security and loss of Level III status is
that it serves as punishment for refusing to participate in
the program.

Justice O'Connor recognizes that the transfer is a penalty, but finds insufficient coercion because the "changes in
[respondent's] living conditions seem to [her] minor." Ante,
at 51 (opinion concurring in judgment). The coerciveness of
the penalty in this case must be measured not by comparing
the quality of life in a prison environment with that in a free
society, but rather by the contrast between the favored and
disfavored classes of prisoners. It is obviously impossible to
measure precisely the significance of the difference between
being housed in a four-person, maximum-security cell in the
most dangerous area of the prison, on the one hand, and having a key to one's own room, the right to take a shower, and
the ability to move freely within adjacent areas during certain hours, on the other--or to fully appreciate the importance of visitation privileges, being able to send more than
$30 per pay period to family, having access to the yard for
exercise, and the opportunity to participate in group activities. What is perfectly clear, however, is that it is the aggregate effect of those penalties that creates compulsion.
Nor is it coincidental that petitioners have selected this same

Stevens, J., dissenting
group of sanctions as the punishment to be imposed for themost serious violations of prison rules. Considering these

consequences as a whole and comparing the Department'streatment of respondent to the rest of the prison population,
it is perfectly clear that the penalty imposed is "constitution-ally indistinguishable from the coercive provisions we struck
down in Gardner, Sanitation Men, and Turley." Cunningham, 431 U. S., at 807.11 III

The SATP clearly serves legitimate therapeutic purposes.The goal of the program is to rehabilitate sex offenders, and
the requirement that participants complete admission of re-sponsibility and sexual history forms may well be an important component of that process. Mental health professionalsseem to agree that accepting responsibility for past sexual
misconduct is often essential to successful treatment, andthat treatment programs can reduce the risk of recidivism
by sex offenders. See Winn, Strategic and Systematic Man-agement of Denial in Cognitive/Behavioral Treatment of
Sexual Offenders, 8 Sexual Abuse: J. Research and Treat-ment 25, 26-27 (1996).

The program's laudable goals, however, do not justify re-duced constitutional protection for those ordered to participate. "We have already rejected the notion that citizensmay be forced to incriminate themselves because it serves
a governmental need." Cunningham, 431 U. S., at 808.

11 Justice O'Connor would distinguish these cases because the penalty
involved the loss of one's livelihood, whereas here respondent will be
housed, clothed, and fed regardless of whether he is in maximum or medium security. We rejected a similar argument in Turley, when we refused to distinguish Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U. S. 273 (1968), and Uniformed Sanitation Men Assn., Inc. v. Commissioner of Sanitation of City
of New York, 392 U. S. 280 (1968), based on the difference between losing
one's job and losing the ability to obtain government contracts. 414 U. S.,
at 83. We concluded that there was no "difference of constitutional magnitude between the threat of job loss to an employee of the State, and a
threat of loss of contracts to a contractor." Ibid.

The benefits of obtaining confessions from sex offenders maybe substantial, but "claims of overriding interests are not

unusual in Fifth Amendment litigation," and until today atleast "they have not fared well."

Turley, 414 U. S., at 78.
The State's interests in law enforcement and rehabilitationare present in every criminal case. If those interests were

sufficient to justify impinging on prisoners' Fifth Amendment right, inmates would soon have no privilege left toinvoke.

The plurality's willingness to sacrifice prisoners' FifthAmendment rights is also unwarranted because available alternatives would allow the State to achieve the same objectives without impinging on inmates' privilege. Turner v.
Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 93 (1987). The most obvious alternative
is to grant participants use immunity. See Murphy, 465
U. S., at 436, n. 7 ("[A] State may validly insist on answers
to even incriminating questions . . . as long as it recognizes
that the required answers may not be used in a criminal
proceeding and thus eliminates the threat of incrimination");
Baxter, 425 U. S., at 318 ("Had the State desired Palmigiano's
testimony over his Fifth Amendment objection, we can but
assume that it would have extended whatever use immunity
is required by the Federal Constitution"). Petitioners have
not provided any evidence that the program's therapeutic
aims could not be served equally well by granting use immunity. Participants would still obtain all the therapeutic benefits of accepting responsibility and admitting past misconduct; they simply would not incriminate themselves in the
process. At least one State already offers such protection,
see Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 197.440 (West 2001) ("Communications made in the application for or in the course of a sexual
offender's diagnosis and treatment . . . shall be privileged
from disclosure in any civil or criminal proceeding"), and
there is no indication that its choice is incompatible with
rehabilitation. In fact, the program's rehabilitative goals
would likely be furthered by ensuring free and open discus536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sion without the threat of prosecution looming over participants' therapy sessions.

The plurality contends that requiring immunity will undermine the therapeutic goals of the program because once
"inmates know society will not punish them for their past
offenses, they may be left with the false impression that
society does not consider those crimes to be serious ones."
Ante, at 34. See also Brief for 18 States as Amici Curiae 11
("By subjecting offenders to prosecution for newly revealed
offenses, and by adhering to its chosen policy of mandatory
reporting for cases of suspected child sexual abuse, Kansas
reinforces the sensible notion that wrongdoing carries consequences"). The idea that an inmate who is confined to
prison for almost 20 years for an offense could be left with
the impression that his crimes are not serious or that wrongdoing does not carry consequences is absurd. Moreover,
the argument starts from a false premise. Granting use
immunity does not preclude prosecution; it merely prevents
the State from using an inmate's own words, and the fruits
thereof, against him in a subsequent prosecution. New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450, 457-458 (1979). The plurality's
concern might be justified if the State were required to grant
transactional immunity, but we have made clear since Kastigar that use immunity is sufficient to alleviate a potential Fifth Amendment violation, 406 U. S., at 453. Nor is a
State required to grant use immunity in order to have a
sex offender treatment program that involves admission of
responsibility.

Alternatively, the State could continue to pursue its rehabilitative goals without violating participants' Fifth Amendment rights by offering inmates a voluntary program. The
United States points out that an inmate's participation in the
sexual offender treatment program operated by the Federal
Bureau of Prisons is entirely voluntary. "No loss of institutional privileges flows from an inmate's decision not to par536US1 Unit: $U58 [12-16-03 19:15:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ticipate in the program." 12 If an inmate chooses to partici-pate in the federal program, he will be transferred from his

"parent facility" to a "more desirable" prison, but if he re-fuses to participate in the first place, as respondent attempted to do, he suffers no negative consequences. Tr. ofOral Arg. 21-22. Although the inmates in the federal program are not granted use immunity, they are not compelledto participate. Indeed, there is reason to believe successful
rehabilitation is more likely for voluntary participants thanfor those who are compelled to accept treatment. See Abel,
Mittelman, Becker, Rathner, & Rouleau, Predicting ChildMolesters' Response to Treatment, 528 Annals N. Y. Acad. of
Sciences 223 (1988) (finding that greater perceived pressureto participate in treatment is strongly correlated with the
dropout rate).Through its treatment program, Kansas seeks to achieve
the admirable goal of reducing recidivism among sex offend-ers. In the process, however, the State demands an impermissible and unwarranted sacrifice from the participants.No matter what the goal, inmates should not be compelled
to forfeit the privilege against self-incrimination simply be-cause the ends are legitimate or because they have been convicted of sex offenses. Particularly in a case like this one,in which respondent has protested his innocence all along
and is being compelled to confess to a crime that he stillinsists he did not commit, we ought to ask ourselves--what
if this is one of those rare cases in which the jury made a

12 Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27. Because of this material difference between the Kansas and federal programs, recognizing the
compulsion in this case would not cast any doubt on the validity of voluntary programs. The plurality asserts that "the federal program is different from Kansas' SATP only in that it does not require inmates to sacrifice
privileges besides housing as a consequence of nonparticipation." Ante,
at 45 (emphasis added). This statement is inaccurate because, as the
quote in the text reveals, no loss of privileges follows from the decision
not to participate in the federal program.

CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABAL
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-1406. Argued February 27, 2002--Decided June 10, 2002
Respondent Echazabal worked for independent contractors at one of petitioner Chevron U. S. A. Inc.'s oil refineries until Chevron refused to
hire him because of a liver condition--which its doctors said would be
exacerbated by continued exposure to toxins at the refinery--and the
contractor employing him laid him off in response to Chevron's request
that it reassign him to a job without exposure to toxins or remove him
from the refinery. Echazabal filed suit, claiming, among other things,
that Chevron's actions violated the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990 (ADA). Chevron defended under an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation permitting the defense that a
worker's disability on the job would pose a direct threat to his health.
The District Court granted Chevron summary judgment, but the Ninth
Circuit reversed, finding that the regulation exceeded the scope of permissible rulemaking under the ADA.

Held: The ADA permits the EEOC's regulation. Pp. 78-87.

(a) The ADA's discrimination definition covers a number of things an
employer might do to block a disabled person from advancing in the
workplace, such as "using qualification standards . . . that screen out or
tend to screen out [such] an individual," 42 U. S. C. $ 12112(b)(6). And
along with $ 12113(a), the definition creates an affirmative defense for
action under a qualification standard "shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity," which "may include a requirement that
an individual shall not pose a direct threat to the health or safety of
other individuals in the workplace," $ 12113(b). The EEOC's regulation
carries the defense one step further, allowing an employer to screen out
a potential worker with a disability for risks on the job to his own health
or safety. Pp. 78-79.

(b) Echazabal relies on the canon expressio unius exclusio alterius--
expressing one item of an associated group excludes another left unmentioned--for his argument that the ADA, by recognizing only threats to
others, precludes the regulation as a matter of law. The first strike
against the expression-exclusion rule here is in the statute, which includes the threat-to-others provision as an example of legitimate qualifications that are "job-related and consistent with business necessity."
These spacious defensive categories seem to give an agency a good deal

74 CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABAL

Syllabus
of discretion in setting the limits of permissible qualification standards.
And the expansive "may include" phrase points directly away from the
sort of exclusive specifications that Echazabal claims. Strike two is the
failure to identify any series of terms or things that should be understood to go hand in hand, which are abridged in circumstances supporting a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant
to be excluded. Echazabal claims that Congress's adoption only of the
threat-to-others exception in the ADA was a deliberate omission of the
threat-to-self exception included in the EEOC's regulation implementing the precursor Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which has language identical to that in the ADA. But this is not an unequivocal implication of
congressional intent. Because the EEOC was not the only agency interpreting the Rehabilitation Act, its regulation did not establish a clear,
standard pairing of threats to self and others. And, it is likely that
Congress used such language in the ADA knowing what the EEOC had
made of that language under the earlier statute. The third strike is
simply that there is no apparent stopping point to the argument that,
by specifying a threat-to-others defense, Congress intended a negative
implication about those whose safety could be considered. For example, Congress could not have meant that an employer could not defend
a refusal to hire when a worker's disability would threaten others outside the workplace. Pp. 79-84.

(c) Since Congress has not spoken exhaustively on threats to a worker's own health, the regulation can claim adherence under the rule in
Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467
U. S. 837, 843, so long as it makes sense of the statutory defense for
qualification standards that are "job-related and consistent with business necessity." Chevron's reasons for claiming that the regulation is
reasonable include, inter alia, that it allows Chevron to avoid the risk
of violating the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA).
Whether an employer would be liable under OSHA for hiring an individual who consents to a job's particular dangers is an open question, but
the employer would be courting trouble under OSHA. The EEOC's
resolution exemplifies the substantive choices that agencies are expected to make when Congress leaves the intersection of competing
objectives both imprecisely marked and subject to administrative leeway. Nor can the EEOC's resolution be called unreasonable as allowing the kind of workplace paternalism the ADA was meant to outlaw.
The ADA was trying to get at refusals to give an even break to classes
of disabled people, while claiming to act for their own good in reliance
on untested and pretextual stereotypes. This sort of sham protection
is just what the regulation disallows, by demanding a particularized
enquiry into the harms an employee would probably face. Finally, that

the threat-to-self defense reasonably falls within the general "job related" and "business necessity" standard does not reduce the "direct
threat" language to surplusage. The provision made a conclusion clear
that might otherwise have been fought over in litigation or administrative rulemaking. Pp. 84-87.

76 CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABAL

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
A regulation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Com-mission authorizes refusal to hire an individual because his

performance on the job would endanger his own health,owing to a disability. The question in this case is whether
the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 328,42 U. S. C. $ 12101

et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V), permits theregulation.
1 We hold that it does.

I
Beginning in 1972, respondent Mario Echazabal workedfor independent contractors at an oil refinery owned by petitioner Chevron U. S. A. Inc. Twice he applied for a job di-rectly with Chevron, which offered to hire him if he could
pass the company's physical examination. See 42 U. S. C.$ 12112(d)(3) (1994 ed.). Each time, the exam showed liver
abnormality or damage, the cause eventually being identifiedas Hepatitis C, which Chevron's doctors said would be aggravated by continued exposure to toxins at Chevron's refinery.In each instance, the company withdrew the offer, and the
second time it asked the contractor employing Echazabaleither to reassign him to a job without exposure to harmful
chemicals or to remove him from the refinery altogether.The contractor laid him off in early 1996.

Echazabal filed suit, ultimately removed to federal court,claiming, among other things, that Chevron violated the
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA or Act) in refusing to

1 We do not consider the further issue passed upon by the Ninth Circuit,
which held that the respondent is a " `qualified individual' " who "can perform the essential functions of the employment position," 42 U. S. C.

$ 12111(8) (1994 ed.). 226 F. 3d 1063, 1072 (2000). That issue will only
resurface if the Circuit concludes that the decision of respondent's employer to exclude him was not based on the sort of individualized medical
enquiry required by the regulation, an issue on which the District Court
granted summary judgment for petitioner and which we leave to the Ninth
Circuit for initial appellate consideration if warranted.

Opinion of the Court
hire him, or even to let him continue working in the plant,because of a disability, his liver condition.

2 Chevron defended under a regulation of the Equal Employment Oppor-tunity Commission (EEOC) permitting the defense that a

worker's disability on the job would pose a "direct threat" tohis health, see 29 CFR $ 1630.15(b)(2) (2001). Although two
medical witnesses disputed Chevron's judgment that Echaza-bal's liver function was impaired and subject to further damage under the job conditions in the refinery, the DistrictCourt granted summary judgment for Chevron. It held
that Echazabal raised no genuine issue of material fact as towhether the company acted reasonably in relying on its own
doctors' medical advice, regardless of its accuracy.On appeal, the Ninth Circuit asked for briefs on a threshold question not raised before, whether the EEOC's regula-tion recognizing a threat-to-self defense,

ibid., exceeded thescope of permissible rulemaking under the ADA. 226 F. 3d

1063, 1066, n. 3 (2000). The Circuit held that it did and re-versed the summary judgment. The court rested its position on the text of the ADA itself in explicitly recognizingan employer's right to adopt an employment qualification
barring anyone whose disability would place others in theworkplace at risk, while saying nothing about threats to the
disabled employee himself. The majority opinion reasonedthat "by specifying only threats to `other individuals in the
workplace,' the statute makes it clear that threats to otherpersons--including the disabled individual himself--are not
included within the scope of the [direct threat] defense," id.,at 1066-1067, and it indicated that any such regulation would
unreasonably conflict with congressional policy against pa-ternalism in the workplace,

id., at 1067-1070. The courtwent on to reject Chevron's further argument that Echaza2 Chevron did not dispute for purposes of its summary-judgment motion
that Echazabal is "disabled" under the ADA, and Echazabal did not argue
that Chevron could have made a " `reasonable accommodation.' " App.

bal was not " `otherwise qualified' " to perform the job, holding that the ability to perform a job without risk to one's

The decision conflicted with one from the Eleventh Circuit,
Moses v. American Nonwovens, Inc., 97 F. 3d 446, 447 (1996),

Section 102 of the ADA, 104 Stat. 328, 42 U. S. C. $ 12101
et seq., prohibits "discriminat[ion] against a qualified individual with a disability because of the disability . . . in regard
to" a number of actions by an employer, including "hiring."
42 U. S. C. $ 12112(a). The statutory definition of "discriminat[ion]" covers a number of things an employer might do to
block a disabled person from advancing in the workplace,
such as "using qualification standards . . . that screen out
or tend to screen out an individual with a disability."

$ 12112(b)(6). By that same definition, ibid., as well as by
separate provision, $ 12113(a), the Act creates an affirmative
defense for action under a qualification standard "shown to
be job-related for the position in question and . . . consistent
with business necessity." Such a standard may include
"a requirement that an individual shall not pose a direct
threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the
workplace," $ 12113(b), if the individual cannot perform the
job safely with reasonable accommodation, $ 12113(a). By
regulation, the EEOC carries the defense one step further,
in allowing an employer to screen out a potential worker
with a disability not only for risks that he would pose to
others in the workplace but for risks on the job to his own
health or safety as well: "The term `qualification standard'
may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose

Chevron relies on the regulation here, since it says a jobin the refinery would pose a "direct threat" to Echazabal's
health. In seeking deference to the agency, it argues thatnothing in the statute unambiguously precludes such a defense, while the regulation was adopted under authorityexplicitly delegated by Congress, 42 U. S. C. $ 12116, and
after notice-and-comment rulemaking. See United States v.
Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 227 (2001); Chevron U. S. A. Inc.v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837,

842-844 (1984). Echazabal, on the contrary, argues that asa matter of law the statute precludes the regulation, which
he claims would be an unreasonable interpretation even ifthe agency had leeway to go beyond the literal text.

A
As for the textual bar to any agency action as a matterof law, Echazabal says that Chevron loses on the threshold

question whether the statute leaves a gap for the EEOC tofill. See id., at 843-844. Echazabal recognizes the generality of the language providing for a defense when a plaintiffis screened out by "qualification standards" that are "jobrelated and consistent with business necessity" (and reason-able accommodation would not cure the difficulty posed by
employment). 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(a). Without more, thoseprovisions would allow an employer to turn away someone
whose work would pose a serious risk to himself. That pos-sibility is said to be eliminated, however, by the further specification that " `qualification standards' may include a re-quirement that an individual shall not pose a direct threat to
the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace."$ 12113(b); see also $ 12111(3) (defining "direct threat" in
terms of risk to others). Echazabal contrasts this provisionwith an EEOC regulation under the Rehabilitation Act of
1973, 87 Stat. 357, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 701 et seq., ante536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
dating the ADA, which recognized an employer's right toconsider threats both to other workers and to the threatening employee himself. Because the ADA defense provisionrecognizes threats only if they extend to another, Echazabal
reads the statute to imply as a matter of law that threats tothe worker himself cannot count.

The argument follows the reliance of the Ninth Circuit ma-jority on the interpretive canon,

expressio unius est exclusioalterius, "expressing one item of [an] associated group or

series excludes another left unmentioned." United Statesv. Vonn, 535 U. S. 55, 65 (2002). The rule is fine when it
applies, but this case joins some others in showing whenit does not. See, e. g., ibid.; United Dominion Industries,
Inc. v. United States, 532 U. S. 822, 836 (2001); Pauley v.BethEnergy Mines, Inc., 501 U. S. 680, 703 (1991).

The first strike against the expression-exclusion rule hereis right in the text that Echazabal quotes. Congress included the harm-to-others provision as an example of legit-imate qualifications that are "job-related and consistent with
business necessity." These are spacious defensive catego-ries, which seem to give an agency (or in the absence of
agency action, a court) a good deal of discretion in settingthe limits of permissible qualification standards. That discretion is confirmed, if not magnified, by the provision that"qualification standards" falling within the limits of job relation and business necessity "may include" a veto on thosewho would directly threaten others in the workplace. Far
from supporting Echazabal's position, the expansive phrasingof "may include" points directly away from the sort of exclusive specification he claims. United States v. New York
Telephone Co., 434 U. S. 159, 169 (1977); Federal Land Bank
of St. Paul v. Bismarck Lumber Co., 314 U. S. 95, 100 (1941).3

3 In saying that the expansive textual phrases point in the direction of
agency leeway we do not mean that the defense provisions place no limit
on agency rulemaking. Without deciding whether all safety-related qualification standards must satisfy the ADA's direct-threat standard, see Al536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

81Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Just as statutory language suggesting exclusiveness ismissing, so is that essential extrastatutory ingredient of an

expression-exclusion demonstration, the series of terms fromwhich an omission bespeaks a negative implication. The
canon depends on identifying a series of two or more termsor things that should be understood to go hand in hand,
which is abridged in circumstances supporting a sensibleinference that the term left out must have been meant to be
excluded. E. Crawford, Construction of Statutes 337 (1940)(

expressio unius " `properly applies only when in the naturalassociation of ideas in the mind of the reader that which is

expressed is so set over by way of strong contrast to thatwhich is omitted that the contrast enforces the affirmative
inference' " (quoting State ex rel. Curtis v. De Corps, 134Ohio St. 295, 299, 16 N. E. 2d 459, 462 (1938))); United States
v. Vonn, supra.Strike two in this case is the failure to identify any such
established series, including both threats to others andthreats to self, from which Congress appears to have made
a deliberate choice to omit the latter item as a signal of theaffirmative defense's scope. The closest Echazabal comes is
the EEOC's rule interpreting the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,87 Stat. 357, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 701

et seq., a precursorof the ADA. That statute excepts from the definition of a

protected "qualified individual with a handicap" anyone whowould pose a "direct threat to the health or safety of other
individuals," but, like the later ADA, the Rehabilitation
bertson's, Inc. v. Kirkingburg, 527 U. S. 555, 569-570, n. 15 (1999), we assume that some such regulations are implicitly precluded by the Act's
specification of a direct-threat defense, such as those allowing "indirect"
threats of "insignificant" harm. This is so because the definitional and
defense provisions describing the defense in terms of "direct" threats of
"significant" harm, 42 U. S. C. $$ 12113(b), 12111(3), are obviously intended
to forbid qualifications that screen out by reference to general categories
pretextually applied. See infra, at 85-86, and n. 5. Recognizing the "indirect" and "insignificant" would simply reopen the door to pretext by
way of defense.

82 CHEVRON U. S. A. INC. v. ECHAZABAL

Opinion of the Court
Act says nothing about threats to self that particular em-ployment might pose. 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(b). The EEOC

nonetheless extended the exception to cover threat-to-selfemployment, 29 CFR $ 1613.702(f ) (1990), and Echazabal argues that Congress's adoption only of the threat-to-othersexception in the ADA must have been a deliberate omission of the Rehabilitation Act regulation's tandem term ofthreat-to-self, with intent to exclude it.

But two reasons stand in the way of treating the omissionas an unequivocal implication of congressional intent. The
first is that the EEOC was not the only agency interpretingthe Rehabilitation Act, with the consequence that its regulation did not establish a clear, standard pairing of threats toself and others. While the EEOC did amplify upon the text
of the Rehabilitation Act exclusion by recognizing threats toself along with threats to others, three other agencies adopting regulations under the Rehabilitation Act did not. See28 CFR $ 42.540(

l)(1) (1990) (Department of Justice), 29 CFR$ 32.3 (1990) (Department of Labor), and 45 CFR $ 84.3(k)(1)

(1990) (Department of Health and Human Services).4 Itwould be a stretch, then, to say that there was a standard
usage, with its source in agency practice or elsewhere, thatconnected threats to others so closely to threats to self that
leaving out one was like ignoring a twin.Even if we put aside this variety of administrative experience, however, and look no further than the EEOC's Rehabil4 In fact, we have said that the regulations issued by the Department of
Health and Human Services, which had previously been the regulations
of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, are of "particular
significance" in interpreting the Rehabilitation Act because "HEW was
the agency responsible for coordinating the implementation and enforcement of $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 794," prohibiting discrimination against individuals with disabilities by recipients of federal
funds. Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams, 534 U. S. 184, 195 (2002).
Unfortunately for Echazabal's argument, the congruence of the ADA with
the HEW regulations does not produce an unequivocal statement of congressional intent.

536US1 Unit: $U59 [12-16-03 19:17:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

83Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
itation Act regulation pairing self and others, the congres-sional choice to speak only of threats to others would still be

equivocal. Consider what the ADA reference to threats toothers might have meant on somewhat different facts. If
the Rehabilitation Act had spoken only of "threats to health"and the EEOC regulation had read that to mean threats to
self or others, a congressional choice to be more specific in
the ADA by listing threats to others but not threats to selfwould have carried a message. The most probable reading

would have been that Congress understood what a failureto specify could lead to and had made a choice to limit the
possibilities. The statutory basis for any agency rulemaking under the ADA would have been different from its
basis under the Rehabilitation Act and would have indicated
a difference in the agency's rulemaking discretion. But
these are not the circumstances here. Instead of making
the ADA different from the Rehabilitation Act on the point
at issue, Congress used identical language, knowing full well
what the EEOC had made of that language under the earlier
statute. Did Congress mean to imply that the agency had
been wrong in reading the earlier language to allow it to
recognize threats to self, or did Congress just assume
that the agency was free to do under the ADA what it had
already done under the earlier Act's identical language?
There is no way to tell. Omitting the EEOC's reference to
self-harm while using the very language that the EEOC
had read as consistent with recognizing self-harm is equivocal at best. No negative inference is possible.

There is even a third strike against applying the
expression-exclusion rule here. It is simply that there is no
apparent stopping point to the argument that by specifying
a threat-to-others defense Congress intended a negative
implication about those whose safety could be considered.
When Congress specified threats to others in the workplace,
for example, could it possibly have meant that an employer
could not defend a refusal to hire when a worker's disability

Opinion of the Court
would threaten others outside the workplace? If TyphoidMary had come under the ADA, would a meat packer have

been defenseless if Mary had sued after being turned away?See 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(d). Expressio unius just fails to
work here. B

Since Congress has not spoken exhaustively on threats toa worker's own health, the agency regulation can claim adherence under the rule in Chevron, 467 U. S., at 843, so longas it makes sense of the statutory defense for qualification
standards that are "job-related and consistent with businessnecessity." 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(a). Chevron's reasons for
calling the regulation reasonable are unsurprising: moralconcerns aside, it wishes to avoid time lost to sickness, excessive turnover from medical retirement or death, litigationunder state tort law, and the risk of violating the national
Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1590,as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 651

et seq. Although Echazabalclaims that none of these reasons is legitimate, focusing on

the concern with OSHA will be enough to show that theregulation is entitled to survive.

Echazabal points out that there is no known instance ofOSHA enforcement, or even threatened enforcement, against
an employer who relied on the ADA to hire a worker willingto accept a risk to himself from his disability on the job. In
Echazabal's mind, this shows that invoking OSHA policy andpossible OSHA liability is just a red herring to excuse covert
discrimination. But there is another side to this. The textof OSHA itself says its point is "to assure so far as possible
every working man and woman in the Nation safe andhealthful working conditions," $ 651(b), and Congress specifically obligated an employer to "furnish to each of his em-ployees employment and a place of employment which are
free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likelyto cause death or serious physical harm to his employees," $ 654(a)(1). Although there may be an open question

85Cite as: 536 U. S. 73 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
whether an employer would actually be liable under OSHAfor hiring an individual who knowingly consented to the particular dangers the job would pose to him, see Brief forUnited States et al. as Amici Curiae 19, n. 7, there is no
denying that the employer would be asking for trouble: hisdecision to hire would put Congress's policy in the ADA, a
disabled individual's right to operate on equal terms withinthe workplace, at loggerheads with the competing policy of
OSHA, to ensure the safety of "each" and "every" worker.Courts would, of course, resolve the tension if there were
no agency action, but the EEOC's resolution exemplifies thesubstantive choices that agencies are expected to make when
Congress leaves the intersection of competing objectivesboth imprecisely marked but subject to the administrative
leeway found in 42 U. S. C. $ 12113(a).Nor can the EEOC's resolution be fairly called unreasonable as allowing the kind of workplace paternalism the ADAwas meant to outlaw. It is true that Congress had paternalism in its sights when it passed the ADA, see $ 12101(a)(5)(recognizing "overprotective rules and policies" as a form of
discrimination). But the EEOC has taken this to mean thatCongress was not aiming at an employer's refusal to place
disabled workers at a specifically demonstrated risk, but wastrying to get at refusals to give an even break to classes of
disabled people, while claiming to act for their own good inreliance on untested and pretextual stereotypes.

5 Its regu5 Echazabal's contention that the Act's legislative history is to the contrary is unpersuasive. Although some of the comments within the legislative history decry paternalism in general terms, see, e. g., H. R. Rep.
No. 101-485, pt. 2, p. 72 (1990) ("It is critical that paternalistic concerns
for the disabled person's own safety not be used to disqualify an otherwise
qualified applicant"); ADA Conf. Rep., 136 Cong. Rec. 17377 (1990) (statement of Sen. Kennedy) ("[A]n employer could not use as an excuse for not
hiring a person with HIV disease the claim that the employer was simply
`protecting the individual' from opportunistic diseases to which the individual might be exposed"), those comments that elaborate actually express
the more pointed concern that such justifications are usually pretextual,

Opinion of the Court
lation disallows just this sort of sham protection, throughdemands for a particularized enquiry into the harms the employee would probably face. The direct threat defense mustbe "based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on
the most current medical knowledge and/or the best avail-able objective evidence," and upon an expressly "individualized assessment of the individual's present ability to safelyperform the essential functions of the job," reached after
considering, among other things, the imminence of the riskand the severity of the harm portended. 29 CFR $ 1630.2(r)
(2001). The EEOC was certainly acting within the reason-able zone when it saw a difference between rejecting workplace paternalism and ignoring specific and documented risksto the employee himself, even if the employee would take his
chances for the sake of getting a job.6
rooted in generalities and misperceptions about disabilities. See, e. g.,
H. R. Rep. No. 101-485, at 74 ("Generalized fear about risks from the
employment environment, such as exacerbation of the disability caused by
stress, cannot be used by an employer to disqualify a person with a disability"); S. Rep. No. 101-116, p. 28 (1989) ("It would also be a violation to
deny employment to an applicant based on generalized fears about the
safety of the applicant . . . . By definition, such fears are based on averages and group-based predictions. This legislation requires individualized assessments").

Similarly, Echazabal points to several of our decisions expressing concern under Title VII, which like the ADA allows employers to defend
otherwise discriminatory practices that are "consistent with business necessity," 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2(k), with employers adopting rules that exclude women from jobs that are seen as too risky. See, e. g., Dothard
v. Rawlinson, 433 U. S. 321, 335 (1977); Automobile Workers v. Johnson
Controls, Inc., 499 U. S. 187, 202 (1991). Those cases, however, are beside
the point, as they, like Title VII generally, were concerned with paternalistic judgments based on the broad category of gender, while the EEOC has
required that judgments based on the direct threat provision be made on
the basis of individualized risk assessments.

6 Respect for this distinction does not entail the requirement, as Echazabal claims, that qualification standards be "neutral," stating what the job
requires, as distinct from a worker's disqualifying characteristics. Brief
for Respondent 26. It is just as much business necessity for skyscraper

Opinion of the Court
Finally, our conclusions that some regulation is permissi-ble and this one is reasonable are not open to Echazabal's

objection that they reduce the direct threat provision to"surplusage," see Babbitt v. Sweet Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687, 698 (1995). The merefact that a threat-to-self defense reasonably falls within the
general "job related" and "business necessity" standard doesnot mean that Congress accomplished nothing with its explicit provision for a defense based on threats to others.The provision made a conclusion clear that might otherwise
have been fought over in litigation or administrative rule-making. It did not lack a job to do merely because the
EEOC might have adopted the same rule later in applyingthe general defense provisions, nor was its job any less responsible simply because the agency was left with the optionto go a step further. A provision can be useful even without
congressional attention being indispensable.Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of
Appeals and remand the case for proceedings consistentwith this opinion.

It is so ordered.

contractors to have steelworkers without vertigo as to have well-balanced

not turn on formalism. We have no occasion, however, to try to describe
how acutely an employee must exhibit a disqualifying condition before an
employer may exclude him from the class of the generally qualified. See
Brief for Respondent 31. This is a job for the trial courts in the first
instance.

JPMORGAN CHASE BANK v. TRAFFIC STREAM(BVI) INFRASTRUCTURE LTD.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 01-651. Argued April 17, 2002--Decided June 10, 2002
Respondent Traffic Stream (BVI) Infrastructure Ltd. is a corporation organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), an Overseas
Territory of the United Kingdom. In 1998, petitioner, then known as
Chase Manhattan Bank, agreed to finance some Traffic Stream ventures,
with the contract to be governed by New York law and with Traffic
Stream agreeing to submit to the jurisdiction of federal courts in Manhattan. Chase subsequently sued Traffic Stream for defaulting on its
obligations. The District Court for the Southern District of New York
found subject-matter jurisdiction under the alienage diversity statute,
28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a)(2)--which gives district courts jurisdiction over
civil actions where the controversy, inter alia, is "between citizens of a
State and citizens or subjects of a foreign state"--and granted Chase
summary judgment. In reversing, the Second Circuit found that, because Traffic Stream was a citizen of an Overseas Territory and not an
independent foreign state, jurisdiction was lacking.

Held: A corporation organized under the laws of the BVI is a "citize[n]

or subjec[t] of a foreign state" for the purposes of alienage diversity
jurisdiction. Pp. 91-100.

(a) A corporation of a foreign state is deemed that state's subject for
jurisdiction purposes. Steamship Co. v. Tugman, 106 U. S. 118, 121.
Although Traffic Stream was organized under BVI law and the BVI is
unrecognized by the United States Executive Branch as an independent
foreign state, this Court has never held that the requisite status as
citizen or subject must be held directly from a formally recognized state,
as distinct from that state's legal dependency; and any such distinction
would be entirely beside the point of the alienage jurisdiction statute.
Pp. 91-92.

(b) The BVI Constitution was established by the Crown of the United
Kingdom. The United Kingdom exercises pervasive authority over the
BVI, e. g., the Queen may annul any BVI statute and make laws for the
BVI. The Crown's representatives have imposed laws and international obligations on the BVI. In a practical sense, then, the statutes
permitting incorporation in the BVI are enacted in the exercise of the
United Kingdom's political authority, and it seems fair to regard a BVI

89Cite as: 536 U. S. 88 (2002)
Syllabus
company as a citizen or subject of this ultimate political authority.
Pp. 92-94.

(c) Whether, as the Second Circuit posits, the relationship between
the United Kingdom and its territories is too attenuated for that state
to be viewed as a governing authority for $ 1332(a)(2) purposes depends
upon the statute's objective. The state courts' penchant before and
after the Revolution to disrupt international relations and discourage
foreign investment led directly to the alienage jurisdiction provided by
Article III of the Constitution. The First Congress granted federal
courts such jurisdiction, and the statute was amended in 1875 to track
Article III's language. The similarity of $ 1332(a)(2) to Article III thus
bespeaks a shared purpose. The relationship between the BVI's powers over corporations and the sources of those powers in Crown and
Parliament places the United Kingdom well within the range of concern
that Article III and $ 1332(a)(2) address. It exercises ultimate authority over the BVI's statutory law and responsibility for the BVI's external relations. Pp. 94-97.

(d) Two flaws defeat Traffic Stream's alternative argument that, because the United Kingdom does not recognize BVI residents as citizens
or subjects, and because corporations are legally nothing more than a
collection of shareholders residing in the corporation's jurisdiction, Traffic Stream is not a citizen or subject under the alienage diversity statute.
First, its outdated notion that corporate citizenship derives from natural
persons has long since been replaced by the conception of corporations
as independent legal entities. Second, it fails to recognize that jurisdictional analysis under United States law is not governed by United
Kingdom law. Traffic Stream's status under United Kingdom law does
not disqualify it from being a citizen or subject under the domestic statute at issue. Section 1332(a)(2) has no room for the suggestion that
members of a polity, under a sovereign's authority, do not qualify as
"subjects" merely because they enjoy fewer rights than other members
do. Because Traffic Stream concedes that BVI citizens are "nationals"
of the United Kingdom, it is immaterial that United Kingdom law may
provide different rights of abode for individuals in the territories.
Pp. 97-99.

Opinion of the Court
Chase subsequently charged Traffic Stream with default-ing on its obligations. It sued in the United States District

Court for the Southern District of New York, which foundsubject-matter jurisdiction under the alienage diversity statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a)(2), and granted summary judgmentto Chase. When Traffic Stream appealed, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sua sponte raisedthe question whether Traffic Stream was a citizen or subject
of a foreign state for the purposes of alienage diversity juris-diction. The court relied on its precedent in

Matimak Trad-ing Co. v. Khalily, 118 F. 3d 76 (1997), in answering that

because Traffic Stream was a citizen of an Overseas Terri-tory and not an independent foreign state, jurisdiction was
lacking. 251 F. 3d 334, 337 (2001). The judgment of theDistrict Court was reversed, and the case ordered to be remanded with instructions to dismiss the complaint. Ibid.Chase was denied rehearing en banc.

law, a corporation has the nationality of the state under thelaws of which the corporation is organized"). In spite of this

general rule of corporate citizenship, this case presents twoissues about the application of the statute to Traffic Stream:
whether Traffic Stream has been incorporated under thelaws of a "foreign state" given the BVI's status as an Overseas Territory, and whether the BVI's corporate citizens are"citizens or subjects" within the meaning of $ 1332(a)(2).

A
The argument that the status of the BVI renders the stat-ute inapplicable begins by assuming that Traffic Stream, organized under BVI law, must be a citizen or subject of theBVI alone. Since the BVI is a British Overseas Territory,
unrecognized by the United States Executive Branch as anindependent foreign state, it is supposed to follow that for
purposes of alienage jurisdiction Traffic Stream is not a citi-zen or subject of a "foreign state" within the meaning of

$ 1332(a)(2).Even on the assumption, however, that a foreign state
must be diplomatically recognized by our own Governmentto qualify as such under the jurisdictional statute (an issue
we need not decide here), we have never held that the requi-site status as citizen or subject must be held directly from a
formally recognized state, as distinct from such a state'slegal dependency. On the contrary, a consideration of the
relationships of the BVI and the recognized state of theUnited Kingdom convinces us that any such distinction
would be entirely beside the point of the statute providingalienage jurisdiction.

The current BVI Constitution was established when theCrown of the United Kingdom, in the exercise of power

granted by the West Indies Act, 1962, c. 19, $ 5(1), issuedthe Virgin Islands (Constitution) Order 1976, SI 1976/2145.
Under that order, the United Kingdom exercises pervasive

Opinion of the Court
authority over the territory. The Constitution provides, forexample, that the BVI Government shall include a Governor

and Deputy Governor appointed by the Queen to "hold officeduring Her Majesty's pleasure,"

id., pt. II, $ 3(1), an Executive Council mainly appointed by the Governor on thebasis of the popular election for the Legislative Council,

$$ 14-15, and a Legislature comprising the Queen and a Legislative Council of mainly popularly elected representatives,$$ 25-26.

Bills take effect as laws only when approved by the royallyappointed Governor or by the Queen acting through a Secretary of State, $ 42. The Governor is instructed to withhold
assent from any bill that may conflict with the laws of the
United Kingdom or is "likely to prejudice the Royal prerogative." $ 42(2)(b). The Queen, acting through a Secretary
of State, has authority to annul any BVI statute, $ 43(1),
and "[t]here is reserved to Her Majesty full power to make
laws for the peace, order and good government of the Virgin
Islands," $ 71. "[I]f the Legislative Council fails to pass . . .
a Bill or motion . . . the Governor may, at any time that he
thinks fit, . . . declare that such Bill or motion shall have
effect as if it had been passed . . . ." $ 44.

The Crown's representatives have not slept on their powers, which have recently been exercised to impose laws and
international obligations upon the territory, as in the Caribbean Territories (Abolition of Death Penalty for Murder)
Order 1991, and the Merchant Shipping (Salvage Convention) (Overseas Territories) Order 1997, the latter of which
brought the BVI into compliance with the International Convention on Salvage, 1989. In a very practical sense, then,
the statutes that permit incorporation in the BVI, see BVI
Companies Act (CAP. 285); BVI International Business Companies Act (CAP. 291), are laws enacted in the exercise of
the political authority of the United Kingdom, and it seems
fair to regard a BVI company as a citizen or subject of this
ultimate political authority. This view of the relationship

Opinion of the Court

seems especially reasonable when such a corporation is en-gaged in an international transaction, since the United Kingdom acts on the BVI's behalf in the international arena. See6 Halsbury, Laws of England || 983, p. 471 (4th ed. 1991)
("Her Majesty's government in the United Kingdom is in-ternationally responsible for the external affairs of United
Kingdom dependent territories"); see also United NationsAct, 1946, c. 45 (empowering the Crown to bring "His Majesty's dominions" into compliance with directives of the UnitedNations Security Council).

The Second Circuit nonetheless takes the position that therelationship between the United Kingdom and its territories

is "too attenuated" for the United Kingdom to be viewedas a governing authority for purposes of the relationship
assumed by $ 1332(a)(2). Matimak Trading Co., 118 F. 3d,at 86. This, of course, depends upon the statute's objective.

Both during and after the Revolution, state courts werenotoriously frosty to British creditors trying to collect debts
from American citizens, and state legislatures went so faras to hobble British debt collection by statute, despite the
specific provision of the 1783 Treaty of Paris that creditorsin the courts of either country would "meet with no lawful
impediment" to debt collection. Definitive Treaty of Peace,United States-Great Britain, Art. IV, 8 Stat. 82. See Holt,
"To Establish Justice": Politics, the Judiciary Act of 1789,and the Invention of the Federal Courts, 1989 Duke L. J.
1421, 1438-1449. Ultimately, the States' refusal to honorthe treaty became serious enough to prompt protests by
the British Secretary of State, particularly when irked byAmerican demands for treaty compliance on the British side.
See 31 Journals of the Continental Congress, 1774-1789,pp. 781-784 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1934).

This penchant of the state courts to disrupt internationalrelations and discourage foreign investment led directly to
the alienage jurisdiction provided by Article III of the Con536US1 Unit: $U60 [12-19-02 08:44:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

95Cite as: 536 U. S. 88 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
stitution. See U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 2 (federal jurisdiction"extend[s] to . . . Controversies . . . between a State, or the

Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects")."[T]he proponents of the Constitution . . . made it quite clear
that the elimination or amelioration of difficulties with creditwas the principal reason for having the alienage and diversity jurisdictions, and that it was one of the most important
reasons for a federal judiciary." Holt, supra, at 1473. Thisis how James Wilson put it during the debates at the Pennsylvania ratification convention:

"Let us suppose the case, that a wicked law is made insome one of the states, enabling a debtor to pay his creditor with the fourth, fifth, or sixth part of the real value
of the debt, and this creditor, a foreigner, complains tohis prince . . . of the injustice that has been done him. . . .

Bound by inclination, as well as duty, to redress thewrong his subject sustains . . . [h]e must therefore apply
to the United States; the United States must be account-able. `My subject has received a flagrant injury: do me
justice, or I will do myself justice.' If the United Statesare answerable for the injury, ought they not to possess
the means of compelling the faulty state to repair it?They ought; and this is what is done here. For now,
if complaint is made in consequence of such injustice,
Congress can answer, `Why did not your subject applyto the General Court . . . ?' " 2 Debates on the Federal

Constitution 493 (J. Elliot ed. 1876) (hereinafter Elliot'sDebates).

Wilson emphasized that in order to "extend our manufactures and our commerce" there would need to be a "proper
security . . . provided for the regular discharge of contracts.
This security cannot be obtained, unless we give the power
of deciding upon those contracts to the general government."
Id., at 492. His concerns were echoed by James Madison:
"We well know, sir, that foreigners cannot get justice done

them in these courts, and this has prevented many wealthygentlemen from trading or residing among us." 3

id., at 583.
Madison also remarked that alienage jurisdiction was neces-sary to "avoid controversies with foreign powers" so that a

single State's courts would not "drag the whole communityinto war."

Id., at 534; see also The Federalist No. 80, p. 536
(J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) ("[A]n unjust sentence
against a foreigner [may] be an aggression upon his sover-eign" rendering alienage jurisdiction "essential to . . . the

security of the public tranquility").Thus, the First Congress granted federal courts the alienage jurisdiction authorized in the Constitution, even while
general federal-question jurisdiction was withheld. See Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, $ 11, 1 Stat. 78 (providing for jurisdiction where "an alien is a party" and more than $500 in
controversy). The language of the statute was amended in
1875 to track Article III by replacing the word "aliens" with
"citizens, or subjects," Act of Mar. 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 470, the
phrase that remains today. Although there is no need here
to decide whether the current drafting provides jurisdiction
up to the constitutional hilt, cf. Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, 152 U. S. 454 (1894) (despite similar language,
federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. $ 1331 does not
extend as far as Article III), there is no doubt that the similarity of $ 1332(a)(2) to Article III bespeaks a shared purpose.

The relationship between the BVI's powers over corporations and the sources of those powers in Crown and Parliament places the United Kingdom well within the range of
concern addressed by Article III and $ 1332(a)(2). The
United Kingdom exercises ultimate authority over the BVI's
statutory law, including its corporate law and the law of corporate charter, and it exercises responsibility for the BVI's
external relations. These exercises of power and responsibility point to just the kind of relationship that the Framers
believed would bind sovereigns "by inclination, as well as
duty, to redress the wrong[s]" against their nationals, 2 El536US1 Unit: $U60 [12-19-02 08:44:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom to protect, asagainst foreign Powers, . . . [c]orporations owing their existence to the law in force in the United Kingdom and colo-nies"). Any doubters may consult the United Kingdom's
own filings in this matter and others comparable, which ex-press apprehension that expulsion of corporations like Traffic
Stream from federal courts would cloud investment opportu-nity and raise the sort of threat to "the security of the public
tranquility" that the Framers hoped to avoid. See, e. g.,Brief for Government of United Kingdom of Great Britain

B
Traffic Stream's alternative argument is that BVI corpora-tions are not "citizens or subjects" of the United Kingdom.

Traffic Stream begins with the old fiction that a corporationis just an association of shareholders, presumed to reside
in the place of incorporation, see, e. g., Tugman, 106 U. S.,at 120-121, with the result that, for jurisdictional purposes,
a suit against the corporation should be understood as a suitagainst the shareholders, see

id., at 121. Traffic Stream pro-ceeds to read the British Nationality Act, 1981, as a declaration by the United Kingdom that BVI residents are not itscitizens or subjects, but mere "nationals," without the rights
and privileges of citizens or subjects, such as the right totravel freely within the United Kingdom. See I. Macdonald & N. Blake, Macdonald's Immigration Law and Practicein the United Kingdom 130-131 (4th ed. 1995) (describing

Opinion of the Court

categories of United Kingdom citizenship).2 Traffic Streaminsists that because it is legally nothing more than a collection of noncitizen individuals, the corporation itself cannot betreated as deserving of access to the courts of the United
States under a statute that opens them to foreign citizensand subjects.

The less important flaw in the argument is its reliance on
the outdated legal construct of corporations as collections ofshareholders linked by contract, see M. Horwitz, The Transformation of American Law 1870-1960, pp. 69-93 (1992), aview long since replaced by the conception of corporations as
independent legal entities, see id., at 93-107.3 Thus, TrafficStream's whole notion of corporate citizenship derived from
natural persons is irrelevant to jurisdictional enquiry in theUnited States today.

But the argument's more significant weakness is its failureto recognize that jurisdictional analysis under the law of
the United States is not ultimately governed by the law
of the United Kingdom, whatever that may be. While it is
perfectly true that "every independent nation [has the inherent right] to determine for itself . . . what classes of persons
shall be entitled to its citizenship," United States v. Wong
Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649, 668 (1898), our jurisdictional concern
here is with the meaning of "citizen" and "subject" as those

2 Ironically, in passing the British Nationality Act, 1981, c. 61, $ 36, the
United Kingdom identified one goal as "reducing statelessness."

3 Indeed, Congress itself rejected the earlier rule in 1958 when it provided that "a corporation shall be deemed to be a citizen of any State by
which it has been incorporated and of the State where it has its principal
place of business." 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(c)(1). There has been raised some
question as to whether $ 1332(c) applies to foreign, as well as domestic,
corporations, although those Circuits that have reached the issue are
in agreement that $ 1332(c) extends to alien corporations. See Danjaq,
S. A. v. Pathe Communications Corp., 979 F. 2d 772, 773-774 (CA9 1992);
Vareka Investment, N. V. v. American Investment Properties, Inc., 724
F. 2d 907, 909 (CA11 1984); Jerguson v. Blue Dot Investment, Inc., 659 F.
2d 31, 35 (CA5 1981). There is no need for us to weigh in on this point.

Opinion of the Court
terms are used in $ 1332(a)(2). In fact, we have no needeven to decide whether Traffic Stream's reading of the British Nationality Act is wrong, as the United Kingdom says itis,

4 but only whether the status Traffic Stream claims under

the Nationality Act would so operate on the law of theUnited States as to disqualify it from being a citizen or subject under the domestic statute before us here. We thinkthere is nothing disqualifying.

Although the word "citizen" may imply (and in 1789 and1875 may have implied) the enjoyment of certain basic rights
and privileges, see Black's Law Dictionary 237 (7th ed. 1999)(defining "citizen" as "entitled to enjoy all its civil rights and
protections" of a community), a "subject" is merely "[o]newho owes allegiance to a sovereign and is governed by that
sovereign's laws," id., at 1438. Thus, contrary to TrafficStream's view, the text of $ 1332(a)(2) has no room for the
suggestion that members of a polity, under the authority ofa sovereign, fail to qualify as "subjects" merely because they
enjoy fewer rights than other members do. For good or ill,many societies afford greater rights to some of its members
than others without any suggestion that the less favoredones have ceased to be "citizens or subjects." And although
some persons, like resident aliens, may live within a foreignstate without being treated under American law as members
of that particular polity, cf. Wong Kim Ark, supra, at 660(" `children . . . born in a place . . . then occupied . . . by
conquest, are still aliens' "), Traffic Stream concedes thatBVI citizens are at least "nationals" of the United Kingdom.
See Brief for Respondent 25. Given the object of the alien-age statute, as explained earlier, there is no serious question that "nationals" were meant to be amenable to the juris-diction of the federal courts, leaving it immaterial for our
purposes that the law of the United Kingdom may providedifferent rights of abode for individuals in the territories.

Northern Ireland as Amicus Curiae 12-13.

III
Because our opinion accords with the positions taken bythe Governments of the United Kingdom, the BVI, and the

United States, the case presents no issue of deference thatmay be due to the various interested governments. It is
enough to hold that the United Kingdom's retention and ex-ercise of authority over the BVI renders BVI citizens, both
natural and juridic, "citizens or subjects" of the United King-dom under 28 U. S. C. $ 1332(a). We therefore reverse the
judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.

NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION

v. MORGAN

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 00-1614. Argued January 9, 2002--Decided June 10, 2002
Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a plaintiff "shall" file an

employment discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) either 180 or 300 days after an "alleged
unlawful employment practice occurred." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e)(1).
Respondent Morgan, a black male, filed a charge of discrimination and
retaliation with the EEOC against petitioner National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), and cross-filed with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. He alleged that he had been
subjected to discrete discriminatory and retaliatory acts and had experienced a racially hostile work environment throughout his employment.
The EEOC issued a "Notice of Right to Sue," and Morgan filed this
lawsuit. While some of the allegedly discriminatory acts occurred
within 300 days of the time that Morgan filed his EEOC charge, many
took place prior to that time period. The District Court granted Amtrak summary judgment in part, holding that the company could not be
liable for conduct occurring outside of the 300-day filing period. The
Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that a plaintiff may sue on claims that
would ordinarily be time barred so long as they either are "sufficiently
related" to incidents that fall within the statutory period or are part of
a systematic policy or practice of discrimination that took place, at least
in part, within the period.

Held: A Title VII plaintiff raising claims of discrete discriminatory or retaliatory acts must file his charge within the appropriate 180- or 300-day
period, but a charge alleging a hostile work environment will not be
time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period; in neither
instance is a court precluded from applying equitable doctrines that may
toll or limit the time period. Pp. 108-122.

(a) Strict adherence to Title VII's timely filing requirements is the
best guarantee of evenhanded administration of the law. Mohasco
Corp. v. Silver, 447 U. S. 807, 826. In a State having an entity authorized to grant or seek relief with respect to the alleged unlawful practice,
an employee who initially files a grievance with that agency must file
the charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the employment practice;

536US1 Unit: $U61 [12-22-03 07:32:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
102 NATIONAL RAILROAD PASSENGER CORPORATION

v. MORGAN

Syllabus

in all other States, the charge must be filed within 180 days. $ 2000e-
5(e)(1). The operative statutory terms of $ 2000e-5(e)(1), the charge
filing provision, are "shall," "after . . . occurred," and "unlawful employment practice." "[S]hall" makes the act of filing a charge within the
specified time period mandatory. "[O]ccurred" means that the practice
took place or happened in the past. The requirement, therefore, that
the charge be filed "after" the practice "occurred" means that a litigant
has up to 180 or 300 days after the unlawful practice happened to file
with the EEOC. The critical questions for both discrete discriminatory
acts and hostile work environment claims are: What constitutes an "unlawful employment practice" and when has that practice "occurred"?
The answer varies with the practice. Pp. 108-110.

(b) A party must file a charge within either 180 or 300 days of the
date that a discrete retaliatory or discriminatory act "occurred" or lose
the ability to recover for it. Morgan asserts that the term "practice"
provides a statutory basis for the Ninth Circuit's continuing violation
doctrine because it connotes an ongoing violation that can endure or
recur over a period of time. This argument is unavailing, however,
given that $ 2000e-2 explains in great detail the sorts of actions
that qualify as "[u]nlawful employment practices," including among
them numerous discrete acts, without indicating in any way that the
term "practice" converts related discrete acts into a single unlawful
practice for timely filing purposes. And the Court has repeatedly interpreted the term "practice" to apply to a discrete act of single "occurence," even where it has a connection to other acts. Several principles
may be derived from Electrical Workers v. Robbins & Myers, Inc.,
429 U. S. 229, 234-235; United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U. S. 553,
558; and Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250, 257. First,
discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when
they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges. Because each
discrete act starts a new clock for filing charges alleging that act, the
charge must be filed within the 180- or 300-day period after the act
occurred. The existence of past acts and the employee's prior knowledge of their occurrence, however, does not bar employees from filing
charges about related discrete acts so long as the acts are independently
discriminatory and charges addressing those acts are themselves timely
filed. Nor does the statute bar an employee from using the prior acts
as background evidence to support a timely claim. In addition, the time
period for filing a charge remains subject to application of equitable
doctrines such as waiver, estoppel, and tolling. See Zipes v. Trans
World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393. While Morgan alleged that
he suffered from numerous discriminatory and retaliatory acts from the
date he was hired through the date he was fired, only those acts
that occurred within the applicable 300-day filing period are actionable.

103Cite as: 536 U. S. 101 (2002)
Syllabus
All prior discrete discriminatory acts are untimely filed and no longer
actionable. Pp. 110-115.

(c) Hostile work environment claims are different in kind from discrete acts. Because their very nature involves repeated conduct, the
"unlawful employment practice," $ 2000e-5(e)(1), cannot be said to occur
on any particular day. It occurs over a series of days or perhaps years
and, in direct contrast to discrete acts, a single act of harassment may
not be actionable on its own. See Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc., 510
U. S. 17, 21. Determining whether an actionable hostile environment
claim exists requires an examination of all the circumstances, including
the frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is
physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and
whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance. Id., at 23. The question whether a court may, for purposes of
determining liability, review all such conduct, including those acts that
occur outside the filing period, turns on the statutory requirement that
a charge be filed within a certain number of days "after the alleged
unlawful employment practice occurred." Because such a claim is composed of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one "unlawful employment practice," it does not matter that some of the component
acts fall outside the statutory time period. Provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time
period of the hostile environment may be considered for the purposes
of determining liability. That act need not be the last act. Subsequent
events may still be part of the one claim, and a charge may be filed at
a later date and still encompass the whole. Therefore, a court's task is
to determine whether the acts about which an employee complains are
part of the same actionable hostile work environment practice, and if so,
whether any act falls within the statutory time period. To support his
hostile environment claim, Morgan presented evidence that managers
made racial jokes, performed racially derogatory acts, and used various
racial epithets. Although many of these acts occurred outside the 300-
day filing period, it cannot be said that they are not part of the same
actionable hostile environment claim. Pp. 115-121.

(d) The Court's holding does not leave employers defenseless when a
plaintiff unreasonably delays filing a charge. The filing period is subject to waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling when equity so requires,
Zipes, supra, at 398, and an employer may raise a laches defense if the
plaintiff unreasonably delays in filing and as a result harms the defendant, see, e. g., Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 424-425.

Opinion of the Court
VII plaintiff file a charge with the Equal Employment Op-portunity Commission (EEOC) either 180 or 300 days "after

the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." Weconsider whether, and under what circumstances, a Title VII
plaintiff may file suit on events that fall outside this statu-tory time period.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuitheld that a plaintiff may sue on claims that would ordinarily
be time barred so long as they either are "sufficiently re-lated" to incidents that fall within the statutory period or
are part of a systematic policy or practice of discriminationthat took place, at least in part, within the limitations period.
We reverse in part and affirm in part. We hold that thestatute precludes recovery for discrete acts of discrimination
or retaliation that occur outside the statutory time period.We also hold that consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged out-side the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as an act contributing tothat hostile environment takes place within the statutory
time period. The application of equitable doctrines, how-ever, may either limit or toll the time period within which
an employee must file a charge.

I
On February 27, 1995, Abner J. Morgan, Jr., a black male,filed a charge of discrimination and retaliation against Amtrak with the EEOC and cross-filed with the California De-partment of Fair Employment and Housing. Morgan alleged that during the time period that he worked for Amtrakhe was "consistently harassed and disciplined more harshly
than other employees on account of his race." 1 App. to Pet.

1 Such discrimination, he alleges, began when the company hired him
in August 1990 as an electrician helper, rather than as an electrician.
Subsequent alleged racially motivated discriminatory acts included a termination for refusing to follow orders, Amtrak's refusal to allow him to

Opinion of the Court

for Cert. 25a. The EEOC issued a "Notice of Right to Sue"on July 3, 1996, and Morgan filed this lawsuit on October 2,

1996. While some of the allegedly discriminatory acts aboutwhich Morgan complained occurred within 300 days of the
time that he filed his charge with the EEOC, many tookplace prior to that time period. Amtrak filed a motion, arguing, among other things, that it was entitled to summaryjudgment on all incidents that occurred more than 300 days
before the filing of Morgan's EEOC charge. The DistrictCourt granted summary judgment in part to Amtrak, holding that the company could not be liable for conduct occurring before May 3, 1994, because that conduct fell outside ofthe 300-day filing period. The court employed a test established by the United States Court of Appeals for the SeventhCircuit in

Galloway v. General Motors Service Parts Operations, 78 F. 3d 1164 (1996): A "plaintiff may not base [the]suit on conduct that occurred outside the statute of limitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect theplaintiff to sue before the statute ran on that conduct, as in
a case in which the conduct could constitute, or be recognized, as actionable harassment only in the light of eventsthat occurred later, within the period of the statute of limitations." Id., at 1167. The District Court held that "[b]e-cause Morgan believed that he was being discriminated
against at the time that all of these acts occurred, it wouldnot be unreasonable to expect that Morgan should have filed
an EEOC charge on these acts before the limitations periodon these claims ran." App. to Pet. for Cert. 40a.

Morgan appealed. The United States Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit reversed, relying on its previous articuparticipate in an apprenticeship program, numerous "written counselings"
for absenteeism, as well as the use of racial epithets against him by his
managers.

2 The District Court denied summary judgment to Amtrak with respect

to those claims it held were timely filed. The remaining claims then proceeded to trial, where the jury returned a verdict in favor of Amtrak.

lation of the continuing violation doctrine, which "allowscourts to consider conduct that would ordinarily be time

barred `as long as the untimely incidents represent an ongo-ing unlawful employment practice.' " 232 F. 3d 1008, 1014
(2000) (quoting Anderson v. Reno, 190 F. 3d 930, 936 (CA91999)). Contrary to both the Seventh Circuit's test, used by
the District Court, and a similar test employed by the Fifth
Circuit,3 the Ninth Circuit held that its precedent "precludessuch a notice limitation on the continuing violation doctrine."

232 F. 3d, at 1015.In the Ninth Circuit's view, a plaintiff can establish a continuing violation that allows recovery for claims filed outsideof the statutory period in one of two ways. First, a plaintiff
may show "a series of related acts one or more of which arewithin the limitations period."

Ibid. Such a "serial violation is established if the evidence indicates that the allegedacts of discrimination occurring prior to the limitations period are sufficiently related to those occurring within the
limitations period." Ibid. The alleged incidents, however,
"cannot be isolated, sporadic, or discrete." Ibid. Second,
a plaintiff may establish a continuing violation if he shows
"a systematic policy or practice of discrimination that operated, in part, within the limitations period--a systemic violation." Id., at 1015-1016.

To survive summary judgment under this test, Morgan
had to "raise a genuine issue of disputed fact as to (1) the
existence of a continuing violation--be it serial or systemic,"
and (2) the continuation of the violation into the limitations
period. Id., at 1016. Because Morgan alleged three types

3 The Fifth Circuit employs a multifactor test, which, among other
things, takes into account: (1) whether the alleged acts involve the same
type of discrimination; (2) whether the incidents are recurring or independent and isolated events; and (3) whether the earlier acts have sufficient permanency to trigger the employee's awareness of and duty to challenge the alleged violation. See Berry v. Board of Supervisors, 715 F. 2d
971, 981 (1983).

of Title VII claims, namely, discrimination, hostile environ-ment, and retaliation, the Court of Appeals considered the

allegations with respect to each category of claim separatelyand found that the prelimitations conduct was sufficiently
related to the postlimitations conduct to invoke the continu-ing violation doctrine for all three. Therefore, "[i]n light of
the relatedness of the incidents, [the Court of Appeals found]that Morgan ha[d] sufficiently presented a genuine issue of
disputed fact as to whether a continuing violation existed."
Id., at 1017. Because the District Court should have al-lowed events occurring in the prelimitations period to be

"presented to the jury not merely as background informa-tion, but also for purposes of liability," id., at 1017-1018, the
Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial.We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 927 (2001), and now reverse in part and affirm in part.

II
The Courts of Appeals have taken various approaches tothe question whether acts that fall outside of the statutory

time period for filing charges set forth in 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e) are actionable under Title VII. See n. 3, supra. While
the lower courts have offered reasonable, albeit divergent,solutions, none are compelled by the text of the statute. In
the context of a request to alter the timely filing require-ments of Title VII, this Court has stated that "strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legisla-ture is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration of
the law." Mohasco Corp. v. Silver, 447 U. S. 807, 826 (1980).In

Mohasco, the Court rejected arguments that strict adher-ence to a similar statutory time restriction

$ 2000e-5(e) and the requirement of $ 2000e-5(c) that, in the case of an
unlawful employment practice that occurs in a State that prohibits such
practices, no charge may be filed with the EEOC before the expiration of
60 days after proceedings have been commenced in the appropriate state
agency unless such proceedings have been earlier terminated.

charge was "unfair" or that "a less literal reading of the Actwould adequately effectuate the policy of deferring to state

agencies." Id., at 824-825. Instead, the Court noted that"[b]y choosing what are obviously quite short deadlines, Congress clearly intended to encourage the prompt processingof all charges of employment discrimination." Id., at 825.
Similarly here, our most salient source for guidance is thestatutory text.

Title 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e)(1) is a charge filing provisionthat "specifies with precision" the prerequisites that a plaintiff must satisfy before filing suit. Alexander v. GardnerDenver Co., 415 U. S. 36, 47 (1974). An individual must filea charge within the statutory time period and serve notice

upon the person against whom the charge is made. In aState that has an entity with the authority to grant or seek
relief with respect to the alleged unlawful practice, an em-ployee who initially files a grievance with that agency must
file the charge with the EEOC within 300 days of the em-ployment practice; in all other States, the charge must be
filed within 180 days. A claim is time barred if it is not filedwithin these time limits.

For our purposes, the critical sentence of the charge filingprovision is: "A charge under this section

shall be filedwithin one hundred and eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred." $ 2000e-5(e)(1) (em-phasis added). The operative terms are "shall," "after . . .
occurred," and "unlawful employment practice." "[S]hall"makes the act of filing a charge within the specified time
period mandatory. See, e. g., Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg WeissBershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U. S. 26, 35 (1998) ("[T]he
mandatory `shall,' . . . normally creates an obligation imper-vious to judicial discretion"). "[O]ccurred" means that the
practice took place or happened in the past.5 The require5 "In the absence of an indication to the contrary, words in a statute are assumed to bear their `ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.' " Walters v. Metropolitan Ed. Enterprises, Inc., 519 U. S. 202, 207

Opinion of the Court

ment, therefore, that the charge be filed "after" the practice"occurred" tells us that a litigant has up to 180 or 300 days

after the unlawful practice happened to file a charge withthe EEOC.

The critical questions, then, are: What constitutes an "un-lawful employment practice" and when has that practice
"occurred"? Our task is to answer these questions for bothdiscrete discriminatory acts and hostile work environment
claims. The answer varies with the practice.

A
We take the easier question first. A discrete retaliatoryor discriminatory act "occurred" on the day that it "happened." A party, therefore, must file a charge within either180 or 300 days of the date of the act or lose the ability to
recover for it.Morgan argues that the statute does not require the filing
of a charge within 180 or 300 days of each discrete act, butthat the language requires the filing of a charge within the
specified number of days after an "unlawful employmentpractice." "Practice," Morgan contends, connotes an ongoing violation that can endure or recur over a period of time.See Brief for Respondent 25-26. In Morgan's view, the
term "practice" therefore provides a statutory basis for theNinth Circuit's continuing violation doctrine.

6 This argu(1997) (quoting Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates
Ltd. Partnership, 507 U. S. 380, 388 (1993) (internal quotation marks and
citation omitted)). Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1561
(1993) defines "occur" as "to present itself: come to pass: take place:
happen." See also Black's Law Dictionary 1080 (6th ed. 1990) (defining
"[o]ccur" as "[t]o happen; . . . to take place; to arise").

6 Morgan also argues that the EEOC's discussion of continuing violations

in its Compliance Manual, which provides that certain serial violations and systemic violations constitute continuing violations that allow
relief for untimely events, as well as the positions the EEOC has taken in
prior briefs, warrant deference under Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural

Opinion of the Court
ment is unavailing, however, given that 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-2explains in great detail the sorts of actions that qualify as

"[u]nlawful employment practices" and includes among suchpractices numerous discrete acts. See,

e. g., $ 2000e-2(a) ("It
shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer--
(1) to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or
otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of
employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin . . ."). There is simply no indication
that the term "practice" converts related discrete acts into
a single unlawful practice for the purposes of timely filing.
Cf. $ 2000e-6(a) (providing that the Attorney General may
bring a civil action in "pattern or practice" cases).

We have repeatedly interpreted the term "practice" to
apply to a discrete act or single "occurrence," even when it
has a connection to other acts. For example, in Electrical
Workers v. Robbins & Myers, Inc., 429 U. S. 229, 234 (1976),
an employee asserted that his complaint was timely filed because the date "the alleged unlawful employment practice
occurred" was the date after the conclusion of a grievance
arbitration procedure, rather than the earlier date of his discharge. The discharge, he contended, was "tentative" and
"nonfinal" until the grievance and arbitration procedure
ended. Not so, the Court concluded, because the discriminatory act occurred on the date of discharge--the date that
the parties understood the termination to be final. Id., at
234-235. Similarly, in Bazemore v. Friday, 478 U. S. 385

Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837 (1984). Brief for Respondent 26-32. But we have held that the EEOC's interpretive guidelines do
not receive Chevron deference. See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co.,
499 U. S. 244, 257 (1991). Such interpretations are " `entitled to respect'
under our decision in Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U. S. 134, 140 (1944),
but only to the extent that those interpretations have the `power to persuade.' " Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000).

Opinion of the Court

(1986) (per curiam), a pattern-or-practice case, when consid-ering a discriminatory salary structure, the Court noted that

although the salary discrimination began prior to the datethat the act was actionable under Title VII, "[e]ach week's
paycheck that deliver[ed] less to a black than to a similarlysituated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII . . . ."
Id., at 395.

This Court has also held that discrete acts that fall withinthe statutory time period do not make timely acts that fall

outside the time period. In United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans,431 U. S. 553 (1977), United forced Evans to resign after she
married because of its policy against married female flight
attendants. Although Evans failed to file a timely charge
following her initial separation, she nonetheless claimed that
United was guilty of a present, continuing violation of Title
VII because its seniority system failed to give her credit for
her prior service once she was rehired. The Court disagreed, concluding that "United was entitled to treat [Evans'
resignation] as lawful after [she] failed to file a charge of
discrimination within the" charge filing period then allowed
by the statute. Id., at 558. At the same time, however, the
Court noted that "[i]t may constitute relevant background
evidence in a proceeding in which the status of a current
practice is at issue." Ibid. The emphasis, however, "should
not be placed on mere continuity" but on "whether any present violation exist[ed]." Ibid. (emphasis in original).

In Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U. S. 250 (1980),
the Court evaluated the timeliness of an EEOC complaint
filed by a professor who argued that he had been denied academic tenure because of his national origin. Following the
decision to deny tenure, the employer offered him a " `terminal' " contract to teach an additional year. Id., at 253.
Claiming, in effect, a " `continuing violation,' " the professor
argued that the time period did not begin to run until his
actual termination. Id., at 257. The Court rejected this
argument: "Mere continuity of employment, without more,

536US1 Unit: $U61 [12-22-03 07:32:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
is insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action foremployment discrimination."

Ibid. In order for the time
period to commence with the discharge, "he should haveidentified the alleged discriminatory acts that continued

until, or occurred at the time of, the actual termination ofhis employment."

Ibid. He could not use a termination
that fell within the limitations period to pull in the timebarred discriminatory act. Nor could a time-barred act jus-tify filing a charge concerning a termination that was not

independently discriminatory.We derive several principles from these cases. First, discrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred,
even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed
charges. Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new
clock for filing charges alleging that act. The charge, therefore, must be filed within the 180- or 300-day time period
after the discrete discriminatory act occurred. The existence of past acts and the employee's prior knowledge of their
occurrence, however, does not bar employees from filing
charges about related discrete acts so long as the acts are
independently discriminatory and charges addressing those
acts are themselves timely filed. Nor does the statute bar
an employee from using the prior acts as background evidence in support of a timely claim.

As we have held, however, this time period for filing
a charge is subject to equitable doctrines such as tolling
or estoppel. See Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455
U. S. 385, 393 (1982) ("We hold that filing a timely charge of
discrimination with the EEOC is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a requirement that, like
a statute of limitations, is subject to waiver, estoppel, and
equitable tolling"). Courts may evaluate whether it would
be proper to apply such doctrines, although they are to be
applied sparingly. See Baldwin County Welcome Center
v. Brown, 466 U. S. 147, 152 (1984) (per curiam) ("Procedural
requirements established by Congress for gaining access to

v. MORGAN

Opinion of the Court

the federal courts are not to be disregarded by courts out ofa vague sympathy for particular litigants").

The Court of Appeals applied the continuing violationsdoctrine to what it termed "serial violations," holding that
so long as one act falls within the charge filing period, dis-criminatory and retaliatory acts that are plausibly or sufficiently related to that act may also be considered for thepurposes of liability. See 232 F. 3d, at 1015. With respect
to this holding, therefore, we reverse.Discrete acts such as termination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire are easy to identify. Eachincident of discrimination and each retaliatory adverse employment decision constitutes a separate actionable "unlaw-ful employment practice." Morgan can only file a charge to
cover discrete acts that "occurred" within the appropriatetime period.

7 While Morgan alleged that he suffered from

numerous discriminatory and retaliatory acts from the datethat he was hired through March 3, 1995, the date that he

was fired, only incidents that took place within the timelyfiling period are actionable. Because Morgan first filed his
charge with an appropriate state agency, only those acts thatoccurred 300 days before February 27, 1995, the day that
Morgan filed his charge, are actionable. During that timeperiod, Morgan contends that he was wrongfully suspended
and charged with a violation of Amtrak's "Rule L" for insub-ordination while failing to complete work assigned to him,
denied training, and falsely accused of threatening a man7 Because the Court of Appeals held that the "discrete acts" were actionable as part of a continuing violation, there was no need for it to further
contemplate when the time period began to run for each act. The District
Court noted that "Morgan believed that he was being discriminated
against at the time that all of these acts occurred. . . ." App. to Pet.
for Cert. 40a. There may be circumstances where it will be difficult to
determine when the time period should begin to run. One issue that may
arise in such circumstances is whether the time begins to run when the
injury occurs as opposed to when the injury reasonably should have been
discovered. But this case presents no occasion to resolve that issue.

Hostile environment claims are different in kind from dis-crete acts. Their very nature involves repeated conduct.

See 1 B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment Discrimi-nation Law 348-349 (3d ed. 1996) (hereinafter Lindemann)
("The repeated nature of the harassment or its intensity con-stitutes evidence that management knew or should have
known of its existence"). The "unlawful employment prac-tice" therefore cannot be said to occur on any particular day.
It occurs over a series of days or perhaps years and, in directcontrast to discrete acts, a single act of harassment may not
be actionable on its own. See Harris v. Forklift Systems,
Inc., 510 U. S. 17, 21 (1993) ("As we pointed out in Meritor[Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U. S. 57, 67 (1986),] `mere

utterance of an . . . epithet which engenders offensive feel-ings in a[n] employee,' ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), does not sufficiently affect the conditions of employmentto implicate Title VII"). Such claims are based on the cumulative effect of individual acts."We have repeatedly made clear that although [Title VII]
mentions specific employment decisions with immediate con-sequences, the scope of the prohibition `is not limited to "eco8 The final alleged discriminatory act, he contends, led to his termination
on March 3, 1995. Morgan alleges that after the manager reported that
Morgan had threatened him, he was ordered into a supervisor's office.
Then, after he asked for union representation or the presence of a
co-worker as a witness, the supervisor denied both, ordered everyone out
of the office, and yelled at Morgan to get his "black ass" into the office.
Morgan refused and went home. He was subsequently suspended and
charged with violations of two company rules and, following an investigatory hearing, terminated.

respect to "pattern-or-practice" claims brought by private litigants as
none are at issue here.

In determining whether an actionable hostile work envi-ronment claim exists, we look to "all the circumstances,"

statute. It provides that a charge must be filed within 180or 300 days "after the alleged unlawful employment practice

occurred." A hostile work environment claim is composedof a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one
"unlawful employment practice." 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e)(1).The timely filing provision only requires that a Title VII
plaintiff file a charge within a certain number of days afterthe unlawful practice happened. It does not matter, for purposes of the statute, that some of the component acts of thehostile work environment fall outside the statutory time period. Provided that an act contributing to the claim occurswithin the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile
environment may be considered by a court for the purposesof determining liability.

11

That act need not, however, be the last act. As long asthe employer has engaged in enough activity to make out an

actionable hostile environment claim, an unlawful employ-ment practice has "occurred," even if it is still occurring.
Subsequent events, however, may still be part of the onehostile work environment claim and a charge may be filed at
a later date and still encompass the whole.It is precisely because the entire hostile work environment
encompasses a single unlawful employment practice that wedo not hold, as have some of the Circuits, that the plaintiff
may not base a suit on individual acts that occurred outsidethe statute of limitations unless it would have been unreasonable to expect the plaintiff to sue before the statute ran

11 Amtrak argues that recovery for conduct taking place outside the time
period for filing a timely charge should be available only in hostile environment cases where the plaintiff reasonably did not know such conduct was
discriminatory or where the discriminatory nature of such conduct is recognized as discriminatory only in light of later events. See Brief for Petitioner 38. The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit adopted this
approach in Galloway v. General Motors Service Parts Operations, 78
F. 3d 1164 (1996). See supra, at 106. Although we reject the test proposed by petitioner, other avenues of relief are available to employers.

on such conduct. The statute does not separate individualacts that are part of the hostile environment claim from the

whole for the purposes of timely filing and liability. And thestatute does not contain a requirement that the employee file
a charge prior to 180 or 300 days "after" the single unlawfulpractice "occurred." Given, therefore, that the incidents
constituting a hostile work environment are part of one unlawful employment practice, the employer may be liable forall acts that are part of this single claim. In order for the

charge to be timely, the employee need only file a chargewithin 180 or 300 days of any act that is part of the hostile
work environment.

The following scenarios illustrate our point: (1) Acts on
days 1-400 create a hostile work environment. The employee files the charge on day 401. Can the employee recover for that part of the hostile work environment that occurred in the first 100 days? (2) Acts contribute to a hostile
environment on days 1-100 and on day 401, but there are no
acts between days 101-400. Can the act occurring on day
401 pull the other acts in for the purposes of liability? In
truth, all other things being equal, there is little difference
between the two scenarios as a hostile environment constitutes one "unlawful employment practice" and it does not
matter whether nothing occurred within the intervening 301
days so long as each act is part of the whole. Nor, if sufficient activity occurred by day 100 to make out a claim, does
it matter that the employee knows on that day that an actionable claim happened; on day 401 all incidents are still
part of the same claim. On the other hand, if an act on day
401 had no relation to the acts between days 1-100, or for
some other reason, such as certain intervening action by the
employer, was no longer part of the same hostile environment claim, then the employee cannot recover for the previous acts, at least not by reference to the day 401 act.

Our conclusion with respect to the incidents that may be
considered for the purposes of liability is reinforced by the

Opinion of the Court
fact that the statute in no way bars a plaintiff from recover-ing damages for that portion of the hostile environment that

falls outside the period for filing a timely charge. Morgancorrectly notes that the timeliness requirement does not dictate the amount of recoverable damages. It is but one in aseries of provisions requiring that the parties take action
within specified time periods, see, e. g., $$ 2000e-5(b), (c), (d),
none of which function as specific limitations on damages.Explicit limitations on damages are found elsewhere in

the statute. Section 1981a(b)(3), for example, details spe-cific limitations on compensatory and punitive damages.
Likewise, $ 2000e-5(g)(1) allows for recovery of backpay liability for up to two years prior to the filing of the charge.
If Congress intended to limit liability to conduct occurring
in the period within which the party must file the charge, it
seems unlikely that Congress would have allowed recovery
for two years of backpay. And the fact that Congress expressly limited the amount of recoverable damages elsewhere to a particular time period indicates that the timely
filing provision was not meant to serve as a specific limitation either on damages or the conduct that may be considered for the purposes of one actionable hostile work environment claim.

It also makes little sense to limit the assessment of liability in a hostile work environment claim to the conduct that
falls within the 180- or 300-day period given that this time
period varies based on whether the violation occurs in a
State or political subdivision that has an agency with authority to grant or seek relief. It is important to remember that
the statute requires that a Title VII plaintiff must wait 60
days after proceedings have commenced under state or local
law to file a charge with the EEOC, unless such proceedings
have earlier terminated. $ 2000e-5(c). In such circumstances, however, the charge must still be filed within 300
days of the occurrence. See Mohasco, 447 U. S., at 825-826.

Opinion of the Court

charges in a State or locality ensures that employees areneither time barred from later filing their charges with the

EEOC nor dissuaded from first filing with a state agency.See id., at 821 ("The history identifies only one reason for
treating workers in deferral States differently from workersin other States: to give state agencies an opportunity to redress the evil at which the federal legislation was aimed, andto avoid federal intervention unless its need was demonstrated"). Surely, therefore, we cannot import such a limit-ing principle into the provision where its effect would be to
make the reviewable time period for liability dependent uponwhether an employee lives in a State that has its own remedial scheme.12Simply put, $ 2000e-5(e)(1) is a provision specifying when
a charge is timely filed and only has the consequence of limit-ing liability because filing a timely charge is a prerequisite to
having an actionable claim. A court's task is to determinewhether the acts about which an employee complains are
part of the same actionable hostile work environment prac-tice, and if so, whether any act falls within the statutory
time period.With respect to Morgan's hostile environment claim, the
Court of Appeals concluded that " the pre- and post-limitations period incidents involve[d] the same type of
employment actions, occurred relatively frequently, and wereperpetrated by the same managers." 232 F. 3d, at 1017. To
support his claims of a hostile environment, Morgan pre-sented evidence from a number of other employees that
managers made racial jokes, performed racially derogatoryacts, made negative comments regarding the capacity of
blacks to be supervisors, and used various racial epithets.
Id., at 1013. Although many of the acts upon which hisclaim depends occurred outside the 300 day filing period,

12 The same concern is not implicated with discrete acts given that, unlike hostile work environment claims, liability there does not depend upon
proof of repeated conduct extending over a period of time.

we cannot say that they are not part of the same actionablehostile environment claim.

13 On this point, we affirm.

C
Our holding does not leave employers defenseless againstemployees who bring hostile work environment claims that

extend over long periods of time. Employers have recoursewhen a plaintiff unreasonably delays filing a charge. As
noted in Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385(1982), the filing period is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to
filing a Title VII suit. Rather, it is a requirement subjectto waiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling "when equity so
requires." Id., at 398. These equitable doctrines allow usto honor Title VII's remedial purpose "without negating the
particular purpose of the filing requirement, to give promptnotice to the employer."

Ibid.This Court previously noted that despite the procedural

protections of the statute "a defendant in a Title VII enforce-ment action might still be significantly handicapped in making his defense because of an inordinate EEOC delay in filingthe action after exhausting its conciliation efforts." Occidental Life Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, 373 (1977).The same is true when the delay is caused by the employee,
rather than by the EEOC. Cf. Albemarle Paper Co. v.
Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 424 (1975) ("[A] party may not be `enti-tled' to relief if its conduct of the cause has improperly and

substantially prejudiced the other party"). In such cases,the federal courts have the discretionary power to "to locate
`a just result' in light of the circumstances peculiar to thecase." Id., at 424-425.

In addition to other equitable defenses, therefore, an em-ployer may raise a laches defense, which bars a plaintiff from
maintaining a suit if he unreasonably delays in filing a suitand as a result harms the defendant. This defense " `re13 We make no judgment, however, on the merits of Morgan's claim.

quires proof of (1) lack of diligence by the party against
whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party
asserting the defense.' " Kansas v. Colorado, 514 U. S. 673,
687 (1995) (quoting Costello v. United States, 365 U. S. 265,
282, (1961)). We do not address questions here such as
"how--and how much--prejudice must be shown" or "what
consequences follow if laches is established." 2 Lindemann

various defenses in the face of unreasonable and prejudicial
delay.

III

We conclude that a Title VII plaintiff raising claims of discrete discriminatory or retaliatory acts must file his charge
within the appropriate time period--180 or 300 days--set
forth in 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e)(1). A charge alleging a hostile work environment claim, however, will not be time
barred so long as all acts which constitute the claim are part
of the same unlawful employment practice and at least one
act falls within the time period. Neither holding, however,
precludes a court from applying equitable doctrines that may
toll or limit the time period.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court of Appeals' judgment
is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
14 Nor do we have occasion to consider whether the laches defense may
be asserted against the EEOC, even though traditionally the doctrine may
not be applied against the sovereign. We note, however, that in Occidental there seemed to be general agreement that courts can provide relief
to defendants against inordinate delay by the EEOC. See Occidental
Life Ins. Co. of Cal. v. EEOC, 432 U. S. 355, 373 (1977). Cf. id., at 383
(Rehnquist, J., dissenting in part) ("Since here the suit is to recover backpay for an individual that could have brought her own suit, it is impossible
to think that the EEOC was suing in the sovereign capacity of the
United States").

I join Part II-A of the Court's opinion because I agreethat Title VII suits based on discrete discriminatory acts are
time barred when the plaintiff fails to file a charge with theEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within
the 180- or 300-day time period designated in the statute.42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e)(1). I dissent from the remainder of
the Court's opinion, however, because I believe a similar re-striction applies to all types of Title VII suits, including
those based on a claim that a plaintiff has been subjected toa hostile work environment.

I
The Court today holds that, for discrete discriminatoryacts, $ 2000e-5(e)(1) serves as a form of statute of limitations,

barring recovery for actions that take place outside thecharge-filing period. The Court acknowledges, however,
that this limitations period may be adjusted by equitabledoctrines. See

ante, at 114, n. 7; see also Zipes v. TransWorld Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 393 (1982) ("We hold that

filing a timely charge of discrimination with the EEOC is nota jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court, but a
requirement that, like a statute of limitations, is subject towaiver, estoppel, and equitable tolling"). Like the Court,
I see no need to resolve fully the application of the discoveryrule to claims based on discrete discriminatory acts. See
ante, at 114, n. 7. I believe, however, that some versionof the discovery rule applies to discrete-act claims. See 2
B. Lindemann & P. Grossman, Employment DiscriminationLaw 1349 (3d ed. 1996) ("Although [Supreme Court precedents] seem to establish a relatively simple `notice' rule as towhen discrimination `occurs' (so as to start the running of
the charge-filing period), courts continue to disagree on what

the notice must be of " (emphasis in original)). In my view,therefore, the charge-filing period precludes recovery based

on discrete actions that occurred more than 180 or 300 daysafter the employee had, or should have had, notice of the
discriminatory act. II

Unlike the Court, I would hold that $ 2000e-5(e)(1) servesas a limitations period for all actions brought under Title
VII, including those alleging discrimination by being sub-jected to a hostile working environment. Section 2000e-
5(e)(1) provides that a plaintiff must file a charge with theEEOC within 180 or 300 days "after the alleged unlawful
employment practice occurred."* It draws no distinctionbetween claims based on discrete acts and claims based on
hostile work environments. If a plaintiff fails to file acharge within that time period, liability may not be assessed,
and damages must not be awarded, for that part of thehostile environment that occurred outside the charge-filing
period.The Court's conclusion to the contrary is based on a characterization of hostile environment discrimination as com-posing a single claim based on conduct potentially spanning
several years. See ante, at 117. I agree with this characterization. I disagree, however, with the Court's conclusion
that, because of the cumulative nature of the violation, ifany conduct forming part of the violation occurs within the

charge-filing period, liability can be proved and damages canbe collected for the entire hostile environment. Although a
hostile environment claim is, by its nature, a general atmos-phere of discrimination not completely reducible to particular discriminatory acts, each day the worker is exposed tothe hostile environment may still be treated as a separate
"occurrence," and claims based on some of those occurrences

*This case provides no occasion to determine whether the discovery rule
operates in the context of hostile work environment claims.

forfeited. In other words, a hostile environment is a formof discrimination that occurs every day; some of those daily

occurrences may be time barred, while others are not.The Court's treatment of hostile environment claims as
constituting a single occurrence leads to results that contra-dict the policies behind 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e-5(e)(1). Consider
an employee who has been subjected to a hostile work environment for 10 years. Under the Court's approach, such anemployee may, subject only to the uncertain restrictions of

equity, see ante, at 122, sleep on his or her rights for a dec-ade, bringing suit only in year 11 based in part on actions
for which a charge could, and should, have been filed manyyears previously in accordance with the statutory mandate.

$ 2000e-5(e)(1) ("A charge under this section shall be filed[within 180 or 300 days] after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred"). Allowing suits based on such re-mote actions raises all of the problems that statutes of limitations and other similar time limitations are designed toaddress:

"Statutes of limitation . . . promote justice by preventingsurprises through the revival of claims that have been
allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memo-ries have faded, and witnesses have disappeared. The
theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust
not to put the adversary on notice to defend within theperiod of limitation and that the right to be free of stale

claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prose-cute them."

Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U. S. 342, 348-349 (1944).

Although the statute's 2-year limitation on backpay partially
addresses these concerns, $ 2000e-5(g)(1), under the Court's
view, liability may still be assessed and other sorts of damages (such as damages for pain and suffering) awarded based
on long-past occurrences. An employer asked to defend
such stale actions, when a suit challenging them could have

Opinion of O'Connor, J.

been brought in a much more timely manner, may rightlycomplain of precisely this sort of unjust treatment.

The Court is correct that nothing in $ 2000e-5(e)(1) can beread as imposing a cap on damages. But reading $ 2000e-
5(e)(1) to require that a plaintiff bring an EEOC chargewithin 180 or 300 days of the time individual incidents constituting a hostile work environment occur or lose the ability
to bring suit based on those incidents is not equivalent totransforming it into a damages cap. The limitation is one

on liability. The restriction on damages for occurrences toofar in the past follows only as an obvious consequence.

Nor, as the Court claims, would reading $ 2000e-5(e)(1) as
limiting hostile environment claims conflict with Title VII's
allowance of backpay liability for a period of up to two years
prior to a charge's filing. $ 2000e-5(g)(1). Because of the
potential adjustments to the charge-filing period based on
equitable doctrines, two years of backpay will sometimes be
available even under my view. For example, two years of
backpay may be available where an employee failed to file a
timely charge with the EEOC because his employer deceived
him in order to conceal the existence of a discrimination
claim.

The Court also argues that it makes "little sense" to base
relief on the charge-filing period, since that period varies
depending on whether the State or political subdivision
where the violation occurs has designated an agency to deal
with such claims. See ante, at 119. The Court concludes
that "[s]urely . . . we cannot import such a limiting principle . . . where its effect would be to make the reviewable
time period for liability dependent upon whether an employee lives in a State that has its own remedial scheme."
Ante, at 120. But this is precisely the principle the Court
has adopted for discrete discriminatory acts--depending on
where a plaintiff lives, the time period changes as to which
discrete discriminatory actions may be reviewed. The justification for the variation is the same for discrete discrimina536US1 Unit: $U61 [12-22-03 07:32:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

127Cite as: 536 U. S. 101 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
tory acts as it is for claims based on hostile work environ-ments. The longer time period is intended to give States

and other political subdivisions time to review claims them-selves, if they have a mechanism for doing so. The same
rationale applies to review of the daily occurrences thatmake up a part of a hostile environment claim.

My approach is also consistent with that taken by the
Court in other contexts. When describing an ongoing anti-trust violation, for instance, we have stated:

"[E]ach overt act that is part of the violation and that
injures the plaintiff . . . starts the statutory [limitations]period running again, regardless of the plaintiff 's knowledge of the alleged illegality at much earlier times. . . .
But the commission of a separate new overt act gener-ally does not permit the plaintiff to recover for the

injury caused by old overt acts outside the limitationsperiod."

Klehr v. A. O. Smith Corp., 521 U. S. 179, 189
(1997) (citations omitted).

Similarly, in actions under the Racketeer Influenced and Cor-rupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U. S. C. $ 1961

et seq., concerning a pattern of racketeering activity, we rejected a rule
that would have allowed plaintiffs to recover for all of theacts that made up the pattern so long as at least one occurred

within the limitations period. In doing so, we endorsed therule of several Circuits that, although "commission of a separable, new predicate act within [the] limitations period per-mits a plaintiff to recover for the additional damages caused
by that act . . . the plaintiff cannot use an independent, newpredicate act as a bootstrap to recover for injuries caused
by other earlier predicate acts that took place outside the
limitations period." 521 U. S., at 190; but cf. Rotella v.
Wood, 528 U. S. 549, 554, n. 2, 557 (2000) (reserving the question of whether the injury discovery rule applies in civil
RICO and, by extension, Clayton Act cases). The Court
today allows precisely this sort of bootstrapping in the Title

the hostile environment has continued into the charge-filingperiod.

FRANCONIA ASSOCIATES et al. v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 01-455. Argued April 15, 2002--Decided June 10, 2002*
Under $$ 515 and 521 of the Housing Act of 1949, the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) makes direct loans to private, nonprofit entities
to develop and/or construct rural housing for the elderly and low- or
middle-income individuals and families. Petitioners are property owners who entered into such loans before December 21, 1979. The promissory notes petitioners executed authorized "[p]repaymen[t] of scheduled
installments, or any portion thereof, . . . at any time at the option of
Borrower." On February 5, 1988, concerned about the dwindling supply of low- and middle-income rural housing in the face of increasing
prepayments of mortgages by $ 515 borrowers, Congress enacted the
Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA),
which amended the Housing Act of 1949 to impose permanent restrictions upon prepayment of $ 515 mortgages entered into before December
21, 1979. On May 30, 1997, the Franconia petitioners filed suit under
the Tucker Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1491, charging that ELIHPA abridged the
absolute prepayment right set forth in their promissory notes and
thereby effected, inter alia, a repudiation of their contracts. In dismissing petitioners' contract claims as untimely under $ 2501--which
provides that a claim "shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed
within six years after such claim first accrues"--the Court of Federal
Claims concluded that the claims first accrued on the ELIHPA regulations' effective date. In affirming on statute of limitations grounds, the
Federal Circuit ruled that, if the Government's continuing duty to allow
petitioners to prepay their loans was breached, the breach occurred immediately upon ELIHPA's enactment date, over nine years before petitioners filed their suit. The court rejected petitioners' argument that
ELIHPA's passage qualified as a repudiation, so that their suit would
be timely if filed within six years of either the date performance fell due
(the date they tendered prepayment) or the date on which they elected
to treat the repudiation as a present breach. On September 16, 1998,
the Grass Valley petitioners filed an action that was virtually identical
to the Franconia suit. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed for the

Court's Rule 12.4), also on certiorari to the same court.

Syllabus
reasons it had dismissed the Franconia claims, and the Federal Circuit
affirmed without opinion.

Held: Because ELIHPA's enactment qualified as a repudiation of the parties' bargain, not a present breach of the loan agreements, breach would
occur, and the six-year limitations period would commence to run, when
a borrower tenders prepayment and the Government then dishonors its
obligation to accept the tender and release its control over use of the
property securing the loan. Pp. 141-149.

(a) Resolution of two threshold matters narrows the scope of the controversy. First, the requirement that the Government unequivocally
waive its sovereign immunity is satisfied here because, once the United
States waives immunity and does business with its citizens, it does so
much as a party never cloaked with immunity. Cf. Clearfield Trust
Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363, 369. Second, the Court, like the
Government, accepts for purposes of this decision that the loan contracts
guaranteed the absolute prepayment right petitioners allege. P. 141.

(b) Under applicable general contract law principles, whether petitioners' claims were filed "within six years after [they] first accrue[d],"

$ 2501, depends upon when the Government breached the prepayment
undertaking stated in the promissory notes. In declaring ELIHPA a
present breach of petitioners' loan contracts, the Federal Circuit reasoned that the Government had but one obligation under those agreements: to continue to allow borrowers the unfettered right to prepay
their loans at any time. If that continuing duty was breached, the court
maintained, the breach occurred immediately, totally, and definitively,
when ELIHPA took away the borrowers' unfettered right to prepay.
In so ruling, the court incorrectly characterized the performance allegedly due from the Government under the promissory notes. The Government's pledged performance is properly comprehended as an obligation to accept prepayment. Once the Government's obligation is thus
correctly characterized, the decisions below lose force. A promisor's
failure to perform at the time indicated for performance in the contract
establishes an immediate breach. But the promisor's renunciation of a
contractual duty before the time fixed in the contract for performance
is a repudiation, which ripens into a breach prior to the time for performance only if the promisee elects to treat it as such, see Roehm v.
Horst, 178 U. S. 1, 13. Viewed in this light, ELIHPA effected a repudiation of the FmHA loan contracts, not an immediate breach. ELIHPA
conveyed the Government's announcement that it would not perform as
represented in the promissory notes if and when, at some point in the
future, petitioners attempted to prepay their mortgages. Unless petitioners treated ELIHPA as a present breach by filing suit prior to the

536US1 Unit: $U62 [01-14-04 18:28:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

131Cite as: 536 U. S. 129 (2002)
Syllabus
date indicated for performance, breach would occur when a borrower
attempted to prepay, for only then would the Government's responsive
performance become due. Pp. 141-144.

(c) The first of the Government's arguments to the contrary is unpersuasive. The Government contends that $ 2501's "first accrues" qualification is meant to ensure that suits against the United States are filed
on the earliest possible date, thereby providing the Government with
reasonably prompt notice of the fiscal implications of past enactments.
However, $ 2501's text is unexceptional: A number of contemporaneous
state statutes of limitations applicable to suits between private parties
also tie the commencement of the limitations period to the date a claim
"first accrues." Equally telling, in its many years of applying and interpreting $ 2501, the Court of Federal Claims has never attributed to the
words "first accrues" the meaning the Government now proposes. Instead, in other settings, that court has adopted the repudiation doctrine
in its traditional form when evaluating the timeliness of suits governed
by $ 2501. Two practical considerations reinforce the Court's conclusion. First, reading $ 2501 as the Government proposes would seriously
distort the repudiation doctrine in Tucker Act suits because a party
aggrieved by the Government's renunciation of a contractual obligation anticipating future performance would be compelled by the looming
limitations bar to forgo the usual option of awaiting the time performance is due before filing suit for breach. Second, putting prospective
plaintiffs to the choice of either bringing suit soon after the Government's repudiation or forever relinquishing their claims would surely
proliferate litigation, forcing the Government to defend against highly
speculative damages claims in a profusion of suits, most of which would
never have been brought under a less novel interpretation of $ 2501.
Pp. 144-147.

(d) The Court also rejects the premise, and therefore the conclusion,
of the Government's second argument against application of the repudiation doctrine. The Government contends that a congressional enactment like ELIHPA that precludes the Government from honoring a contractual obligation anticipating future performance always constitutes a
present breach because the agency or official responsible for administering the contract is not free to change its mind and render the requisite
performance without violating binding federal law. However, just as
Congress may announce the Government's intent to dishonor an obligation to perform in the future through a duly enacted law, so may it
retract that renouncement prior to the time for performance, thereby
enabling the agency or contracting official to perform as promised. Indeed, Congress changed its mind in just this manner before it enacted
ELIHPA. In 1979 amendments to the National Housing Act, Congress

Opinion of the Court
repudiated the promissory notes at issue here by conditioning prepayment of all $ 515 loans on the borrower's agreement to maintain the
low-income use of its property for a specified period. One year later,
Congress removed those conditions on pre-1979 loans, thereby retracting the repudiation. Hence, the fact that the Government's repudiation here rested upon the enactment of a new statute makes no significant difference. Mobil Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc.

Opinion of the Court
properties to low- and middle-income housing and to abideby related restrictions during the life of the loans.

Petitioners allege that the promissory notes governingtheir loans guaranteed the borrower the right to prepay at
any time and thereby gain release from the federal programand the restrictions it places on the use of a participating
owner's property. In the suits that yielded the judgments
before us, petitioners charged that Congress abridged thatrelease right in the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987 (ELIHPA or Act), 101 Stat. 1877,as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1472(c) (1994 ed. and Supp. V).
That Act placed permanent restraints upon prepayment of
FmHA loans. Petitioners asserted in their complaints
that ELIHPA effected both a repudiation of their contracts
and a taking of their property in violation of the Fifth
Amendment.

The Federal Circuit held petitioners' claims time barred
under 28 U. S. C. $ 2501, which prescribes that all Tucker
Act claims must be filed within six years of the date they
"first accrue[d]." In the Federal Circuit's view, passage of
ELIHPA constituted an immediate breach of the FmHA loan
agreements and therefore triggered the running of the limitations period. Petitioners filed suit not "within six years
of," but over nine years after, ELIHPA's enactment. On
that account, the Federal Circuit held their claims untimely,
and their suits properly dismissed.

Accepting for purposes of this decision that the loan
contracts guaranteed the absolute prepayment right petitioners allege, we reverse the Federal Circuit's judgment.
ELIHPA's enactment, we conclude, qualified as a repudiation
of the parties' bargain, not a present breach of the loan
agreements. Accordingly, breach would occur, and the sixyear limitations period would commence to run, when a
borrower tenders prepayment and the Government then dishonors its obligation to accept the tender and release its control over use of the property that secured the loan.

Opinion of the Court

I
A

Under $$ 515 and 521 of the Housing Act of 1949, 76 Stat.671, 82 Stat. 551, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $$ 1485, 1490a, the

FmHA makes direct loans to private, nonprofit entities todevelop or construct rural housing designed to serve the elderly and low- or middle-income individuals and families.1Section 515 loans require the borrower, inter alia, to execute
various loan documents, including a loan agreement, a prom-issory note, and a real estate mortgage.

Before December 21, 1979, each petitioner entered intoa loan agreement with the FmHA under $$ 515 and 521
"to provide rental housing and related facilities for eligibleoccupants . . . in rural areas." App. to Pet. for Cert. A165.
In the loan agreements, each petitioner certified that it wasunable to obtain a comparable loan in the commercial market.
See id., at A177. The loan agreements contained variousprovisions designed to ensure that the projects were affordable for people with low incomes. Those provisions includedrestrictions as to eligible tenants, the rents petitioners could
charge, and the rate of return petitioners could realize, aswell as requirements regarding the maintenance and financial operations of each project. See id., at A170-A174.Each loan agreement also specified the length of the loan,
ordinarily 40 or 50 years.The promissory notes executed by petitioners required
payment of the principal on each mortgage in scheduledinstallments, plus interest. See id., at A176-A177. The

1 Since 1994, the program has been entrusted to the Rural Housing
Service, known between 1994 and 1996 as Rural Housing and Community
Development Services. That agency was created by the Secretary of
Agriculture under authority provided by the Department of Agriculture
Reorganization Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 3219, as amended, 110 Stat. 1128,
1131. See also 7 CFR $ 2003.18 (2002) (functional organization of Rural
Housing Service). Our references to the FmHA should be understood to
include these successor agencies.

Opinion of the Court
notes also contained the prepayment provision curtailed by
the legislation involved in the litigation now before us. That
provision read: "Prepayments of scheduled installments, or
any portion thereof, may be made at any time at the option
of Borrower." Id., at A176. No other provision of the loan
documents addressed prepayment.

In 1979, Congress found that many $ 515 participants had
prepaid their mortgages, thus threatening the continued
availability of affordable rural housing. Concerned that
"these projects [remain] available to low and moderate income families for the entire original term of the loan," H. R.
Rep. No. 96-154, p. 43 (1979), Congress amended the National Housing Act to stem the loss of low-cost rural housing
due to prepayments, see Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979, 93 Stat. 1101. In these 1979
amendments, Congress prohibited the FmHA from accepting
prepayment of any loan made before or after the date of
enactment unless the owner agreed to maintain the lowincome use of the rental housing for a 15-year or 20-year
period from the date of the loan. 93 Stat. 1134-1135. That
requirement could be avoided if the FmHA determined that
there was no longer a need for the low-cost housing. Id.,
at 1135.

The 1979 amendments applied to all program loans, past,
present, and future. In 1980, however, Congress further
amended the National Housing Act to eliminate retroactive
application of the $ 515 prepayment limitations imposed by
the 1979 legislation. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 1614, provided that the prepayment restrictions would apply only to loans entered into
after December 21, 1979, the date that amendment was
enacted. $ 514, 94 Stat. 1671-1672. The 1980 Act also
required the Secretary of Agriculture to inform Congress
of the repeal's adverse effects, if any, on the availability of
low-income housing. Id., at 1672.

136 FRANCONIA ASSOCIATES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
By 1987, Congress had again become concerned about thedwindling supply of low- and moderate-income rural housing

in the face of increasing prepayments of mortgages under$ 515.

2 A House of Representatives Committee found that

owners were "prepay[ing] or . . . refinanc[ing] their FmHAloans, without regard to the low income and elderly tenants

in these projects." H. R. Rep. No. 100-122, p. 53.Responsive to that concern, Congress passed ELIHPA,
which amended the Housing Act of 1949 to impose perma-nent restrictions upon prepayment of $ 515 mortgages entered into before December 21, 1979. This legislation,enacted on February 5, 1988, provides that before FmHA
can accept an offer to prepay such a mortgage,

"the [FmHA] shall make reasonable efforts to enter intoan agreement with the borrower under which the borrower will make a binding commitment to extend thelow income use of the assisted housing and related facilities involved for not less than the 20-year period begin-ning on the date on which the agreement is executed."
42 U. S. C. $ 1472(c)(4)(A) (1994 ed.).
The legislation further provides that the FmHA may includeincentives in such an agreement, including an increase in

the rate of return on investment, reduction of the interestrate on the loan, and an additional loan to the borrower.

$ 1472(c)(4)(B) (1994 ed. and Supp. V).Under ELIHPA, if the FmHA determines after a "reasonable period" that an agreement cannot be reached, the ownerwho sought to prepay must offer to sell the housing to
"any qualified nonprofit organization or public agency at afair market value determined by 2 independent appraisers." $ 1472(c)(5)(A)(i) (1994 ed.). If an offer to buy is not

2 In 1986, Congress had passed a temporary moratorium that precluded

$ 515 prepayments in most cases. The moratorium originally was to expire in 1987, but it was extended into 1988 by another temporary measure.
See note following 42 U. S. C. $ 1472, p. 163 (1994 ed.).

Opinion of the Court
made by a nonprofit organization or agency within 180days, the FmHA may accept the owner's offer to prepay.

$ 1472(c)(5)(A)(ii). The offer-for-sale requirement may beavoided if the FmHA determines that prepayment will not
"materially affec[t]" housing opportunities for minorities andone of two other conditions is met: Prepayment will not displace the tenants of the affected housing, or there is "an ade-quate supply of safe, decent, and affordable rental housing
within the market area" and "sufficient actions have beentaken to ensure" that such housing "will be made available"
to displaced tenants. $ 1472(c)(5)(G)(ii).ELIHPA's implementing regulations establish a process
by which the FmHA addresses prepayment requests.Under those procedures, the FmHA first "develo[ps] an incentive offer," making a "reasonable effort . . . to enter intoan agreement with the borrower to maintain the housing for
low-income use that takes into consideration the economicloss the borrower may suffer by foregoing

[sic] prepay-ment." 7 CFR $ 1965.210 (2002). Only if the borrower

rejects that offer will the FmHA attempt to make the deter-minations--regarding the effect on minority housing opportunities, the displacement of tenants, and the supply ofaffordable housing in the market--required by 42 U. S. C.

$ 1472(c)(5)(G) before prepayment can be accepted. 7 CFR$ 1965.215(a) (2002).

subject to ELIHPA--and others, who had entered into loanagreements after December 21, 1979, and were therefore unaffected by the Act. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A3, n. 2.4Petitioners alleged that ELIHPA repudiated their loan contracts, which, they asserted, gave them the right "to termi-nate their participation in the Government's housing program by exercising their option to prepay at any time." Id.,at A112. Their complaint sought relief on two theories:
breach of contract and a violation of the Fifth Amendment'sproscription against taking property without just compensation. See id., at A132-A133.The Court of Federal Claims granted the Government's
motion to dismiss petitioners' contract claims as barred bythe six-year statute of limitations in 28 U. S. C. $ 2501. 43
Fed. Cl. 702 (1999). That provision states: "Every claim ofwhich the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filedwithin six years after such claim first accrues." The court
concluded that petitioners' contract claims first accrued onMay 23, 1988, the effective date of regulations implementing
ELIHPA. Id., at 709. That was so, the court said, becausethose regulations breached the only performance required of
the Government under the promissory notes: "to keep itspromise to allow borrowers an unfettered prepayment
right." Id., at 710. The court also dismissed petitioners'takings claims sua sponte; because "the [Government]
conduct . . . alleged to have constituted a taking" was "Con-gress's change of the prepayment option," the court reasoned, any claim based on that conduct "accrued at the timeof the 1988 legislation." Id., at 711.

Opinion of the Court
Court of Appeals agreed with the Court of Federal Claimson the respective benefits and burdens generated by the

promissory notes: Petitioners enjoyed "an unfettered rightto prepay their loans at any time,"

id., at 1363, while the
Government had an obligation "to continue to allow borrow-ers" that option,

ibid. If the Government's "continuing duty
was breached," the court concluded, "the breach occurred
immediately upon enactment of ELIHPA because, by itsterms, ELIHPA took away the borrowers' unfettered right

of prepayment." Ibid. Thus, the court ruled, the statuteof limitations began to run on February 5, 1988, the date of
ELIHPA's passage, see id., at 1364; 5 given that limitations-triggering date, the court held, petitioners' claims, filed over
nine years post-ELIHPA, were time barred.In holding petitioners' claims untimely, the Federal Circuit
rejected the argument pressed by petitioners that the pas-sage of ELIHPA qualified as a repudiation. Were ELIHPA
so regarded, petitioners' suit would be timely if filed withinsix years of either the date performance fell due (the date
petitioners tendered prepayment) or the date on which petitioners elected to treat the repudiation as a present breach."An anticipatory repudiation occurs," the Court of Appeals

recognized, "when an obligor communicates to an obligeethat he will commit a breach in the future."

Id., at 1363
(internal quotation marks omitted). "The doctrine of antici-patory repudiation does not apply in this case," the court

reasoned, because after ELIHPA revoked the promise to
allow unrestricted prepayment, the Government owed no
future performance under the contracts. Id., at 1364.

5 The Federal Circuit thus disagreed with the Court of Federal Claims
in one respect: The former concluded that petitioners' claims had accrued
on the date of ELIHPA's enactment, while the latter held that those claims
had accrued on the effective date of regulations implementing the Act.
240 F. 3d, at 1365, n. 3. This disagreement is irrelevant to, and rendered
academic by, our resolution of the petitions.

140 FRANCONIA ASSOCIATES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners' takings claims were time barred for essen-tially the same reason, the Federal Circuit held. The "property" allegedly taken without just compensation was peti-tioners' contractual "right to prepay their FmHA loans at
any time," id., at 1365; the takings claim thus arose when,upon passage of ELIHPA, the Government "took away and
conclusively abolished" the unrestricted prepayment option,
id., at 1366.6On September 16, 1998, the Grass Valley petitioners, all

of whom had entered into $ 515 loan agreements before De-cember 21, 1979, joined by other plaintiffs with post-1979
loans, filed an action in the Court of Federal Claims virtuallyidentical to the Franconia action. On April 12, 2000, that
court granted the Government's motion to dismiss the GrassValley petitioners' contract claims for the reasons it had dismissed the claims of the Franconia petitioners. 46 Fed. Cl.629, 633-635 (2000). The Federal Circuit affirmed without
opinion. Judgt. order reported at 7 Fed. Appx. 928 (2001).7We granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 1073 (2002), and now reverse the two judgments of the Federal Circuit before usfor review.

6 Like the Court of Federal Claims, see 43 Fed. Cl. 702, 708-709 (1999),
the Federal Circuit rejected petitioners' "alternative argument" that even
if the limitations period commenced to run upon enactment of legislation
installing prepayment restrictions, the 1992 legislation, rather than
ELIHPA, served as the operative provision. 240 F. 3d, at 1365, and n. 4.
Petitioners contended that ELIHPA represented an emergency measure
that curtailed prepayment rights only temporarily; the definitive legislative action, they maintained, occurred later, when the 1992 legislation made curtailment of their prepayment rights permanent. Id.,
at 1365. The Federal Circuit concluded that although Congress had designated certain provisions in ELIHPA "interim measures," ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted), "no similar language . . . indicate[s] that
[ELIHPA's] restrictions on FmHA loan prepayments were anything but
permanent as to" borrowers in petitioners' situation, ibid.

takings claims as untimely in a separate decision. 51 Fed. Cl. 436, 439

Opinion of the Court

II

A

A waiver of the sovereign immunity of the United States
"cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed."
United States v. King, 395 U. S. 1, 4 (1969). That requirement is satisfied here. Once the United States waives its
immunity and does business with its citizens, it does so much
as a party never cloaked with immunity. Cf. Clearfield
Trust Co. v. United States, 318 U. S. 363, 369 (1943) ("The
United States does business on business terms." (internal
quotation marks omitted)).

Another threshold matter confines this controversy. For
purposes of our disposition, the United States agrees, it may
be assumed that petitioners obtained precisely the promise
they allege--a promise that permits them an unfettered right
to prepay their mortgages any time over the life of the loans,
thereby gaining release from federal restrictions on the use
of their property. See Brief for United States 18-19; Tr. of
Oral Arg. 29-30. The sole issue before us is thus cleanly
presented: were petitioners' complaints initiated within the
six-year limitations period prescribed in 28 U. S. C. $ 2501?

"When the United States enters into contract relations, its
rights and duties therein are governed generally by the law
applicable to contracts between private individuals." Mobil
Oil Exploration & Producing Southeast, Inc. v. United
States, 530 U. S. 604, 607 (2000) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Under applicable "principles of general contract
law," Priebe & Sons, Inc. v. United States, 332 U. S. 407, 411
(1947), whether petitioners' claims were filed "within six
years after [they] first accrue[d]," 28 U. S. C. $ 2501, depends
upon when the Government breached the prepayment undertaking stated in the promissory notes. See 1 C. Corman,
Limitations of Actions $ 7.2.1, p. 482 (1991) ("The cause of
action for breach of contract accrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run, at the time of the breach." (footnote

Opinion of the Court
omitted)); see also 18 W. Jaeger, Williston on Contracts$ 2021A, p. 697 (3d ed. 1978) (same).

In declaring ELIHPA a present breach of petitioners' loancontracts, the Federal Circuit reasoned that the Government
had but one obligation under those agreements: "to continueto allow borrowers the unfettered right to prepay their loans
at any time." 240 F. 3d, at 1363; see also 43 Fed. Cl., at 710
(Government's contractual duty was "to keep its promise toallow borrowers an unfettered prepayment right"). If that

continuing duty was breached, the court maintained, thebreach occurred

immediately, totally, and definitively when
ELIHPA took away the borrowers' unfettered right to pre-pay. See 240 F. 3d, at 1363. The Court of Appeals so ruled

despite petitioners' insistence that "the government's per-formance obligation under the contracts was to

accept prepayment" whenever tendered during the long life of theloans, even decades into the future.

Id., at 1362 (emphasis
added); see also 43 Fed. Cl., at 710.The Federal Circuit, we are persuaded, incorrectly characterized the performance allegedly due from the Government
under the promissory notes. If petitioners enjoyed a "rightto prepay their loans at any time," 240 F. 3d, at 1363, then

necessarily the Government had a corresponding obligation
to accept prepayment and execute the appropriate releases.
See Brief for Petitioners 5-6. Absent an obligation on the
lender to accept prepayment, the obligation "to allow" borrowers to prepay would be meaningless. A loan contract of
such incomplete design would be illusory. See J. Murray,
Contracts $ 2, p. 5 (2d rev. ed. 1974) (promise required
to create a binding contract must be an "undertaking or
commitment to do or refrain from doing [some]thing in the
future").

Once the Government's pledged performance is properly
comprehended as an obligation to accept prepayment, the
error in the Federal Circuit's reasoning becomes apparent.
Failure by the promisor to perform at the time indicated
for performance in the contract establishes an immediate

536US1 Unit: $U62 [01-14-04 18:28:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
breach. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 235(2)
(1979) (hereinafter Restatement) ("When performance of a
duty under a contract is due[,] any non-performance is a
breach."); Murray, supra, $ 206, at 417. But the promisor's
renunciation of a "contractual duty before the time fixed in
the contract for . . . performance" is a repudiation. 4 A.
Corbin, Contracts $ 959, p. 855 (1951) (emphasis added); Restatement $ 250 (repudiation entails a statement or "voluntary affirmative act" indicating that the promisor "will commit a breach" when performance becomes due). Such a
repudiation ripens into a breach prior to the time for performance only if the promisee "elects to treat it as such."
See Roehm v. Horst, 178 U. S. 1, 13 (1900) (repudiation
"give[s] the promisee the right of electing either to . . . wait
till the time for [the promisor's] performance has arrived, or
to act upon [the renunciation] and treat it as a final assertion
by the promisor that he is no longer bound by the contract").

Viewed in this light, ELIHPA effected a repudiation of the
FmHA loan contracts, not an immediate breach. The Act
conveyed an announcement by the Government that it would
not perform as represented in the promissory notes if and
when, at some point in the future, petitioners attempted to
prepay their mortgages. See Restatement $ 250, Comment
b ("[A] statement of intention not to perform except on conditions which go beyond the contract constitutes a repudiation." (internal quotation marks omitted)); Murray, supra,

$ 208, at 421. Unless petitioners treated ELIHPA as a present breach by filing suit prior to the date indicated for performance, breach would occur when a borrower attempted to
prepay, for only at that time would the Government's responsive performance become due.8

8 The record indicates that at least one petitioner has attempted to prepay, see App. to Pet. for Cert. A157-A158, but contains no information
about how many others have done so or when any such attempts took
place, see 43 Fed. Cl., at 707. Application of our holding to each petitioner
in light of such determinations is a task for the lower courts on remand.

144 FRANCONIA ASSOCIATES v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
In sum, once it is understood that ELIHPA is most sensi-bly characterized as a repudiation, the decisions below lose

force. To recapitulate, "[t]he time of accrual . . . depends onwhether the injured party chooses to treat the . . . repudiation as a present breach." 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Ac-tions $ 7.2.1, p. 488 (1991). If that party "[e]lects to place
the repudiator in breach before the performance date, the
accrual date of the cause of action is accelerated from [the]time of performance to the date of such election."

Id., at
488-489. But if the injured party instead opts to await per-formance, "the cause of action accrues, and the statute of

limitations commences to run, from the time fixed for performance rather than from the earlier date of repudiation."
Id., at 488.

The Government draws no distinction "between a duty to
allow petitioners to prepay and a duty to accept tendered
prepayments"; "any such distinction," the Government acknowledges, "would be without significance." Brief for
United States 33. Indeed, the Government recognizes, if
petitioners had an "unfettered right to prepay," then, "of
course," that right would be complemented by an "obligation
to accept any prepayment tendered." Ibid. In defense of
the judgment below, the Government relies on two other
grounds.

First, the Government draws upon the text of $ 2501,
which bars any claims not "filed within six years after [the]
claim first accrues." The words "first accrues," the Government contends, are key. See id., at 11. Those words, according to the Government, convey Congress' intent to guard
the sovereign against claims that might be deemed timely
under statutes of limitations applicable to private parties.
Id., at 28. As the Government reads $ 2501, the "first accrues" qualification ensures that suits against the United
States are filed on "the earliest possible date," id., at 17,
thereby providing the Government with "reasonably prompt
notice of the fiscal implications of past enactments," id.,

536US1 Unit: $U62 [01-14-04 18:28:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

145Cite as: 536 U. S. 129 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
at 16. See ibid. ("[S]trict construction of [$ 2501] . . . servesthe salutary purpose of ensuring that a Congress close to the

one that enacted the statute [alleged to have caused a breachof contract]--rather than a Congress serving perhaps many
decades later--may and must address the consequences.");see Tr. of Oral Arg. 45-46.

We do not agree that $ 2501 creates a special accrual rulefor suits against the United States. Contrary to the Government's contention, the text of $ 2501 is unexceptional: Anumber of contemporaneous state statutes of limitations applicable to suits between private parties also tie the com-mencement of the limitations period to the date a claim "first
accrues." See J. Angell, Limitations of Actions 536-588 (6thed. 1876) (quoting state statutes of limitations). Equally
telling, in its many years of applying and interpreting $ 2501,the Court of Federal Claims has never attributed to the
words "first accrues" the meaning the Government now pro-poses. Instead, in other settings, that court has adopted the
repudiation doctrine in its traditional form when evaluatingthe timeliness of suits governed by $ 2501. See Plaintiffs

conclude, presents an "unduly restrictiv[e]" reading of thecongressional waiver of sovereign immunity, Bowen v. City

Opinion of the Court
Two practical considerations reinforce this conclusion.Cf. Crown Coat Front Co. v. United States, 386 U. S. 503, 517

(1967) (the words "first accrues" must be interpreted "withdue regard to those practical ends which are to be served
by any limitation of the time within which an action mustbe brought" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Reading

$ 2501 as the Government proposes would seriously distortthe repudiation doctrine in suits brought under the Tucker
Act. Assuming a claim could "first accrue" for limitationspurposes on the date of repudiation, but see

supra, at 144, aparty aggrieved by the Government's renunciation of a contractual obligation anticipating future performance would becompelled by the looming limitations bar to forgo the usual
option of awaiting the time performance is due before filingan action for breach. The Government's construction of

$ 2501 would thus convert the repudiation doctrine from ashield for the promisee into a sword by which the Government could invoke its own wrongdoing to defeat otherwisetimely suits. As Professor Corbin explained, "[t]he plaintiff
should not be penalized for leaving to the defendant an op-portunity to retract his wrongful repudiation; and he would
be so penalized if the statutory period of limitation is heldto begin to run against him immediately." Corbin, Contracts $ 989, at 967; see Roehm v. Horst, 178 U. S., at 10 ("[I]tseems reasonable to allow an option to the injured party,
either to sue immediately, or to wait till the time when theact was to be done, . . . which may be advantageous to the
innocent party.").There is also reason to doubt that the Government's reading of $ 2501 would inure to the benefit of the United States.Putting prospective plaintiffs to the choice of either bringing
suit soon after the Government's repudiation or forever re-linquishing their claims would surely proliferate litigation.

Opinion of the Court
Every borrower of FmHA loans, for example, would beforced to sue the Government within six years of ELIHPA's

enactment in order to preserve a claim stemming from thatAct. Faced with the prospect of forever forgoing such a
claim, even a borrower that had not previously wished toprepay might well conclude that early exit from the FmHA
program is the only safe course. The Government would
thus find itself defending against highly speculative damagesclaims in a profusion of lawsuits, most of which would never

have been brought under a less novel interpretation of$ 2501. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.

The Government also seeks to avoid the repudiation doc-trine by attacking as "futile" petitioners' "search for an exact

parallel in contracts solely between private parties." Brieffor United States 13. The law of repudiation does not govern here, the Government ultimately contends, because the"statement of intent not to perform" on which petitioners
base their claim is an Act of Congress. Id., at 24. According to the Government, a congressional enactment like
ELIHPA that precludes the Government from honoring a
contractual obligation anticipating future performance always constitutes a present breach. This is so, the Government maintains, because "the promisor"--the agency or official responsible for administering the contract--does not

10 The Government's reliance on McMahon v. United States, 342 U. S. 25
(1951), is misplaced. Brief for United States 29-30. The Court there
rejected an interpretation of the Suits in Admiralty Act that would have
given tort plaintiffs "an option as to when they will choose to start the
period of limitation of an action against the United States." 342 U. S.,
at 27. The reasoning in that case does not apply to petitioners' claims,
which arise out of contracts in which the Government allegedly granted
borrowers an option to demand performance, and thereby precipitate
breach, at any time. See supra, at 141. And unlike the position rejected
in McMahon, our ruling today ensures that suit must be brought within
a fixed period after the date of injury--in this case, no later than six years
after the Government's refusal to accept prepayment in accord with the
terms of the promissory notes.

Opinion of the Court
"remai[n] free to change its mind and render the requisiteperformance" without violating binding federal law.

Id.,
at 27. Accordingly, the Government concludes, the essentialpurpose of the repudiation doctrine--to avoid an unnecessary lawsuit by allowing the promisor an opportunity to ad-here to its undertaking--is inapplicable.

We reject the Government's premise, and therefore its
conclusion. Just as Congress may announce the Govern-ment's intent to dishonor an obligation to perform in the

future through a duly enacted law, so may it retract thatrenouncement prior to the time for performance, thereby
enabling the agency or contracting official to perform as
promised. Indeed, Congress "change[d] its mind" in just
this manner before it enacted ELIHPA. Ibid. In the 1979
amendments to the National Housing Act, Congress repudiated the promissory notes at issue here by conditioning prepayment of all $ 515 loans on the borrower's agreement to
maintain the low-income use of its property for a specified
period. See Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1979, 93 Stat. 1134-1135. One year later, Congress
removed those conditions on pre-1979 loans, thereby retracting the repudiation. See Housing and Community Development Act of 1980, 94 Stat. 1671-1672; supra, at 135.

We comprehend no reason why an Act of Congress may
not constitute a repudiation of a contract to which the United
States is a party. Congress may renounce the Government's
contractual duties without triggering an immediate breach
because Congress may withdraw that repudiation if given
the opportunity to do so. "Hence, . . . the fact that [the Government's] repudiation rested upon the enactment of a new
statute makes no significant difference." Mobil Oil, 530
U. S., at 620; see id., at 619 ("[I]f legislation passed by Congress and signed by the President is not a `statement by the
obligor' " capable of triggering a repudiation, "it is difficult to
imagine what would constitute such a statement." (quoting
Restatement $ 250)).

To answer the question presented--when does the statuteof limitations on petitioners' claims begin to run, see Pet. for

Cert. i--we need not separately address petitioners' alter-native theory of recovery based on the Takings Clause of
the Fifth Amendment. The Federal Circuit's holding thattakings relief was time barred hinged entirely on its conclusion that petitioners' contract claims accrued upon passageof ELIHPA. See 240 F. 3d, at 1365-1366. Because that
conclusion was incorrect, we hold, the Federal Circuit erredin dismissing petitioners' takings theory on grounds of
untimeliness. * * *

Concluding that each petitioner's claim is timely if filedwithin six years of a wrongly rejected tender of prepayment,
we reverse the judgments of the Federal Circuit and remandthe Franconia and Grass Valley cases reviewed herein for
further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

WATCHTOWER BIBLE & TRACT SOCIETY OFNEW YORK, INC.,

et al. v. VILLAGEOF STRATTON

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 00-1737. Argued February 26, 2002--Decided June 17, 2002
Respondent Village of Stratton (Village) promulgated an ordinance that,

inter alia, prohibits "canvassers" from "going in and upon" private residential property to promote any "cause" without first obtaining a permit
from the mayor's office by completing and signing a registration form.
Petitioners, a society and a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses that
publish and distribute religious materials, brought this action for injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance violates their First Amendment
rights to the free exercise of religion, free speech, and freedom of the
press. The District Court upheld most provisions of the ordinance as
valid, content-neutral regulations, although it did require the Village to
accept narrowing constructions of several provisions. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. Among its rulings, that court held that the ordinance
was content neutral and of general applicability and therefore subject
to intermediate scrutiny; rejected petitioners' argument that the ordinance is overbroad because it impairs the right to distribute pamphlets
anonymously that was recognized in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections
Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334; concluded that the Village's interests in protecting its residents from fraud and undue annoyance and its desire to prevent criminals from posing as canvassers in order to defraud its residents were sufficient bases on which to justify the regulation; and
distinguished this Court's earlier cases protecting the Jehovah's Witnesses ministry.

Held: The ordinance's provisions making it a misdemeanor to engage in

door-to-door advocacy without first registering with the mayor and
receiving a permit violate the First Amendment as it applies to religious proselytizing, anonymous political speech, and the distribution of
handbills. Pp. 160-169.

(a) For over 50 years, this Court has invalidated on First Amendment
grounds restrictions on door-to-door canvassing and pamphleteering by
Jehovah's Witnesses. See, e. g., Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S.
105. Although those cases do not directly control the question at issue,
they yield several themes that guide the Court. Among other things,

536US1 Unit: $U63 [12-16-03 20:25:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

151Cite as: 536 U. S. 150 (2002)
Syllabus
those cases emphasize that the hand distribution of religious tracts is
ages old and has the same claim as more orthodox practices to the guarantees of freedom of religion, speech, and press, e. g., id., at 109; discuss
extensively the historical importance of door-to-door canvassing and
pamphleteering as vehicles for the dissemination of ideas, e. g., Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147, 164, but recognize the
legitimate interests a town may have in some form of regulation, particularly when the solicitation of money is involved, e. g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306, or the prevention of burglary is a legitimate
concern, Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 144; make clear that
there must be a balance between such interests and the effect of the
regulations on First Amendment rights, e. g., ibid.; and demonstrate
that the Jehovah's Witnesses have not struggled for their rights alone,
but for those many who are poorly financed and rely extensively upon
this method of communication, see, e. g., id., at 144-146, including nonreligious groups and individuals, see, e. g., Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S.
516, 539-540. Pp. 160-164.

(b) The Court need not resolve the parties' dispute as to what standard of review to use here because the breadth of speech affected by the
ordinance and the nature of the regulation make it clear that the Sixth
Circuit erred in upholding it. There is no doubt that the interests the
ordinance assertedly serves--the prevention of fraud and crime and the
protection of residents' privacy--are important and that the Village may
seek to safeguard them through some form of regulation of solicitation
activity. However, the amount of speech covered by the ordinance
raises serious concerns. Had its provisions been construed to apply
only to commercial activities and the solicitation of funds, arguably the
ordinance would have been tailored to the Village's interest in protecting its residents' privacy and preventing fraud. Yet, the Village's administration of its ordinance unquestionably demonstrates that it applies
to a significant number of noncommercial "canvassers" promoting a wide
variety of "causes." The pernicious effect of the permit requirement is
illustrated by, e. g., the requirement that a canvasser be identified in a
permit application filed in the mayor's office and made available for public inspection, which necessarily results in a surrender of the anonymity
this Court has protected. Also central to the Court's conclusion that
the ordinance does not pass First Amendment scrutiny is that it is not
tailored to the Village's stated interests. Even if the interest in preventing fraud could adequately support the ordinance insofar as it applies to commercial transactions and the solicitation of funds, that interest provides no support for its application to petitioners, to political
campaigns, or to enlisting support for unpopular causes. The Village's

argument that the ordinance is nonetheless valid because it serves the
two additional interests of protecting residents' privacy and the prevention of crime is unpersuasive. As to the former, an unchallenged ordinance section authorizing residents to post "No Solicitation" signs, coupled with their unquestioned right to refuse to engage in conversation
with unwelcome visitors, provides ample protection for unwilling listeners. As to the latter, it seems unlikely that the lack of a permit would
preclude criminals from knocking on doors and engaging in conversations not covered by the ordinance, and, in any event, there is no evidence in the record of a special crime problem related to door-to-door
solicitation. Pp. 164-169.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioners contend that a village ordinance making it amisdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy without

first registering with the mayor and receiving a permit vio-lates the First Amendment. Through this facial challenge,
we consider the door-to-door canvassing regulation not onlyas it applies to religious proselytizing, but also to anonymous
political speech and the distribution of handbills.

VILLAGE OF STRATTON

Opinion of the Court

District of Ohio, seeking an injunction against the enforcement of several sections of Ordinance No. 1998-5 regulating
uninvited peddling and solicitation on private property in the
Village. Petitioners' complaint alleged that the ordinance
violated several constitutional rights, including the free exercise of religion, free speech, and the freedom of the press.
App. 10a-44a. The District Court conducted a bench trial
at which evidence of the administration of the ordinance and
its effect on petitioners was introduced.

Section 116.01 prohibits "canvassers" and others from
"going in and upon" private residential property for the purpose of promoting any "cause" without first having obtained
a permit pursuant to $ 116.03.1 That section provides that

any canvasser who intends to go on private property to
promote a cause must obtain a "Solicitation Permit" from
the office of the mayor; there is no charge for the permit,
and apparently one is issued routinely after an applicant

1 Section 116.01 provides: "The practice of going in and upon private
property and/or the private residences of Village residents in the Village
by canvassers, solicitors, peddlers, hawkers, itinerant merchants or transient vendors of merchandise or services, not having been invited to do so
by the owners or occupants of such private property or residences, and
not having first obtained a permit pursuant to Section 116.03 of this Chapter, for the purpose of advertising, promoting, selling and/or explaining
any product, service, organization or cause, or for the purpose of soliciting
orders for the sale of goods, wares, merchandise or services, is hereby
declared to be a nuisance and is prohibited." App. to Brief for Respondents 2a. The Village has interpreted the term "canvassers" to include
Jehovah's Witnesses and the term "cause" to include their ministry. The
ordinance does not appear to require a permit for a surveyor since such
an individual would not be entering private property "for the purpose
of advertising, promoting, selling and/or explaining any product, service,
organization or cause, or for the purpose of soliciting orders for the sale
of goods, wares, merchandise or services." Thus, contrary to the assumption of the dissent in its heavy reliance on the example from Dartmouth,
post, at 172-173, 177, 179 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.), the Village's ordinance would have done nothing to prevent that tragic crime.

Petitioners did not apply for a permit.

A section of the ordinance that petitioners do not challenge
establishes a procedure by which a resident may prohibit
solicitation even by holders of permits. If the resident files
a "No Solicitation Registration Form" with the mayor, and
also posts a "No Solicitation" sign on his property, no uninvited canvassers may enter his property, unless they are
specifically authorized to do so in the "No Solicitation Registration Form" itself.5 Only 32 of the Village's 278 residents

same shall be exhibited by such person whenever he is requested to do so
by any police officer or by any person who is solicited." Id., at 4a.

Chapter may be denied or revoked by the Mayor for any one or more of
the following reasons:

"(b) Fraud or misrepresentation contained in the Solicitor's Registration Form.

"(c) Fraud, misrepresentation or false statements made in the course of

Ordinances or of any State or Federal Law.

preach from Scripture.7 "For us to seek a permit from amunicipality to preach we feel would almost be an insult to

God." App. 321a.Petitioners introduced some evidence that the ordinance
was the product of the mayor's hostility to their ministry,but the District Court credited the mayor's testimony that
it had been designed to protect the privacy rights of theVillage residents, specifically to protect them "from `flim
flam' con artists who prey on small town populations." 61F. Supp. 2d 734, 736 (SD Ohio 1999). Nevertheless, the
court concluded that the terms of the ordinance applied to
the activities of petitioners as well as to "business or politicalcanvassers,"

id., at 737, 738.
The District Court upheld most provisions of the ordi-nance as valid, content-neutral regulations that did not infringe on petitioners' First Amendment rights. The courtdid, however, require the Village to accept narrowing constructions of three provisions. First, the court viewed therequirement in $ 116.03(b)(5) that the applicant must list the
specific address of each residence to be visited as potentially
invalid, but cured by the Village's agreement to attach to theform a list of willing residents.

Id., at 737. Second, it held
that petitioners could comply with $ 116.03(b)(6) by merelystating their purpose as "the Jehovah's Witness ministry."

Id., at 738. And third, it held that $ 116.05, which limitedcanvassing to the hours before 5 p.m., was invalid on its face
and should be replaced with a provision referring to "reason-able hours of the day."

Id., at 739. As so modified, the
court held the ordinance constitutionally valid as applied topetitioners and dismissed the case.

7 Specifically, from the Book of "Matthew chapter 28, verses 19 and 20,
which we take as our commission to preach. . . . So Jesus, by example,
instituted a house-to-house search for people so as to preach the good
news to them. And that's the activity that Jehovah's Witnesses engage
in, even as Christ's apostles did after his resurrection to heaven." Id.,

of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990),8because that "language was dicta and therefore not binding."
240 F. 3d, at 561. It also rejected petitioners' argument thatthe ordinance is overbroad because it impairs the right to
distribute pamphlets anonymously that we recognized in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334 (1995), rea-soning that "the very act of going door-to-door requires the

canvassers to reveal a portion of their identities." 240 F. 3d,at 563. The Court of Appeals concluded that the interests
promoted by the Village--"protecting its residents fromfraud and undue annoyance"--as well as the harm that it
seeks to prevent--"criminals posing as canvassers in orderto defraud its residents"--though "by no means overwhelming," were sufficient to justify the regulation. Id., at 565-566. The court distinguished earlier cases protecting the
Jehovah's Witnesses ministry because those cases either in8 "The only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment

volved a flat prohibition on the dissemination of ideas, e. g.,Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U. S. 141 (1943), or an ordinance that left the issuance of a permit to the discretion ofa municipal officer, see, e. g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310
U. S. 296, 302 (1940).In dissent, Judge Gilman expressed the opinion that by
subjecting noncommercial solicitation to the permit require-ments, the ordinance significantly restricted a substantial
quantity of speech unrelated to the Village's interest in elimi-nating fraud and unwanted annoyance. In his view, the Village "failed to demonstrate either the reality of the harm orthe efficacy of the restriction." 240 F. 3d, at 572.

We granted certiorari to decide the following question:"Does a municipal ordinance that requires one to obtain a
permit prior to engaging in the door-to-door advocacy of apolitical cause and to display upon demand the permit, which
contains one's name, violate the First Amendment protectionaccorded to anonymous pamphleteering or discourse?" 534

II
For over 50 years, the Court has invalidated restrictionson door-to-door canvassing and pamphleteering.

10 It is

more than historical accident that most of these cases in-volved First Amendment challenges brought by Jehovah's

Witnesses, because door-to-door canvassing is mandated bytheir religion. As we noted in

Murdock v. Pennsylvania,

9 In their briefs and at oral argument, the parties debated a factual issue
embedded in the question presented, namely, whether the permit contains
the speaker's name. We need not resolve this factual dispute in order to
answer whether the ordinance's registration requirement abridges so
much protected speech that it is invalid on its face.

Opinion of the Court
319 U. S. 105, 108 (1943), the Jehovah's Witnesses "claimto follow the example of Paul, teaching `publickly, and from

house to house.' Acts 20:20. They take literally the man-date of the Scriptures, `Go ye into all the world, and preach
the gospel to every creature.' Mark 16:15. In doing sothey believe that they are obeying a commandment of God."
Moreover, because they lack significant financial resources,the ability of the Witnesses to proselytize is seriously diminished by regulations that burden their efforts to canvassdoor-to-door.

Although our past cases involving Jehovah's Witnesses,most of which were decided shortly before and during World
War II, do not directly control the question we confronttoday, they provide both a historical and analytical backdrop
for consideration of petitioners' First Amendment claim thatthe breadth of the Village's ordinance offends the First
Amendment.11 Those cases involved petty offenses thatraised constitutional questions of the most serious magnitude--questions that implicated the free exercise of religion,the freedom of speech, and the freedom of the press. From
these decisions, several themes emerge that guide our con-sideration of the ordinance at issue here.

First, the cases emphasize the value of the speech in-volved. For example, in Murdock v. Pennsylvania, the
Court noted that "hand distribution of religious tracts is anage-old form of missionary evangelism--as old as the history
of printing presses. It has been a potent force in variousreligious movements down through the years. . . . This form
of religious activity occupies the same high estate under theFirst Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits. It has the same claim to protection asthe more orthodox and conventional exercises of religion.

11 The question presented is similar to one raised, but not decided, in
Hynes. The ordinance that we held invalid in that case on vagueness
grounds required advance notice to the police before "casually soliciting
the votes of neighbors." 425 U. S., at 620, n. 4.

VILLAGE OF STRATTON

Opinion of the Court

It also has the same claim as the others to the guaranteesof freedom of speech and freedom of the press."

Id.,
at 108-109.In addition, the cases discuss extensively the historical

importance of door-to-door canvassing and pamphleteeringas vehicles for the dissemination of ideas. In

Schneider v.
State (Town of Irvington), 308 U. S. 147 (1939), the petitioner was a Jehovah's Witness who had been convicted ofcanvassing without a permit based on evidence that she had

gone from house to house offering to leave books or booklets.Writing for the Court, Justice Roberts stated that "pamphlets have proved most effective instruments in the dissemination of opinion. And perhaps the most effective way of
bringing them to the notice of individuals is their distribution at the homes of the people. On this method of
communication the ordinance imposes censorship, abuse of
which engendered the struggle in England which eventuated
in the establishment of the doctrine of the freedom of the
press embodied in our Constitution. To require a censorship through license which makes impossible the free and
unhampered distribution of pamphlets strikes at the very
heart of the constitutional guarantees." Id., at 164 (emphasis added).

Despite the emphasis on the important role that door-todoor canvassing and pamphleteering has played in our constitutional tradition of free and open discussion, these early
cases also recognized the interests a town may have in some
form of regulation, particularly when the solicitation of
money is involved. In Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S.
296 (1940), the Court held that an ordinance requiring Jehovah's Witnesses to obtain a license before soliciting door to
door was invalid because the issuance of the license depended on the exercise of discretion by a city official. Our
opinion recognized that "a State may protect its citizens
from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the
community, before permitting him publicly to solicit funds

Opinion of the Court
for any purpose, to establish his identity and his authority
to act for the cause which he purports to represent." Id.,
at 306. Similarly, in Martin v. City of Struthers, the Court
recognized crime prevention as a legitimate interest served
by these ordinances and noted that "burglars frequently pose
as canvassers, either in order that they may have a pretense
to discover whether a house is empty and hence ripe for burglary, or for the purpose of spying out the premises in order
that they may return later." 319 U. S., at 144. Despite recognition of these interests as legitimate, our precedent is
clear that there must be a balance between these interests
and the effect of the regulations on First Amendment rights.
We "must `be astute to examine the effect of the challenged
legislation' and must `weigh the circumstances and . . . appraise the substantiality of the reasons advanced in support
of the regulation.' " Ibid. (quoting Schneider, 308 U. S., at
161).

Finally, the cases demonstrate that efforts of the Jehovah's
Witnesses to resist speech regulation have not been a struggle for their rights alone. In Martin, after cataloging the
many groups that rely extensively upon this method of
communication, the Court summarized that "[d]oor to door
distribution of circulars is essential to the poorly financed
causes of little people." 319 U. S., at 144-146.

That the Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only "little people" who face the risk of silencing by regulations like the
Village's is exemplified by our cases involving nonreligious
speech. See, e. g., Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620 (1980); Hynes v. Mayor and Council
of Oradell, 425 U. S. 610 (1976); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S.
516 (1945). In Thomas, the issue was whether a labor leader
could be required to obtain a permit before delivering
a speech to prospective union members. After reviewing

the Jehovah's Witnesses cases discussed above, the Court
observed:

164 WATCHTOWER BIBLE & TRACT SOC. OF N. Y., INC. v.

VILLAGE OF STRATTON

Opinion of the Court

"As a matter of principle a requirement of registrationin order to make a public speech would seem generally

incompatible with an exercise of the rights of freespeech and free assembly. . . .

. . . . .
"If the exercise of the rights of free speech and free
assembly cannot be made a crime, we do not think this
can be accomplished by the device of requiring previousregistration as a condition for exercising them and making such a condition the foundation for restraining inadvance their exercise and for imposing a penalty for
violating such a restraining order. So long as no moreis involved than exercise of the rights of free speech and
free assembly, it is immune to such a restriction. If onewho solicits support for the cause of labor may be required to register as a condition to the exercise of hisright to make a public speech, so may he who seeks to
rally support for any social, business, religious or politi-cal cause. We think a requirement that one must register before he undertakes to make a public speech to enlist support for a lawful movement is quite incompatiblewith the requirements of the First Amendment."

Id.,
at 539-540.

Although these World War II-era cases provide guidancefor our consideration of the question presented, they do not

answer one preliminary issue that the parties adamantly dis-pute. That is, what standard of review ought we use in assessing the constitutionality of this ordinance. We find it
unnecessary, however, to resolve that dispute because the
breadth of speech affected by the ordinance and the nature
of the regulation make it clear that the Court of Appeals
erred in upholding it.

III

The Village argues that three interests are served by its
ordinance: the prevention of fraud, the prevention of crime,

536US1 Unit: $U63 [12-16-03 20:25:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
and the protection of residents' privacy. We have no diffi-culty concluding, in light of our precedent, that these are

important interests that the Village may seek to safeguardthrough some form of regulation of solicitation activity. We
must also look, however, to the amount of speech covered bythe ordinance and whether there is an appropriate balance
between the affected speech and the governmental interests
that the ordinance purports to serve.The text of the Village's ordinance prohibits "canvassers"

from going on private property for the purpose of explainingor promoting any "cause," unless they receive a permit and
the residents visited have not opted for a "no solicitation"sign. Had this provision been construed to apply only to
commercial activities and the solicitation of funds, arguablythe ordinance would have been tailored to the Village's interest in protecting the privacy of its residents and preventingfraud. Yet, even though the Village has explained that the
ordinance was adopted to serve those interests, it has never
contended that it should be so narrowly interpreted. To the
contrary, the Village's administration of its ordinance unquestionably demonstrates that the provisions apply to a significant number of noncommercial "canvassers" promoting a
wide variety of "causes." Indeed, on the "No Solicitation
Forms" provided to the residents, the canvassers include
"Camp Fire Girls," "Jehovah's Witnesses," "Political Candidates," "Trick or Treaters during Halloween Season," and
"Persons Affiliated with Stratton Church." The ordinance
unquestionably applies, not only to religious causes, but to
political activity as well. It would seem to extend to "residents casually soliciting the votes of neighbors," 12 or ringing
doorbells to enlist support for employing a more efficient
garbage collector.

The mere fact that the ordinance covers so much speech
raises constitutional concerns. It is offensive--not only to

12 Hynes, 425 U. S., at 620, n. 4.

VILLAGE OF STRATTON

Opinion of the Court

the values protected by the First Amendment, but to the
very notion of a free society--that in the context of everyday
public discourse a citizen must first inform the government
of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then obtain a
permit to do so. Even if the issuance of permits by the mayor's office is a ministerial task that is performed promptly
and at no cost to the applicant, a law requiring a permit to
engage in such speech constitutes a dramatic departure from
our national heritage and constitutional tradition. Three
obvious examples illustrate the pernicious effect of such a
permit requirement.

First, as our cases involving distribution of unsigned handbills demonstrate,13 there are a significant number of persons
who support causes anonymously.14 "The decision in favor
of anonymity may be motivated by fear of economic or official
retaliation, by concern about social ostracism, or merely by
a desire to preserve as much of one's privacy as possible."
McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S., at 341-342.
The requirement that a canvasser must be identified in a
permit application filed in the mayor's office and available for
public inspection necessarily results in a surrender of that
anonymity. Although it is true, as the Court of Appeals suggested, see 240 F. 3d, at 563, that persons who are known to
the resident reveal their allegiance to a group or cause when
they present themselves at the front door to advocate an
issue or to deliver a handbill, the Court of Appeals erred in
concluding that the ordinance does not implicate anonymity
interests. The Sixth Circuit's reasoning is undermined by

13 Talley v. California, 362 U. S. 60 (1960); McIntyre v. Ohio Elections
Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334 (1995).

14 Although the Jehovah's Witnesses do not themselves object to a loss

of anonymity, they bring this facial challenge in part on the basis of overbreadth. We may, therefore, consider the impact of this ordinance on the
free speech rights of individuals who are deterred from speaking because
the registration provision would require them to forgo their right to speak
anonymously. See Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601, 612 (1973).

Opinion of the Court
our decision in Buckley v. American Constitutional Law
Foundation, Inc., 525 U. S. 182 (1999). The badge requirement that we invalidated in Buckley applied to petition cir-culators seeking signatures in face-to-face interactions. The

fact that circulators revealed their physical identities did notforeclose our consideration of the circulators' interest in
maintaining their anonymity. In the Village, strangers to
the resident certainly maintain their anonymity, and theordinance may preclude such persons from canvassing for

unpopular causes. Such preclusion may well be justified insome situations--for example, by the special state interest
in protecting the integrity of a ballot-initiative process, see
ibid., or by the interest in preventing fraudulent commercial
transactions. The Village ordinance, however, sweeps more
broadly, covering unpopular causes unrelated to commercial
transactions or to any special interest in protecting the electoral process.

Second, requiring a permit as a prior condition on the exercise of the right to speak imposes an objective burden on
some speech of citizens holding religious or patriotic views.
As our World War II-era cases dramatically demonstrate,
there are a significant number of persons whose religious
scruples will prevent them from applying for such a license.
There are no doubt other patriotic citizens, who have such
firm convictions about their constitutional right to engage in
uninhibited debate in the context of door-to-door advocacy,
that they would prefer silence to speech licensed by a petty
official.

Third, there is a significant amount of spontaneous speech
that is effectively banned by the ordinance. A person who
made a decision on a holiday or a weekend to take an active
part in a political campaign could not begin to pass out handbills until after he or she obtained the required permit.
Even a spontaneous decision to go across the street and urge
a neighbor to vote against the mayor could not lawfully be
implemented without first obtaining the mayor's permission.

168 WATCHTOWER BIBLE & TRACT SOC. OF N. Y., INC. v.

VILLAGE OF STRATTON

Opinion of the Court

In this respect, the regulation is analogous to the circulation
licensing tax the Court invalidated in Grosjean v. American
Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 (1936). In Grosjean, while discussing the history of the Free Press Clause of the First Amendment, the Court stated that " `[t]he evils to be prevented
were not the censorship of the press merely, but any action
of the government by means of which it might prevent such
free and general discussion of public matters as seems absolutely essential to prepare the people for an intelligent exercise of their rights as citizens.' " Id., at 249-250 (quoting 2
T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 886 (8th ed. 1927)); see
also Lovell v. City of Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938).

The breadth and unprecedented nature of this regulation
does not alone render the ordinance invalid. Also central to
our conclusion that the ordinance does not pass First Amendment scrutiny is that it is not tailored to the Village's stated
interests. Even if the interest in preventing fraud could adequately support the ordinance insofar as it applies to commercial transactions and the solicitation of funds, that interest provides no support for its application to petitioners, to
political campaigns, or to enlisting support for unpopular
causes. The Village, however, argues that the ordinance is
nonetheless valid because it serves the two additional interests of protecting the privacy of the resident and the prevention of crime.

With respect to the former, it seems clear that $ 107 of the
ordinance, which provides for the posting of "No Solicitation"
signs and which is not challenged in this case, coupled with
the resident's unquestioned right to refuse to engage in conversation with unwelcome visitors, provides ample protection for the unwilling listener. Schaumburg, 444 U. S., at
639 ("[T]he provision permitting homeowners to bar solicitors from their property by posting [no solicitation] signs . . .
suggest[s] the availability of less intrusive and more effective
measures to protect privacy"). The annoyance caused by an

Breyer, J., concurring
uninvited knock on the front door is the same whether or notthe visitor is armed with a permit.

With respect to the latter, it seems unlikely that the ab-sence of a permit would preclude criminals from knocking
on doors and engaging in conversations not covered by theordinance. They might, for example, ask for directions or
permission to use the telephone, or pose as surveyers or census takers. See n. 1, supra. Or they might register undera false name with impunity because the ordinance contains

no provision for verifying an applicant's identity or organiza-tional credentials. Moreover, the Village did not assert an
interest in crime prevention below, and there is an absenceof any evidence of a special crime problem related to doorto-door solicitation in the record before us.

The rhetoric used in the World War II-era opinions that
repeatedly saved petitioners' coreligionists from petty prosecutions reflected the Court's evaluation of the First Amendment freedoms that are implicated in this case. The value
judgment that then motivated a united democratic people
fighting to defend those very freedoms from totalitarian attack is unchanged. It motivates our decision today.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and
the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Ginsburg join, concurring.

While joining the Court's opinion, I write separately to
note that the dissent's "crime prevention" justification for
this ordinance is not a strong one. Cf. post, at 176-180 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.). For one thing, there is no indication that the legislative body that passed the ordinance
considered this justification. Stratton did not rely on the
rationale in the courts below, see 61 F. Supp. 2d 734, 736

ordinance as "constructed to protect the Village residentsfrom `flim flam' con artists"); 240 F. 3d 553, 565 (CA6 2001)

(opinion of the Court of Appeals describing interests as "pro-tecting [the Village's] residents from fraud and undue annoyance"), and its general references to "deter[ing] crime" inits brief to this Court cannot fairly be construed to include
anything other than the fraud it discusses specifically. Brief
for Respondents 14-18.In the intermediate scrutiny context, the Court ordinarily

does not supply reasons the legislative body has not given.Cf.

United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.,
529 U. S. 803, 816 (2000) ("When the Government restricts
speech, the Government bears the burden of proving the constitutionality of its actions" (emphasis added)). That does
not mean, as The Chief Justice suggests, that only a government with a "battery of constitutional lawyers," post, at
172, could satisfy this burden. It does mean that we expect
a government to give its real reasons for passing an ordinance. Legislators, in even the smallest town, are perfectly
able to do so--sometimes better on their own than with too
many lawyers, e. g., a "battery," trying to offer their advice.
I can only conclude that if the village of Stratton thought
preventing burglaries and violent crimes was an important
justification for this ordinance, it would have said so.

But it is not just that. It is also intuitively implausible
to think that Stratton's ordinance serves any governmental
interest in preventing such crimes. As the Court notes,
several categories of potential criminals will remain entirely
untouched by the ordinance. Ante, at 168-169, 154, n. 1.
And as to those who might be affected by it, "[w]e have never
accepted mere conjecture as adequate to carry a First
Amendment burden," Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 392 (2000). Even less readily
should we accept such implausible conjecture offered not by
the party itself but only by an amicus, see Brief for Ohio
et al. as Amici Curiae 5-6.

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment
Because Stratton did not rely on the crime prevention jus-tification, because Stratton has not now "present[ed] more

than anecdote and supposition," Playboy Entertainment
Group, supra, at 822, and because the relationship between
the interest and the ordinance is doubtful, I am unwilling toassume that these conjectured benefits outweigh the cost of

abridging the speech covered by the ordinance.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring in the judgment.

I concur in the judgment, for many but not all of the reasons set forth in the opinion for the Court. I do not agree,for example, that one of the causes of the invalidity of Stratton's ordinance is that some people have a religious objectionto applying for a permit, and others (posited by the Court)
"have such firm convictions about their constitutional right
to engage in uninhibited debate in the context of doorto-door advocacy, that they would prefer silence to speech

licensed by a petty official." Ante, at 167.

If a licensing requirement is otherwise lawful, it is in my
view not invalidated by the fact that some people will choose,
for religious reasons, to forgo speech rather than observe
it. That would convert an invalid free-exercise claim,
see Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.
v. Smith, 494 U. S. 872 (1990), into a valid free-speech
claim--and a more destructive one at that. Whereas the
free-exercise claim, if acknowledged, would merely exempt
Jehovah's Witnesses from the licensing requirement, the
free-speech claim exempts everybody, thanks to Jehovah's
Witnesses.

As for the Court's fairytale category of "patriotic citizens,"
ante, at 167, who would rather be silenced than licensed in a
manner that the Constitution (but for their "patriotic" objection) would permit: If our free-speech jurisprudence is to be
determined by the predicted behavior of such crackpots, we
are in a sorry state indeed.

VILLAGE OF STRATTON

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting

Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.
Stratton is a village of 278 people located along the OhioRiver where the borders of Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania converge. It is strung out along a multilane high-way connecting it with the cities of East Liverpool to the
north and Steubenville and Weirton, West Virginia, to thesouth. One may doubt how much legal help a village of this
size has available in drafting an ordinance such as the pres-ent one, but even if it had availed itself of a battery of constitutional lawyers, they would have been of little use in thetown's effort. For the Court today ignores the cases on
which those lawyers would have relied, and comes up withnewly fashioned doctrine. This doctrine contravenes wellestablished precedent, renders local governments largely im-potent to address the very real safety threat that canvassers
pose, and may actually result in less of the door-to-door com-munication that it seeks to protect.

More than half a century ago we recognized that canvass-ers, "whether selling pots or distributing leaflets, may lessen
the peaceful enjoyment of a home," and that "burglars fre-quently pose as canvassers, either in order that they may
have a pretense to discover whether a house is empty and
hence ripe for burglary, or for the purpose of spying out thepremises in order that they may return later."

Martin v.
City of Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 144 (1943). These problemscontinue to be associated with door-to-door canvassing, as

are even graver ones.A recent double murder in Hanover, New Hampshire, a
town of approximately 7,500 that would appear tranquil tomost Americans but would probably seem like a bustling
town of Dartmouth College students to Stratton residents,illustrates these dangers. Two teenagers murdered a married couple of Dartmouth College professors, Half and Su-sanne Zantop, in the Zantops' home. Investigators have
concluded, based on the confession of one of the teenagers,
that the teenagers went door-to-door intent on stealing

access numbers to bank debit cards and then killing theirowners. See Dartmouth Professors Called Random Targets, Washington Post, Feb. 20, 2002, p. A2. Their modus
operandi was to tell residents that they were conducting an
environmental survey for school. They canvassed a fewhomes where no one answered. At another, the resident did

not allow them in to conduct the "survey." They were allowed into the Zantop home. After conducting the phonyenvironmental survey, they stabbed the Zantops to death.

canvassing, the 278 " `little people,' " ante, at 163, of Stratton,
who, unlike petitioners, do not have a team of attorneys at
their ready disposal, see Jehovah's Witnesses May Make
High Court History Again, Legal Times, Feb. 25, 2002, p. 1
(noting that petitioners have a team of 12 lawyers in their
New York headquarters), enacted the ordinance at issue
here. The residents did not prohibit door-to-door communication; they simply required that canvassers obtain a permit
before going door-to-door. And the village does not have
the discretion to reject an applicant who completes the
application.

The town had little reason to suspect that the negligible
burden of having to obtain a permit runs afoul of the
First Amendment. For over 60 years, we have categorically stated that a permit requirement for door-to-door canvassers, which gives no discretion to the issuing authority,
is constitutional. The District Court and Court of Appeals,
relying on our cases, upheld the ordinance. The Court
today, however, abruptly changes course and invalidates
the ordinance.

The Court speaks of the "historical and analytical backdrop for consideration of petitioners' First Amendment
claim," ante, at 161. But this "backdrop" is one of longstanding and unwavering approval of a permit requirement
like Stratton's. Our early decisions in this area expressly

sanction a law that merely requires a canvasser to register.
In Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306 (1940), we
stated that "[w]ithout doubt a State may protect its citizens
from fraudulent solicitation by requiring a stranger in the
community, before permitting him publicly to solicit funds
for any purpose, to establish his identity and his authority
to act for the cause which he purports to represent." In
Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, 116 (1943), we contrasted the license tax struck down in that case with "merely
a registration ordinance calling for an identification of the
solicitors so as to give the authorities some basis for investigating strangers coming into the community." And Martin,
supra, at 148, states that a "city can punish those who call
at a home in defiance of the previously expressed will of the
occupant and, in addition, can by identification devices control the abuse of the privilege by criminals posing as
canvassers."

It is telling that Justices Douglas and Black, perhaps the
two Justices in this Court's history most identified with an
expansive view of the First Amendment, authored, respectively, Murdock and Martin. Their belief in the constitutionality of the permit requirement that the Court strikes
down today demonstrates just how far the Court's present
jurisprudence has strayed from the core concerns of the
First Amendment.

We reaffirmed our view that a discretionless permit requirement is constitutional in Hynes v. Mayor and Council
of Oradell, 425 U. S. 610 (1976). Hynes, though striking
down a registration ordinance on vagueness grounds, noted
that "the Court has consistently recognized a municipality's
power to protect its citizens from crime and undue annoyance by regulating soliciting and canvassing. A narrowly
drawn ordinance, that does not vest in municipal officials the
undefined power to determine what messages residents will
hear, may serve these important interests without running
afoul of the First Amendment." Id., at 616-617.

The Stratton ordinance suffers from none of the defectsdeemed fatal in these earlier decisions. The ordinance does

not prohibit door-to-door canvassing; it merely requires thatcanvassers fill out a form and receive a permit. Cf.

Martin,
supra. The mayor does not exercise any discretion in decid-ing who receives a permit; approval of the permit is automatic upon proper completion of the form. Cf. Cantwell,
supra. And petitioners do not contend in this Court thatthe ordinance is vague. Cf.

Hynes, supra.
Just as troubling as the Court's ignoring over 60 years ofprecedent is the difficulty of discerning from the Court's

opinion what exactly it is about the Stratton ordinance thatrenders it unconstitutional. It is not clear what test the
Court is applying, or under which part of that indeterminatetest the ordinance fails. See

ante, at 164 (finding it
"unnecessary . . . to resolve" what standard of review appliesto the ordinance). We are instead told that the "breadth of

speech affected" and "the nature of the regulation" renderthe permit requirement unconstitutional.

Ibid. Under a
straightforward application of the applicable First Amendment framework, however, the ordinance easily passesmuster.

There is no support in our case law for applying anything
more stringent than intermediate scrutiny to the ordinance.
The ordinance is content neutral and does not bar anyone
from going door-to-door in Stratton. It merely regulates
the manner in which one must canvass: A canvasser must
first obtain a permit. It is, or perhaps I should say was,
settled that the "government may impose reasonable restrictions on the time, place, or manner of protected speech, provided the restrictions `are justified without reference to the
content of the regulated speech, that they are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and that
they leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.' " Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U. S. 781, 791 (1989) (quoting Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984)). Earlier

this Term, the Court reaffirmed that this test applies tocontent-neutral time, place, or manner restrictions on speech

in public forums. See Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., 534U. S. 316 (2002).

The Court suggests that Stratton's regulation of speechwarrants greater scrutiny. Ante, at 164. But it would be
puzzling if regulations of speech taking place on another citizen's private property warranted greater scrutiny than reg-ulations of speech taking place in public forums. Common

sense and our precedent say just the opposite. In Hynes,the Court explained: " `Of all the methods of spreading unpopular ideas, [house-to-house canvassing] seems the leastentitled to extensive protection. The possibilities of persuasion are slight compared with the certainties of annoyance.Great as is the value of exposing citizens to novel views,
home is one place where a man ought to be able to shuthimself up in his own ideas if he desires.' " 425 U. S., at 619
(quoting Z. Chafee, Free Speech in the United States 406(1954)). In

Ward, the Court held that intermediate scrutinywas appropriate "even in a public forum," 491 U. S., at 791

(emphasis added), appropriately recognizing that speech en-joys greater protection in a public forum that has been
opened to all citizens, see ibid. Indeed, we have held thatthe mere proximity of private residential property to a public forum permits more extensive regulation of speech takingplace at the public forum than would otherwise be allowed.
See Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 483-484 (1988). Surelythen, intermediate scrutiny applies to a content-neutral regulation of speech that occurs not just near, but at, anothercitizen's private residence.

The Stratton regulation is aimed at three significant gov-ernmental interests: the prevention of fraud, the prevention
of crime, and the protection of privacy.1 The Court con1 Of course, fraud itself may be a crime. I assume, as does the majority,
that the interest in preventing "crime" refers to a separate interest in
preventing burglaries and violent crimes.

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
cedes that "in light of our precedent, . . . these are importantinterests that [Stratton] may seek to safeguard through some

form of regulation of solicitation activity." Ante, at 165.Although initially recognizing the important interest in preventing crime, the Court later indicates that the "absence ofany evidence of a special crime problem related to door-todoor solicitation in the record before us" lessens this interest. Ante, at 169. But the village is entitled to rely on ourassertion in

Martin that door-to-door canvassing poses a risk
of crime, see Erie v. Pap's A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 297 (2000)(citing

Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U. S. 41
(1986)), and the experience of other jurisdictions with crime
stemming from door-to-door canvassing, see 529 U. S., at 297;
Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377,
393, n. 6 (2000).

The double murder in Hanover described above is but one
tragic example of the crime threat posed by door-to-door
canvassing. Other recent examples include a man soliciting
gardening jobs door-to-door who tied up and robbed elderly
residents, see Van Derbken, 98-Year-Old Latest Victim in
Series of Home Invasions, San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 13,
2000, p. A18, a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman who
raped a woman, see Employers Liable for Rape by Salesman,
Texas Lawyer, Jan. 11, 1999, p. 2, and a man going door-todoor purportedly on behalf of a church group who committed
multiple sexual assaults, see Ingersoll, Sex Crime Suspect
Traveled with Church Group, Wis. State Journal, Feb. 19,
2000, p. 1B. The Constitution does not require that Stratton
first endure its own crime wave before it takes measures to
prevent crime.

What is more, the Court soon forgets both the privacy and
crime interests. It finds the ordinance too broad because it
applies to a "significant number of noncommercial `canvassers.' " Ante, at 165. But noncommercial canvassers, for example, those purporting to conduct environmental surveys
for school, see supra, at 172-173, can violate no trespassing

signs and engage in burglaries and violent crimes just aseasily as commercial canvassers can. See Martin, 319 U. S.,

at 144 (canvassers, "whether selling pots or distributingleaflets, may lessen the peaceful enjoyment of a home" and
"sp[y] out" homes for burglaries (emphasis added)). Strat-ton's ordinance is thus narrowly tailored. It applies to
everyone who poses the risks associated with door-to-doorcanvassing,

i. e., it applies to everyone who canvasses door-to-door. The Court takes what should be a virtue of the

ordinance--that it is content neutral, cf. 44 Liquormart, Inc.v. Rhode Island, 517 U. S. 484, 501 (1996) ("[O]ur commercial
speech cases have recognized the dangers that attend gov-ernmental attempts to single out certain messages for suppression")--and turns it into a vice.The next question is whether the ordinance serves the important interests of protecting privacy and preventing fraudand crime. With respect to the interest in protecting privacy, the Court concludes that "[t]he annoyance caused byan uninvited knock on the front door is the same whether or

not the visitor is armed with a permit." Ante, at 168-169.True, but that misses the key point: The permit requirement
results in fewer uninvited knocks. Those who have com-plied with the permit requirement are less likely to visit residences with no trespassing signs, as it is much easier for theauthorities to track them down.

The Court also fails to grasp how the permit requirementserves Stratton's interest in preventing crime.

2 We have

approved of permit requirements for those engaging in pro-tected First Amendment activity because of a commonsense

recognition that their existence both deters and helps detectwrongdoing. See, e. g., Thomas v. Chicago Park Dist., 534

2 It is sufficient that the ordinance serves the important interest of protecting residents' privacy. A law need only serve a governmental interest. Because the Court's treatment of Stratton's interest in preventing
crime gives short shrift to Stratton's attempt to deal with a very serious
problem, I address that issue as well.

U. S. 316 (2002) (upholding a permit requirement aimed,in part, at preventing unlawful uses of a park and assuring

financial accountability for damage caused by the event).And while some people, intent on committing burglaries
or violent crimes, are not likely to be deterred by the pros-pect of a misdemeanor for violating the permit ordinance,
the ordinance's effectiveness does not depend on criminalsregistering.

The ordinance prevents and detects serious crime by mak-ing it a crime not to register. Take the Hanover double
murder discussed earlier. The murderers did not achieve
their objective until they visited their fifth home over a pe-riod of seven months. If Hanover had a permit requirement, the teens may have been stopped before they achievedtheir objective. One of the residents they visited may have
informed the police that there were two canvassers wholacked a permit. Such neighborly vigilance, though perhaps
foreign to those residing in modern day cities, is not uncom-mon in small towns. Or the police on their own may have
discovered that two canvassers were violating the ordinance.
Apprehension for violating the permit requirement may wellhave frustrated the teenagers' objectives; it certainly would

have assisted in solving the murders had the teenagers goneahead with their plan.

3

Of course, the Stratton ordinance does not guarantee thatno canvasser will ever commit a burglary or violent crime.

The Court seems to think this dooms the ordinance, erectingan insurmountable hurdle that a law must provide a foolproof method of preventing crime. In order to survive in-termediate scrutiny, however, a law need not solve the crime

3 Indeed, an increased focus on apprehending criminals for "petty" offenses, such as not paying subway fares, is credited with the dramatic
reduction in violent crimes in New York City during the last decade. See,
e. g., M. Gladwell, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big
Difference (2000). If this works in New York City, surely it can work in
a small village like Stratton.

problem, it need only further the interest in preventingcrime. Some deterrence of serious criminal activity is more

than enough to survive intermediate scrutiny.The final requirement of intermediate scrutiny is that a
regulation leave open ample alternatives for expression.Undoubtedly, ample alternatives exist here. Most obviously, canvassers are free to go door-to-door after filling outthe permit application. And those without permits may
communicate on public sidewalks, on street corners, throughthe mail, or through the telephone.

Intermediate scrutiny analysis thus confirms what ourcases have long said: A discretionless permit requirement for
canvassers does not violate the First Amendment. Today,the Court elevates its concern with what is, at most, a negligible burden on door-to-door communication above this es-tablished proposition. Ironically, however, today's decision
may result in less of the door-to-door communication that theCourt extols. As the Court recognizes, any homeowner
may place a "No Solicitation" sign on his or her property,and it is a crime to violate that sign. Ante, at 168. In light
of today's decision depriving Stratton residents of the degreeof accountability and safety that the permit requirement provides, more and more residents may decide to place thesesigns in their yards and cut off door-to-door communication
altogether.

BARNES, in her official capacity as MEMBER OF

THE BOARD OF POLICE COMMISSIONERS OF

KANSAS CITY MISSOURI, et al. v. GORMAN

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 01-682. Argued April 23, 2002--Decided June 17, 2002
Respondent, a paraplegic, suffered serious injuries that left him unable to

work full time when, after arrest, he was transported to a Kansas City
police station in a van that was not equipped to accommodate the disabled. He sued petitioner police officials and officers for discriminating
against him on the basis of his disability, in violation of $ 202 of the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, by failing to maintain appropriate policies for the
arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries. A jury
awarded him compensatory and punitive damages, but the District
Court vacated as to punitive damages, holding that they are unavailable
in private suits brought under $ 202 of the ADA and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. In reversing, the Eighth Circuit found punitive damages
available under the "general rule" of Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 70-71, that "absent clear direction to the contrary by Congress, the federal courts have the power to award any
appropriate relief" for violation of a federal right.

Held: Punitive damages may not be awarded in private suits brought

under $ 202 of the ADA and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. These sections are enforceable through private causes of action, whose remedies
are coextensive with those available in a private action under Title VI
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. See $ 203 of the ADA and $ 505(a)(2) of
the Rehabilitation Act. Title VI invokes Congress's Spending Clause
power to place conditions on the grant of federal funds. This Court has
regularly applied a contract-law analogy in defining the scope of conduct
for which funding recipients may be held liable in money damages, and
in finding a damages remedy available, in private suits under Spending
Clause legislation. The same analogy applies in determining the scope
of damages remedies. A remedy is appropriate relief only if the recipient is on notice that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself

to such liability. A funding recipient is generally on notice that it is
subject not only to those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant
legislation but also to those traditionally available in breach of contract suits. Title VI mentions no remedies; and punitive damages are

generally not available for breach of contract. Nor could it be said that
Title VI funding recipients have, merely by accepting funds, implicitly
consented to a remedy which is not normally available for contract

actions, and the indeterminate magnitude of which could produce liability exceeding the level of federal funding. Because punitive damages
may not be awarded in private suits under Title VI, it follows that they
may not be awarded in suits under $ 202 of the ADA and $ 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act. Pp. 184-190.

Respondent Jeffrey Gorman, a paraplegic, is confined toa wheelchair and lacks voluntary control over his lower

torso, including his bladder, forcing him to wear a catheterattached to a urine bag around his waist. In May 1992, he
was arrested for trespass after fighting with a bouncer at aKansas City, Missouri, nightclub. While waiting for a police
van to transport him to the station, he was denied permis-sion to use a restroom to empty his urine bag. When the
van arrived, it was not equipped to receive respondent'swheelchair. Over respondent's objection, the officers removed him from his wheelchair and used a seatbelt andhis own belt to strap him to a narrow bench in the rear of

the van. During the ride to the police station, respondentreleased his seatbelt, fearing it placed excessive pressure on
his urine bag. Eventually, the other belt came loose andrespondent fell to the floor, rupturing his urine bag and injuring his shoulder and back. The driver, the only officerin the van, finding it impossible to lift respondent, fastened
him to a support for the remainder of the trip. Upon arrivJoel D. Kuperberg, Philip D. Kohn, John Sanford Todd, Robert E. Shannon, Joseph A. Soldani, William B. Conners, Gregory P. Priamos, Hadden Roth, James F. Penman, George Rios, Brien J. Farrell, Valerie J.

Opinion of the Court
ing at the station, respondent was booked, processed, andreleased; later he was convicted of misdemeanor trespass.

After these events, respondent suffered serious medicalproblems--including a bladder infection, serious lower back
pain, and uncontrollable spasms in his paralyzed areas--thatleft him unable to work full time.

Respondent brought suit against petitioners--members ofthe Kansas City Board of Police Commissioners, the chief of
police, and the officer who drove the van--in the UnitedStates District Court for the Western District of Missouri.
The suit claimed petitioners had discriminated against re-spondent on the basis of his disability, in violation of $ 202 of
the ADA and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, by failing tomaintain appropriate policies for the arrest and transportation of persons with spinal cord injuries.A jury found petitioners liable and awarded over $1 million
in compensatory damages and $1.2 million in punitive dam-ages. The District Court vacated the punitive damages
award, holding that punitive damages are unavailable in suitsunder $ 202 of the ADA and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed, rely-ing on this Court's decision in Franklin v. Gwinnett County
Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60, 70-71 (1992), which stated the"general rule" that "absent clear direction to the contrary by
Congress, the federal courts have the power to award anyappropriate relief in a cognizable cause of action brought
pursuant to a federal statute." Punitive damages are ap-propriate relief, the Eighth Circuit held, because they are
"an integral part of the common law tradition and the judi-cial arsenal," 257 F. 3d 738, 745 (2001), and Congress did
nothing to disturb this tradition in enacting or amending therelevant statutes,

id., at 747. We granted certiorari. 534U. S. 1103 (2002).

Section 202 of the ADA prohibits discrimination againstthe disabled by public entities; $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act

Opinion of the Court
prohibits discrimination against the disabled by recipients offederal funding, including private organizations, 29 U. S. C.

$ 794(b)(3). Both provisions are enforceable through privatecauses of action. Section 203 of the ADA declares that the
"remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in [$ 505(a)(2) ofthe Rehabilitation Act] shall be the remedies, procedures,
and rights this subchapter provides" for violations of $ 202.
42 U. S. C. $ 12133. Section 505(a)(2) of the RehabilitationAct, in turn, declares that the "remedies, procedures, and

rights set forth in title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . .shall be available" for violations of $ 504, as added, 92 Stat.
2983, 29 U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(2). Thus, the remedies for violations of $ 202 of the ADA and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
are coextensive with the remedies available in a private
cause of action brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d et seq., which prohibits racial
discrimination in federally funded programs and activities.

Although Title VI does not mention a private right of
action, our prior decisions have found an implied right of
action, e. g., Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677,
703 (1979), and Congress has acknowledged this right in
amendments to the statute, leaving it "beyond dispute that
private individuals may sue to enforce" Title VI, Alexander
v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 280 (2001). It is less clear what
remedies are available in such a suit. In Franklin, supra,
at 73, we recognized "the traditional presumption in favor of
any appropriate relief for violation of a federal right," and
held that since this presumption applies to suits under Title
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U. S. C. $$ 1681-
1688, monetary damages were available. (Emphasis added.)
And the Court has interpreted Title IX consistently with
Title VI, see Cannon, supra, at 694-698. Franklin, however, did not describe the scope of "appropriate relief." We
take up this question today.

Title VI invokes Congress's power under the Spending
Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, to place conditions on

Opinion of the Court
the grant of federal funds. See Davis v. Monroe CountyBd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 640 (1999) (Title IX). We have

repeatedly characterized this statute and other SpendingClause legislation as "much in the nature of a contract: in
return for federal funds, the [recipients] agree to comply withfederally imposed conditions." Pennhurst State School and
Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981) (emphasisadded);

1 see also Davis, supra, at 640; Gebser v. Lago Vista

Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 286 (1998); Guardians Assn. v. Civil Serv. Comm'n of New York City, 463U. S. 582, 599 (1983) (opinion of White, J.); id., at 632-633

(Marshall, J., dissenting); Lau v. Nichols, 414 U. S. 563, 568-569 (1974). Just as a valid contract requires offer and acceptance of its terms, "[t]he legitimacy of Congress' powerto legislate under the spending power . . . rests on whether
the [recipient] voluntarily and knowingly accepts the termsof the `contract.' . . . Accordingly, if Congress intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, it must doso unambiguously."

Pennhurst, supra, at 17; see also Davis,supra, at 640; Gebser, supra, at 287; Franklin, 503 U. S.,

at 74. Although we have been careful not to imply that allcontract-law rules apply to Spending Clause legislation, see,
e. g., Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Ed., 470 U. S. 656, 669(1985) (Title I), we have regularly applied the contract-law
analogy in cases defining the scope of conduct for which fund-ing recipients may be held liable for money damages. Thus,

1 Justice Stevens believes that our reliance on Pennhurst is "inappropriate" because that case addressed legislation imposing affirmative
obligations on recipients whereas Title VI "simply prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct." Post, at 192 (opinion concurring in judgment). He
does not explain why he thinks this distinction--which played no role in
the Court's application of contract-law principles in Pennhurst, 451 U. S.,
at 24-25--ought to make a difference. Whatever his reason, we have
regularly applied Pennhurst's contract analogy to legislation that "simply
prohibit[s] certain discriminatory conduct." See, e. g., Davis v. Monroe
County Bd. of Ed., 526 U. S. 629, 640 (1999) (Title IX); Gebser v. Lago
Vista Independent School Dist., 524 U. S. 274, 287 (1998) (same).

Opinion of the Court
a recipient may be held liable to third-party beneficiaries forintentional conduct that violates the clear terms of the relevant statute, Davis, supra, at 642, but not for its failure tocomply with vague language describing the objectives of the
statute, Pennhurst, supra, at 24-25; and, if the statute im-plies that only violations brought to the attention of an official with power to correct them are actionable, not for conduct unknown to any such official, see Gebser, supra, at 290.We have also applied the contract-law analogy in finding a

damages remedy available in private suits under SpendingClause legislation.

Franklin, supra, at 74-75.
The same analogy applies, we think, in determining the
scope of damages remedies. We said as much in Gebser:
"Title IX's contractual nature has implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies." 524 U. S., at
287. One of these implications, we believe, is that a remedy
is "appropriate relief," Franklin, 503 U. S., at 73, only if the
funding recipient is on notice that, by accepting federal funding, it exposes itself to liability of that nature. A funding
recipient is generally on notice that it is subject not only to
those remedies explicitly provided in the relevant legislation,
but also to those remedies traditionally available in suits for
breach of contract. Thus we have held that under Title IX,
which contains no express remedies, a recipient of federal
funds is nevertheless subject to suit for compensatory damages, id., at 76, and injunction, Cannon, supra, at 711-712,
forms of relief traditionally available in suits for breach of
contract. See, e. g., Restatement (Second) of Contracts $ 357
(1981); 3 S. Williston, Law of Contracts $$ 1445-1450 (1920);
J. Pomeroy, A Treatise on the Specific Performance of Contracts 1-5 (1879). Like Title IX, Title VI mentions no remedies--indeed, it fails to mention even a private right of action
(hence this Court's decision finding an implied right of action
in Cannon). But punitive damages, unlike compensatory
damages and injunction, are generally not available for
breach of contract, see 3 E. Farnsworth, Contracts $ 12.8,

pp. 192-201 (2d ed. 1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts$ 355; 1 T. Sedgwick, Measure of Damages $ 370 (8th ed.

1891).Nor (if such an interpretive technique were available)
could an implied punitive damages provision reasonably befound in Title VI. Some authorities say that reasonably implied contractual terms are those that the parties would haveagreed to if they had adverted to the matters in question.
See 2 Farnsworth, supra, $ 7.16, at 335, and authorities cited.More recent commentary suggests that reasonably implied
contractual terms are simply those that "compor[t] withcommunity standards of fairness," Restatement (Second) of
Contracts, supra, $ 204, Comment d; see also 2 Farnsworth,
supra, $ 7.16, at 334-336. Neither approach would supportthe implication here of a remedy that is not normally available for contract actions and that is of indeterminate magni-tude. We have acknowledged that compensatory damages
alone "might well exceed a recipient's level of federal fund-ing,"

Gebser, supra, at 290; punitive damages on top of thatcould well be disastrous. Not only is it doubtful that funding recipients would have agreed to exposure to such unor-thodox and indeterminate liability; it is doubtful whether
they would even have accepted the funding if punitive dam-ages liability was a required condition. "Without doubt, the
scope of potential damages liability is one of the most sig-nificant factors a school would consider in deciding whether
to receive federal funds." Davis, supra, at 656 (Kennedy,J., dissenting). And for the same reason of unusual and disproportionate exposure, it can hardly be said that communitystandards of fairness support such an implication. In sum,
it must be concluded that Title VI funding recipients havenot, merely by accepting funds, implicitly consented to liability for punitive damages.2

2 We cannot understand Justice Stevens' Chicken-Little statement
that today's decision "has potentially far-reaching consequences that go
well beyond the issues briefed and argued in this case." Post, at 192-193.
Our decision merely applies a principle expressed and applied many times

Opinion of the Court
Our conclusion is consistent with the "well settled" rulethat "where legal rights have been invaded, and a federal

statute provides for a general right to sue for such invasion,federal courts may use any available remedy to make good
the wrong done." Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 684 (1946); seealso Franklin, supra, at 66. When a federal-funds recipient
violates conditions of Spending Clause legislation, the wrongdone is the failure to provide what the contractual obligation
requires; and that wrong is "made good" when the recipient
compensates the Federal Government or a third-party bene-ficiary (as in this case) for the loss caused by that failure.

See Guardians, 463 U. S., at 633 (Marshall, J., dissenting)("When a court concludes that a recipient has breached its
contract, it should enforce the broken promise by protect-ing the expectation that the recipient would not discriminate. . . . The obvious way to do this is to put private partiesin as good a position as they would have been had the contract been performed"). Punitive damages are not compen-satory, and are therefore not embraced within the rule described in Bell. * * *

Because punitive damages may not be awarded in privatesuits brought under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, it
follows that they may not be awarded in suits brought under$ 202 of the ADA and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.

3 This

before: that the "contractual nature" of Spending Clause legislation "has
implications for our construction of the scope of available remedies."
Gebser, 524 U. S., at 287 (emphasis added). We do not imply, for example,
that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that
contract-law principles apply to all issues that they raise. Since Justice
Stevens is unable to identify any "far-reaching consequenc[e]" that might
reasonably follow from our decision today, and since we are merely occupying ground that the Court has long held, we surely do not deserve his
praise that we are "fearless crusaders," post, at 193, n. 2.

3 Justice Stevens believes that our analysis of Title VI does not carry

over to the ADA because the latter is not Spending Clause legislation, and
identifies "tortious conduct." Post, at 192, 193, n. 2. Perhaps he thinks
that it should not carry over, but that is a question for Congress, and

makes it unnecessary to reach petitioners' alternative argu-ment--neither raised nor passed on below

4--invoking the

traditional presumption against imposition of punitive dam-ages on government entities. Vermont Agency of Natural

Resources v. United States ex rel. Stevens, 529 U. S. 765,784-785 (2000); Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247,
262-263 (1981). The judgment of the Court of Appeals isreversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,concurring.

I join the Court's opinion because I agree that analogy tothe common law of contract is appropriate in this instance,
with the conclusion that punitive damages are not availableunder the statute. Punitive damages, as the Court points
out, may range in orders of "indeterminate magnitude,"
Congress has unequivocally said otherwise. The ADA could not be
clearer that the "remedies, procedures, and rights . . . this subchapter
provides" for violations of $ 202 are the same as the "remedies, procedures,
and rights set forth in" $ 505(a)(2) of the Rehabilitation Act, which is
Spending Clause legislation. 42 U. S. C. $ 12133. Section 505(a)(2), in
turn, explains that the "remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in title
VI . . . shall be available" for violations of $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
29 U. S. C. $ 794a(a)(2). These explicit provisions make discussion of the
ADA's status as a "non Spending Clause" tort statute quite irrelevant.

4 Justice Stevens suggests that our decision likewise rests on a theory

neither presented nor passed on below. Post, at 191-192. But the parties raised, and the courts below passed on, the applicability of Franklin
v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U. S. 60 (1992), to the question
presented. That case addressed Spending Clause legislation (Title IX)
and cited the contract-analogy discussion in Pennhurst as the basis for its
acknowledgment of a notice requirement. See 503 U. S., at 74-75. Respondent did argue (quite correctly) that petitioners had failed to rely on
the Newport ground that Justice Stevens uses, Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 262-263 (1981), see Brief for Respondent 41-43,
but not that they had failed to rely on the contract analogy initiated in
Pennhurst, Brief for Respondent 35-41.

ante, at 188, untethered to compensable harm, and wouldthus pose a concern that recipients of federal funding could

not reasonably have anticipated. I realize, however, andread the Court's opinion as acknowledging, that the
contract-law analogy may fail to give such helpfully clearanswers to other questions that may be raised by actions for
private recovery under Spending Clause legislation, such asthe proper measure of compensatory damages.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in the judgment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals might be reversedon any of three different theories: (1) as the Court held in

Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247 (1981), absentclear congressional intent to the contrary, municipalities are
not subject to punitive damages; (2) an analysis of the textand legislative history of $ 504 of Rehabilitation Act of 1973
and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA) indicates that Congress did not intend to authorize a
punitive damages remedy for violations of either statute;1 or(3) applying reasoning akin to that used in

Pennhurst StateSchool and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1 (1981), that

the remedies for violations of federal statutes enacted pursu-ant to Congress' spending power should be defined by the
common law of contracts, third-party beneficiaries are notallowed to recover punitive damages.

Petitioners did not rely on either the first or the thirdof those theories in either the District Court or the Court
of Appeals. Nevertheless, because it presents the narrow-est basis for resolving the case, I am convinced that it is an
appropriate exercise of judicial restraint to decide the case

1 This was the theory that was adopted by the Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit in Moreno v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 99 F. 3d 782, 788-792
(1996). It was also the only theory discussed and rejected by the Court
of Appeals below.

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
on the theory that petitioners are immune from punitivedamages under

Newport. There is, however, no justification
for the Court's decision to reach out and decide the case ona broader ground that was not argued below. The Court's

reliance on, and extension of, Pennhurst--a case that wasnot even cited in petitioners' briefs in the Court of Appeals--
is particularly inappropriate.

In Pennhurst we were faced with the question whetherthe Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights

Act, 42 U. S. C. $ 6010, had imposed affirmative obligationson participating States. Relying in part on the important
distinction between statutory provisions that "simply

prohibited certain kinds of state conduct" and those that
"impose affirmative obligations on the States to fund certain services," 451 U. S., at 16-17, we first held that $ 6010
was enacted pursuant to the Spending Clause. We then
concluded that the "affirmative obligations" that the Court
of Appeals had found in $ 6010 could "hardly be considered
a `condition' of the grant of federal funds." Id., at 23.
"When Congress does impose affirmative obligations on the
States, it usually makes a far more substantial contribution
to defray costs. . . . It defies common sense, in short, to suppose that Congress implicitly imposed this massive obligation on participating States." Id., at 24.

The case before us today involves a municipality's breach
of a condition that simply prohibits certain discriminatory
conduct. The prohibition is set forth in two statutes, one of
which, Title II of the ADA, was not enacted pursuant to the
Spending Clause. Our opinion in Pennhurst says nothing
about the remedy that might be appropriate for such a
breach. Nor do I believe that the rules of contract law
on which the Court relies are necessarily relevant to the
tortious conduct described in this record. Moreover, the
Court's novel reliance on what has been, at most, a useful
analogy to contract law has potentially far-reaching consequences that go well beyond the issues briefed and argued

193Cite as: 536 U. S. 181 (2002)
Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
in this case.2 In light of the fact that the petitioners--inaddition to most defendants sued for violations of Title II of

the ADA and $ 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973--areclearly not subject to punitive damages pursuant to our holding in Newport, I see no reason to decide the case on theexpansive basis asserted by the Court.

Accordingly, I do not join the Court's opinion, although Ido concur in its judgment in this case.

2 Although rejected by the Sixth Circuit, see Westside Mothers v. Haveman, 289 F. 3d 852 (2002), one District Court applied the Pennhurst
contract analogy in order to support its conclusion that Spending Clause
legislation is not the "supreme law of the land." Westside Mothers v.
Haveman, 133 F. Supp. 2d 549, 561 (ED Mich. 2001). The Court fortunately does cabin the potential reach of today's decision by stating that
"[w]e do not imply, for example, that suits under Spending Clause legislation are suits in contract, or that contract-law principles apply to all issues
that they raise," ante, at 189, n. 2, but whenever the Court reaches out to
adopt a broad theory that was not discussed in the early stages of the
litigation, and that implicates statutes that are not at issue, its opinion is
sure to have unforeseen consequences. When it does so unnecessarily, it
tends to assume a legislative, rather than a judicial, role. Reliance on a
narrower theory that was not argued below does not create that risk. I
am not persuaded that "Chicken-Little," ante, at 188, n. 2, is an appropriate characterization of judicial restraint; it is, however, a rhetorical device appropriately used by fearless crusaders.

UNITED STATES v. DRAYTON et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 01-631. Argued April 16, 2002--Decided June 17, 2002
The driver of the bus on which respondents were traveling allowed three

police officers to board the bus as part of a routine drug and weapons
interdiction effort. One officer knelt on the driver's seat, facing the
rear of the bus, while another officer stayed in the rear, facing forward.
Officer Lang worked his way from back to front, speaking with individual passengers as he went. To avoid blocking the aisle, Lang stood next
to or just behind each passenger with whom he spoke. He testified that
passengers who declined to cooperate or who chose to exit the bus at
any time would have been allowed to do so without argument; that most
people are willing to cooperate; that passengers often leave the bus for
a cigarette or a snack while officers are on board; and that, although he
sometimes informs passengers of their right to refuse to cooperate, he
did not do so on the day in question. As Lang approached respondents,
who were seated together, he held up his badge long enough for them
to identify him as an officer. Speaking just loud enough for them to
hear, he declared that the police were looking for drugs and weapons
and asked if respondents had any bags. When both of them pointed to
a bag overhead, Lang asked if they minded if he checked it. Respondent Brown agreed, and a search of the bag revealed no contraband.
Lang then asked Brown whether he minded if Lang checked his person.
Brown agreed, and a patdown revealed hard objects similar to drug
packages in both thigh areas. Brown was arrested. Lang then asked
respondent Drayton, "Mind if I check you?" When Drayton agreed, a
patdown revealed objects similar to those found on Brown, and Drayton
was arrested. A further search revealed that respondents had taped
cocaine between their shorts. Charged with federal drug crimes, respondents moved to suppress the cocaine on the ground that their consent to the patdown searches was invalid. In denying the motions, the
District Court determined that the police conduct was not coercive and
respondents' consent to the search was voluntary. The Eleventh Circuit reversed and remanded based on its prior holdings that bus passengers do not feel free to disregard officers' requests to search absent
some positive indication that consent may be refused.

Held: The Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to advise

bus passengers of their right not to cooperate and to refuse consent to
searches. Pp. 200-208.

Syllabus
(a) Among its rulings in Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429, this Court
held that the Fourth Amendment permits officers to approach bus passengers at random to ask questions and request their consent to
searches, provided a reasonable person would feel free to decline the
requests or otherwise terminate the encounter, id., at 436. The Court
identified as "particularly worth noting" the factors that the officer, although obviously armed, did not unholster his gun or use it in a threatening way, and that he advised respondent passenger that he could refuse consent to a search. Relying on this last factor, the Eleventh
Circuit erroneously adopted what is in effect a per se rule that evidence
obtained during suspicionless drug interdictions on buses must be suppressed unless the officers have advised passengers of their right not to
cooperate and to refuse consent to a search. Pp. 200-203.

(b) Applying Bostick's framework to this case demonstrates that the
police did not seize respondents. The officers gave the passengers no
reason to believe that they were required to answer questions. When
Lang approached respondents, he did not brandish a weapon or make
any intimidating movements. He left the aisle free so that respondents
could exit. He spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quiet
voice. Nothing he said would suggest to a reasonable person that he
or she was barred from leaving the bus or otherwise terminating the
encounter, or would indicate a command to answer his questions.
There were ample grounds to conclude that their encounter was cooperative and not coercive or confrontational. There was no overwhelming
show or application of force, no intimidating movement, no brandishing
of weapons, no blocking of exits, no threat, and no command, not even
an authoritative tone of voice. Had this encounter occurred on the
street, it doubtless would be constitutional. The fact that an encounter
takes place on a bus does not on its own transform standard police questioning into an illegal seizure. See Bostick, supra, at 439-440. Indeed, because many fellow passengers are present to witness officers'
conduct, a reasonable person may feel even more secure in deciding not
to cooperate on a bus than in other circumstances. Lang's display of
his badge is not dispositive. See, e. g., Florida v. Rodriguez, 469 U. S.
1, 5-6. And, because it is well known that most officers are armed, the
presence of a holstered firearm is unlikely to be coercive absent active
brandishing of the weapon. Officer Hoover's position at the front of the
bus also does not tip the scale to respondents, since he did nothing to
intimidate passengers and said or did nothing to suggest that people
could not exit. See INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 219. Finally, Lang's
testimony that only a few passengers refuse to cooperate does not suggest that a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate the encounter. See id., at 216. Drayton argues unsuccessfully that no reasonable person in his position would feel free to terminate the encounter

after Brown was arrested. The arrest of one person does not mean
that everyone around him has been seized. Even after arresting
Brown, Lang provided Drayton with no indication that he was required
to answer Lang's questions. Pp. 203-206.

(c) Respondents were not subjected to an unreasonable search.
Where, as here, the question of voluntariness pervades both the search
and seizure inquiries, the respective analyses turn on very similar facts.
For the foregoing reasons, respondents' consent to the search of their
luggage and their persons was voluntary. When respondents told Lang
they had a bag, he asked to check it. And when he asked to search
their persons, he inquired first if they objected, thus indicating to
a reasonable person that he or she was free to refuse. Moreover,
officers need not always inform citizens of their right to refuse when
seeking permission to conduct a warrantless consent search. See, e. g.,
Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 227. While knowledge of

the right to refuse is taken into account, the Government need not establish such knowledge as the sine qua non of an effective consent.
Ibid. Nor does a presumption of invalidity attach if a citizen consented
without explicit notification that he or she was free to refuse to cooperate. Instead, the totality of the circumstances controls, without giving extra weight to whether this type of warning was given. See,
e. g., Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33, 39-40. Although Lang did not
give such a warning, the totality of the circumstances indicates that
respondents' consent was voluntary, and the searches were reasonable.

and ensure the safety of the two other officers without block-ing the aisle or otherwise obstructing the bus exit. Officers

Lang and Blackburn went to the rear of the bus. Blackburnremained stationed there, facing forward. Lang worked his
way toward the front of the bus, speaking with individualpassengers as he went. He asked the passengers about
their travel plans and sought to match passengers with lug-gage in the overhead racks. To avoid blocking the aisle,
Lang stood next to or just behind each passenger with whomhe spoke.

According to Lang 's testimony, passengers who declinedto cooperate with him or who chose to exit the bus at any
time would have been allowed to do so without argument.In Lang's experience, however, most people are willing to
cooperate. Some passengers go so far as to commend thepolice for their efforts to ensure the safety of their travel.
Lang could recall five to six instances in the previous yearin which passengers had declined to have their luggage
searched. It also was common for passengers to leave thebus for a cigarette or a snack while the officers were on
board. Lang sometimes informed passengers of their rightto refuse to cooperate. On the day in question, however,
he did not.Respondents were seated next to each other on the bus.
Drayton was in the aisle seat, Brown in the seat next to thewindow. Lang approached respondents from the rear and
leaned over Drayton's shoulder. He held up his badge longenough for respondents to identify him as a police officer.
With his face 12-to-18 inches away from Drayton's, Langspoke in a voice just loud enough for respondents to hear:

"I'm Investigator Lang with the Tallahassee PoliceDepartment. We're conducting bus interdiction

[sic],
attempting to deter drugs and illegal weapons beingtransported on the bus. Do you have any bags on the

bus?" App. 55.

Opinion of the Court
Both respondents pointed to a single green bag in the overhead luggage rack. Lang asked, "Do you mind if I check
it?," and Brown responded, "Go ahead." Id., at 56. Lang
handed the bag to Officer Blackburn to check. The bag contained no contraband.

Officer Lang noticed that both respondents were wearing
heavy jackets and baggy pants despite the warm weather.
In Lang's experience drug traffickers often use baggy clothing to conceal weapons or narcotics. The officer thus asked
Brown if he had any weapons or drugs in his possession.
And he asked Brown: "Do you mind if I check your person?"
Brown answered, "Sure," and cooperated by leaning up in
his seat, pulling a cell phone out of his pocket, and opening
up his jacket. Id., at 61. Lang reached across Drayton
and patted down Brown's jacket and pockets, including his
waist area, sides, and upper thighs. In both thigh areas,
Lang detected hard objects similar to drug packages
detected on other occasions. Lang arrested and handcuffed
Brown. Officer Hoover escorted Brown from the bus.

Lang then asked Drayton, "Mind if I check you?" Id.,
at 65. Drayton responded by lifting his hands about eight
inches from his legs. Lang conducted a patdown of Drayton's thighs and detected hard objects similar to those found
on Brown. He arrested Drayton and escorted him from the
bus. A further search revealed that respondents had ducttaped plastic bundles of powder cocaine between several
pairs of their boxer shorts. Brown possessed three bundles
containing 483 grams of cocaine. Drayton possessed two
bundles containing 295 grams of cocaine.

Respondents were charged with conspiring to distribute
cocaine, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841(a)(1) and 846, and
with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it, in violation of $ 841(a)(1). They moved to suppress the cocaine, arguing that the consent to the patdown search was invalid.

Opinion of the Court
United States District Court for the Northern District ofFlorida denied their motions to suppress. The District

Court determined that the police conduct was not coerciveand respondents' consent to the search was voluntary. The
District Court pointed to the fact that the officers weredressed in plain clothes, did not brandish their badges in an
authoritative manner, did not make a general announcementto the entire bus, and did not address anyone in a menacing
tone of voice. It noted that the officers did not block theaisle or the exit, and stated that it was "obvious that [respondents] can get up and leave, as can the people ahead ofthem." App. 132. The District Court concluded: "[E]verything that took place between Officer Lang and Mr. Draytonand Mr. Brown suggests that it was cooperative. There was
nothing coercive, there was nothing confrontational aboutit."

Ibid.The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed

and remanded with instructions to grant respondents' mo-tions to suppress. 231 F. 3d 787 (2000). The court held that
this disposition was compelled by its previous decisions in
United States v. Washington, 151 F. 3d 1354 (1998), andUnited States v. Guapi, 144 F. 3d 1393 (1998). Those cases

had held that bus passengers do not feel free to disregardpolice officers' requests to search absent "some positive indication that consent could have been refused." Washington,supra, at 1357.

We granted certiorari. 534 U. S. 1074 (2002). The re-spondents, we conclude, were not seized and their consent to
the search was voluntary; and we reverse.

Law enforcement officers do not violate the FourthAmendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by

approaching individuals on the street or in other publicplaces and putting questions to them if they are willing to
listen. See, e. g., Florida v. Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 497 (1983)

(plurality opinion); see id., at 523, n. 3 (Rehnquist, J., dis-senting);

Florida v. Rodriguez, 469 U. S. 1, 5-6 (1984) (per
curiam) (holding that such interactions in airports are "thesort of consensual encounter[s] that implicat[e] no Fourth

Amendment interest"). Even when law enforcement offi-cers have no basis for suspecting a particular individual,
they may pose questions, ask for identification, and request
consent to search luggage--provided they do not induce co-operation by coercive means. See

Florida v. Bostick, 501
U. S., at 434-435 (citations omitted). If a reasonable personwould feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she

has not been seized.

The Court has addressed on a previous occasion the specific question of drug interdiction efforts on buses. In Bostick, two police officers requested a bus passenger's consent
to a search of his luggage. The passenger agreed, and the
resulting search revealed cocaine in his suitcase. The Florida Supreme Court suppressed the cocaine. In doing so it
adopted a per se rule that due to the cramped confines onboard a bus the act of questioning would deprive a person of
his or her freedom of movement and so constitute a seizure
under the Fourth Amendment.

This Court reversed. Bostick first made it clear that for
the most part per se rules are inappropriate in the Fourth
Amendment context. The proper inquiry necessitates a
consideration of "all the circumstances surrounding the encounter." Id., at 439. The Court noted next that the traditional rule, which states that a seizure does not occur so
long as a reasonable person would feel free "to disregard the
police and go about his business," California v. Hodari D.,
499 U. S. 621, 628 (1991), is not an accurate measure of the
coercive effect of a bus encounter. A passenger may not
want to get off a bus if there is a risk it will depart before
the opportunity to reboard. Bostick, 501 U. S., at 434-436.
A bus rider's movements are confined in this sense, but this
is the natural result of choosing to take the bus; it says noth536US1 Unit: $U65 [12-19-02 17:56:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
202 UNITED STATES v. DRAYTON

Opinion of the Court
ing about whether the police conduct is coercive. Id., at 436.The proper inquiry "is whether a reasonable person would

feel free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise ter-minate the encounter."

Ibid. Finally, the Court rejected
Bostick's argument that he must have been seized becauseno reasonable person would consent to a search of luggage

containing drugs. The reasonable person test, the Court explained, is objective and "presupposes an innocent person."
Id., at 437-438.

In light of the limited record, Bostick refrained from decid-ing whether a seizure occurred.

Id., at 437. The Court,
however, identified two factors "particularly worth noting"
on remand. Id., at 432. First, although it was obvious that
an officer was armed, he did not remove the gun from its
pouch or use it in a threatening way. Second, the officer
advised the passenger that he could refuse consent to the
search. Ibid.

Relying upon this latter factor, the Eleventh Circuit has
adopted what is in effect a per se rule that evidence obtained
during suspicionless drug interdiction efforts aboard buses
must be suppressed unless the officers have advised passengers of their right not to cooperate and to refuse consent to
a search. In United States v. Guapi, supra, the Court of
Appeals described "[t]he most glaring difference" between
the encounters in Guapi and in Bostick as "the complete lack
of any notification to the passengers that they were in fact
free to decline the search request. . . . Providing [this] simple
notification . . . is perhaps the most efficient and effective
method to ensure compliance with the Constitution." 144
F. 3d, at 1395. The Court of Appeals then listed other factors that contributed to the coerciveness of the encounter:
(1) the officer conducted the interdiction before the passengers disembarked from the bus at a scheduled stop; (2) the
officer explained his presence in the form of a general announcement to the entire bus; (3) the officer wore a police
uniform; and (4) the officer questioned passengers as he

Opinion of the Court
moved from the front to the rear of the bus, thus obstructingthe path to the exit.

Id., at 1396.
After its decision in Guapi the Court of Appeals decided
United States v. Washington and the instant case. The
court suppressed evidence obtained during similar drug in-terdiction efforts despite the following facts: (1) the officers

in both cases conducted the interdiction after the passengers
had reboarded the bus; (2) the officer in the present case didnot make a general announcement to the entire bus but instead spoke with individual passengers; (3) the officers inboth cases were not in uniform; and (4) the officers in both
cases questioned passengers as they moved from the rear to
the front of the bus and were careful not to obstruct passengers' means of egress from the bus.

Although the Court of Appeals has disavowed a per se requirement, the lack of an explicit warning to passengers is
the only element common to all its cases. See Washington,
151 F. 3d, at 1357 ("It seems obvious to us that if police officers genuinely want to ensure that their encounters with
bus passengers remain absolutely voluntary, they can simply
say so. Without such notice in this case, we do not feel a
reasonable person would have felt able to decline the agents'
requests"); 231 F. 3d, at 790 (noting that "[t]his case is
controlled by" Guapi and Washington, and dismissing any
factual differences between the three cases as irrelevant).
Under these cases, it appears that the Court of Appeals
would suppress any evidence obtained during suspicionless drug interdiction efforts aboard buses in the absence of
a warning that passengers may refuse to cooperate. The
Court of Appeals erred in adopting this approach.

Applying the Bostick framework to the facts of this particular case, we conclude that the police did not seize respondents when they boarded the bus and began questioning

passengers. The officers gave the passengers no reason
to believe that they were required to answer the officers'
questions. When Officer Lang approached respondents, he

536US1 Unit: $U65 [12-19-02 17:56:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
204 UNITED STATES v. DRAYTON

Opinion of the Court
did not brandish a weapon or make any intimidating move-ments. He left the aisle free so that respondents could exit.

He spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quietvoice. Nothing he said would suggest to a reasonable person that he or she was barred from leaving the bus or other-wise terminating the encounter.

There were ample grounds for the District Court to conclude that "everything that took place between Officer Langand [respondents] suggests that it was cooperative" and that

there "was nothing coercive [or] confrontational" about theencounter. App. 132. There was no application of force, no
intimidating movement, no overwhelming show of force, no
brandishing of weapons, no blocking of exits, no threat,
no command, not even an authoritative tone of voice. It is
beyond question that had this encounter occurred on the
street, it would be constitutional. The fact that an encounter takes place on a bus does not on its own transform standard police questioning of citizens into an illegal seizure. See
Bostick, 501 U. S., at 439-440. Indeed, because many fellow
passengers are present to witness officers' conduct, a reasonable person may feel even more secure in his or her decision not to cooperate with police on a bus than in other
circumstances.

Respondents make much of the fact that Officer Lang displayed his badge. In Florida v. Rodriguez, 469 U. S., at 5-6,
however, the Court rejected the claim that the defendant
was seized when an officer approached him in an airport,
showed him his badge, and asked him to answer some questions. Likewise, in INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210, 212-213
(1984), the Court held that Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) agents' wearing badges and questioning workers in a factory did not constitute a seizure. And while neither Lang nor his colleagues were in uniform or visibly
armed, those factors should have little weight in the analysis.
Officers are often required to wear uniforms and in many
circumstances this is cause for assurance, not discomfort.

536US1 Unit: $U65 [12-19-02 17:56:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

205Cite as: 536 U. S. 194 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Much the same can be said for wearing sidearms. Thatmost law enforcement officers are armed is a fact well known

to the public. The presence of a holstered firearm thus isunlikely to contribute to the coerciveness of the encounter
absent active brandishing of the weapon.Officer Hoover's position at the front of the bus also does
not tip the scale in respondents' favor. Hoover did nothing
to intimidate passengers, and he said nothing to suggest thatpeople could not exit and indeed he left the aisle clear. In

Delgado, the Court determined there was no seizure eventhough several uniformed INS officers were stationed near
the exits of the factory. Id., at 219. The Court noted: "The
presence of agents by the exits posed no reasonable threat
of detention to these workers, . . . the mere possibility that
they would be questioned if they sought to leave the buildings should not have resulted in any reasonable apprehension
by any of them that they would be seized or detained in any
meaningful way." Ibid.

Finally, the fact that in Officer Lang 's experience only a
few passengers have refused to cooperate does not suggest
that a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate
the bus encounter. In Lang 's experience it was common for
passengers to leave the bus for a cigarette or a snack while
the officers were questioning passengers. App. 70, 81.
And of more importance, bus passengers answer officers'
questions and otherwise cooperate not because of coercion
but because the passengers know that their participation enhances their own safety and the safety of those around them.
"While most citizens will respond to a police request, the fact
that people do so, and do so without being told they are free
not to respond, hardly eliminates the consensual nature of
the response." Delgado, supra, at 216.

Drayton contends that even if Brown's cooperation with
the officers was consensual, Drayton was seized because no
reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter
with the officers after Brown had been arrested. The Court

536US1 Unit: $U65 [12-19-02 17:56:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
206 UNITED STATES v. DRAYTON

Opinion of the Court
of Appeals did not address this claim; and in any event theargument fails. The arrest of one person does not mean that

everyone around him has been seized by police. If anything,Brown's arrest should have put Drayton on notice of the
consequences of continuing the encounter by answeringthe officers' questions. Even after arresting Brown, Lang
addressed Drayton in a polite manner and provided him
with no indication that he was required to answer Lang'squestions.

We turn now from the question whether respondents wereseized to whether they were subjected to an unreasonable
search, i. e., whether their consent to the suspicionless search
was involuntary. In circumstances such as these, where the
question of voluntariness pervades both the search and seizure inquiries, the respective analyses turn on very similar
facts. And, as the facts above suggest, respondents' consent
to the search of their luggage and their persons was voluntary. Nothing Officer Lang said indicated a command to
consent to the search. Rather, when respondents informed
Lang that they had a bag on the bus, he asked for their permission to check it. And when Lang requested to search
Brown and Drayton's persons, he asked first if they objected,
thus indicating to a reasonable person that he or she was
free to refuse. Even after arresting Brown, Lang provided
Drayton with no indication that he was required to consent
to a search. To the contrary, Lang asked for Drayton's permission to search him ("Mind if I check you?"), and Drayton agreed.

The Court has rejected in specific terms the suggestion
that police officers must always inform citizens of their right
to refuse when seeking permission to conduct a warrantless
consent search. See, e. g., Ohio v. Robinette, 519 U. S. 33,
39-40 (1996); Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U. S. 218, 227
(1973). "While knowledge of the right to refuse consent is
one factor to be taken into account, the government need not
establish such knowledge as the sine qua non of an effective

536US1 Unit: $U65 [12-19-02 17:56:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

207Cite as: 536 U. S. 194 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
consent." Ibid. Nor do this Court's decisions suggest thateven though there are no

per se rules, a presumption of invalidity attaches if a citizen consented without explicit notifi-cation that he or she was free to refuse to cooperate. Instead, the Court has repeated that the totality of thecircumstances must control, without giving extra weight to
the absence of this type of warning. See, e. g., Schneckloth,
supra; Robinette, supra, at 39-40. Although Officer Langdid not inform respondents of their right to refuse the

search, he did request permission to search, and the totalityof the circumstances indicates that their consent was voluntary, so the searches were reasonable.

In a society based on law, the concept of agreement and
consent should be given a weight and dignity of its own.
Police officers act in full accord with the law when they ask
citizens for consent. It reinforces the rule of law for the
citizen to advise the police of his or her wishes and for the
police to act in reliance on that understanding. When this
exchange takes place, it dispels inferences of coercion.

We need not ask the alternative question whether, after
the arrest of Brown, there were grounds for a Terry stop
and frisk of Drayton, Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 (1968), though
this may have been the case. It was evident that Drayton
and Brown were traveling together--Officer Lang observed
the pair reboarding the bus together; they were each dressed
in heavy, baggy clothes that were ill-suited for the day's
warm temperatures; they were seated together on the bus;
and they each claimed responsibility for the single piece of
green carry-on luggage. Once Lang had identified Brown as
carrying what he believed to be narcotics, he may have had
reasonable suspicion to conduct a Terry stop and frisk on
Drayton as well. That question, however, has not been presented to us. The fact the officers may have had reasonable
suspicion does not prevent them from relying on a citizen's
consent to the search. It would be a paradox, and one most
puzzling to law enforcement officials and courts alike, were

we to say, after holding that Brown's consent was voluntary,that Drayton's consent was ineffectual simply because the

police at that point had more compelling grounds to detainhim. After taking Brown into custody, the officers were
entitled to continue to proceed on the basis of consent and toask for Drayton's cooperation.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Anyone who travels by air today submits to searches ofthe person and luggage as a condition of boarding the aircraft. It is universally accepted that such intrusions arenecessary to hedge against risks that, nowadays, even small
children understand. The commonplace precautions of airtravel have not, thus far, been justified for ground transportation, however, and no such conditions have been placed onpassengers getting on trains or buses. There is therefore
an air of unreality about the Court's explanation that buspassengers consent to searches of their luggage to "enhanc[e]
their own safety and the safety of those around them."
Ante, at 205. Nor are the other factual assessments under-lying the Court's conclusion in favor of the Government

more convincing.The issue we took to review is whether the police's examination of the bus passengers, including respondents,amounted to a suspicionless seizure under the Fourth
Amendment.1 If it did, any consent to search was plainly

invalid as a product of the illegal seizure. See Florida v.Royer, 460 U. S. 491, 507-508 (1983) (plurality opinion)

("[T]he consent was tainted by the illegality and . . . ineffec-tive to justify the search"); id., at 509 (Powell, J., concurring);
id., at 509 (Brennan, J., concurring in result).Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429 (1991), established the
framework for determining whether the bus passengerswere seized in the constitutional sense. In that case, we
rejected the position that police questioning of bus passen-gers was a

per se seizure, and held instead that the issue ofseizure was to be resolved under an objective test considering all circumstances: whether a reasonable passenger wouldhave felt "free to decline the officers' requests or otherwise
terminate the encounter," id., at 436. We thus applied to abus passenger the more general criterion, whether the person questioned was free "to ignore the police presence andgo about his business,"

id., at 437 (quoting Michigan v. Chesternut, 486 U. S. 567, 569 (1988)).Before applying the standard in this case, it may be worth

getting some perspective from different sets of facts. A
perfect example of police conduct that supports no colorableclaim of seizure is the act of an officer who simply goes up

to a pedestrian on the street and asks him a question. See
Royer, 460 U. S., at 497; see id., at 523, n. 3 (Rehnquist, J.,
dissenting). A pair of officers questioning a pedestrian,

in the first place"). While it is true that the Eleventh Circuit purported
to address the question "whether the consent given by each defendant for

the search was `uncoerced and legally voluntary,' " 231 F. 3d 787, 788
(2000), elsewhere the court made it clear that it was applying the test in
Florida v. Bostick, 501 U. S. 429 (1991), which is relevant to the issue of
seizure, 231 F. 3d, at 791, n. 6. There is thus no occasion here to reach
any issue of consent untainted by seizure. If there were, the consent
would have to satisfy the voluntariness test of Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,
412 U. S. 218 (1973), which focuses on "the nature of a person's subjective
understanding," id., at 230, and requires consideration of "the characteristics of the accused [in addition to] the details of the interrogation," id.,
at 226.

Souter, J., dissenting
without more, would presumably support the same conclu-sion. Now consider three officers, one of whom stands

behind the pedestrian, another at his side toward the opensidewalk, with the third addressing questions to the pedestrian a foot or two from his face. Finally, consider the samescene in a narrow alley. On such barebones facts, one may
not be able to say a seizure occurred, even in the last case,
but one can say without qualification that the atmosphereof the encounters differed significantly from the first to the

last examples. In the final instance there is every reason tobelieve that the pedestrian would have understood, to his
considerable discomfort, what Justice Stewart described as
the "threatening presence of several officers," United States
v. Mendenhall, 446 U. S. 544, 554 (1980) (opinion of Stewart,
J.). The police not only carry legitimate authority but also
exercise power free from immediate check, and when the attention of several officers is brought to bear on one civilian
the imbalance of immediate power is unmistakable. We all
understand this, as well as we understand that a display of
power rising to Justice Stewart's "threatening" level may
overbear a normal person's ability to act freely, even in the
absence of explicit commands or the formalities of detention.
As common as this understanding is, however, there is little
sign of it in the Court's opinion. My own understanding of
the relevant facts and their significance follows.

When the bus in question made its scheduled stop in Tallahassee, the passengers were required to disembark while the
vehicle was cleaned and refueled. App. 104. When the
passengers returned, they gave their tickets to the driver,
who kept them and then left himself, after giving three
police officers permission to board the bus in his absence.
Id., at 77-78. Although they were not in uniform, the officers displayed badges and identified themselves as police.
One stationed himself in the driver's seat by the door at the
front, facing back to observe the passengers. The two others went to the rear, from which they worked their way for536US1 Unit: $U65 [12-19-02 17:56:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ward, with one of them speaking to passengers, the otherbacking him up. Id., at 47-48. They necessarily addressed

the passengers at very close range; the aisle was only 15inches wide, and each seat only 18.

2 The quarters were

cramped further by the overhead rack, 19 inches above thetop of the passenger seats. The passenger by the window

could not have stood up straight, id., at 55, and the face ofthe nearest officer was only a foot or 18 inches from the face
of the nearest passenger being addressed, id., at 57. Duringthe exchanges, the officers looked down, and the passengers
had to look up if they were to face the police. The officerasking the questions spoke quietly. He prefaced his requests for permission to search luggage and do a body pat-down by identifying himself by name as a police investigator
"conducting bus interdiction" and saying, " `We would likefor your cooperation. Do you have any luggage on the
bus?' " Id., at 82.Thus, for reasons unexplained, the driver with the tickets
entitling the passengers to travel had yielded his custody ofthe bus and its seated travelers to three police officers,
whose authority apparently superseded the driver's own.The officers took control of the entire passenger compartment, one stationed at the door keeping surveillance of allthe occupants, the others working forward from the back.
With one officer right behind him and the other one forward,a third officer accosted each passenger at quarters extremely
close and so cramped that as many as half the passengerscould not even have stood to face the speaker. None was
asked whether he was willing to converse with the policeor to take part in the enquiry. Instead the officer said the
police were "conducting bus interdiction," in the courseof which they "would like . . . cooperation."

Ibid. Thereasonable inference was that the "interdiction" was not a

consensual exercise, but one the police would carry out what2 The figures are from a Lodging filed by respondents (available in Clerk
of Court's case file). The Government does not dispute their accuracy.

ever the circumstances; that they would prefer "cooperation"but would not let the lack of it stand in their way. There

was no contrary indication that day, since no passenger hadrefused the cooperation requested, and there was no reason
for any passenger to believe that the driver would returnand the trip resume until the police were satisfied. The
scene was set and an atmosphere of obligatory participation
was established by this introduction. Later requests tosearch prefaced with "Do you mind . . ." would naturally

have been understood in the terms with which the encoun-ter began.

It is very hard to imagine that either Brown or Drayton
would have believed that he stood to lose nothing if he refused to cooperate with the police, or that he had any free
choice to ignore the police altogether. No reasonable passenger could have believed that, only an uncomprehending
one. It is neither here nor there that the interdiction was
conducted by three officers, not one, as a safety precaution.
See id., at 47. The fact was that there were three, and when
Brown and Drayton were called upon to respond, each one
was presumably conscious of an officer in front watching, one
at his side questioning him, and one behind for cover, in case
he became unruly, perhaps, or "cooperation" was not forthcoming. The situation is much like the one in the alley, with
civilians in close quarters, unable to move effectively, being
told their cooperation is expected. While I am not prepared
to say that no bus interrogation and search can pass the
Bostick test without a warning that passengers are free to
say no, the facts here surely required more from the officers
than a quiet tone of voice. A police officer who is certain to
get his way has no need to shout.

It is true of course that the police testified that a bus passenger sometimes says no, App. 81, but that evidence does
nothing to cast the facts here in a different light. We have
no way of knowing the circumstances in which a passenger
elsewhere refused a request; maybe that has happened only

Souter, J., dissenting
when the police have told passengers they had a right torefuse (as the officers sometimes advised them), id., at 81-82.

Nor is it fairly possible to see the facts of this case differentlyby recalling INS v. Delgado, 466 U. S. 210 (1984), as precedent. In that case, a majority of this Court found no seizurewhen a factory force was questioned by immigration officers,
with an officer posted at every door leading from the work-place.

Id., at 219. Whether that opinion was well reasonedor not, the facts as the Court viewed them differed from the

case here. Delgado considered an order granting summaryjudgment in favor of respondents, with the consequence that
the Court was required to construe the record and all issuesof fact favorably to the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. See id., at 214; id., at 221 (Stevens, J., concur-ring). The Court therefore emphasized that even after
"th[e] surveys were initiated, the employees were about theirordinary business, operating machinery and performing
other job assignments." Id., at 218. In this case, however,Brown and Drayton were seemingly pinned-in by the officers
and the customary course of events was stopped flat. Thebus was going nowhere, and with one officer in the driver's
seat, it was reasonable to suppose no passenger would tendto his own business until the officers were ready to let him.

In any event, I am less concerned to parse this case against
Delgado than to apply Bostick's totality of circumstancestest, and to ask whether a passenger would reasonably have

felt free to end his encounter with the three officers bysaying no and ignoring them thereafter. In my view the
answer is clear. The Court's contrary conclusion tells methat the majority cannot see what Justice Stewart saw, and
I respectfully dissent.

Syllabus

CAREY, WARDEN v. SAFFOLD
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-301. Argued February 27, 2002--Decided June 17, 2002
The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 requires

a state prisoner seeking federal habeas relief to file his petition
within one year after his state conviction becomes final, 28 U. S. C.

$ 2244(d)(1)(A), but excludes from that period the time during which an
application for state collateral review is "pending," $ 2244(d)(2). Respondent Saffold filed a state habeas petition in California seven days
before the federal deadline. Five days after the state trial court denied
his petition, he filed a further petition in the State Court of Appeal.
Four and one-half months after that petition was denied, he filed a further petition in the State Supreme Court, which denied the petition on
the merits and for lack of diligence. The Federal District Court dismissed his subsequent federal habeas petition as untimely, finding that
the federal statute of limitations was not tolled during the intervals
between the denial of one state petition and the filing of the next because no application was "pending" during that time. In reversing,
the Ninth Circuit included the intervals in the "pending" period, and
found that Saffold's petition was timely because the State Supreme
Court based its decision not only on lack of diligence but also on the
merits.

Held:

1. As used in $ 2244(d)(2), "pending" covers the time between a lower
state court's decision and the filing of a notice of appeal to a higher state
court. Most States' collateral review systems require a prisoner to file
a petition in a trial court; then to file a notice of appeal within a specified
time after entry of the trial court's unfavorable judgment; and, if still
unsuccessful, to file a further notice of appeal (or request for discretionary review) to the state supreme court within a specified time. Petitioner warden seeks a uniform national rule that a state petition is not
"pending" during the interval between a lower court's entry of judgment and the timely filing of a notice of appeal in the next court, reasoning that the petition is not being considered during that time. Such a
reading is not consistent with the ordinary meaning of "pending," which,
in the present context, means until the completion of the collateral review process; i. e., until the application has achieved final resolution
through the State's postconviction proceedings. Petitioner's reading

Syllabus
would also produce a serious statutory anomaly. Because a federal habeas petitioner has not exhausted his state remedies as long as he has
"the right under [state] law . . . to raise" in that State, "by any available
procedure, the question presented," $ 2254(c), and because petitioner's
interpretation encourages state prisoners to file their petitions before
the State completes a full round of collateral review, federal courts
would have to contend with petitions that are in one sense unlawful
(because the claims have not been exhausted) but in another sense required by law (because they would otherwise be barred by the 1-year
limitations period). Pp. 219-221.

2. The same "pending" rule applies to California's unique collateral
review system, even though that system involves, not a notice of appeal,
but the filing (within a "reasonable" time) of a further original state
habeas petition in a higher court. California's system is not as special
in practice as its terminology might suggest. A prisoner typically will
seek habeas review in a lower court and later seek appellate review in
a higher court. Thus, the system functions very much like that in other
States, but for its indeterminate timeliness rule. That rule may make
it more difficult for federal courts to determine when a review application comes too late. But the tolling provision seeks to protect the
State's interests, and the State can explicate timing requirements more
precisely should that prove necessary. In applying a federal statute
that interacts with state procedural rules, this Court looks to how a
state procedure functions, not its particular name. California's system
functions in ways sufficiently like other state collateral review systems
to bring intervals between a lower court decision and a filing in a higher
court within the scope of "pending." Pp. 221-225.

3. The words "on the merits" by themselves do not indicate that Saffold's petition was timely, but it is not possible to conclude that the
Ninth Circuit was wrong in its ultimate conclusion. The State Supreme
Court may have included such words in its opinion for a variety of reasons. And the Ninth Circuit's willingness to take them as an absolute
bellwether risks the tolling of the federal limitations period even when
it is likely that the state petition was untimely, thus threatening the
statutory purpose of encouraging prompt filings in order to protect the
federal system from being forced to hear stale claims. In reconsidering
the timeliness issue, the Ninth Circuit is left to evaluate any special
conditions justifying Saffold's delay in filing in the state court and any
other relevant considerations, and to decide whether to certify a question to the State Supreme Court to seek clarification of the state law.
Pp. 225-227.

Opinion of the Court
application for state collateral review is "pending" in thestate courts. $ 2244(d)(2).

This case raises three questions related to the statutoryword "pending":
(1) Does that word cover the time between a lower statecourt's decision and the filing of a notice of appeal to a higher
state court?(2) If so, does it apply similarly to California's unique state
collateral review system--a system that does not involve anotice of appeal, but rather the filing (within a reasonable
time) of a further original state habeas petition in a highercourt?

(3) If so, was the petition at issue here (filed in the Califor-nia Supreme Court 4

1/2 months after the lower state court

reached its decision) pending during that period, or was itno longer pending because it failed to comply with state

timeliness rules?We answer the first two questions affirmatively, while remanding the case to the Court of Appeals for its furtherconsideration of the third.

I
In 1990 Tony Saffold, the respondent, was convicted andsentenced in California state court for murder, assault with a

firearm, and robbery. His conviction became final on directreview in April 1992. Because Saffold's conviction became
final before AEDPA took effect, the federal limitations pe-riod began running on AEDPA's effective date, April 24,
1996, giving Saffold one year from that date (in the absenceof tolling) to file a federal habeas petition.

A week before the federal deadline, Saffold filed a statehabeas petition in the state trial court. The state trial court
denied the petition. Five days later Saffold filed a furtherpetition in the State Court of Appeal. That court denied his
petition. And 41/2 months later Saffold filed a further peti-tion in the California Supreme Court. That court also denied Saffold's petition, stating in a single sentence that it did

218 CAREY v. SAFFOLD

Opinion of the Court
so "on the merits and for lack of diligence." App. G to Pet.for Cert. 1.

Approximately one week later, in early June 1998, Saffoldfiled a petition for habeas corpus in the Federal District
Court. The District Court noted that AEDPA required Saf-fold to have filed his petition by April 24, 1997. It recognized that the statute gave Saffold extra time by tolling its
limitations period while Saffold's application for state collat-eral review was "pending" in the state courts. But the District Court decided that Saffold's petition was "pending" onlywhile the state courts were actively considering it, and that
period did not include the intervals between the time a lower
state court had denied Saffold's petition and the time he had
filed a further petition in a higher state court. In Saffold's
case those intervals amounted to five days (between the trial
court and intermediate court) plus 41/2 months (between
the intermediate court and Supreme Court), and those intervals made a critical difference. Without counting the intervals as part of the time Saffold's application for state
collateral review was "pending," the tolling period was not
long enough to make Saffold's federal habeas petition timely.
Hence the District Court dismissed the petition.

The Ninth Circuit reversed. It included in the "pending"
period, and hence in the tolling period, the intervals between
what was, in effect, consideration of a petition by a lower
state court and further consideration by a higher state
court--at least assuming a petitioner's request for that further higher court consideration was timely. Saffold v. Newland, 250 F. 3d 1262, 1266 (2001). It added that Saffold's
petition to the California Supreme Court was timely despite
the 41/2 months that had elapsed since the California Court
of Appeal decision. That is because the California Supreme
Court had denied Saffold's petition, not only because of

"lack of diligence" but also "on the merits," a circumstance
that showed the California Supreme Court had "applied its
untimeliness bar only after considering to some degree the

underlying federal constitutional questions raised." Id., at1267.

We granted certiorari. We now vacate the judgment andremand the case.

II
In most States, relevant state law sets forth some versionof the following collateral review procedures. First, the

prisoner files a petition in a state court of first instance, typi-cally a trial court. Second, a petitioner seeking to appeal
from the trial court's judgment must file a notice of appealwithin, say, 30 or 45 days after entry of the trial court's judgment. See, e. g., Ala. Rule App. Proc. 4 (2001); Colo. App.Rule 4(b)(1) (2001); Ky. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.04(3) (2002).
Third, a petitioner seeking further review of an appellatecourt's judgment must file a further notice of appeal to the
state supreme court (or seek that court's discretionary re-view) within a short period of time, say, 20 or 30 days, after
entry of the court of appeals judgment. See, e. g., Ala. RuleApp. Proc. 5 (2001); Colo. Rev. Stat. $ 13-4-108 (2001); Conn.
Rule App. Proc. 80-1 (2002); Ky. Rule Civ. Proc. 76.20(2)(b)(2002). California argues here for a "uniform national rule"
to the effect that an application for state collateral review isnot "pending" in the state courts during the interval between a lower court's entry of judgment and the timely filingof a notice of appeal (or petition for review) in the next court.
Brief for Petitioner 36. Its rationale is that, during thisperiod of time, the petition is not under court consideration.

California's reading of the word "pending," however, is notconsistent with that word's ordinary meaning. The dictionary defines "pending" (when used as an adjective) as "incontinuance" or "not yet decided." Webster's Third New
International Dictionary 1669 (1993). It similarly definesthe term (when used as a preposition) as "through the period
of continuance . . . of," "until the . . . completion of." Ibid.That definition, applied in the present context, means that an
application is pending as long as the ordinary state collateral

220 CAREY v. SAFFOLD

Opinion of the Court
review process is "in continuance"--i. e., "until the comple-tion of " that process. In other words, until the application has achieved final resolution through the State's post-conviction procedures, by definition it remains "pending."

California's reading would also produce a serious statutoryanomaly. A federal habeas petitioner must exhaust state
remedies before he can obtain federal habeas relief. The
statute makes clear that a federal petitioner has not ex-hausted those remedies as long as he maintains "the right

under the law of the State to raise" in that State, "by anyavailable procedure, the question presented." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254(c). We have interpreted this latter provision to require the federal habeas petitioner to "invok[e] one complete
round of the State's established appellate review process."
O'Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999). The exhaustion requirement serves AEDPA's goal of promoting
"comity, finality, and federalism," Williams v. Taylor, 529
U. S. 420, 436 (2000), by giving state courts "the first opportunity to review [the] claim," and to "correct" any "constitutional violation in the first instance." Boerckel, supra, at
844-845. And AEDPA's limitations period--with its accompanying tolling provision--ensures the achievement of this
goal because it "promotes the exhaustion of state remedies
while respecting the interest in the finality of state court
judgments." Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167, 178 (2001).
California's interpretation violates these principles by encouraging state prisoners to file federal habeas petitions
before the State completes a full round of collateral review.
This would lead to great uncertainty in the federal courts,
requiring them to contend with habeas petitions that are
in one sense unlawful (because the claims have not been
exhausted) but in another sense required by law (because
they would otherwise be barred by the 1-year statute of
limitations).

It is therefore not surprising that no circuit court has interpreted the word "pending" in the manner proposed by

Opinion of the Court
California. Every Court of Appeals to consider the argu-ment has rejected it. Melancon v. Kaylo, 259 F. 3d 401, 406

(CA5 2001); Payton v. Brigano, 256 F. 3d 405, 408 (CA62001); Hizbullahankhamon v. Walker, 255 F. 3d 65, 72 (CA2

Barnett v. LeMaster, 167F. 3d 1321, 1323 (CA10 1999). Like these courts, we answer

the first question in the affirmative.

III
Having answered the necessarily predicate question ofhow the tolling provision ordinarily treats applications for

state collateral review in typical "appeal" States, we turnto the question whether this rule applies in California. California's collateral review system differs from that of otherStates in that it does not require, technically speaking, appellate review of a lower court determination. Instead it con-templates that a prisoner will file a new "original" habeas
petition. And it determines the timeliness of each filing ac-cording to a "reasonableness" standard. These differences,
it is argued, require treating California differently from "ap-peal" States, in particular by not counting a petition as
"pending" during the interval between a lower court's deter-mination and filing of another petition in a higher court.
See, e. g., Brief for Criminal Justice Legal Foundation asAmicus Curiae 5-18.

California's "original writ" system, however, is not as spe-cial in practice as its terminology might suggest. As interpreted by the courts, California's habeas rules lead a pris-oner ordinarily to file a petition in a lower court first. In re
Ramirez, 89 Cal. App. 4th 1312, 1316, 108 Cal. Rptr. 2d 229,232 (2001) (appellate court "has discretion to refuse to issue
the writ . . . on the ground that application has not [first]been made . . . in a lower court");

Opinion of the Court
of Cal., 500 F. 2d 1124, 1126 (CA9 1974) (same); 6 B. Witkin &N. Epstein, California Criminal Law $ 20, p. 540 (3d ed. 2000)

(describing general policy that reviewing court will requireapplication to have been made first in lower court). And a
prisoner who files a subsequent and similar petition in an-other lower court (say, another trial court) will likely find
consideration of that petition barred as successive. See,
e. g., In re Clark, 5 Cal. 4th 750, 767-771, 855 P. 2d 729, 740-744 (1993). At the same time, a prisoner who files that same

petition in a higher, reviewing court will find that he canobtain the basic appellate review that he seeks, even though
it is dubbed an "original" petition. See In re Resendiz, 25
Cal. 4th 230, 250, 19 P. 3d 1171, 1184 (2001) (reviewing court
grants substantial deference to lower court's factual findings). Thus, typically a prisoner will seek habeas review in
a lower court and later seek appellate review in a higher
court--just as occurred in this case.

The upshot is that California's collateral review process
functions very much like that of other States, but for the
fact that its timeliness rule is indeterminate. Other States
(with the exception of North Carolina, see Allen v. Mitchell,
276 F. 3d 183, 186 (CA4 2001)), specify precise time limits,
such as 30 or 45 days, within which an appeal must be taken,
while California applies a general "reasonableness" standard.
Still, we do not see how that feature of California law could
make a critical difference. As mentioned, AEDPA's tolling
rule is designed to protect the principles of "comity, finality,
and federalism," by promoting "the exhaustion of state remedies while respecting the interest in the finality of state
court judgments." Duncan, supra, at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted). It modifies the 1-year filing rule (a
rule that prevents prisoners from delaying their federal filing) in order to give States the opportunity to complete one
full round of review, free of federal interference. Inclusion
of California's "reasonableness" periods carries out that purpose in the same way, and to the same degree, as does inclu536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

223Cite as: 536 U. S. 214 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
sion of the more specific appellate filing periods prevalent inother States. And exclusion of those periods in California

would undermine AEDPA's statutory goals just as it wouldin those States. See Part II,

supra.
The fact that California's timeliness standard is generalrather than precise may make it more difficult for federal

courts to determine just when a review application (i. e., a
filing in a higher court) comes too late. But it is the State'sinterests that the tolling provision seeks to protect, and the

State, through its supreme court decisions or legislation, canexplicate timing requirements more precisely should that
prove necessary.

Ordinarily, for purposes of applying a federal statute that
interacts with state procedural rules, we look to how a state
procedure functions, rather than the particular name that it
bears. See Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of Equalization,
329 U. S. 69, 72 (1946) (looking to function rather than "designation" that state law gives a state-court judgment for purposes of determining federal jurisdiction); Department of
Banking of Neb. v. Pink, 317 U. S. 264, 268 (1942) (per curiam) (same). We find that California's system functions in
ways sufficiently like other state systems of collateral review
to bring intervals between a lower court decision and a filing
of a new petition in a higher court within the scope of the
statutory word "pending."

The dissent contends that this application of the federal
tolling provision to California's "original writ" system "will
disrupt the sound operation of the federal limitations period
in at least 36 States." Post, at 227 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).
This is so, the dissent believes, because the prisoner is given
two choices when his petition has been denied by the intermediate court: He can file a "petition for hearing" in the supreme court within 10 days, or he can file a "new petition"
in the supreme court. In re Reed, 33 Cal. 3d 914, 918, and
n. 2, 663 P. 2d 216, 217, and n. 2 (1983). Why is California
different, the dissent asks, from "appeal" States that also

536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN
224 CAREY v. SAFFOLD

Opinion of the Court
give their supreme courts the power to entertain originalhabeas petitions? Won't our interpretation of the federal

tolling rule, as it applies to California, apply equally to thoseother States, meaning that even after the statutory time to
appeal to the supreme court has expired, the federal limita-tions period may still be tolled because a prisoner might, at
any time, file an original petition?

The answer to this question is "no." In "appeal" systems,the original writ plays a different role. As the Supreme

Court of Idaho (one of the States cited by the dissent)explains:

"The Supreme Court, having jurisdiction to review on
appeal decisions of the district courts in habeas corpus
proceedings . . . will not exercise its power . . . to grantan

original writ of habeas corpus, except in extraordinary cases." In re Barlow, 48 Idaho 309, 282 P. 380(1929).

See also, e. g., Commonwealth v. Salzinger, 406 Pa. 268, 269,
177 A. 2d 619, 620 (1962) ("extraordinary circumstances" required for exercise of original jurisdiction); La Belle v. Hancock, 99 N. H. 254, 255, 108 A. 2d 545 (1954) (per curiam)
("original authority" to grant habeas relief "not ordinarily
exercised"); Ex parte Lambert, 37 Tex. Crim. 435, 436, 36
S. W. 81, 82 (1896) ("[E]xcept in extraordinary cases, we will
not entertain jurisdiction as a court to grant original writs
of habeas corpus").

California, in contrast, has engrained original writs--both
at the appellate level and in the supreme court--into its normal collateral review process. As we have explained, and
as the dissent recognizes, the only avenue for a prisoner to
challenge the denial of his application in the superior court
is to file a "new petition" in the appellate court. And to
challenge an appellate court denial, "[f]urther review [of a
habeas application] may be sought in [the supreme] court

Opinion of the Court
either by a new petition for habeas corpus or, preferably, bya petition for hearing." In re Reed, supra, at 918, n. 2, 663

P. 2d, at 216, n. 2 (emphasis added). Unlike States such as,say, Idaho, see In re Barlow, supra, the original writ in California is not "extraordinary"--it is interchangeable with thepetition for hearing, with neither option bringing adverse
consequences to the petitioner. Consequently, we treat Cal-ifornia both as

similar to other States (in that its "originalwrit" system functions like the "appeal" systems of those

other States), and differently from other States (in that therule we apply to original writs in California does not apply
to original writs in other States, precisely because origi-nal writs in California function like appeals). And of course,
as we have said, California remains free, through legisla-tive or judicial action, to adjust its "original writ" system
accordingly. IV

It remains to ask whether Saffold delayed "unreasonably"in seeking California Supreme Court review. If so, his application would no longer have been "pending" during thisperiod. Saffold filed his petition for review in the California
Supreme Court 41/2 months after the California Court of Ap-peal issued its decision. The Ninth Circuit held that this
filing was nonetheless timely. It based its conclusion pri-marily upon the fact that the California Supreme Court
wrote that it denied the petition "on the merits and for lack
of diligence." These first three words, the Ninth Circuitsuggested, showed that the California Supreme Court could

not have considered the petition too late, for, if so, why wouldit have considered the merits? 250 F. 3d, at 1267

.
There are many plausible answers to this question. Acourt will sometimes address the merits of a claim that it

believes was presented in an untimely way: for instance,where the merits present no difficult issue; where the court
wants to give a reviewing court alternative grounds for deci536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN
226 CAREY v. SAFFOLD

Opinion of the Court
sion; or where the court wishes to show a prisoner (who may
not have a lawyer) that it was not merely a procedural technicality that precluded him from obtaining relief. Given the
variety of reasons why the California Supreme Court may
have included the words "on the merits," those words cannot
by themselves indicate that the petition was timely. And
the Ninth Circuit's apparent willingness to take such words
as an absolute bellwether risks the tolling of the federal limitations period even when it is highly likely that the prisoner
failed to seek timely review in the state appellate courts.
See, e. g., Welch v. Newland, 267 F. 3d 1013 (CA9 2001) (finding limitations period tolled during 4-year gap). The Ninth
Circuit's rule consequently threatens to undermine the statutory purpose of encouraging prompt filings in federal court
in order to protect the federal system from being forced to
hear stale claims. See Duncan, 533 U. S., at 179.

If the California Supreme Court had clearly ruled that Saffold's 41/2-month delay was "unreasonable," that would be the
end of the matter, regardless of whether it also addressed
the merits of the claim, or whether its timeliness ruling was
"entangled" with the merits. 250 F. 3d, at 1267. We cannot
say in this case, however, that the Ninth Circuit was wrong
in its ultimate conclusion. Saffold argues that special circumstances were present here: He was not notified of the
Court of Appeal's decision for several months, and he filed
within days after receiving notification. And he contends it
is more likely that the phrase "lack of diligence" referred to
the delay between the date his conviction became final and
the date he first sought state postconviction relief--a matter
irrelevant to the question whether his application was "pending" during the 41/2-month interval. We leave it to the
Court of Appeals to evaluate these and any other relevant
considerations in the first instance. We also leave to the
Court of Appeals the decision whether it would be appropriate to certify a question to the California Supreme Court

of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Kennedy, with whom The Chief Justice,
Justice Scalia, and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

Respondent is a California prisoner who did not file a no-tice of appeal. The Court, however, begins by considering

a question not presented, whether the statute of limita-tions would have been tolled for a hypothetical prisoner who
filed an appeal somewhere else. This is a strong indicationthat the Court is off in the wrong direction. After holding
that tolling applies for its hypothetical appellant, the Courtfinally gets to California, where no appeal was filed. On the
Court's view, California's procedures are "unique," ante, at217, so giving them special treatment under the statute will
affect only that one State. It is quite wrong about this. Infact, today's ruling will disrupt the sound operation of the
federal limitations period in at least 36 States. This is whathappens when the Court departs from the text of a nationwide statute to reach a result in one particular State.The Court's conclusion that an application is pending before the filing of an original writ in the California SupremeCourt rests on three propositions: First, "application" means
"petition, appeal from the denial of a petition, and anythingelse that functions as an appeal." Second, California's
procedures are very different from those in other States.Third, a petition for an original writ in the California Supreme Court functions as an appeal. The first is an untena-ble interpretation of statutory text. The second and third,
however, are wrong on both the facts and the law. The rem536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

edies available in the California Supreme Court are no different from those available in most other state supreme courts.
Like 36 other States, California allows its high court both to
reverse the denial of habeas corpus in the lower court and
to grant an original petition for habeas outright. In California, as in other States, these procedures differ in more than
name. They differ with respect to the question in this case:
whether an application was pending in the 4-month period
between the denial of respondent's habeas petition in the
California Court of Appeal and his filing of a new petition in
the California Supreme Court.

The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(1), provides a 1-year
statute of limitations for filing a federal habeas corpus petition, but it tolls the limitations period while a "properly filed
application" for collateral review is "pending" in the state
courts. The Court now holds that on the day before respondent filed an original petition in the California Supreme
Court, his application was "properly filed" and "pending"
somewhere. The Court does not say what that application
was, nor does it identify the court in which it was filed. This
is because nothing had been under consideration or awaiting the result of an appeal for four months, since the California Court of Appeal had denied respondent's previous
application.

Instead of identifying a particular pending application, the
Court relies upon an expansive definition of the term. The
Court begins by defining "pending," offering one definition
for when the word is used as an adjective and another for
when used as a preposition. See ante, at 219. As the statute only uses the word as an adjective (tolling while the application "is pending"), the latter definition is irrelevant and
misleading. When used as an adjective, the definition does
not help the Court. The Court says "pending" means " `in
continuance' or `not yet decided.' " Ibid. (quoting Webster's
Third New International Dictionary 1669 (1993)). The real

Kennedy, J., dissenting
issue though is not what "pending" means, but when is an"application . . . pending." The Court asserts that "an application is pending as long as the ordinary state collateral re-view process is `in continuance' . . . ."

Ante, at 219-220.
That is only true, of course, if "application" means the "ordi-nary state collateral review process," a proposition that finds

no support in Webster's Third. Indeed, it is inconsistent
with Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S. 4 (2000), which recognizedthat an "application" is a "document" distinct from the legal

claims contained within it. Id., at 8, 9. The word, "applica-tion," appears in numerous other places in the laws governing federal habeas corpus. E. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 2242 ("applica-tion for a writ of habeas corpus shall be in writing signed
and verified"); $ 2243 (a "judge entertaining an applicationfor a writ of habeas corpus"). In each place, it is clear that
the statute refers to a specific legal document; in none is theword used as a substitute for the ordinary collateral review
process. Without discussing Artuz or these many statu-tory references, the Court gives "application" a new meaning, one that does not even require the existence of any document evidencing the "application," and one that embracesthe multiple petitions, appeals, and other filings that constitute the "ordinary state collateral review process." Ante,
at 219-220.

The Court explains that the original petition in the California Supreme Court is part of the ordinary collateral review process because it functions as an appeal under California law. California, the Court says, "does not require,
technically speaking, appellate review of a lower court determination. Instead it contemplates that a prisoner will file a
new `original' habeas petition." Ante, at 221. This is an
incorrect statement of California law. While California does
not permit appeals of the California Superior Court's denial
of habeas corpus, it does provide for "appellate review" of
the denial of a petition for habeas corpus by the California
Court of Appeal. That appeal is not just available; as the
Court concedes, ante, at 224-225, the California Supreme

Court has said that it is the preferred practice. See In re
Reed, 33 Cal. 3d 914, 918, and n. 2, 663 P. 2d 216, 217, and
n. 2 (1983). Section 1506 of the Cal. Penal Code Ann. (West2000) provides: "[I]n all criminal cases where an application

for a writ of habeas corpus has been heard and determinedin a court of appeal, either the defendant or the people may
apply for a hearing in the Supreme Court." Respondent
had 10 days after the Court of Appeal denied his petition tofile a petition for review. Cal. App. Rules of Court 28(b),

50(b) (2002). The Court's analysis is thus premised on a mis-interpretation of California law.

Had respondent filed the appeal provided by Cal. Penal
Code Ann. $ 1506 (West 2000), his application might have remained pending during the 10 days while he prepared his
appeal and while the appeal was under consideration by the
California Supreme Court. This is because an appeal is not
a new application; rather, it is a request that the appellate
court order the lower court to grant the original application.
Congress used the word "application" in precisely this way
for federal petitions for habeas corpus--distinguishing between "appeals," see 28 U. S. C. $ 2253, and second or successive "applications," see $ 2244. Thus, an application may
remain "pending" in the lower court while the prisoner

pursues his appeal, because the lower court may grant the
original application at some point in the future.

An application does not remain pending, however, once the
court that has denied it loses the power to ever grant it.
When the Court of Appeal denied respondent's petition and
respondent did not appeal, the petition became final and was
no longer pending before that court. See Cal. App. Rule of
Court 24 (2002) ("When a decision of a reviewing court is
final as to that court, it is not thereafter subject to modification or rehearing by that court . . ."). Respondent could
not ask the Court of Appeal to grant the application, and
respondent could not request that the California Supreme
Court order the Court of Appeal to grant the application.

Instead respondent filed a new application, a petition for awrit of habeas corpus, invoking the original jurisdiction of

the California Supreme Court. See Cal. Const., Art. VI,$ 10 (Supp. 2001). Under California law, the original petition began a new proceeding that had no proximate connec-tion to the proceedings in the California Court of Appeal.
See People v. Romero, 8 Cal. 4th 728, 737, 883 P. 2d 388, 391
(1994). The California Supreme Court had no power togrant the previous petition, and it did not even have the

power to vacate the judgment of the lower state court. See
In re Michael E., 15 Cal. 3d 183, 192-193, n. 15, 538 P. 2d
231, 237, n. 15 (1975). There is no sense in which, before or
after the filing of a petition for an original writ, an application remained pending below.

Even if California recognized an original writ as an equivalent procedure to an appeal for purposes of state law, the
two procedures would differ with respect to the federal statutory question in this case. When a prisoner files an appeal,
the original application remains pending in the lower court,
but when a prisoner files an original writ, there is no application pending in any lower court. As it turns out, however,
California law does not regard an appeal and an original writ
as equivalents. California recognizes that a prisoner may
obtain relief through either procedure, but the California Supreme Court has said an appeal is preferred. In re Reed,
supra, at 918-919, and n. 2, 663 P. 2d, at 217, n. 2. At the
same time, a prisoner may use an original writ in circumstances where an appeal is not available. Although California encourages prisoners to exhaust claims in the lower
courts, the claims within an original petition need not be the
same as those presented earlier. E. g., In re Black, 66 Cal.
2d 881, 428 P. 2d 293 (1967); Cal. App. Rule of Court 56(a)(1)
(2002) (directing prisoners to explain why the exhaustion
rule should not apply). Indeed, the California Supreme
Court may grant relief even if the prisoner has not filed any
petition in the lower courts. E. g., In re Moss, 175 Cal. App.

232 CAREY v. SAFFOLD

Kennedy, J., dissenting
3d 913, 922, 221 Cal. Rptr. 645, 649 (1985). As the new peti-tion constitutes a new application in form and function, the

California Supreme Court has long recognized what ourCourt today refuses to see. After the denial of a habeas
petition, there is no application "pending" in any court:

"Where a petitioner was remanded to custody by a superior court, and the proceeding instituted in that courtwas thus terminated and was no longer a matter

pending therein, he could inaugurate a new proceeding forrelief in another court and can still do so, but is now

limited in the making of a new application by statutoryprovision to a higher court, either the district court of
appeal having jurisdiction, or the supreme court."
In re Zany, 164 Cal. 724, 727, 130 P. 710 (1913).

The petition thus is not pending even under state law: Eachhabeas petition is a "

new proceeding for relief," ibid., and is
not the same case, let alone the same application. Each timea California court denies a petition, the application is "no

longer a matter pending," ibid., before any court, because itcan no longer be granted by that court or any other court in
the future.

The Court's contrary conclusion does not depend upon anyreasonable construction of a "pending application." It depends entirely upon the proposition that when Californiasays "original writ," it means "appeal," and federal courts
must not privilege form over substance. But California pro-vides for an appeal, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. $ 1506 (West
2000), and none was taken here. It is impossible to under-stand why the Court has ignored this provision by which
California provides for an appeal, just like every other State.

The Court also has ignored the fact that most other States
provide for original writs, just like California. As a consequence, the Court's error is of substantial significance beyond this case; for the California Supreme Court's original
jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus is not some quirk

of California law. At least 36 other States grant their su-preme courts original jurisdiction over petitions for habeas

corpus as well as appellate jurisdiction over a habeas deter-mination in the lower courts. See Appendix,

infra. Congress, of course, understands this distinction, since it hasprovided both procedures for our own Court. A state prisoner seeking to challenge the validity of his sentence may
seek review of a lower court's decision by filing a petition forcertiorari, 28 U. S. C. $ 1257, or he may file a petition for an

original writ of habeas corpus, $ 2241. While the prisonermay obtain relief through either procedure, there is a clear
distinction between an appeal--which requests that we
order the lower court to grant an application pending before
it--and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus--which requests that we grant the relief ourselves. Before this case
no one thought that distinction to be merely one of form and
not substance.

The Court is thus quite mistaken to conclude that its decision concerns only the procedures within California. The
Court distinguishes California from other States because
California "has engrained original writs--both at the appellate level and in the supreme court--into its normal collateral review process." Ante, at 224. This statement is not
correct even for California. See supra, at 231-232. It may
or may not be true for the four other States the Court cites,
but even so the federal courts will have to test that point
for dozens more. The Court's distinction between "appeal
States" and "original writ States" is its own creation with
no clear meaning under state law, not to mention a tie to
the law Congress has enacted. Having departed from the
sensible meaning of application, and the well-understood distinction between an appeal and an original writ, the Court
now requires federal courts to define the ordinary collateral
review procedures in each State. It may not be clear in how
many States original writs will fall on the side of the ordinary, but it is clear that the question will be litigated. In

Kennedy, J., dissenting
many, if not all, of the States mentioned above, a prisoner
like respondent, relying upon today's decision, will be able to
extend the federal tolling period, perhaps indefinitely, by filing a petition for an original writ of habeas corpus in a state
supreme court many months after his state appeal has been
denied. See Welch v. Newland, 267 F. 3d 1013 (CA9 2001)
(tolling the federal limitations for a 4-year gap).

In those jurisdictions the Court will create a strange
anomaly. Now an application can be both pending and not
pending, taking on what the Seventh Circuit has described
as a "Cheshire-cat like quality, both there and not there at
the same time." Fernandez v. Sternes, 227 F. 3d 977, 980
(2000). If, for instance, the Court's hypothetical prisoner
declined to file an appeal to the State's highest court, and he
went to federal court more than a year later, his petition
would be dismissed as time barred. As no application had
been on the docket of any court for a year, and no petition
that he had addressed to any state court could ever be
granted, no "properly filed application" was "pending" anywhere. Under the Court's view, however, it would be premature to say that the federal statute of limitations had expired. The prisoner could file a new petition invoking the
original jurisdiction of the state high court, and if the court
denied it on the merits (or without comment), a subsequent
federal application could be timely even though the earlier
one was too late.

Under today's ruling, the federal court would be required
to rule that the state petition, which was not pending before,
had retroactively become so, and the prisoner's new federal
application was timely. This is not a sensible way of determining when an application is "pending" under the federal
tolling provision. Whether an application is pending at any
given moment should be susceptible of a yes or no answer.
On the Court's theory the answer will often be "impossible
to tell," because it depends not on whether an application is

536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., dissenting
under submission in a particular court but upon events thatmay occur at some later time.

The Court's insistence on treating an original writ as anappeal will create serious confusion in California--and elsewhere--for another reason. Federal courts will have todetermine when an original writ is timely under California

law because on the Court's holding only timely petitions
cause an application to be (retroactively) pending. Theproblem, however, is that an original writ in California--like

original writs elsewhere and unlike appeals in California andmost everywhere else--does not have a strict time limit.
Under California law the question is not whether a petition
is "timely" but whether the prisoner exercised "due diligence" in filing his petition within a reasonable time after he
becomes aware of the grounds for relief. In re Harris, 5
Cal. 4th 813, 828, n. 7, 855 P. 2d 391, 398, n. 7 (1993). This
equitable concept is designed to be flexible, and it allows California courts to correct miscarriages of justice, even those
which happened long ago. E. g., In re Stankewitz, 40 Cal.
3d 391, 396, n. 1, 708 P. 2d 1260, 1262, n. 1 (1985) (hearing
the merits despite an 18-month delay); In re Moss, 175 Cal.
App. 3d, at 921, 221 Cal. Rptr., at 648 (hearing the merits
despite a 9-month delay). Nothing about AEDPA suggests
that Congress wanted to inject this degree of unpredictability into the 1-year statute of limitations, and it is hard to
see how federal courts are to approach this state-law inquiry.

While there may be cases, like this one, where the California courts expressly deny a petition for lack of diligence, the
California courts routinely deny petitions filed after lengthy
delays without making specific findings of undue delay.
Brief for Respondent 40-41, n. 27. Under the Court's rule,
federal courts will be required to assess, without clear guidance from state law, whether respondent exercised due diligence. This inquiry will create substantial uncertainty, and
resulting federal litigation, over whether a prisoner had filed
his habeas petition within a reasonable time. The uncer536US1 Unit: $U66 [12-16-03 20:35:46] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tainty may vex prisoners as well, for they cannot knowwhether the federal statute of limitations is running while

they prepare their state petitions.The Court's disposition in this very case proves that the
timing question is often unanswerable. Even though this isthe rare case where the California Supreme Court made a
specific finding of "lack of diligence," the Court does not hold
respondent's petition untimely. Instead, the Court con-cludes that the lack of diligence finding is ambiguous, because it might refer, not to respondent's 4-month delay infiling his final writ, but to his 5-year delay in pursuing any
collateral relief at all. Ante, at 226. This ambiguity, however, should not benefit respondent. If the California court
held that all of respondent's state habeas petitions were
years overdue, then they were not "properly filed" at all, and
there would be no tolling of the federal limitations period.
See Artuz v. Bennett, 531 U. S., at 8. Our consideration
whether respondent's petition was "pending" presupposes
that it was "properly filed" in the California courts.

The Court takes a different view, but in delivering the
case back to the Court of Appeals, it provides no guidance
for resolving the ambiguity. As the question has been thoroughly briefed before our Court, it is difficult to see how the
lower court would resolve it, if we could not. The Court
says that the Court of Appeals might certify a question to
the California Supreme Court, but it gives no indication
what that court might ask. Presumably, it is not suggesting
that in every case where the California Supreme Court issues a summary denial, the Court of Appeals should certify
the factbound question of what it really meant to say.

The Court begins in a hypothetical jurisdiction, and it ends
without answering the question presented. Both points are
telling. By leaving the text of the federal statute behind
and calling California's procedures something they are not,
the Court has complicated the disposition of the thousands
of petitions filed each year in the federal district courts in

UNITED STATES v. FIOR D'ITALIA, INC.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-463. Argued April 22, 2002--Decided June 17, 2002
Employers must pay Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes,

calculated as a percentage of the wages, including tips, that their employees receive. 26 U. S. C. $$ 3101, 3111, 3121(q). An employee reports the tip amount to the employer, who sends copies of the reports
to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). 26 CFR $ 31.6011(a)-1(a). In
1991 and 1992, respondent Fior D'Italia restaurant paid FICA taxes
based on the tip amount its employees reported, but the reports also
showed that the tips listed on customers' credit card slips far exceeded
the reported amount. The IRS made a compliance check and assessed
additional FICA taxes using an "aggregate estimation" method, under
which it examined the credit card slips; found the average percentage
tip paid by those customers; assumed that cash-paying customers paid
at same rate; calculated total tips by multiplying the tip rates by Fior
D'Italia's total receipts; subtracted the tips already reported; applied
the FICA tax rate to the remainder; and assessed additional taxes owed.
After paying a portion of the taxes, Fior D'Italia filed this refund suit,
claiming that the tax statutes did not authorize the IRS to use the aggregate estimation method, but required it to first determine the tips
that each individual employee received and then use that information to
calculate the employer's total FICA tax liability. Fior D'Italia agreed
that it would not dispute the accuracy of the particular calculation in
this case. The District Court ruled for Fior D'Italia, and the Ninth
Circuit affirmed.

Held: The tax law authorizes the IRS to use the aggregate estimation

method. Pp. 242-252.

(a) An assessment is entitled to a legal presumption of correctness.
By granting the IRS assessment authority, 26 U. S. C. $ 6201(a) must
simultaneously grant it power to decide how to make that assessment
within certain limits, which are not exceeded when the IRS estimates
tax liability using a reasonable method. Pp. 242-244.

(b) The FICA statute's language, taken as a whole, does not prevent
using an aggregate estimation method. Fior D'Italia claims that, because $ 3121(q) speaks in the singular--"tips received by an employee
in the course of his employment"--an employer's liability attaches to
each individual payment, not when the payments are later summed and

Syllabus
reported. However, $ 3121(q) is a definitional section. Sections 3111(a)
and (b), which impose the tax, speak in the plural--"wages" paid to
"individuals" by the employer "with respect to employment"--and thus
impose liability for the totality of the "wages" paid, which totality,
says the definitional section, includes each individual employee's tips.
Pp. 244-245.

(c) Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's view, there is no reason to read

$ 446(b)--which authorizes the IRS to use estimation methods for determining income tax liability--or $ 6205(a)(1)--which authorizes the
Secretary to adopt regulations prescribing mechanisms for employers
to adjust FICA tax liability--as limiting the IRS' authority to use an
aggregate estimation method to compute in computing FICA tax liability. Pp. 245-246.

(d) Certain features of an aggregate estimate--that it includes tips
that should not count in calculating FICA tax, e. g., tips amounting to
less than $20 per month; and that a calculation based on credit card slips
can overstate the aggregate amount because, e. g., cash-paying customers tend to leave a lower percentage tip--do not show that the method
is so unreasonable as to violate the law. Absent Fior D'Italia's stipulation that it would not challenge the IRS calculation's accuracy, a taxpayer would be free and able to present evidence that the assessment
is inaccurate in a particular case. Pp. 246-248.

(e) The fact that the employer is placed in an awkward position by
the requirement that it pay taxes only on tips reported by its employees,
even when it knows those reports are inaccurate, does not make aggregate estimation unlawful. Section 3121(q) makes clear that penalties
will not attach and interest will not accrue unless the IRS actually
demands the money and the restaurant refuses to pay the amount demanded in a timely fashion. Pp. 248-249.

(f) Finally, even assuming that an improper motive on the IRS' part
could render unlawful its use of a statutorily permissible enforcement
method in certain circumstances, Fior D'Italia has not shown that the
IRS has acted illegally in this case. It has presented a general claim
that the aggregate estimation method lends itself to abusive agency action. But agency action cannot be found unreasonable in all cases simply because of a general possibility of abuse, which exists in respect to
many discretionary enforcement powers. Pp. 250-252.

Revenue Service (IRS) to base that assessment upon itsaggregate estimate of all the tips that the restaurant's customers paid its employees, or whether the law requires theIRS instead to determine total tip income by estimating each
individual employee's tip income separately, then adding in-dividual estimates together to create a total. In our view,
the law authorizes the IRS to use the aggregate estimationmethod.

The tax law imposes, not only on employees, but also "on
every employer," an "excise tax," i. e., a FICA tax, in an
amount equal to a percentage "of the wages . . . paid by himwith respect to employment." $ 3111(a) (setting forth basic

forth additional hospital insurance tax). It specifies that"tips received by an employee in the course of his employment shall be considered remuneration" and "deemed tohave been paid by the employer" for purposes of the FICA
tax sections. $ 3121(q). It also requires an employee whoreceives wages in the form of tips to report the amount of
those tips to the employer, who must send copies of those
reports to the IRS. 26 CFR $ 31.6011(a)-1(a) (2001).In 1991 and 1992 the reports provided to San Francisco's

Fior D'Italia restaurant (and ultimately to the IRS) by therestaurant's employees showed that total tip income
amounted to $247,181 and $220,845, in each year respectively.
And Fior D'Italia calculated and paid its FICA tax based on
these amounts. The same reports, however, also showed
that customers had listed tips on their credit card slips
amounting to far more than the amount reported by the employees ($364,786 in 1991 and $338,161 in 1992). Not surprisingly, this discrepancy led the IRS to conduct a compliance check. And that check led the IRS to issue an
assessment against Fior D'Italia for additional FICA tax.

To calculate the added tax it found owing, the IRS used
what it calls an "aggregate estimation" method. That
method was a very simple one. The IRS examined the restaurant's credit card slips for the years in question, finding
that customers had tipped, on average, 14.49% of their bills
in 1991 and 14.29% in 1992. Assuming that cash-paying
customers on average tipped at those rates also, the IRS
calculated total tips by multiplying the tip rates by the restaurant's total receipts. It then subtracted tips already
reported and applied the FICA tax rate to the remainder.
The results for 1991 showed total tips amounting to $403,726
and unreported tips amounting to $156,545. The same figures for 1992 showed $368,374 and $147,529. The IRS issued an assessment against Fior D'Italia for additional FICA
taxes owed, amounting to $11,976 for 1991 and $11,286 for
1992.

242 UNITED STATES v. FIOR D'ITALIA, INC.

Opinion of the Court
After paying a portion of the taxes assessed, the restau-rant brought this refund suit, while the IRS filed a counterclaim for the remainder. The restaurant argued that thetax statutes did not authorize the IRS to use its "aggregate
estimation" method; rather, they required the IRS first todetermine the tips that each individual employee received
and then to use that information to calculate the employer'stotal FICA tax liability. Simplifying the case, the restaurant agreed that "[f]or purpose[s] of this litigation," it would"not dispute the facts, estimates and/or determinations" that
the IRS had "used . . . as a basis for its calculation" of theemployees' "aggregate unreported tip income." App. 35.
And the District Court decided the sole remaining legalquestion--the question of the

statutory authority to esti-mate tip income in the aggregate--in Fior D'Italia's favor.

The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court by avote of 2 to 1, the majority concluding that the IRS is not
legally authorized to use its aggregate estimation method, atleast not without first adopting its own authorizing regulation. In light of differences among the Circuits, compare242 F. 3d 844 (CA9 2001) (case below) with

330 West HubbardRestaurant Corp. v. United States, 203 F. 3d 990, 997 (CA7

States, 118 F. 3d 1526, 1530 (CA11 1997), we granted the Gov-ernment's petition for certiorari. We now reverse.

An "assessment" amounts to an IRS determination that ataxpayer owes the Federal Government a certain amount of

unpaid taxes. It is well established in the tax law that anassessment is entitled to a legal presumption of correctness--a presumption that can help the Government prove itscase against a taxpayer in court. See, e. g., United States v.
Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 440 (1976); Palmer v. IRS, 116 F. 3d1309, 1312 (CA9 1997);

Opinion of the Court
1160 (CA3 1971); United States v. Lease, 346 F. 2d 696, 700(CA2 1965). We consider here the Government's authority to make an assessment in a particular way, namely, bydirectly estimating the aggregate tips that a restaurant's
employees have received rather than estimating (and thensumming) the tips received by each individual employee.

The Internal Revenue Code says that the IRS, as delegate
of the Secretary of Treasury,

"is authorized and required to make the inquiries, deter-minations, and

assessments of all taxes . . . which have
not been duly paid . . . ." 26 U. S. C. $ 6201(a) (empha-sis added).

This provision, by granting the IRS assessment authority,must simultaneously grant the IRS power to decide

how to
make that assessment--at least within certain limits. Andthe courts have consistently held that those limits are not

exceeded when the IRS estimates an individual's tax liabil-ity--as long as the method used to make the estimate is a
"reasonable" one. See, e. g., Erickson v. Commissioner, 937F. 2d 1548, 1551 (CA10 1991) (estimate made with reference
to taxpayer's purchasing record was "presumptively correct"
when based on "reasonable foundation"). See also Janis,

Fior D'Italia does not challenge this basic principle of law.Rather, it seeks to explain why this principle should not
apply here, or why it should not determine the outcome ofthis case in the Government's favor.

A
Fior D'Italia's primary argument rests upon the statutethat imposes the FICA tax. It points out that the tax law

says there is "imposed on every employer" an "excise tax"calculated on the basis of "wages . . . paid by him" as those
"wages" are "defined in" $ 3121. $$ 3111(a), (b). It addsthat the subsection of $ 3121 which specifies that "wages"
includes tips (subsection q) refers to "tips" as those "receivedby

an employee in the course of his employment," i. e., totips received by each employee individually. (Emphasis

added.) Fior D'Italia emphasizes $ 3121(q)'s reference to theemployee in the singular to conclude that the "employer's
liability for FICA taxes therefore attaches to each of theseindividual payments, not when they are later summed and
reported." Brief for Respondent 28 (emphasis in original).In our view Fior D'Italia's linguistic argument makes too
much out of too little. The language it finds key, the words"tips received by an employee," is contained in a definitional
section, $ 3121(q), not in the sections that impose the tax,$$ 3111(a), (b). The definitional section speaks in the singular. It says that an employee's (singular) tips "shall be con-sidered remuneration" for purposes of the latter, tax imposing sections. $ 3121(q). But the latter operational sectionsspeak in the plural. They impose on employers a FICA tax
calculated as a percentage of the "wages" (plural) paid to"individuals" (plural) by the employer "with respect to employment." $$ 3111(a), (b). The operational sections conse-quently impose liability for the

totality of the "wages" thatthe employer pays, which totality of "wages," says the defi536US1 Unit: $U67 [01-14-04 18:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
nitional section, shall include the tips that each individual
employee earns. It is as if a tax were imposed on "all of a
restaurant's dishes," with a definitional section specifying
that "dishes" shall "include each customer's silverware."
We simply do not see how this kind of language, taken as
a whole, argues against use of an aggregate estimation
method that seeks to determine the restaurant's total FICA
tax liability.

B

The Ninth Circuit relied in part upon two other statutory
provisions. The first, 26 U. S. C. $ 446(b), has been interpreted to authorize the IRS to use methods of estimation
for determining income tax liability. See, e. g., Mendelson,
supra, at 521-522 (authorizing estimate of waitress' gross
receipts). The court felt this provision negatively implies
a lack of IRS authority to use the aggregate estimation
method in respect to other taxes, such as employer FICA
taxes, where no such provision applies. 242 F. 3d, at 849.
The second, 26 U. S. C. $ 6205(a)(1), authorizes the Secretary
to adopt regulations that prescribe mechanisms for employers to adjust FICA tax liability. The court felt this provision negatively implies a lack of IRS authority to use an aggregate estimation method in the absence of a regulation.
242 F. 3d, at 851.

After examining the statutes, however, we cannot find any
negative implication. The first says that, where a taxpayer
has used "a method of accounting" that "does not clearly reflect income," or has used "no method of accounting" at all,
"the computation of taxable income shall be made under such
method as, in the opinion of the Secretary, does clearly reflect income." $ 446(b). This provision applies to only one
corner of income tax law, and even within that corner it says
nothing about any particular method of calculation. To read
it negatively would significantly limit IRS authority in that
respect both within and outside the field of income tax law.

536US1 Unit: $U67 [01-14-04 18:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
246 UNITED STATES v. FIOR D'ITALIA, INC.

Opinion of the Court
And there is simply no reason to believe that Congress in-tended any such limitation.

Section 6205(a)(1) refers to certain employment taxes,including FICA taxes, and says that when an employer
initially pays "less than the correct amount of tax," then"proper adjustments . . . shall be made, without interest," in
accordance with "regulations." The IRS has made clearthat this provision refers to an employer's "adjustments,"
say, in an initially underreported tax liability, made beforethe IRS has assessed an underpayment. See generally 26
CFR $ 31.6205-1 (2001). Again, there is simply no reason tobelieve that Congress, in writing this provision applicable to
a small corner of tax law, intended, through negative implica-tion, to limit the IRS' general power to assess tax deficiencies. Indeed, Fior D'Italia has not advanced in this Courteither "negative implication" argument relied on by the
Ninth Circuit. C

Fior D'Italia next points to several features of an "aggre-gate" estimate that, in its view, make it "unreasonable" (and
therefore contrary to law) for the IRS to use that method.First, it notes that an aggregate estimate will sometimes include tips that should not count in calculating the FICA taxthe employer owes. The law excludes an employee's tips
from the FICA wages base insofar as those tips amount toless than $20 in a month. 26 U. S. C. $ 3121(a)(12)(B). It
also excludes the portion of tips and other wages (includ-ing fixed salary) an employee receives that rises above a
certain annual level--$53,400 in 1991 and $55,500 in 1992.$ 3121(a)(1); 242 F. 3d, at 846, n. 4. These ceilings mean that
if a waiter earns, say, $36,000 in fixed salary, reports $20,000in tips, and fails to report $10,000 in tips, the restaurant
would not owe additional taxes, because the waiter's re-ported income ($56,000) already exceeds the FICA ceiling.
But if that waiter earns $36,000 in fixed salary, reports$10,000 in tips, and fails to report another $10,000 in tips,

536US1 Unit: $U67 [01-14-04 18:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

247Cite as: 536 U. S. 238 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
the restaurant would owe additional taxes on the unreportedamount, because the waiter's reported income of $46,000 falls

below the FICA ceiling.Second, Fior D'Italia points out that an aggregate calculation based on credit card slips can overstate the aggregateamount of tips because it fails to account for the possibilities
that: (1) customers who pay cash tend to leave a lower percentage of the bill as a tip; (2) some customers "stiff " thewaiter, leaving no tip at all; (3) some customers write a high

tip on the credit card slip, but ask for some cash back, leavinga net lower amount; and (4) some restaurants deduct the
credit card company fee from the tip, leaving the employees
with a lower net amount.

Fior D'Italia adds that these potential errors can make an
enormous difference to a restaurant, for restaurant profits
are often low, while the tax is high. Brief for Respondent
9-10, n. 6 (asserting that an assessment for unreported tips
for all years since employer FICA tax provision was enacted
would amount to two years' total profits). Indeed, the restaurant must pay this tax on the basis of amounts that the
restaurant itself cannot control, for the restaurant's customers, not the restaurant itself, determine the level of tips.
Fior D'Italia concludes that the IRS should avoid these problems by resting its assessment upon individual calculations
of employee tip earnings, and argues that the IRS' failure to
do so will always result in an overstatement of tax liability,
rendering any assessment that results from aggregate estimates unreasonable and outside the limits of any delegated
IRS authority.

In our view, these considerations do not show that the IRS'
aggregate estimating method falls outside the bounds of
what is reasonable. It bears repeating that in this litigation,
Fior D'Italia stipulated that it would not challenge the particular IRS calculation as inaccurate. Absent such a stipulation, a taxpayer would remain free to present evidence that
an assessment is inaccurate in a particular case. And we do

536US1 Unit: $U67 [01-14-04 18:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
248 UNITED STATES v. FIOR D'ITALIA, INC.

Opinion of the Court
not accept Fior D'Italia's claim that restaurants are unableto do so--that they "simply do not have the information to

dispute" the IRS assessment. Tr. of Oral Arg. 36. Whydoes a restaurant owner not know, or why is that owner unable to find out: how many busboys or other personnel workfor only a day or two--thereby likely earning less than $20
in tips; how many employees were likely to have earnedmore than $55,000 or so in 1992; how much less cash-paying
customers tip; how often they "stiff " waiters or ask for acash refund; and whether the restaurant owner deducts a
credit card charge of, say 3%, from employee tips? Afterall, the restaurant need not prove these matters with precision. It need only demonstrate that use of the aggregatemethod in the particular case has likely produced an inaccurate result. And in doing so, it may well be able to convincea judge to insist upon a more accurate formula. See

, e. g.,Erickson, 937 F. 2d, at 1551 ("Some reasonable foundation

for the assessment is necessary to preserve the presumptionof correctness" (emphasis in original)).

Nor has Fior D'Italia convinced us that individualized em-ployee assessments will inevitably lead to a more "reasonable" assessment of employer liability than an aggregate es-timate. After all, individual audits will be plagued by some
of the same inaccuracies Fior D'Italia attributes to theaggregate estimation method, because they are, of course,
based on estimates themselves. See, e. g., Mendelson, 305F. 2d, at 521-522;

McQuatters v. Commissioner, 32 TCM1122 (1973), || 73,240 P-H Memo TC. Consequently, we cannot find that the aggregate method is, as a general matter,so unreasonable as to violate the law.

D
Fior D'Italia also mentions an IRS regulation that it be-lieves creates a special problem of fairness when taken

together with the "aggregate" assessment method. Thatregulation says that an employer, when calculating its FICA

536US1 Unit: $U67 [01-14-04 18:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

249Cite as: 536 U. S. 238 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
tax, must "include wages received by an employee in theform of tips

only to the extent of the tips reported . . . to
the employer." 26 CFR $ 31.6011(a)-1(a) (2001) (emphasisadded). How, then, asks Fior D'Italia, could the employer

have calculated tax on a different amount, namely: (1) theamount of tips "reported"; plus (2) the amount of tips

received but not reported? Indeed, Fior D'Italia itself did not
do so initially, presumably because this regulation said itshould not do so. See Brief for Respondent 16-17. And, if

it should not do so, is it not seriously unfair for the IRS laterto assess against it a tax deficiency based on this latter figure? "[T]here is no practical or legally authorized way,"
Fior D'Italia complains, for the restaurant to include the additional amount of tips for which the IRS might later seek
tax payment. Id., at 16.

The statute itself, however, responds to this concern. It
says that, insofar as tips were received but not reported to
the employer, that remuneration (i. e., the unreported tips)
shall not be deemed to have been paid by the employer until
"the date on which notice and demand for such taxes is made
to the employer by the Secretary." 26 U. S. C. $ 3121(q).
This provision makes clear that it is not unfair or illegal to
assess a tax deficiency on the unreported tips, for penalties
will not attach and interest will not accrue unless the IRS
actually demands the money and the restaurant refuses subsequently to pay the amount demanded in a timely fashion.
See generally Rev. Rul. 95-7, 1995-4 I. R. B. 44. Indeed,
the statute (and its accompanying Revenue Ruling) contemplates both a restaurant that does not police employee tip
reporting and a later assessment based on unreported tips.
It makes clear that, at most, such a restaurant would have
to create a reserve for potential later tax liability. Although
the reporting scheme may place restaurants in an awkward
position, the Tax Code seems to contemplate that position;
and its bookkeeping awkwardness consequently fails to support the argument that aggregate estimation is unlawful.

250 UNITED STATES v. FIOR D'ITALIA, INC.

Opinion of the Court

E
Finally, Fior D'Italia suggests that the IRS is putting its"aggregate estimate" method to improper use. It traces a

lengthy history of disagreement among restaurant workers,restaurant owners, and the IRS as to how best to enforce
the restaurants' legal obligation to pay FICA taxes on unre-ported tip income. It notes that the IRS has agreed to create a special program, called the "Tip Reporting AlternativeCommitment," whereby a restaurant promises to establish
accurate tip reporting procedures in return for an IRS prom-ise to base FICA tax liability on reported tips alone. It
adds that any coercion used to force a restaurant to entersuch a program (often unpopular with employees) would conflict with the views of Members of Congress and IRS offi-cials, who have said that a restaurant should not be held
responsible for its employees' failure to report all their tipsas income. See, e. g., Letter of Members of Congress to Secretary of Treasury Lloyd Bentsen, 32 Tax Analysts' DailyTax Highlights & Documents 3913 (Mar. 4, 1994); App. 106,
107. It adds that Congress has enacted this view into twospecial laws: the first of which gives restaurants a nonrefundable tax credit on FICA taxes paid, i. e., permits restaurantsto offset any FICA it pays on employee tips on a dollar for
dollar basis against its own income tax liability, 26 U. S. C.$ 45B; and the second of which prohibits the IRS from
"threaten[ing] to audit" a restaurant in order to "coerce" itinto entering the special tip-reporting program. Internal
Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998,112 Stat. 755.

Fior D'Italia says that the IRS' recent use of an "aggre-gate estimate" approach runs contrary to the understanding
that underlies this second statute, for it "effectively forcesthe employer into . . . verifying, investigating, monitoring,
and policing compliance by its employees--responsibilitieswhich Congress and the Courts have considered, evaluated,
and steadfastly refused to transfer from IRS to the em536US1 Unit: $U67 [01-14-04 18:30:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN

251Cite as: 536 U. S. 238 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
ployer." Brief for Respondent 9. And it suggests that theIRS intends to use a legal victory here as a "threat," say, to

reopen back tax years, in order to require restaurant owners"to force" their "employees to report" all tips.

Id., at 14.
Why else, asks Fior D'Italia, would the IRS bring this case?After all, given the dollar for dollar FICA/ income tax setoff,

this case may not even produce revenue for the Government.

Fior D'Italia's "abuse of power" argument, however, doesnot constitute a ground for holding unlawful the IRS' use of

aggregate estimates. Even if we assume, for argument'ssake, that an improper motive could render unlawful the use
of a statutorily permissible enforcement method in certain
circumstances, cf. United States v. Powell, 379 U. S. 48, 58
(1964), we note that Fior D'Italia has not demonstrated that
the IRS has acted illegally in this case. Instead it has presented a general claim to the effect that the aggregate estimation method lends itself to abusive agency action. But
we cannot find agency action unreasonable in all cases simply
because of a general possibility of abuse--a possibility that
exists in respect to many discretionary enforcement powers.
Cf. Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U. S. 821, 831 (1985).

The statutes and congressional documents that protect
restaurants from onerous monitoring requirements consequently do not support Fior D'Italia's argument that aggregate estimates are statutorily prohibited. For example, the
Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act
prohibits the IRS from "threaten[ing] to audit" restaurants
as a means to "coerce" them into policing employee tip reporting, supra, at 250, but Fior D'Italia does not claim that
the IRS has violated this statute. Nor, for that matter, has
Fior D'Italia presented evidence that this particular litigation would fail to yield revenue to the Government (due to
the availability of the FICA tax credit), or convincingly explained, even if so, why that fact, while making the case unremunerative, would automatically make it improper. And
while other documents show that Congress has expressed

concern regarding a restaurant's difficulty in trying to su-pervise its employees' reporting of their tips, they do not

suggest that the aggregate estimate method is an unreason-able way of ascertaining unpaid FICA taxes for which the
employer is indisputably liable (particularly when one re-calls that the taxpayer generally remains free to challenge
the accuracy of the calculation at issue, even though thistaxpayer has waived its right to do so). Rather, as we have
shown, the relevant Code provisions and case law sup-port the use of aggregate estimates. See

supra, at 242-244, 248-249.

We conclude that Fior D'Italia's discussion of IRS "abuse"is insufficient to show that the agency's use of aggregate estimates is prohibited by law. In saying this, we recognizethat Fior D'Italia remains free to make its policy-related
arguments to Congress. III

For these reasons, and because Fior D'Italia has stipulatedthat it does not challenge the accuracy of the IRS assessment
in this case, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is

Reversed.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The Court holds that the Internal Revenue Service's statu-tory authorization to make assessments for unpaid taxes is

reasonably read to cover a restaurateur's FICA taxes basedon an aggregate estimate of all unreported employee tips.
I believe that reading the statute so broadly saddles employ-ers with a burden unintended by Congress, and I respectfully dissent. I

Taxes on earned income imposed by the Federal InsuranceContributions Act (FICA) pay for employees' benefits under
the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 622, as amended, 42 U. S. C.

$ 401 et seq. (1994 ed. and Supp. V). In the simplest case,the employee is taxed on what he receives, and the employer

is taxed on what he pays. See 26 U. S. C. $$ 3101, 3111.For a long time, an employee's income from tips was not recognized as remuneration paid by the employer, and the cor-responding FICA tax was imposed only on the employee.
See Social Security Amendments of 1965, $ 313(c), 79 Stat.
382. In 1987, however, the Internal Revenue Code wasamended to treat tip income within the remuneration on

which the employer, too, is taxed, 26 U. S. C. $ 3121(q), andthat is the present law.

The scheme is simple. The tips are includible in the
employee's wages. The employee must report the amount
of taxable tip income to the employer. $ 6053(a). "[L]arge
food or beverage establishment[s]" must pass on that information to the Internal Revenue Service, $ 6053(c)(1), and
must also report the total amount of tips shown on credit
card slips, ibid. The employer is subject to tax on the same
amount of tip income listed on an employee's report to him
and in turn reported by him to the IRS. For both the employer and the employee, however, taxable tip income is limited to income within what is known as the "wage band";
there is no tax on tips that amount to less than $20 in a
given month, or on total remuneration in excess of the Social
Security wage base ($53,400 and $55,500, respectively, in the
years relevant to this case).

Because many employees report less tip income than they
receive, their FICA taxes and their employers' matching
amounts are less than they would be in a world of complete
reporting. The IRS has chosen to counter dishonesty on the
part of restaurant employees not by moving directly against
them, but by going against their employers with assessments
of unpaid FICA taxes based on an estimate of all tip income
paid to all employees aggregated together. The Court finds
these aggregated assessments authorized by the general provision for assessments of unpaid taxes, $ 6201, which benefits

United States v. Janis, 428 U. S. 433, 440 (1976).1 The practice of assessing FICA taxes against an employer on estimated aggregate tip income, however, raises anomaly after
anomaly, to the point that one has to suspect that the Government's practice is wrong. An appreciation of these consequences, in fact, calls for a reading of the crucial provision,
26 U. S. C. $ 3121(q), in a straightforward way, which bars
aggregate assessments and the anomalies that go with them.

II

A

The Social Security scheme of benefits and the FICA tax
funding it have been characterized as a kind of "social insurance," Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 609 (1960), in which
employers and employees contribute matching amounts.
Compare 26 U. S. C. $ 3101 with $ 3111. The payments that
beneficiaries are entitled to receive are determined by the
records of their wages earned. Nestor, supra, at 608.

Notwithstanding this basic structure, the IRS's aggregate
estimation method creates a disjunction between amounts
presumptively owed by an employer and those owed by an
employee. It creates a comparable disproportion between
the employer's tax and the employee's ultimate benefits,
since an aggregate assessment does nothing to revise the
earnings records of the individual employees for whose benefit the taxes are purportedly collected.2 Thus, from the outset, the aggregate assessment fits poorly with the design of
the system.

1 In 1998, Congress altered the burdens of proof for tax cases, but the
changes do not implicate FICA. See 26 U. S. C. $ 7491(a).

2 Although the scheme does not create a vested right to benefits in any

employee, see Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 608-611 (1960), the legislative choice to tie benefits to earnings history evinces a general intent to
create a rough parity between taxes paid and benefits received.

B
As the majority acknowledges, the next problem is thatthe aggregate estimation necessarily requires the use of generalized assumptions for calculating such estimates, and theassumptions actually used tend to inflate liability. In the
first place, while the IRS's assumption that many employeesare underreporting is indisputably sound, the assumption
that every patron is not only tipping, but tipping 14.49% in1991 and 14.29% in 1992, is probably not. Those percentages
are based on two further assumptions: that patrons who paywith credit cards tip at the same rate as patrons who pay in
cash, and that all patrons use the tip line of the credit cardslip for tips, rather than to obtain cash. But what is most
significant is that the IRS's method of aggregate estimationignores the wage band entirely, assuming that all tips are
subject to FICA tax, although this is not true in law, andcertainly not always the case in fact.

C
The tendency of the Government's aggregation method tooverestimate liability might not count much against it if it

were fair to expect employers to keep the reports that wouldcarry their burden to refute any contested assessment based
on an aggregate estimate. But it is not fair.Obviously, the only way an employer can refute probable
inflation by estimate is to keep track of every employee'stips,

ante, at 248, and at first blush, there might seem nothingunusual about expecting employers to do this.

3 The Code

3 Of course, even the IRS has not explained the precise manner in which
the employer is expected to generate such records. Before the Court of
Appeals, the IRS argued that the employer could require employees to
pool all tips, and thereby keep track of them. See 242 F. 3d 844, 848, n. 6
(CA9 2001). The court properly rejected this contention as "alter[ing]
the way a restaurant does business . . . . It would be akin to saying that
a restaurant must charge a fixed service charge in lieu of tips." Ibid.
Before this Court, the IRS instead argued that "every employer should

Souter, J., dissenting
imposes a general obligation upon all taxpayers to keep rec-ords relevant to their liability according to regulations promulgated by the Secretary, 26 U. S. C. $ 6001, and, for themost part, the courts have viewed the burden on taxpayers
to maintain such records as reasonable and, hence, as thejustification for requiring taxpayers to disprove IRS estimates; the taxpayer who fails to attend to $ 6001 has onlyhimself to blame. See,

e. g., Kikalos v. Commissioner, 190F. 3d 791, 792, n. 1 (CA7 1999); Cracchiola v. Commissioner,

643 F. 2d 1383, 1385 (CA9 1981); Meneguzzo v. Commis-sioner, 43 T. C. 824, 831 (1965).

4 But the first blush ignores

the one feature of $ 6001 relevant here. The provision statesa single, glaring exception: employers need not keep records

"in connection with charged tips" other than "charge re-ceipts, records necessary to comply with section 6053(c), and
copies of statements furnished by employees under section6053(a)." Ibid. Employers are expressly excused from any
effort to determine whether employees are properly report-ing their tips; the Code tells them that they need not keep
the information specific to each employee that would be nec-essary to determine if any tips fell short of the estimates or
outside the wage band.5 Presumably because of this statuhire reliable people who they can trust to follow the rules." The official
transcript records "Laughter." Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.

4 Such is in keeping with the general rule that burdens shift to those

with peculiar knowledge of the relevant facts. Campbell v. United States,
365 U. S. 85, 96 (1961) ("[T]he ordinary rule . . . does not place the burden
upon a litigant of establishing facts peculiarly within the knowledge of his
adversary"); National Communications Assn. v. AT&T Corp., 238 F. 3d
124, 130 (CA2 2001) ("[A]ll else being equal, the burden is better placed on
the party with easier access to relevant information"); 9 J. Wigmore, Evidence $ 2486, p. 290 (J. Chadbourn rev. ed. 1981) ("[T]he burden of proving
a fact is said to be put on the party who presumably has peculiar means
of knowledge" (emphasis deleted)).

5 The statute refers only to charged tips, rather than cash tips, but the

IRS does not dispute that the employer has no obligation to keep any
records beyond those specifically required under 26 U. S. C. $ 6053, and the
IRS's regulations on the subject do not impose any requirements with

tory exception, the Secretary's regulations regarding em-ployer recordkeeping do not impose any obligations beyond

those mentioned in $ 6001. See 26 CFR $ 31.6001-5 (2001)(describing required records). This absolution from recordkeeping is mirrored by the fact that tips are uniquely ex-cepted from the general rule that remuneration must be reported in W-2 statements. See 26 U. S. C. $ 6041(e). Theupshot is that Congress has enacted a singular exception to
the duty to keep records that would allow any ready wageband determinations or other checks on estimates, while the
aggregate assessment practice of the IRS virtually reads theexception out of the Code.

The majority doubts that there is any practical differencebetween determining the liability of one employee, very possibly with an estimation similar to the one used here, andestimating the aggregate amount for an employer.

Ante, at248. But determinations limited to an individual employee

will necessarily be more tailored, if only by taking the wageband into account. In fact, any such determination would
occur in consequence of some audit of the employee, whowould have an incentive to divulge information to contest
the IRS's figures where possible, and generate the verypaper trail an employer would need to contest liability while
availing himself of the exception in $ 6001.

D
The strangeness of combining a statute excusing employ-ers from recordkeeping with an administrative practice of

respect to cash tips. See 26 CFR $ 31.6001-5 (2001). Moreover, it would
be irrational to read 26 U. S. C. $ 6001 to require an employer to keep
detailed records only of cash tips, while, for example, being relieved of the
burden to record which employees received which charged tips, or
whether the tip space was used for something other than tips, or how
employees allocated charged tips amongst themselves via the process of
"tipping out" (sharing tips with supporting waitstaff who do not receive
their own tips, such as bartenders and hosts).

Souter, J., dissenting
making probably inflated assessments stands out even more
starkly in light of the eccentric route the Government has to
follow in a case like this in order to benefit from the presumption of correctness that an aggregate assessment carries. Under the general authorization to make assessments,
26 U. S. C. $ 6201, on which the Government relies, any assessment is preceded by liability for taxes. $ 6201(a) ("The
Secretary is authorized . . . to make the inquiries, determinations, and assessments of all taxes . . . which have not been
duly paid . . ."); ante, at 242 ("An `assessment' amounts to an
IRS determination that a taxpayer owes the Federal Government a certain amount of unpaid taxes"). After, but only
after, assessment can the IRS take the further step of issuing notice and demand for the unpaid taxes assessed, $ 6303,
so as to authorize the IRS to levy upon the taxpayer's property, or impose liens, $$ 6321, 6331.

In the case of an employer's liability for FICA taxes on
tips, however, this sequence cannot be followed if the employee does not report the tips to the employer in the first
place, for it is the report, not the employee's receipt of the
tips, that raises the employer's liability to pay the FICA tax.
The employer may know from the credit slips that the employees' reports are egregiously inaccurate (wage band or no
wage band), but the employer is still liable only on what the
employee declares. In fact, the effect of $ 6053(c) is such
that employers cannot help but know when underreporting
is severe, since they are required to give the IRS a summary
of the amount of reported tips and the amount of charged
tips. Nonetheless, the employer remains liable solely for
taxes on the reported tips.6

6 In fact, the obligation to report charged tips was imposed before employers had any FICA tax obligation beyond tips that substituted for minimum wage, and the reporting obligations of $ 6053(c) were devised to assist
the IRS in its collections efforts against employees, despite the IRS's use
of it here as a basis for auditing Fior D'Italia.

Souter, J., dissenting
Indeed, even if the employer, seeing a disparity, paid extraFICA taxes on the assumption that the employees had underreported tips, the extra payment would be treated as anoverpayment. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8; Jones v. Liberty Glass
Co., 332 U. S. 524, 531 (1947) (overpayment is "any paymentin excess of that which is properly due"). The overall implication is that employers are meant to pay taxes based onspecific information provided by others. As a practical matter, the tips themselves are not the true basis for liability;instead, it is an employee report that creates the obligation.

Some event must therefore trigger liability for taxes on
unreported tips before the IRS can make the assessment,and this event turns out to be the notice and demand for

which $ 3121(q) makes special provision in such a case.7Only after notice and demand can the Government proceed
to assessment under $ 6201. Whereas the usual sequence isassessment, then notice and demand, see $ 6303, here it is
notice and demand, then assessment.

The IRS does not dispute this. It concedes that it doesnot rely upon $ 6201 before issuing the notice, see Reply

Brief for United States 15-16, but instead performs a "pre-assessment" estimate (for which, incidentally, no statutory
authorization exists). Then it issues notice and (liabilityhaving now attached) uses the same estimate for the official
assessment under $ 6201.Again, at first blush, it is tempting to say that the sequence of events may be unusual, but under the aggregateassessment practice the employer-taxpayer ends up in the
same position he would have been in if he failed to pay FICAtaxes on reported tips. But there are two very significant

7 The majority takes note of this unusual scheme, but finds significance
only in the fact that until notice issues (and liability arises), interest does
not run. Ante, at 249. But to interpret the statute as nothing more
than a method of preventing the running of interest avoids the significance
of $ 3121(q), because there is already a statute that prevents interest running on unpaid FICA taxes. $ 6205(a)(1).

differences. It is true that the employer who is delinquentas to reported tips ends up subject to liability on the basis of

third-party action (the employee's report) which assessmentinvests with a presumption of correctness, and which notice
and demand then make a basis for possible liens and levies.But in that case the employer's liability, and exposure to collection mechanisms, is subject to the important safeguard ofthe employee's report. Whatever the employee may do, it
will not be in his interest to report more tips than he re-ceived, exposing himself (and, incidentally, his employer) to
extra taxation. But this safeguard is entirely lost to theemployer, through no fault of his own, if the Government can
make aggregate assessments. The innocent employer hasfew records and no protection derived from the employee's
interest. Yet without any such protection he is, on the Gov-ernment's theory, immediately liable for the consequences of
notice and demand at the very instant liability arises.The second difference goes to the authority for estimating
liability. The IRS finds this authority implicit in $ 6201,which authorizes assessments. Ante, at 243. In the usual
case, the estimate is thus made in calculating the assessment,which occurs after the event that creates the liability being
estimated and assessed. But in the case of the tips un-reported by the employee, there would be no liability until
notice and demand is made under $ 3121(q), and it is con-sequently at this point that the estimate is required. The
upshot is that the estimate has to occur before the statuteclaimed to authorize it, $ 6201, is even applicable. That is,
the IRS says it can estimate because it can assess, and it canassess because it can previously estimate. Reasoning this
circular may warrant suspicion.

E
There is one more source of suspicion. In 1993, Congressenacted an income tax credit for certain employers in the

amount of FICA taxes paid on tips in excess of the minimum

wage. 26 U. S. C. $ 45B. The existence of the credit createsa peculiar scheme, for unless we are to assume that restaurateurs are constantly operating on the knife-edge of solvency,never able to use the credit (even with its 20-year carryforward, see $ 39), the IRS has little reason to expect to gainmuch from the employer-taxpayer; the collection effort will
probably result in no net benefit to the Government (except,perhaps, as an interest-free loan).

8 And because, as noted,

the aggregate method chosen by the IRS will not affect indi-vidual employees' wage-earning records, the estimates do

not even play much of a bookkeeping role. There is some-thing suspect, then, in the IRS's insistence on conducting
audits of employers, without corresponding audits of employ-ees, for the purpose of collecting FICA taxes that will ultimately be refunded, that do not increase the accuracy of indi-vidual earnings records, and probably overestimate the true
amount of taxable earnings.In fact, the only real advantage to the IRS seems to be
that the threat of audit, litigation, and immediate liabilitymay well force employers to assume the job of monitoring
their employees' tips to ensure accurate reporting. But ifthat explanation for the Government's practice makes sense
of it, it also flips the Government from the frying pan intothe fire. Congress has previously stymied every attempt
the IRS has made to impose such a burden on employers.In the days when employers were responsible only for withholding the employee's share of the FICA tax, the IRS at-tempted to force employers to include tip income on W-2
forms; this effort was blocked when Congress modified 26U. S. C. $ 6041 to exclude tip income expressly from the W-2
requirements. See Revenue Act of 1978, $ 501(b), 92 Stat.2878. When the IRS interpreted the credit available under

8 At oral argument, the Government contended that the payment of
the FICA tax, coupled with the $ 45B credit, benefited its accounting by
permitting payments to be appropriately allocated between the Social
Security trust fund and general revenue. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 20-21.

$ 45B to apply only to tips reported by the employee pursuant to 26 U. S. C. $ 6053(a), Congress overruled the IRS and
clarified that the credit would apply to all FICA taxes paid
on tips above those used to satisfy the employer's minimum
wage obligations. See Small Business Job Protection Act
of 1996, Pub. L. 104-188, $ 1112(a), 110 Stat. 1759. Finally,
when the IRS developed its Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment (TRAC) program, ante, at 250, Congress forbade
the IRS from "threaten[ing] to audit any taxpayer in an attempt to coerce the taxpayer" into participating. Internal
Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998,

$ 3414, 112 Stat. 755.9 And although the use of a threatened
aggregate estimate (after an audit) to induce monitoring of
employee tips may not technically run afoul of that statute,
it is difficult to imagine that Congress would allow the aggregation practice as a lever on employers, when it forbade the
use of an audit for the same purpose.

9 To some extent, the modification of the $ 45B credit and TRAC may be
taken as congressional awareness of the IRS's practice of making aggregate assessments. After all, there is no need to clarify that $ 45B is available for taxes on unreported tips unless such taxes are, in fact, being
paid, and the TRAC program itself depends on the existence of aggregate
assessments, because the "carrot" offered to employers to encourage participation is the IRS's promise to refrain from such assessments.

With respect to $ 45B, however, prior to Congress's modifications, the
IRS regulations did not allow for the credit even when an individual employee was assessed and corresponding notice and demand issued to the
employer. See 58 Fed. Reg. 68033 (1993) (temporary regulation $ 1.45B-
1T). Thus, Congress's clarification did not depend on the existence of aggregate assessments. As for TRAC, at the time that Congress prohibited
the IRS from coercing participation, the IRS had actually halted the aggregate assessment practice. See Director, Office of Employment Tax
Administration and Compliance, Memorandum for Regional Chief Compliance Officers (June 16, 1998), App. 106-107. Moreover, the simple (and
realistic) answer is just that Congress did as asked; restaurateurs complained about a specific practice, i. e., threatened audits, and Congress
responded with a targeted statute.

Consider an alternative. I have noted already that eventhe Government tacitly acknowledges the crucial role of

$ 3121(q), the source of its authority to issue notice and de-mand, without which there is no liability on the employer's
part for FICA taxes on unreported tips and thus no possibil-ity of assessment under $ 6201. It makes sense, then, to understand the scope of authority to make the assessment asbeing limited by the scope of the authority to issue notice
and demand, and it likewise makes sense to pay close atten-tion to the text of that authorization.

The special provision in $ 3121(q) for notice and demandagainst an employer says nothing and suggests nothing
about aggregate assessments. It reads that when an em-ployer was furnished "no statement including such tips" or
was given an "inaccurate or incomplete" one, the remunera-tion in the form of "such tips" shall be treated as if paid on
the date notice and demand is made to the employer."[S]uch tips" are described as "tips received by an employee
in the course of his employment." Ibid. Thus, by itsterms, the statute provides for notice and demand for the
tax on the tips of "an employee," not on the tips of "em-ployees" or "all employees" aggregated together. And, of
course, if notice and demand is limited to taxes on tips of "anemployee," that is the end of aggregate estimates.

It is true that under the Dictionary Act, 1 U. S. C. $ 1, a
statutory provision in the singular may include the pluralwhere that would work in the context. "[A]n employee"

could cover "employees" and the notice and demand couldcover tips received during "their employment," "unless the
context indicates otherwise," ibid. But here the contextdoes indicate otherwise. The anomalies I have pointed out
occur when the singular "employee" in $ 3121(q) is read toinclude the plural, which in turn is crucial to allowing aggregate notice, demand, and assessment; and it turns out that

Souter, J., dissenting
reading the statute to refer only to a particular employee'stips and limiting notice, demand, and assessment accordingly,

goes far to abridge the catalog of oddities that come with theGovernment's position.

First, sticking to the singular means that the employerwill not be assessed more tax than the employee himself
should pay; whether or not the employee is sued for a like
amount, the respective liabilities of employer and employeewill be restored to parity. And by keying the employer's

liability to a particular employee, the near certainty of over-assessment will be replaced with a likelihood of an accurate
assessment taking into consideration the wage band of taxability under FICA.

Second, the fact that the employer has exercised his express, statutory option to decline to keep tipping records on
his work force will no longer place him at such an immediate
disadvantage. It will be relatively easy to discover the
basis for the tax calculation in a particular instance.

Third, if indeed the Government first establishes the employee's liability for unreported tips, notice and demand
under $ 3121(q) will then serve what on its face seems to be
its obvious purpose, to provide the employer with reliable
information, like the employee tip reports that similarly trigger liability, so that the employer will have no further need
for keeping track of employee tips. Although this is not the
time to decide whether the IRS must formally audit the employee's own tax liability first, there is at least one reason to
think Congress assumed that it would. There is no statute
of limitations on an employer's FICA tax liability for unreported tips (because the statute does not run until after

liability attaches, and no time limits are imposed upon the
issuance of the notice that triggers liability). But there is
a statute of limitations for assessments against employees.
26 U. S. C. $ 6501. Conditioning the employer's liability on
a parallel obligation of the employee would in effect place a
limitation period on the employer's exposure.

Finally, of course, the tension with Congress's admonitionthat the IRS not "threaten to audit any taxpayer in an attempt to coerce the taxpayer" into participating in TRAC,112 Stat. 755, will be eliminated. If the employer is liable
only after an individual employee's delinquency has been cal-culated, the use of mass assessments to force an employer,
in self-defense, to institute TRAC will simply vanish.Thus, the context establishes that a singular reading is the
one that makes sense by eliminating the eccentricities en-tailed by the aggregate reading, some of which seem unfair
to employer taxpayers. Of course, this means that the prob-lem of underreporting tips will be harder to solve, but it
seems clear that Congress did not mean to solve it by allow-ing the IRS to use its assessment power to shift the problem
to employers. I would therefore affirm the judgment of theNinth Circuit.

HORN, COMMISSIONER, PENNSYLVANIA DEPART-MENT OF CORRECTIONS,

et al. v. BANKS

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the third circuit

No. 01-1385. Decided June 17, 2002
A Pennsylvania trial court sentenced respondent to death on each of his

12 convictions of first-degree murder. The verdict form in the trial's
penalty phase required, in relevant part, the jury to check a box indicating that it found unanimously either at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or one or more aggravating
circumstances outweighing any mitigating circumstances. The jury
marked the latter box. After respondent's direct appeal was denied,
this Court held that the Constitution prohibits a State from requiring
jurors unanimously to agree that a particular mitigating circumstance
exists before they may consider that circumstance in their sentencing
determination, Mills v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367, 374. In subsequent
state postconviction proceedings, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected respondent's claim that the instructions to the jury and the verdict forms in his case suggested that the mitigating circumstance findings had to be unanimous. In denying his later federal habeas petition,
the District Court did not address whether Mills was retroactive, finding instead the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
(AEDPA) review standard dispositive. The Third Circuit reversed in
part, granting relief under Mills. It found that it did not need to evaluate whether Mills applied retroactively per Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S.
288, because the State Supreme Court had not ruled on retroactivity,
and it found the state court's application of federal law unreasonable
under Mills and Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370.

Held: The Third Circuit erred when it failed to perform a Teague analysis.

Whether to apply the Teague rule--that new constitutional rules of
criminal procedure generally do not apply to cases that became final
before the new rules were announced, 489 U. S., at 310--is a threshold
question in every habeas case. A federal court may decline to apply
Teague if a State does not argue it; but if the State does argue Teague,
the court must apply it before considering the claim's merits. Caspari
v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383. Here, petitioners raised the Teague issue both
in the District Court and in the Third Circuit. To the extent that the
latter court's opinion can be read to imply that AEDPA has changed
Caspari's legal principles, none of this Court's post-AEDPA cases have

Per Curiam
suggested that habeas should automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies
the AEDPA review standard or that AEDPA relieves courts from the
responsibility of addressing properly raised Teague arguments.

Certiorari granted; reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.
The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit granted respondent federal habeas corpus relief from his death sentence. 271 F. 3d 527 (2001). Applying the Antiterrorism
and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) standard
of review,1 the Court of Appeals concluded that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had unreasonably applied federal law
in evaluating respondent's claim that his penalty phase jury
instructions and verdict forms were improper under Mills
v. Maryland, 486 U. S. 367 (1988). The Court of Appeals
found it unnecessary to evaluate whether Mills applies retroactively to cases on habeas review per Teague v. Lane, 489
U. S. 288 (1989), because the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
had not ruled on retroactivity. 271 F. 3d, at 541-543. In
avoiding the Teague issue, the Court of Appeals directly contravened Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383 (1994), in which
we held that federal courts must address the Teague question when it is properly argued by the government. We
thus grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse
the Court of Appeals' determination that a Teague analysis
was unnecessary.2

1 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) was modified by AEDPA and now provides,
in part, that "[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a
person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be
granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in
State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim . . . resulted
in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application
of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court
of the United States."

2 We also grant respondent's motion for leave to proceed in forma

pauperis.

"The sentence you impose will depend upon your find-ings concerning aggravating and mitigating circumstances. The Crime[s] Code in this Commonwealthprovides that the verdict must be a sentence of death

if the jury unanimously finds at least one aggravatingcircumstance and no mitigating circumstance, or if the

jury unanimously finds one or more aggravating circum-stances which outweigh any mitigating circumstance or
circumstances." Commonwealth v. Banks, 540 Pa. 143,
150, 656 A. 2d 467, 470 (1995).

In relevant part, the verdict form required the jury to checka box indicating that "[w]e the jury have found unanimously"

either "[a]t least one aggravating circumstance and no miti-gating circumstances," or "[o]ne or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstance or cir-cumstances." 271 F. 3d, at 549-550. The jury marked the
latter box, and also checked two other boxes indicating the
aggravating circumstance (multiple offenses punishable by atleast life in prison) and mitigating circumstance (extreme

mental or emotional disturbance) that it had found. Re-spondent was sentenced to death on each count of firstdegree murder.After respondent's direct appeal was denied, we decided
Mills, in which we held that the Constitution prohibitsa State from requiring jurors unanimously to agree that a
particular mitigating circumstance exists before they are
permitted to consider that circumstance in their sentencing
determination. 486 U. S., at 374. Subsequently, in state
postconviction proceedings, respondent raised a Mills challenge to the jury instructions and verdict forms in his case,
arguing that they improperly "suggested to the jury that its

on the verdict slips were correct and not impermissibly sug-gestive of a unanimity requirement with respect to mitigating circumstances." Id., at 153, 656 A. 2d, at 471.Respondent petitioned for federal habeas relief, which the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Penn-sylvania denied. 63 F. Supp. 2d 525 (1999). The District
Court rejected respondent's Mills claim on the merits,applying the AEDPA standard of review articulated in 28
U. S. C. $ 2254(d): "Supreme Court precedent . . . did not re-quire an outcome contrary to that reached by the state
courts." 63 F. Supp. 2d, at 544. Because the court foundthe AEDPA standard of review dispositive, it did "not address the parties' arguments concerning the retroactivity of
Mills." Ibid.The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the

District Court in part, granting respondent relief from hisdeath sentence under

Mills. The Court of Appeals firstasked: "Are we compelled to conduct a retroactivity analysis

under Teague?" 271 F. 3d, at 541. It recognized that, perTeague, retroactivity is a " `threshold question,' " but it found
"Teague not to govern [its] analysis" in this case because "wedo not need to focus on anything other than the reasoning
and determination of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court,"which had not ruled on retroactivity. 271 F. 3d, at 541, and
n. 13.3 It rejected petitioners' contention that the statecourt's failure to rule on retroactivity was irrelevant to
whether Teague should apply in federal court:

3 In deciding not to conduct a Teague analysis, the Court of Appeals
"acknowledge[d] further that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has specifically noted its skepticism regarding the retroactive application of
Mills" and has disagreed with the Court of Appeals' resolution of Mills
claims similar to respondent's. 271 F. 3d, at 542.

"Teague teaches that the federal courts habeas corpusproceeding should be reluctant to apply new rules of federal jurisprudence in state court cases decided beforesuch new rules were handed down. Principles of comity and finality counsel that we maintain a circumscribedscope of habeas review. . . Here, however as we have
noted, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court applied Mills.We are examining the application of

Mills, not becausewe wish to impose a new rule not considered by the

Pennsylvania Supreme Court, but as the court in factdid consider and apply it. In such a situation, Teague
is not implicated. Accordingly, we need ask onlywhether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's application
of Mills should be disturbed under the AEDPA stand-ards." 271 F. 3d, at 543 (citation omitted).

Freed from performing a Teague analysis concerningMills' retroactivity, a question which has created some
disagreement among the Federal Circuits,4 the Court ofAppeals asked "whether the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
determination regarding the constitutionality of the instruc-tions, verdict slip, and polling of the jury involved an unreasonable application of Mills." 271 F. 3d, at 544. It thenfound the state court's application of federal law unreasonable under the standards of 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d), relying onboth

Mills and Boyde v. California, 494 U. S. 370 (1990).271 F. 3d, at 551. The Court of Appeals explained that,

"[c]onsidered as a whole, the jury instructions leave no doubtthat `there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents theconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.' " Id., at
549 (quoting Boyde, supra, at 380).

not bar retroactive application of Mills), and Williams v. Dixon, 961 F. 2d

Petitioners seek a writ of certiorari, arguing that theCourt of Appeals erred by not performing a Teague analysis,

by applying Mills retroactively to respondent's case, and byconcluding that the state court's decision was unreasonable
under Mills. We find it unnecessary to resolve the lattertwo of these claims, because we determine that the Court
of Appeals committed a clear error by failing to perform a
Teague analysis.In Teague, we explained that "[u]nless they fall within an

exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules ofcriminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases
which have become final before the new rules are an-nounced." 489 U. S., at 310.

5 And in Caspari, we held that

"[a] threshold question in every habeas case, therefore, iswhether the court is obligated to apply the Teague rule to

the defendant's claim. . . . [A] federal court may, but neednot, decline to apply Teague if the State does not argue it.
But if the State does argue that the defendant seeks thebenefit of a new rule of constitutional law, the court

mustapply Teague before considering the merits of the claim."

510 U. S., at 389 (citations omitted). Here, petitioners raisedthe Teague issue both in the District Court, see 63 F. Supp.
2d, at 544, and in the Court of Appeals, see 271 F. 3d, at542-543. Thus, per Caspari, a case not cited in the opinion
below, it was incumbent upon the Court of Appeals to per-form a Teague analysis before granting respondent relief
under Mills. The Court of Appeals erred in concluding thatit did "not need to focus on anything other than the reason5 We have recognized two exceptions to Teague's rule. "The first exception permits the retroactive application of a new rule if the rule places a
class of private conduct beyond the power of the State to proscribe, . . .
or addresses a `substantive categorical guarante[e] accorded by the Constitution,' such as a rule `prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a
class of defendants because of their status or offense.' " Saffle v. Parks,
494 U. S. 484, 494 (1990) (citations omitted). "The second exception is for
`watershed rules of criminal procedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Id., at 495.

ing and determination of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court."271 F. 3d, at 541.

Although the Court of Appeals may have simply over-looked Caspari, its opinion can also be read to imply that
AEDPA has changed the relevant legal principles articulatedin Caspari, see 271 F. 3d, at 541, n. 13 ("We note, however,
that recent decisions have called into question to what ex-tent

Teague has continued force independent of AEDPA").While it is of course a necessary prerequisite to federal habeas relief that a prisoner satisfy the AEDPA standard ofreview set forth in 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d) ("[a]n application . . .
shall not be granted . . . unless" the AEDPA standard ofreview is satisfied (emphasis added)), none of our postAEDPA cases have suggested that a writ of habeas corpusshould automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies the AEDPA
standard, or that AEDPA relieves courts from the responsi-bility of addressing properly raised Teague arguments. To
the contrary, if our post-AEDPA cases suggest anythingabout AEDPA's relationship to

Teague, it is that the AEDPAand Teague inquiries are distinct. See, e. g., Tyler v. Cain,

533 U. S. 656, 669-670 (2001) (O'Connor, J., concurring) (con-struing successive application provisions of AEDPA, 28
U. S. C. $ 2244(b)(2)(A)); Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362,412-413 (2000) (construing $ 2254(d)). Thus, in addition to
performing any analysis required by AEDPA, a federal courtconsidering a habeas petition must conduct a threshold
Teague analysis when the issue is properly raised by thestate.

We reverse the Court of Appeals' holding that "Teague isnot implicated" by this case, 271 F. 3d, at 543, and remand
for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

GONZAGA UNIVERSITY et al. v. DOE
certiorari to the supreme court of washington

No. 01-679. Argued April 24, 2002--Decided June 20, 2002
As a student at petitioner Gonzaga University, a private educational institution in Washington State, respondent planned to become a public elementary schoolteacher in that State after graduation. Washington at
the time required all new teachers to obtain an affidavit of good moral
character from their graduating colleges. Petitioner League, Gonzaga's
teacher certification specialist, overheard one student tell another that
respondent had engaged in sexual misconduct. League then launched
an investigation; contacted the state agency responsible for teacher certification, identifying respondent by name and discussing the allegations; and, finally, told him that he would not receive his certification
affidavit. Respondent sued Gonzaga and League in state court under,
inter alia, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging a violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g,
which prohibits the federal funding of schools that have a policy or practice of permitting the release of students' education records without
their parents' written consent. A jury awarded respondent compensatory and punitive damages on the FERPA claim. The Washington
Court of Appeals reversed in relevant part, concluding that FERPA
does not create individual rights and thus cannot be enforced under

$ 1983. Reversing in turn, the State Supreme Court acknowledged that
FERPA does not give rise to a private cause of action, but reasoned
that the nondisclosure provision creates a federal right enforceable
under $ 1983.

Held: Respondent's action is foreclosed because the relevant FERPA provisions create no personal rights to enforce under $ 1983. Pp. 278-291.

(a) This Court has never held, and declines to do so here, that spending legislation drafted in terms resembling FERPA's can confer enforceable rights. FERPA directs the Secretary of Education to enforce its
nondisclosure provisions and other spending conditions, $ 1232g(f), by
establishing an office and review board to investigate, process, review,
and adjudicate FERPA violations, $ 1232g(g), and to terminate funds
only upon determining that a recipient school is failing to comply substantially with any FERPA requirement and that such compliance cannot be secured voluntarily, $$ 1234c(a), 1232g(f). In Pennhurst State
School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, the Court made clear
that unless Congress "speak[s] with a clear voice," and manifests an

536US1 Unit: $U69 [12-16-03 21:29:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN
274 GONZAGA UNIV. v. DOE

Syllabus
"unambiguous" intent to create individually enforceable rights, federal
funding provisions provide no basis for private enforcement by $ 1983,
id., at 17, 28, and n. 21. Since Pennhurst, the Court has found that
spending legislation gave rise to rights enforceable under $ 1983 only in
Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S.
418, 426, 432, and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498, 522-
523, where statutory provisions explicitly conferred specific monetary
entitlements upon the plaintiffs, and there was no sufficient administrative means of enforcing the requirements against defendants that failed
to comply. The Court's more recent decisions, however, have rejected
attempts to infer enforceable rights from Spending Clause statutes
whose language did not unambiguously confer such a right upon the
Act's beneficiaries. See, e. g., Suter v. Artist M., 503 U. S. 347, 363;
Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 340, 343. Respondent's attempt to
read this line of cases to establish a relatively loose standard for finding
rights enforceable by $ 1983 is unavailing. Because $ 1983 provides a
remedy only for the deprivation of "rights . . . secured by the [Federal]
Constitution and laws," it is rights, not the broader or vaguer "benefits"
or "interests," that may be enforced thereunder. Thus, the Court further rejects the notion that its implied right of action cases are separate
and distinct from its $ 1983 cases. To the contrary, the former cases
should guide the determination whether a statute confers rights enforceable under $ 1983. Although the question whether a statutory violation may be enforced through $ 1983 is a different inquiry from that
involved in determining whether a private right of action can be implied
from a particular statute, Wilder, supra, at 508, n. 9, the inquiries overlap in one meaningful respect--in either case it must first be determined
whether Congress intended to create a federal right, see Touche Ross &
Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 576. For a statute to create private
rights, its text must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited. E. g.,
Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 692, n. 13. Once the
plaintiff demonstrates that the statute confers rights on a particular
class of persons, California v. Sierra Club, 451 U. S. 287, 294, the right
is presumptively enforceable by $ 1983. Conversely, where a statute
provides no indication that Congress intends to create new individual
rights, there is no basis for a private suit under $ 1983. Pp. 278-286.

(b) There is no question that FERPA's confidentiality provisions create no rights enforceable under $ 1983. The provisions entirely lack
the sort of individually focused rights-creating language that is critical.
FERPA's provisions speak only to the Secretary, directing that "[n]o
funds shall be made available" to any "educational . . . institution" which
has a prohibited "policy or practice," $ 1232g(b)(1). This focus is two
steps removed from the interests of individual students and parents

Syllabus
and clearly does not confer the sort of individual entitlement that is
enforceable under $ 1983. E. g., Cannon, supra, at 690-693. Furthermore, because FERPA's confidentiality provisions speak only in terms
of institutional "policy or practice," not individual instances of disclosure, see $$ 1232g(b)(1)-(2), they have an "aggregate" focus, they are not
concerned with whether the needs of any particular person have been
satisfied, and they cannot give rise to individual rights, Blessing, supra,
at 344. The fact that recipient institutions can avoid termination of
funding so long as they "comply substantially" with FERPA's requirements, $ 1234c(a), also supports a finding that FERPA fails to support

a $ 1983 suit. 520 U. S., at 335, 343. References in $$ 1232g(b)(1) and
(2) to individual parental consent cannot make out the requisite congressional intent to confer individually enforceable rights because each of
those references is made in the context of describing the type of "policy
or practice" that triggers a funding prohibition. The conclusion that
FERPA fails to confer enforceable rights is buttressed by the mechanism that Congress provided for enforcing FERPA violations. The
Secretary is expressly authorized to "deal with violations," $ 1232g(f),
and required to establish a review board to investigate and adjudicate
such violations, $ 1232g(g). For these purposes, the Secretary created
the Family Policy Compliance Office, which has promulgated procedures
for resolving student complaints about suspected FERPA violations.
These procedures squarely distinguish this case from Wright and
Wilder, where an aggrieved individual lacked any federal review mechanism. Finally, because FERPA prohibits most of the Secretary's functions from being carried out in regional offices, $ 1232g(g), in order to
allay the concern that regionalizing enforcement might lead to multiple
interpretations of FERPA, it is implausible to presume that Congress
nonetheless intended private suits to be brought before thousands of
federal- and state-court judges. Pp. 287-290.

The question presented is whether a student may sue aprivate university for damages under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42

a policy or practice of releasing education records to unau-thorized persons. We hold such an action foreclosed because
the relevant provisions of FERPA create no personal rightsto enforce under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 (1994 ed., Supp. V).

Opinion of the Court
Respondent John Doe is a former undergraduate in the
School of Education at Gonzaga University, a private university in Spokane, Washington. He planned to graduate and
teach at a Washington public elementary school. Washington at the time required all of its new teachers to obtain an
affidavit of good moral character from a dean of their graduating college or university. In October 1993, Roberta
League, Gonzaga's "teacher certification specialist," overheard one student tell another that respondent engaged in
acts of sexual misconduct against Jane Doe, a female undergraduate. League launched an investigation and contacted
the state agency responsible for teacher certification, identifying respondent by name and discussing the allegations
against him. Respondent did not learn of the investigation,
or that information about him had been disclosed, until
March 1994, when he was told by League and others that he
would not receive the affidavit required for certification as a
Washington schoolteacher.

Respondent then sued Gonzaga and League (petitioners)
in state court. He alleged violations of Washington tort and
contract law, as well as a pendent violation of $ 1983 for the
release of personal information to an "unauthorized person"
in violation of FERPA.1 A jury found for respondent on all
counts, awarding him $1,155,000, including $150,000 in compensatory damages and $300,000 in punitive damages on the
FERPA claim.

1 The Washington Court of Appeals and the Washington Supreme Court
found petitioners to have acted "under color of state law" for purposes of

$ 1983 when they disclosed respondent's personal information to state officials in connection with state-law teacher certification requirements. 143
Wash. 2d 687, 710-711, 24 P. 3d 390, 401-402 (2001). Although the petition
for certiorari challenged this holding, we agreed to review only the question posed in the first paragraph of this opinion, a question reserved in
Owasso Independent School Dist. No. I-011 v. Falvo, 534 U. S. 426, 430-
431 (2002). We therefore assume without deciding that the relevant disclosures occurred under color of state law.

Opinion of the Court
The Washington Court of Appeals reversed in relevant
part, concluding that FERPA does not create individual
rights and thus cannot be enforced under $ 1983. 99 Wash.
App. 338, 992 P. 2d 545 (2000). The Washington Supreme
Court reversed that decision, and ordered the FERPA damages reinstated. 143 Wash. 2d 687, 24 P. 3d 390 (2001). The
court acknowledged that "FERPA itself does not give rise
to a private cause of action," but reasoned that FERPA's
nondisclosure provision "gives rise to a federal right enforceable under section 1983." Id., at 707-708, 24 P. 3d, at 400.

Like the Washington Supreme Court and the State Court
of Appeals below, other state and federal courts have divided
on the question of FERPA's enforceability under $ 1983.2
The fact that all of these courts have relied on the same set
of opinions from this Court suggests that our opinions in this
area may not be models of clarity. We therefore granted
certiorari, 534 U. S. 1103 (2002), to resolve the conflict among
the lower courts and in the process resolve any ambiguity in
our own opinions.

Congress enacted FERPA under its spending power to
condition the receipt of federal funds on certain requirements relating to the access and disclosure of student educational records. The Act directs the Secretary of Education
to withhold federal funds from any public or private "educational agency or institution" that fails to comply with these
conditions. As relevant here, the Act provides:

2 Compare Gundlach v. Reinstein, 924 F. Supp. 684, 692 (ED Pa. 1996)
(FERPA confers no enforceable rights because it contains "no unambiguous intention on the part of the Congress to permit the invocation of $ 1983
to redress an individual release of records"), aff'd, 114 F. 3d 1172 (CA3
1997); and Meury v. Eagle-Union Community School Corp., 714 N. E. 2d
233, 239 (Ind. Ct. App. 1999) (same), with Falvo v. Owasso Independent
School Dist. No. I-011, 233 F. 3d 1203, 1210 (CA10 2000) (concluding that
release of records in "violation of FERPA is actionable under . . . $ 1983"),
rev'd on other grounds, 534 U. S. 426 (2002); and Brown v. Oneonta, 106
F. 3d 1125, 1131-1132 (CA2 1997) (same).

Opinion of the Court
"No funds shall be made available under any applicableprogram to any educational agency or institution which

has a policy or practice of permitting the release of edu-cation records (or personally identifiable information
contained therein . . .) of students without the writtenconsent of their parents to any individual, agency, or organization." 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g(b)(1).
The Act directs the Secretary of Education to enforce thisand other of the Act's spending conditions. $ 1232g(f ). The

Secretary is required to establish an office and review boardwithin the Department of Education for "investigating, processing, reviewing, and adjudicating violations of [the Act]."$ 1232g(g). Funds may be terminated only if the Secretary
determines that a recipient institution "is failing to complysubstantially with any requirement of [the Act]" and that
such compliance "cannot be secured by voluntary means."$$ 1234c(a), 1232g(f ).

Respondent contends that this statutory regime confersupon any student enrolled at a covered school or institution
a federal right, enforceable in suits for damages under $ 1983,not to have "education records" disclosed to unauthorized
persons without the student's express written consent. Butwe have never before held, and decline to do so here, that
spending legislation drafted in terms resembling those ofFERPA can confer enforceable rights.

In Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980), six years afterCongress enacted FERPA, we recognized for the first time
that $ 1983 actions may be brought against state actors toenforce rights created by federal statutes as well as by the
Constitution. There we held that plaintiffs could recoverpayments wrongfully withheld by a state agency in violation
of the Social Security Act. Id., at 4. A year later, in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1(1981), we rejected a claim that the Developmentally Disabled Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1975 conferredenforceable rights, saying:

280 GONZAGA UNIV. v. DOE

Opinion of the Court
"In legislation enacted pursuant to the spending power,the typical remedy for state noncompliance with federally imposed conditions is not a private cause of actionfor noncompliance but rather action by the Federal Government to terminate funds to the State." Id., at 28.
We made clear that unless Congress "speak[s] with a clearvoice," and manifests an "unambiguous" intent to confer individual rights, federal funding provisions provide no basis forprivate enforcement by $ 1983.

Id., at 17, 28, and n. 21.Since Pennhurst, only twice have we found spending legislation to give rise to enforceable rights. In Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418(1987), we allowed a $ 1983 suit by tenants to recover past

overcharges under a rent-ceiling provision of the PublicHousing Act, on the ground that the provision unambiguously conferred "a mandatory [benefit] focusing on the indi-vidual family and its income." Id., at 430. The key to our
inquiry was that Congress spoke in terms that "could not beclearer," ibid., and conferred entitlements "sufficiently specific and definite to qualify as enforceable rights under Penn-hurst." Id., at 432. Also significant was that the federal
agency charged with administering the Public Housing Act"ha[d] never provided a procedure by which tenants could
complain to it about the alleged failures [of state welfareagencies] to abide by [the Act's rent-ceiling provision]."
Id., at 426.Three years later, in

Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn.,496 U. S. 498 (1990), we allowed a $ 1983 suit brought by

health care providers to enforce a reimbursement provisionof the Medicaid Act, on the ground that the provision, much
like the rent-ceiling provision in Wright, explicitly conferredspecific monetary entitlements upon the plaintiffs. Congress left no doubt of its intent for private enforcement, wesaid, because the provision required States to pay an "objective" monetary entitlement to individual health care provid-ers, with no sufficient administrative means of enforcing the

requirement against States that failed to comply. 496 U. S.,at 522-523.

Our more recent decisions, however, have rejected at-tempts to infer enforceable rights from Spending Clause
statutes. In Suter v. Artist M., 503 U. S. 347 (1992), theAdoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required
States receiving funds for adoption assistance to have a"plan" to make "reasonable efforts" to keep children out of
foster homes. A class of parents and children sought toenforce this requirement against state officials under $ 1983,
claiming that no such efforts had been made. We read theAct "in the light shed by

Pennhurst," id., at 358, and foundno basis for the suit, saying:

"Careful examination of the language . . . does not unam-biguously confer an enforceable right upon the Act's
beneficiaries. The term `reasonable efforts' in this con-text is at least as plausibly read to impose only a rather
generalized duty on the State, to be enforced not by pri-vate individuals, but by the Secretary in the manner [of
reducing or eliminating payments]." Id., at 363.
Since the Act conferred no specific, individually enforceablerights, there was no basis for private enforcement, even

by a class of the statute's principal beneficiaries. Id., at 357.Similarly, in

Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329 (1997),Title IV-D of the Social Security Act required States receiving federal child-welfare funds to "substantially comply"with requirements designed to ensure timely payment of
child support. Five Arizona mothers invoked $ 1983 againststate officials on grounds that state child-welfare agencies
consistently failed to meet these requirements. We foundno basis for the suit, saying:

"Far from creating an individual entitlement to serv-ices, the standard is simply a yardstick for the Secretary
to measure the systemwide performance of a State'sTitle IV-D program. Thus, the Secretary must look to

the aggregate services provided by the State, not towhether the needs of any particular person have been

satisfied." Id., at 343 (emphases in original).
Because the provision focused on "the aggregate servicesprovided by the State," rather than "the needs of any particular person," it conferred no individual rights and thus couldnot be enforced by $ 1983. We emphasized: "[T]o seek redress through $ 1983, . . . a plaintiff must assert the violationof a federal

right, not merely a violation of federal law."Id., at 340 (emphases in original).

Respondent reads this line of cases to establish a relativelyloose standard for finding rights enforceable by $ 1983. He
claims that a federal statute confers such rights so long asCongress intended that the statute "benefit" putative plaintiffs. Brief for Respondent 40-46. He further contendsthat a more "rigorous" inquiry would conflate the standard
for inferring a private right of action under $ 1983 with thestandard for inferring a private right of action directly from
the statute itself, which he admits would not exist underFERPA.

Id., at 41-43. As authority, respondent points toBlessing and Wilder, which, he says, used the term "benefit"

to define the sort of statutory interest enforceable by $ 1983.See Blessing, supra, at 340-341 ("Congress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff ");
Wilder, supra, at 509 (same).Some language in our opinions might be read to suggest

that something less than an unambiguously conferred right isenforceable by $ 1983. Blessing, for example, set forth three
"factors" to guide judicial inquiry into whether or not a stat-ute confers a right: "Congress must have intended that the
provision in question benefit the plaintiff," "the plaintiffmust demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the
statute is not so `vague and amorphous' that its enforcementwould strain judicial competence," and "the provision giving
rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory,rather than precatory, terms." 520 U. S., at 340-341. In

Opinion of the Court
the same paragraph, however, Blessing emphasizes that it isonly violations of

rights, not laws, which give rise to $ 1983
actions. Id., at 340. This confusion has led some courts tointerpret

Blessing as allowing plaintiffs to enforce a statute
under $ 1983 so long as the plaintiff falls within the generalzone of interest that the statute is intended to protect; something less than what is required for a statute to create rights
enforceable directly from the statute itself under an impliedprivate right of action. Fueling this uncertainty is the notion that our implied private right of action cases have nobearing on the standards for discerning whether a statute
creates rights enforceable by $ 1983. Wilder appears to support this notion, 496 U. S., at 508-509, n. 9, while Suter, 503
U. S., at 363-364, and Pennhurst, 451 U. S., at 28, n. 21, appear to disavow it.

We now reject the notion that our cases permit anything
short of an unambiguously conferred right to support a cause
of action brought under $ 1983. Section 1983 provides a
remedy only for the deprivation of "rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United
States. Accordingly, it is rights, not the broader or vaguer
"benefits" or "interests," that may be enforced under the
authority of that section. This being so, we further reject
the notion that our implied right of action cases are separate
and distinct from our $ 1983 cases. To the contrary, our

implied right of action cases should guide the determination
of whether a statute confers rights enforceable under $ 1983.

We have recognized that whether a statutory violation
may be enforced through $ 1983 "is a different inquiry than
that involved in determining whether a private right of
action can be implied from a particular statute." Wilder,
supra, at 508, n. 9. But the inquiries overlap in one meaningful respect--in either case we must first determine
whether Congress intended to create a federal right. Thus
we have held that "[t]he question whether Congress . . . intended to create a private right of action [is] definitively an536US1 Unit: $U69 [12-16-03 21:29:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

swered in the negative" where a "statute by its terms grantsno private rights to any identifiable class." Touche Ross &

Co. v. Redington, 442 U. S. 560, 576 (1979). For a statute tocreate such private rights, its text must be "phrased in terms
of the persons benefited." Cannon v. University of Chi-cago, 441 U. S. 677, 692, n. 13 (1979). We have recognized,
for example, that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964and Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 create
individual rights because those statutes are phrased "withan

unmistakable focus on the benefited class." Id., at 691(emphasis added).

3 But even where a statute is phrased in

such explicit rights-creating terms, a plaintiff suing under animplied right of action still must show that the statute manifests an intent "to create not just a private right but also aprivate remedy." Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 286
(2001) (emphases added).Plaintiffs suing under $ 1983 do not have the burden of
showing an intent to create a private remedy because $ 1983generally supplies a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by federal statutes. See supra, at 279-281. Once aplaintiff demonstrates that a statute confers an individual
right, the right is presumptively enforceable by $ 1983.4 But

3 Title VI provides: "No person in the United States shall . . . be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance" on the basis of race, color, or national origin. 78 Stat.
252, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d (1994 ed.) (emphasis added). Title IX provides:
"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, . . . be subjected
to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance." 86 Stat. 373, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a) (emphasis
added). Where a statute does not include this sort of explicit "right- or
duty-creating language," we rarely impute to Congress an intent to create
a private right of action. See Cannon, 441 U. S., at 690, n. 13 (listing
provisions); Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U. S. 275, 288 (2001) (existence or
absence of rights-creating language is critical to the Court's inquiry).

4 The State may rebut this presumption by showing that Congress "specifically foreclosed a remedy under $ 1983." Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S.
992, 1004-1005, n. 9 (1984). The State's burden is to demonstrate that
Congress shut the door to private enforcement either expressly, through

Opinion of the Court
the initial inquiry--determining whether a statute confers
any right at all--is no different from the initial inquiry in an
implied right of action case, the express purpose of which is
to determine whether or not a statute "confer[s] rights on a
particular class of persons." California v. Sierra Club, 451
U. S. 287, 294 (1981). This makes obvious sense, since $ 1983
merely provides a mechanism for enforcing individual rights
"secured" elsewhere, i. e., rights independently "secured by
the Constitution and laws" of the United States. "[O]ne
cannot go into court and claim a `violation of $ 1983'--for

$ 1983 by itself does not protect anyone against anything."
Chapman v. Houston Welfare Rights Organization, 441
U. S. 600, 617 (1979).

A court's role in discerning whether personal rights exist
in the $ 1983 context should therefore not differ from its role
in discerning whether personal rights exist in the implied
right of action context. Compare Golden State Transit
Corp. v. Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 107-108, n. 4 (1989) ("[A]
claim based on a statutory violation is enforceable under

$ 1983 only when the statute creates `rights, privileges, or
immunities' in the particular plaintiff "), with Cannon, supra,
at 690, n. 13 (statute is enforceable under implied right only
where Congress "explicitly conferred a right directly on a
class of persons that included the plaintiff in the case").
Both inquiries simply require a determination as to whether
or not Congress intended to confer individual rights upon
a class of beneficiaries. Compare Wright, 479 U. S., at 423
(statute must be "intended to rise to the level of an enforce"specific evidence from the statute itself," Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418, 423 (1987), or "impliedly, by
creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with
individual enforcement under $ 1983," Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329,
341 (1997). See also Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National
Sea Clammers Assn., 453 U. S. 1, 20 (1981). These questions do not arise
in this case due to our conclusion that FERPA confers no individual rights
and thus cannot give rise to a presumption of enforceability under $ 1983.

able right"), with Alexander v. Sandoval, supra, at 289 (statute must evince "congressional intent to create new rights");
and California v. Sierra Club, supra, at 294 ("The question
is not simply who would benefit from the Act, but whether
Congress intended to confer federal rights upon those beneficiaries" (citing Cannon, supra, at 690-693, n. 13)). Accordingly, where the text and structure of a statute provide no
indication that Congress intends to create new individual
rights, there is no basis for a private suit, whether under

$ 1983 or under an implied right of action.

Justice Stevens disagrees with this conclusion principally because separation-of-powers concerns are, in his view,
more pronounced in the implied right of action context as
opposed to the $ 1983 context. Post, at 300-301 (dissenting
opinion) (citing Wilder, 496 U. S., at 509, n. 9). But we fail
to see how relations between the branches are served by
having courts apply a multifactor balancing test to pick and
choose which federal requirements may be enforced by

$ 1983 and which may not. Nor are separation-of-powers
concerns within the Federal Government the only guideposts
in this sort of analysis. See Will v. Michigan Dept. of State
Police, 491 U. S. 58, 65 (1989) ("[I]f Congress intends to alter
the `usual constitutional balance between the States and the
Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do so
`unmistakably clear in the language of the statute' " (quoting
Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242
(1985); citing Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 99 (1984))).5

5 This case illustrates the point well. Justice Stevens would conclude
that Congress intended FERPA's nondisclosure provisions to confer individual rights on millions of school students from kindergarten through
graduate school without having ever said so explicitly. This conclusion
entails a judicial assumption, with no basis in statutory text, that Congress
intended to set itself resolutely against a tradition of deference to state
and local school officials, e. g., Falvo, 534 U. S., at 435 (rejecting proposed

Opinion of the Court
With this principle in mind, there is no question thatFERPA's nondisclosure provisions fail to confer enforceable

rights. To begin with, the provisions entirely lack the sortof "rights-creating" language critical to showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights. Alexander v.Sandoval, 532 U. S., at 288-289; Cannon, 441 U. S., at 690,
n. 13. Unlike the individually focused terminology of TitlesVI and IX ("No person . . . shall . . . be subjected to discrimination"), FERPA's provisions speak only to the Secretary ofEducation, directing that "[n]o funds shall be made available"
to any "educational agency or institution" which has a pro-hibited "policy or practice." 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g(b)(1). This
focus is two steps removed from the interests of individualstudents and parents and clearly does not confer the sort
of "individual entitlement" that is enforceable under $ 1983.
Blessing, 520 U. S., at 343 (emphasis in original). As we saidin Cannon:

"There would be far less reason to infer a private rem-edy in favor of individual persons if Congress, instead
of drafting Title IX with an unmistakable focus on thebenefited class, had written it simply as a ban on discriminatory conduct by recipients of federal funds or asa prohibition against the disbursement of public funds
to educational institutions engaged in discriminatorypractices." 441 U. S., at 690-693.

See also Alexander v. Sandoval, supra, at 289 ("Statutesthat focus on the person regulated rather than the individuals protected create `no implication of an intent to conferrights on a particular class of persons' " (quoting

Californiav. Sierra Club, supra, at 294)).

interpretation of FERPA because "[w]e doubt Congress meant to intervene in this drastic fashion with traditional state functions"); Regents of
Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U. S. 214, 226 (1985) (noting tradition of

"reluctance to trench on the prerogatives of state and local educational
institutions"), by subjecting them to private suits for money damages
whenever they fail to comply with a federal funding condition.

Opinion of the Court
FERPA's nondisclosure provisions further speak only interms of institutional policy and practice, not individual instances of disclosure. See $$ 1232g(b)(1)-(2) (prohibiting thefunding of "any educational agency or institution which has
a policy or practice of permitting the release of educationrecords" (emphasis added)). Therefore, as in Blessing, they
have an "aggregate" focus, 520 U. S., at 343, they are notconcerned with "whether the needs of any particular person
have been satisfied," ibid., and they cannot "give rise to indi-vidual rights,"

id., at 344. Recipient institutions can furtheravoid termination of funding so long as they "comply substantially" with the Act's requirements. $ 1234c(a). This,too, is not unlike Blessing, which found that Title IV-D failed
to support a $ 1983 suit in part because it only required "sub-stantial compliance" with federal regulations. 520 U. S., at
335, 343. Respondent directs our attention to subsection(b)(2), but the text and structure of subsections (b)(1) and
(b)(2) are essentially the same.6 In each provision the ref-erence to individual consent is in the context of describing
the type of "policy or practice" that triggers a funding prohi6 Subsection (b)(2) provides in relevant part:
"No funds shall be made available under any applicable program to any
educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of releasing, or providing access to, any personally identifiable information in education records other than directory information . . . unless--

"(A) there is written consent from the student's parents specifying records to be released, the reasons for such release, and to whom, and with a
copy of the records to be released to the student's parents and the student
if desired by the parents." 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g(b)(2)(A).

Respondent invokes this provision to assert the very awkward "individualized right to withhold consent and prevent the unauthorized release of
personally identifiable information in education records by an educational
institution that has a policy or practice of releasing, or providing access
to, such information." Brief for Respondent 14. That is a far cry from
the sort of individualized, concrete monetary entitlement found enforceable in Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980), Wright, and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498 (1990). See supra, at 279-281.

bition. For reasons expressed repeatedly in our prior cases,however, such provisions cannot make out the requisite congressional intent to confer individual rights enforceable by$ 1983.

7

Our conclusion that FERPA's nondisclosure provisions failto confer enforceable rights is buttressed by the mechanism

that Congress chose to provide for enforcing those provi-sions. Congress expressly authorized the Secretary of Education to "deal with violations" of the Act, $ 1232g(f) (em-phasis added), and required the Secretary to "establish or
designate [a] review board" for investigating and adjudicat-ing such violations, $ 1232g(g). Pursuant to these provisions, the Secretary created the Family Policy ComplianceOffice (FPCO) "to act as the Review Board required under
the Act [and] to enforce the Act with respect to all applicableprograms." 34 CFR $$ 99.60(a) and (b) (2001). The FPCO
permits students and parents who suspect a violation of theAct to file individual written complaints. $ 99.63. If a complaint is timely and contains required information, the FPCOwill initiate an investigation, $$ 99.64(a)-(b), notify the educational institution of the charge, $ 99.65(a), and request a writ-ten response, $ 99.65. If a violation is found, the FPCO distributes a notice of factual findings and a "statement of thespecific steps that the agency or institution must take to
comply" with FERPA. $$ 99.66(b) and (c)(1). These admin7 Justice Stevens would have us look to other provisions in FERPA
that use the term "rights" to define the obligations of educational institutions that receive federal funds. See post, at 293-294, 296. He then suggests that any reference to "rights," even as a shorthand means of describing standards and procedures imposed on funding recipients, should give
rise to a statute's enforceability under $ 1983. Ibid. This argument was
rejected in Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S.
1, 18-20 (1981) (no presumption of enforceability merely because a statute
"speaks in terms of `rights' "), and it is particularly misplaced here since
Congress enacted FERPA years before Thiboutot declared that statutes
can ever give rise to rights enforceable by $ 1983.

istrative procedures squarely distinguish this case fromWright and Wilder, where an aggrieved individual lacked

any federal review mechanism, see supra, at 280-281, andfurther counsel against our finding a congressional intent to
create individually enforceable private rights.8Congress finally provided that "[e]xcept for the conduct of
hearings, none of the functions of the Secretary under thissection shall be carried out in any of the regional offices" of
the Department of Education. 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g(g). Thiscentralized review provision was added just four months
after FERPA's enactment due to "concern that regionalizingthe enforcement of [FERPA] may lead to multiple interpretations of it, and possibly work a hardship on parents, stu-dents, and institutions." 120 Cong. Rec. 39863 (1974) ( joint
statement). Cf. Wright, 479 U. S., at 426 ("Congress' aimwas to provide a

decentralized . . . administrative process"(emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)). It is

implausible to presume that the same Congress nonethelessintended private suits to be brought before thousands of
federal- and state-court judges, which could only result inthe sort of "multiple interpretations" the Act explicitly
sought to avoid.In sum, if Congress wishes to create new rights enforceable under $ 1983, it must do so in clear and unambiguousterms--no less and no more than what is required for
Congress to create new rights enforceable under an impliedprivate right of action. FERPA's nondisclosure provisions
contain no rights-creating language, they have an aggregate,not individual, focus, and they serve primarily to direct the
Secretary of Education's distribution of public funds toeducational institutions. They therefore create no rights
enforceable under $ 1983. Accordingly, the judgment of the

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
Supreme Court of Washington is reversed, and the case isremanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this

opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Souter joins,concurring in the judgment.

The ultimate question, in respect to whether private indi-viduals may bring a lawsuit to enforce a federal statute,
through 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 or otherwise, is a question of con-gressional intent. In my view, the factors set forth in this
Court's $ 1983 cases are helpful indications of that intent.See,

e. g., Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 340-341 (1997);
Suter v. Artist M., 503 U. S. 347, 357 (1992); Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498, 509-511 (1990); Wright
v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479
U. S. 418, 423-427 (1987). But the statute books are too
many, the laws too diverse, and their purposes too complex,
for any single legal formula to offer more than general guidance. I would not, in effect, predetermine an outcome
through the use of a presumption--such as the majority's
presumption that a right is conferred only if set forth "unambiguously" in the statute's "text and structure." See ante,
at 280, 288.

At the same time, I do not believe that Congress intended
private judicial enforcement of this statute's "school record
privacy" provisions. The Court mentions most of the considerations I find persuasive: The phrasing of the relevant
prohibition (stating that "[n]o funds shall be made available"
to institutions with a "policy or practice" of permitting the
release of "education records"), see ante, at 288, n. 6, 288-
289; the total absence (in the relevant statutory provision)
of any reference to individual "rights" or the like, see ante,
at 287; the related provisions that make clear, by creating
administrative enforcement processes, that the Spending
Clause was not simply a device to obtain federal jurisdiction,

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
see ante, at 289-290; and later statutory insistence upon cen-tralized federal enforcement at the national, not the regional,

level, see ante, at 290.I would add one further reason. Much of the statute's key
language is broad and nonspecific. The statute, for example,defines its key term, "education records," as (with certain
enumerated exceptions) "those records, files, documents, and
other materials which (i) contain information directly relatedto a student; and (ii) are maintained by an educational . . .

institution." 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g(a)(4)(A). This kind of lan-guage leaves schools uncertain as to just when they can, or
cannot, reveal various kinds of information. It has led, orcould lead, to legal claims that would limit, or forbid, such
practices as peer grading, see Owasso Independent School
Dist. No. I-011 v. Falvo, 534 U. S. 426 (2002), teacher evaluations, see Moore v. Hyche, 761 F. Supp. 112 (ND Ala. 1991),school "honor society" recommendations, see

Price v. Young,
580 F. Supp. 1 (ED Ark. 1983), or even roll call responsesand "bad conduct" marks written down in class, see Tr. of

Oral Arg. in Falvo, supra, O. T. 2001, No. 00-1073, pp. 37-38.
And it is open to interpretations that invariably favor con-fidentiality almost irrespective of conflicting educational

needs or the importance, or common sense, of limited disclosures in certain circumstances, say, where individuals are
being considered for work with young children or other positions of trust.

Under these circumstances, Congress may well have
wanted to make the agency remedy that it provided exclusive--both to achieve the expertise, uniformity, widespread
consultation, and resulting administrative guidance that can
accompany agency decisionmaking and to avoid the comparative risk of inconsistent interpretations and misincentives
that can arise out of an occasional inappropriate application
of the statute in a private action for damages. This factor,
together with the others to which the majority refers, convinces me that Congress did not intend private judicial enforcement actions here.

to hold that the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Actof 1974 (FERPA or Act), 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g, simply does not
create any federal rights, thereby disposing of the case witha negative answer to the question "whether Congress intended to create a federal right," ante, at 283. This inter-pretation would explain the Court's studious avoidance of the
rights-creating language in the title and the text of the Act.Alternatively, its opinion may be read as accepting the proposition that FERPA does indeed create both parental rightsof access to student records and student rights of privacy in
such records, but that those federal rights are of a lesservalue because Congress did not intend them to be enforceable by their owners. See, e. g., ante, at 290 (requiring ofrespondent "no less and no more" than what is required of
plaintiffs attempting to prove that a statute creates an im-plied right of action). I shall first explain why the statute
does, indeed, create federal rights, and then explain why theCourt's novel attempt to craft a new category of second-class
statutory rights is misguided.

Title 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g, which embodies FERPA in itsentirety, includes 10 subsections, which create rights for both

students and their parents, and describe the procedures forenforcing and protecting those rights. Subsection (a)(1)(A)
accords parents "the right to inspect and review the educa-tion records of their children."

an institution that has a policy of denying parents "the right to inspect
and review the education records of their children," subsection (a)(1)(A)
clarifies that if an education record pertains to more than one student,
"the parents of one of such students shall have the right to inspect and

vides that a "student or a person applying for admission"
may waive "his right of access" to certain confidential statements. Two separate provisions protect students' privacy
rights: subsection (a)(2) refers to "the privacy rights of students," and subsection (c) protects "the rights of privacy of
students and their families." And subsection (d) provides
that after a student has attained the age of 18, "the rights
accorded to the parents of the student" shall thereafter be
extended to the student. Given such explicit rights-creating
language, the title of the statute, which describes "family
educational rights," is appropriate: The entire statutory
scheme was designed to protect such rights.

Of course, as we have stated previously, a "blanket approach" to determining whether a statute creates rights enforceable under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 (1994 ed., Supp. V) is inappropriate. Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U. S. 329, 344 (1997).
The precise statutory provision at issue in this case is

$ 1232g(b).2 Although the rights-creating language in this
subsection is not as explicit as it is in other parts of the
statute, it is clear that, in substance, $ 1232g(b) formulates
an individual right: in respondent's words, the "right of
parents to withhold consent and prevent the unauthorized
release of education record information by an educational

review only" the parts pertaining to that student. That subsection then
provides that the educational institution "shall establish appropriate procedures" for the granting of parental requests for access within 45 days.
Ibid. Subsection (a)(1)(B) also refers to the parents' "right to inspect and
review the education records" of their children.

2 In relevant part, $ 1232g(b)(2) states that "[n]o funds shall be made

available under any applicable program to any educational agency or institution which has a policy or practice of releasing, or providing access to,
any personally identifiable information in education records other than
directory information . . . unless" either "there is written consent from the
student's parents specifying records to be released, the reasons for such
release, and to whom, and with a copy of the records to be released to the
student's parents and the student if desired by the parents," or a court
order dictating release of information.

institution . . . that has a policy or practice of releasing suchinformation." Brief for Respondent 11. This provision

plainly meets the standards we articulated in Blessing forestablishing a federal right: It is directed to the benefit of
individual students and parents; the provision is binding onStates, as it is "couched in mandatory, rather than precatory,
terms"; and the right is far from " `vague and amorphous,' "520 U. S., at 340-341. Indeed, the right at issue is more specific and clear than rights previously found enforceable under$ 1983 in

Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and HousingAuthority, 479 U. S. 418 (1987), and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498 (1990), both of which involvedplaintiffs' entitlement to "reasonable" amounts of money.

As such, the federal right created by $ 1232g(b) is "presump-tively enforceable by $ 1983," ante, at 284.

The Court claims that $ 1232g(b), because it references a"policy or practice," has an aggregate focus and thus cannot
qualify as an individual right. See ante, at 288 (emphasisdeleted). But $ 1232g(b) does not simply ban an institution
from having a policy or practice--which would be a moresystemic requirement. Rather, it permits a policy or practice of releasing information, so long as "there is writtenconsent from the student's parents specifying records to be
released, the reasons for such release, and to whom, and witha copy of the records to be released to the student's parents
and the student if desired by the parents." 20 U. S. C.$ 1232g(b)(2)(A). The provision speaks of the individual
"student," not students generally. In light of FERPA'sstated purpose to "protect such individuals' rights to privacy
by limiting the transferability of their records without theirconsent," 120 Cong. Rec. 39862 (1974) (statement of Sen.

3 In Wright, the right claimed was "that a `reasonable' amount for utilities be included in rent that a [public housing authority] was allowed to
charge." 479 U. S., at 430. In Wilder, health care providers asserted the
right to "reasonable and adequate rates" from "States participating in the
Medicaid program." 496 U. S., at 512.

Buckley), the individual focus of $ 1232g(b) is manifest.Moreover, simply because a "pattern or practice" is a precondition to individual relief does not mean that the right as-serted is not an individually enforceable right. Cf. Monell
v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 690-695 (1978) (authorizing municipal liability under $ 1983 when
a municipality's "policy or custom" has caused the violationof an individual's federal rights).

Although $ 1232g(b) alone provides strong evidence thatan individual federal right has been created, this conclusion
is bolstered by viewing the provision in the overall contextof FERPA. Not once in its opinion does the Court acknowledge the substantial number of references to "rights" in theFERPA provisions surrounding $ 1232g(b), even though our
past $ 1983 cases have made clear that a given statutory pro-vision's meaning is to be discerned "in light of the entire
legislative enactment," Suter v. Artist M., 503 U. S. 347, 357(1992).

4 Rather, ignoring these provisions, the Court asserts that FERPA--not just $ 1232g(b)--"entirely lack[s]"rights-creating language, ante, at 287. The Court also

claims that "we have never before held . . . that spendinglegislation drafted in terms resembling those of FERPA can
confer enforceable rights." Ante, at 279. In making thisclaim, the Court contrasts FERPA's "[n]o funds shall be
made available" language with "individually focused termi4 The Court correctly states that "rights" language alone does not necessarily create rights enforceable under $ 1983, ante, at 289, n. 7 (quoting
Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1 (1981)),
but such language is certainly relevant to whether a statute creates rights,
see ante, at 287 (describing " `rights-creating' language" as "critical to
showing the requisite congressional intent to create new rights"). Moreover, in Pennhurst, the Court treated the "rights" language as the only
arguable evidence that the statute created rights; here, the " `overall' or
`specific' purposes of the Act," 451 U. S., at 18, also show an intent to
create individual rights. See supra, at 295 and this page (discussing
FERPA's "stated purpose").

nology" characteristic of federal antidiscrimination statutes,
such as "[n]o person . . . shall . . . be subjected to discrimination," ante, at 287. But the sort of rights-creating language
idealized by the Court has never been present in our $ 1983
cases; rather, such language ordinarily gives rise to an implied cause of action. See Cannon v. University of Chicago,
441 U. S. 677, 690, n. 13 (1979). None of our four most recent
cases involving whether a Spending Clause statute created
rights enforceable under $ 1983--Wright, Wilder, Suter, and
Blessing--involved the sort of "no person shall" rightscreating language envisioned by the Court. And in two of
those cases--Wright and Wilder--we concluded that individual rights enforceable under $ 1983 existed. See n. 3, supra.

Although a "presumptively enforceable" right, ante, at 284,
has been created by $ 1232g(b), one final question remains.
As our cases recognize, Congress can rebut the presumption
of enforcement under $ 1983 either "expressly, by forbidding
recourse to $ 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement [actions]." Blessing, 520
U. S., at 341. FERPA has not explicitly foreclosed enforcement under $ 1983. The only question, then, is whether the
administrative enforcement mechanisms provided by the
statute are "comprehensive" and "incompatible" with $ 1983
actions. As the Court explains, ante, at 289, FERPA authorizes the establishment of an administrative enforcement
framework, and the Secretary of Education has created the
Family Policy Compliance Office (FPCO) to "deal with violations" of the Act, 20 U. S. C. $ 1232g(f ). FPCO accepts complaints from the public concerning alleged FERPA violations
and, if it so chooses, may follow up on such a complaint by
informing institutions of the steps they must take to comply
with FERPA, see 34 CFR $$ 99.63-99.67 (2001), and, in
exceptional cases, by administrative adjudication against
noncomplying institutions, see 20 U. S. C. $ 1234. These ad536US1 Unit: $U69 [12-16-03 21:29:15] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ministrative avenues fall far short of what is necessary toovercome the presumption of enforceability. We have only

found a comprehensive administrative scheme precluding en-forceability under $ 1983 in two of our past cases--

Middlesex
County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers
Assn., 453 U. S. 1 (1981), and Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S.
992 (1984). In Sea Clammers, the relevant statute not only
had "unusually elaborate enforcement provisions," but it alsopermitted private citizens to bring enforcement actions in

court. 453 U. S., at 13-14. In Smith, the statute at issueprovided for "carefully tailored" administrative proceedings
followed by federal judicial review. 468 U. S., at 1009. Incontrast, FERPA provides no guaranteed access to a formal
administrative proceeding or to federal judicial review;rather, it leaves to administrative discretion the decision
whether to follow up on individual complaints. As we saidin

Blessing, 520 U. S., at 348, the enforcement scheme here
is "far more limited than those in Sea Clammers and Smith,"
and thus does not preclude enforcement under $ 1983.5

5 The Court does not test FERPA's administrative scheme against the
"comprehensive enforcement scheme," Blessing, 520 U. S., at 341, standard
for rebutting the presumptive enforceability of a federal right, ante, at
290, n. 8, because it concludes that there is no federal right to trigger this
additional analysis. Yet, at the same time, the Court imports "enforcement scheme" considerations into the initial question whether the statute
creates a presumptively enforceable right. See ante, at 289 ("Our conclusion that FERPA's nondisclosure provisions fail to confer enforceable
rights is buttressed by the mechanism that Congress chose to provide for
enforcing [FERPA violations]"). Folding such considerations into the
rights question renders the rebuttal inquiry superfluous. Moreover, the
Court's approach is inconsistent with our past cases, which have kept separate the inquiries whether there is a right and whether an enforcement
scheme rebuts presumptive enforceability. Thus, the Court's discussion
of the schemes in Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418 (1987), and Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496
U. S. 498 (1990), is inapposite, see ante, at 289-290, because neither of
those cases considered the existence of an enforcement scheme relevant
to whether a federal right had been created in the first instance.

II
Since FERPA was enacted in 1974, all of the FederalCourts of Appeals expressly deciding the question have concluded that FERPA creates federal rights enforceable under$ 1983.

6 Nearly all other federal and state courts reaching

the issue agree with these Circuits.7 Congress has not over-ruled these decisions by amending FERPA to expressly preclude recourse to $ 1983. And yet, the Court departs fromover a quarter century of settled law in concluding that
FERPA creates no enforceable rights. Perhaps more perni-cious than its disturbing of the settled status of FERPA
rights, though, is the Court's novel use of our implied rightof action cases in determining whether a federal right exists
for $ 1983 purposes.In my analysis of whether $ 1232g(b) creates a right for

$ 1983 purposes, I have assumed the Court's forthrightnessin stating that the question presented is "whether Congress
intended to create a federal right," ante, at 283, and that"[p]laintiffs suing under $ 1983 do not have the burden of
showing an intent to create a private remedy," ante, at 284.Rather than proceeding with a straightforward analysis

Dist., 802 F. 2d 21, 33 (CA2 1986)). The Court does not cite--nor can it--
a circuit or state high court opinion to the contrary. See ante, at 278, n. 2.

7 To justify its statement that courts are "divided," ante, at 278, concerning FERPA's enforceability under $ 1983, the Court cites only two cases
disagreeing with the overwhelming majority position of courts reaching
the issue. See ante, at 278, n. 2 (citing Gundlach v. Reinstein, 924
F. Supp. 684 (ED Pa. 1996), aff'd, 114 F. 3d 1172 (CA3 1997), and Meury v.
Eagle-Union Community School Corp., 714 N. E. 2d 233, 239 (Ind. Ct.
App. 1999)). And Gundlach did not even squarely hold that FERPA
rights are unenforceable; rather, the court merely rejected a claim under

$ 1232 in which the plaintiff "failed to allege that Defendants released the
alleged educational records pursuant to university policy," 924 F. Supp.,
at 692.

Stevens, J., dissenting
under these principles, however, the Court has underminedboth of these assertions by needlessly borrowing from cases

involving implied rights of action--cases which place a moreexacting standard on plaintiffs. See ante, at 283-286. By
using these cases, the Court now appears to require a height-ened showing from $ 1983 plaintiffs: "[I]f Congress wishes to
create new rights enforceable under $ 1983, it must do so inclear and unambiguous terms--no less and no more than
what is required for Congress to create new rights enforce-able under an implied private right of action."

Ante, at 290.A requirement that Congress intend a "right to support a

cause of action," ante, at 283, as opposed to simply the cre-ation of an individual federal right, makes sense in the implied right of action context. As we have explained, our im-plied right of action cases "reflec[t] a concern, grounded in
separation of powers, that Congress rather than the courtscontrols the availability of remedies for violations of statutes." Wilder, 496 U. S., at 509, n. 9. However, imposingthe implied right of action framework upon the $ 1983 inquiry, see ante, at 283-286, is not necessary: The separation-of-powers concerns present in the implied right of action context "are not present in a $ 1983 case," because Congressexpressly authorized private suits in $ 1983 itself.

Wilder,496 U. S., at 509, n. 9. Nor is it consistent with our precedent, which has always treated the implied right of actionand $ 1983 inquiries as separate. See, e. g., ibid.

It has been long recognized that the pertinent question indetermining whether a statute provides a basis for a $ 1983

suit is whether Congress intended to create individual rightsbinding on States--as opposed to mere "precatory terms"
that do not "unambiguously" create state obligations, Penn8 Indeed, endorsing such a framework sub silentio overrules cases such
as Wright and Wilder. In those cases we concluded that the statutes at
issue created rights enforceable under $ 1983, but the statutes did not
"clear[ly] and unambiguous[ly]," ante, at 290, intend enforceability
under $ 1983.

hurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1,17, 18 (1981), or "generalized,"

"systemwide" duties on
States, Blessing, 520 U. S., at 343; Suter, 503 U. S., at 363.What has never before been required is congressional intent

specifically to make the right enforceable under $ 1983. Yetthat is exactly what the Court, at points, appears to require
by relying on implied right of action cases: the Court now
asks whether "Congress nonetheless intended private suitsto be brought before thousands of federal- and state-court

judges," ante, at 290.If it were true, as the Court claims, that the implied right
of action and $ 1983 inquiries neatly "overlap in one meaningful respect--in either case we must first determine whether
Congress intended to create a federal right," ante, at 283,
then I would have less trouble referencing implied right of
action precedent to determine whether a federal right exists.
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, however, our implied
right of action cases do not necessarily cleanly separate out
the "right" question from the "cause of action" question.
For example, in the discussion of rights-creating language in
Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677 (1979), which
the Court characterizes as pertaining only to whether there
is a right, ante, at 287, Cannon's reasoning is explicitly based
on whether there is "reason to infer a private remedy," 441
U. S., at 691, and the "propriety of implication of a cause of
action," id., at 690, n. 13. Because Cannon and other implied right of action cases do not clearly distinguish the questions of "right" and "cause of action," it is inappropriate to
use these cases to determine whether a statute creates
rights enforceable under $ 1983.

The Court, however, asserts that it has not imported the
entire implied right of action inquiry into the $ 1983 context,
explaining that while $ 1983 plaintiffs share with implied
right of action plaintiffs the burden of establishing a federal
right, $ 1983 plaintiffs "do not have the burden of showing an
intent to create a private remedy because $ 1983 generally

supplies a remedy for the vindication of rights secured by
federal statutes." Ante, at 284. If the Court has not
adopted such a requirement in the $ 1983 context--which it
purports not to have done--then there should be no difference between the Court's "new" approach to discerning a
federal right in the $ 1983 context and the test we have "traditionally" used, as articulated in Blessing: whether Congress intended to benefit individual plaintiffs, whether the
right asserted is not " `vague and amorphous,' " and whether
Congress has placed a binding obligation on the State with
respect to the right asserted. 520 U. S., at 340-341. Indeed, the Court's analysis, in part, closely tracks Blessing's
factors, as it examines the statute's language, and the asserted right's individual versus systematic thrust. See
ante, at 287-289.

The Court's opinion in other places, however, appears to
require more of plaintiffs. By defining the $ 1983 plaintiff 's
burden concerning "whether a statute confers any right at
all," ante, at 285, as whether "Congress nonetheless intended
private suits to be brought before thousands of federal- and
state-court judges," ante, at 290, the Court has collapsed the
ostensible two parts of the implied right of action test ("is
there a right" and "is it enforceable") into one. As a result,
and despite its statement to the contrary, ante, at 284, the
Court seems to place the unwarranted "burden of showing
an intent to create a private remedy," ibid., on $ 1983 plaintiffs. Moreover, by circularly defining a right actionable
under $ 1983 as, in essence, "a right which Congress intended
to make enforceable," the Court has eroded--if not eviscerated--the long-established principle of presumptive enforceability of rights under $ 1983. Under this reading of the
Court's opinion, a right under Blessing is second class compared to a right whose enforcement Congress has clearly intended. Creating such a hierarchy of rights is not only

ATKINS v. VIRGINIA
certiorari to the supreme court of virginia
No. 00-8452. Argued February 20, 2002--Decided June 20, 2002
Petitioner Atkins was convicted of capital murder and related crimes by a

Virginia jury and sentenced to death. Affirming, the Virginia Supreme
Court relied on Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, in rejecting Atkins'
contention that he could not be sentenced to death because he is mentally retarded.

Held: Executions of mentally retarded criminals are "cruel and unusual

punishments" prohibited by the Eighth Amendment. Pp. 311-321.

(a) A punishment is "excessive," and therefore prohibited by the
Amendment, if it is not graduated and proportioned to the offense.
E. g., Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 367. An excessiveness
claim is judged by currently prevailing standards of decency. Trop v.
Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100-101. Proportionality review under such evolving standards should be informed by objective factors to the maximum
possible extent, see, e. g., Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 1000, the
clearest and most reliable of which is the legislation enacted by the
country's legislatures, Penry, 492 U. S., at 331. In addition to objective
evidence, the Constitution contemplates that this Court will bring its
own judgment to bear by asking whether there is reason to agree or
disagree with the judgment reached by the citizenry and its legislators,
e. g., Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 597. Pp. 311-313.

(b) Much has changed since Penry's conclusion that the two state
statutes then existing that prohibited such executions, even when added
to the 14 States that had rejected capital punishment completely, did
not provide sufficient evidence of a consensus. 492 U. S., at 334. Subsequently, a significant number of States have concluded that death is
not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal, and similar
bills have passed at least one house in other States. It is not so much
the number of these States that is significant, but the consistency of the
direction of change. Given that anticrime legislation is far more popular than legislation protecting violent criminals, the large number of
States prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons (and the
complete absence of legislation reinstating such executions) provides
powerful evidence that today society views mentally retarded offenders
as categorically less culpable than the average criminal. The evidence
carries even greater force when it is noted that the legislatures addressing the issue have voted overwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.

Syllabus
Moreover, even in States allowing the execution of mentally retarded
offenders, the practice is uncommon. Pp. 313-317.

(c) An independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason for the
Court to disagree with the legislative consensus. Clinical definitions of
mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning,
but also significant limitations in adaptive skills. Mentally retarded
persons frequently know the difference between right and wrong and
are competent to stand trial, but, by definition, they have diminished
capacities to understand and process information, to communicate, to
abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical
reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand others' reactions.
Their deficiencies do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions,
but diminish their personal culpability. In light of these deficiencies,
the Court's death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons to agree
with the legislative consensus. First, there is a serious question
whether either justification underpinning the death penalty--retribution and deterrence of capital crimes--applies to mentally retarded offenders. As to retribution, the severity of the appropriate punishment
necessarily depends on the offender's culpability. If the culpability of
the average murderer is insufficient to justify imposition of death, see
Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, 433, the lesser culpability of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that form of retribution.
As to deterrence, the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that
make mentally retarded defendants less morally culpable also make it
less likely that they can process the information of the possibility of
execution as a penalty and, as a result, control their conduct based upon
that information. Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the death penalty's deterrent effect with respect to offenders who are not mentally retarded. Second, mentally retarded defendants in the aggregate face a special risk of wrongful execution because
of the possibility that they will unwittingly confess to crimes they did
not commit, their lesser ability to give their counsel meaningful assistance, and the facts that they are typically poor witnesses and that their
demeanor may create an unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for
their crimes. Pp. 317-321.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
Those mentally retarded persons who meet the law's re-quirements for criminal responsibility should be tried and

punished when they commit crimes. Because of their disa-bilities in areas of reasoning, judgment, and control of their
impulses, however, they do not act with the level of moralculpability that characterizes the most serious adult criminal
conduct. Moreover, their impairments can jeopardize the

Opinion of the Court
reliability and fairness of capital proceedings against men-tally retarded defendants. Presumably for these reasons, in

the 13 years since we decided Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S.302 (1989), the American public, legislators, scholars, and
judges have deliberated over the question whether the deathpenalty should ever be imposed on a mentally retarded criminal. The consensus reflected in those deliberations informsour answer to the question presented by this case: whether
such executions are "cruel and unusual punishments" prohib-ited by the Eighth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.

I
Petitioner, Daryl Renard Atkins, was convicted of abduc-tion, armed robbery, and capital murder, and sentenced to

death. At approximately midnight on August 16, 1996, At-kins and William Jones, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, abducted Eric Nesbitt, robbed him of the money on hisperson, drove him to an automated teller machine in his
pickup truck where cameras recorded their withdrawal ofadditional cash, then took him to an isolated location where
he was shot eight times and killed.Jones and Atkins both testified in the guilt phase of Atkins' trial.1 Each confirmed most of the details in the oth-er's account of the incident, with the important exception
that each stated that the other had actually shot and killedNesbitt. Jones' testimony, which was both more coherent
and credible than Atkins', was obviously credited by the juryand was sufficient to establish Atkins' guilt.

2 At the penalty

1 Initially, both Jones and Atkins were indicted for capital murder. The
prosecution ultimately permitted Jones to plead guilty to first-degree murder in exchange for his testimony against Atkins. As a result of the plea,
Jones became ineligible to receive the death penalty.

2 Highly damaging to the credibility of Atkins' testimony was its substantial inconsistency with the statement he gave to the police upon his
arrest. Jones, in contrast, had declined to make an initial statement to
the authorities.

Opinion of the Court
phase of the trial, the State introduced victim impact evidence and proved two aggravating circumstances: future
dangerousness and "vileness of the offense." To prove future dangerousness, the State relied on Atkins' prior felony
convictions as well as the testimony of four victims of earlier
robberies and assaults. To prove the second aggravator, the
prosecution relied upon the trial record, including pictures
of the deceased's body and the autopsy report.

In the penalty phase, the defense relied on one witness,
Dr. Evan Nelson, a forensic psychologist who had evaluated
Atkins before trial and concluded that he was "mildly mentally retarded." 3 His conclusion was based on interviews
with people who knew Atkins,4 a review of school and court

3 The American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) defines
mental retardation as follows: "Mental retardation refers to substantial
limitations in present functioning. It is characterized by significantly
subaverage intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with related
limitations in two or more of the following applicable adaptive skill areas:
communication, self-care, home living, social skills, community use, selfdirection, health and safety, functional academics, leisure, and work.
Mental retardation manifests before age 18." Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).

The American Psychiatric Association's definition is similar: "The essential feature of Mental Retardation is significantly subaverage general
intellectual functioning (Criterion A) that is accompanied by significant
limitations in adaptive functioning in at least two of the following
skill areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal
skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic
skills, work, leisure, health, and safety (Criterion B). The onset must
occur before age 18 years (Criterion C). Mental Retardation has many
different etiologies and may be seen as a final common pathway of various pathological processes that affect the functioning of the central
nervous system." Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 41 (4th ed. 2000). "Mild" mental retardation is typically used to
describe people with an IQ level of 50-55 to approximately 70. Id., at
42-43.

4 The doctor interviewed Atkins, members of his family, and deputies

at the jail where he had been incarcerated for the preceding 18 months.
Dr. Nelson also reviewed the statements that Atkins had given to the
police and the investigative reports concerning this case.

records, and the administration of a standard intelligencetest which indicated that Atkins had a full scale IQ of 59.

The jury sentenced Atkins to death, but the Virginia Su-preme Court ordered a second sentencing hearing because

the trial court had used a misleading verdict form. 257 Va.160, 510 S. E. 2d 445 (1999). At the resentencing, Dr. Nelson
again testified. The State presented an expert rebuttal wit-ness, Dr. Stanton Samenow, who expressed the opinion that
Atkins was not mentally retarded, but rather was of "aver-age intelligence, at least," and diagnosable as having antisocial personality disorder.6 App. 476. The jury again sen-tenced Atkins to death.

5 Dr. Nelson administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales test
(WAIS-III), the standard instrument in the United States for assessing intellectual functioning. AAMR, Mental Retardation, supra. The
WAIS-III is scored by adding together the number of points earned on
different subtests, and using a mathematical formula to convert this raw
score into a scaled score. The test measures an intelligence range from
45 to 155. The mean score of the test is 100, which means that a person
receiving a score of 100 is considered to have an average level of cognitive
functioning. A. Kaufman & E. Lichtenberger, Essentials of WAIS-III
Assessment 60 (1999). It is estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of
the population has an IQ between 70 and 75 or lower, which is typically
considered the cutoff IQ score for the intellectual function prong of the
mental retardation definition. 2 Kaplan & Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 2952 (B. Sadock & V. Sadock eds. 7th ed. 2000).

At the sentencing phase, Dr. Nelson testified: "[Atkins'] full scale IQ
is 59. Compared to the population at large, that means less than one
percentile. . . . Mental retardation is a relatively rare thing. It's about
one percent of the population." App. 274. According to Dr. Nelson, Atkins' IQ score "would automatically qualify for Social Security disability
income." Id., at 280. Dr. Nelson also indicated that of the over 40 capital
defendants that he had evaluated, Atkins was only the second individual
who met the criteria for mental retardation. Id., at 310. He testified
that, in his opinion, Atkins' limited intellect had been a consistent feature
throughout his life, and that his IQ score of 59 is not an "aberration, malingered result, or invalid test score." Id., at 308.

6 Dr. Samenow's testimony was based upon two interviews with Atkins,

a review of his school records, and interviews with correctional staff. He
did not administer an intelligence test, but did ask Atkins questions taken
from the 1972 version of the Wechsler Memory Scale. Id., at 524-525,

310 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of the Court
The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed the imposition ofthe death penalty. 260 Va. 375, 385, 534 S. E. 2d 312, 318

(2000). Atkins did not argue before the Virginia SupremeCourt that his sentence was disproportionate to penalties imposed for similar crimes in Virginia, but he did contend "thathe is mentally retarded and thus cannot be sentenced to
death." Id., at 386, 534 S. E. 2d, at 318. The majority ofthe state court rejected this contention, relying on our holding in Penry. 260 Va., at 387, 534 S. E. 2d, at 319. Thecourt was "not willing to commute Atkins' sentence of death
to life imprisonment merely because of his IQ score." Id.,at 390, 534 S. E. 2d, at 321.

Justice Hassell and Justice Koontz dissented. They re-jected Dr. Samenow's opinion that Atkins possesses average
intelligence as "incredulous as a matter of law," and con-cluded that "the imposition of the sentence of death upon a
criminal defendant who has the mental age of a child be-tween the ages of 9 and 12 is excessive."

Id., at 394, 395-396, 534 S. E. 2d, at 323-324. In their opinion, "it is indefensible to conclude that individuals who are mentally retardedare not to some degree less culpable for their criminal acts.
By definition, such individuals have substantial limitationsnot shared by the general population. A moral and civilized
society diminishes itself if its system of justice does not af-ford recognition and consideration of those limitations in a
meaningful way." Id., at 397, 534 S. E. 2d, at 325.Because of the gravity of the concerns expressed by the
dissenters, and in light of the dramatic shift in the state leg-islative landscape that has occurred in the past 13 years, we
granted certiorari to revisit the issue that we first addressedin the

Penry case. 533 U. S. 976 (2001).

529. Dr. Samenow attributed Atkins' "academic performance [that was]
by and large terrible" to the fact that he "is a person who chose to pay
attention sometimes, not to pay attention others, and did poorly because
he did not want to do what he was required to do." Id., at 480-481.

Opinion of the Court

II
The Eighth Amendment succinctly prohibits "[e]xcessive"
sanctions. It provides: "Excessive bail shall not be re-quired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual

punishments inflicted." In Weems v. United States, 217U. S. 349 (1910), we held that a punishment of 12 years jailed
in irons at hard and painful labor for the crime of falsifyingrecords was excessive. We explained "that it is a precept
of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated andproportioned to [the] offense."

Id., at 367. We have repeatedly applied this proportionality precept in later casesinterpreting the Eighth Amendment. See

Harmelin v.
Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 997-998 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also id., at1009-1011 (White, J., dissenting).

7 Thus, even though "imprisonment for ninety days is not, in the abstract, a punish-ment which is either cruel or unusual," it may not be imposed

as a penalty for "the `status' of narcotic addiction," Robinsonv.

California, 370 U. S. 660, 666-667 (1962), because such a
sanction would be excessive. As Justice Stewart explainedin

Robinson: "Even one day in prison would be a cruel and
unusual punishment for the `crime' of having a common
cold." Id., at 667.

A claim that punishment is excessive is judged not by the
standards that prevailed in 1685 when Lord Jeffreys presided over the "Bloody Assizes" or when the Bill of Rights
was adopted, but rather by those that currently prevail. As
Chief Justice Warren explained in his opinion in Trop v.
Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (1958): "The basic concept underlying
the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of
man. . . . The Amendment must draw its meaning from the

7 Thus, we have read the text of the Amendment to prohibit all excessive
punishments, as well as cruel and unusual punishments that may or may
not be excessive.

evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of amaturing society." Id., at 100-101.

Proportionality review under those evolving standardsshould be informed by " `objective factors to the maximum
possible extent,' " see Harmelin, 501 U. S., at 1000 (quotingRummel v. Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 274-275 (1980)). We have
pinpointed that the "clearest and most reliable objective evi-dence of contemporary values is the legislation enacted by
the country's legislatures." Penry, 492 U. S., at 331. Rely-ing in part on such legislative evidence, we have held that
death is an impermissibly excessive punishment for the rapeof an adult woman,

Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 593-596(1977), or for a defendant who neither took life, attempted to

take life, nor intended to take life, Enmund v. Florida, 458U. S. 782, 789-793 (1982). In Coker, we focused primarily
on the then-recent legislation that had been enacted in re-sponse to our decision 10 years earlier in Furman v. Georgia,
408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), to support the conclusionthat the "current judgment," though "not wholly unanimous," weighed very heavily on the side of rejecting capitalpunishment as a "suitable penalty for raping an adult
woman." Coker, 433 U. S., at 596. The "current legisla-tive judgment" relevant to our decision in

Enmund was lessclear than in Coker but "nevertheless weigh[ed] on the side

of rejecting capital punishment for the crime at issue."Enmund, 458 U. S., at 793.

We also acknowledged in Coker that the objective evi-dence, though of great importance, did not "wholly determine" the controversy, "for the Constitution contemplatesthat in the end our own judgment will be brought to bear on
the question of the acceptability of the death penalty underthe Eighth Amendment." 433 U. S., at 597. For example,
in Enmund, we concluded by expressing our own judgmentabout the issue:

"For purposes of imposing the death penalty, Enmund'scriminal

culpability must be limited to his participation

Opinion of the Court
in the robbery, and his punishment must be tailored tohis personal responsibility and moral guilt. Putting

Enmund to death to avenge two killings that he did notcommit and had no intention of committing or causing
does not measurably contribute to the retributive end ofensuring that the criminal gets his just deserts. This
is the judgment of most of the legislatures that have
recently addressed the matter, and we have no reasonto disagree with that judgment for purposes of construing and applying the Eighth Amendment." 458 U. S.,at 801 (emphasis added).

Thus, in cases involving a consensus, our own judgment is"brought to bear," Coker, 433 U. S., at 597, by asking
whether there is reason to disagree with the judgmentreached by the citizenry and its legislators.

Guided by our approach in these cases, we shall first re-view the judgment of legislatures that have addressed the
suitability of imposing the death penalty on the mentally re-tarded and then consider reasons for agreeing or disagreeing
with their judgment. III

The parties have not called our attention to any state leg-islative consideration of the suitability of imposing the death
penalty on mentally retarded offenders prior to 1986. Inthat year, the public reaction to the execution of a mentally
retarded murderer in Georgia 8 apparently led to the enact8 Jerome Bowden, who was identified as having mental retardation when
he was 14 years old, was scheduled for imminent execution in Georgia in
June 1986. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles granted a stay
following public protests over his execution. A psychologist selected by
the State evaluated Bowden and determined that he had an IQ of 65,
which is consistent with mental retardation. Nevertheless, the board
lifted the stay and Bowden was executed the following day. The board
concluded that Bowden understood the nature of his crime and his punishment and therefore that execution, despite his mental deficiencies, was
permissible. See Montgomery, Bowden's Execution Stirs Protest, Atlanta
Journal, Oct. 13, 1986, p. A1.

ment of the first state statute prohibiting such executions.9In 1988, when Congress enacted legislation reinstating the

federal death penalty, it expressly provided that a "sentenceof death shall not be carried out upon a person who is mentally retarded." 10 In 1989, Maryland enacted a similar pro-hibition.

11 It was in that year that we decided Penry, and

concluded that those two state enactments, "even whenadded to the 14 States that have rejected capital punishment

completely, do not provide sufficient evidence at present of anational consensus." 492 U. S., at 334.

Much has changed since then. Responding to the nationalattention received by the Bowden execution and our decision
in Penry, state legislatures across the country began to ad-dress the issue. In 1990, Kentucky and Tennessee enacted
statutes similar to those in Georgia and Maryland, as didNew Mexico in 1991, and Arkansas, Colorado, Washington,
Indiana, and Kansas in 1993 and 1994.12 In 1995, when NewYork reinstated its death penalty, it emulated the Federal
Government by expressly exempting the mentally re-tarded.

categorically excluding the mentally retarded from the death penalty. In
fact, he stated: "We do not execute mentally retarded murderers today."
See Veto Proclamation for H. B. No. 236. Instead, his motivation to veto
the bill was based upon what he perceived as a procedural flaw: "My opposition to this legislation focuses on a serious legal flaw in the bill. House
Bill No. 236 would create a system whereby the jury and judge are asked
to make the same determination based on two different sets of facts. . . .
Also of grave concern is the fact that the provision that sets up this legally
flawed process never received a public hearing during the legislative
process." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
complete absence of States passing legislation reinstatingthe power to conduct such executions) provides powerful evidence that today our society views mentally retarded offend-ers as categorically less culpable than the average criminal.
The evidence carries even greater force when it is noted thatthe legislatures that have addressed the issue have voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the prohibition.19 Moreover,even in those States that allow the execution of mentally
retarded offenders, the practice is uncommon. Some States,for example New Hampshire and New Jersey, continue to
authorize executions, but none have been carried out in dec-ades. Thus there is little need to pursue legislation barring
the execution of the mentally retarded in those States. Andit appears that even among those States that regularly execute offenders and that have no prohibition with regard tothe mentally retarded, only five have executed offenders possessing a known IQ less than 70 since we decided Penry.20The practice, therefore, has become truly unusual, and it is
fair to say that a national consensus has developed againstit.

representatives of widely diverse religious communities in the United

of persons with mental retardation cannot be morally justified." Brief

Opinion of the Court
To the extent there is serious disagreement about the exe-cution of mentally retarded offenders, it is in determining

which offenders are in fact retarded. In this case, for in-stance, the Commonwealth of Virginia disputes that Atkins
suffers from mental retardation. Not all people who claimto be mentally retarded will be so impaired as to fall within
the range of mentally retarded offenders about whom thereis a national consensus. As was our approach in

Fordv. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399 (1986), with regard to insanity,

"we leave to the State[s] the task of developing appropriateways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon [their]
execution of sentences." Id., at 405, 416-417.22

IV
This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judg-ment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardationand the penological purposes served by the death penalty.
Additionally, it suggests that some characteristics of mentalretardation undermine the strength of the procedural protections that our capital jurisprudence steadfastly guards.
over, within the world community, the imposition of the death penalty
for crimes committed by mentally retarded offenders is overwhelmingly
disapproved. Brief for European Union as Amicus Curiae 4. Finally,
polling data shows a widespread consensus among Americans, even those
who support the death penalty, that executing the mentally retarded is
wrong. Bonner & Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as
Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1; App. B to Brief for
AAMR et al. as Amici Curiae (appending approximately 20 state and
national polls on the issue). Although these factors are by no means dispositive, their consistency with the legislative evidence lends further support to our conclusion that there is a consensus among those who have
addressed the issue. See Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 830, 831,
n. 31 (1988) (considering the views of "respected professional organizations, by other nations that share our Anglo-American heritage, and by
the leading members of the Western European community").

generally conform to the clinical definitions set forth in n. 3, supra.

318 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of the Court
As discussed above, clinical definitions of mental retardation require not only subaverage intellectual functioning, but
also significant limitations in adaptive skills such as communication, self-care, and self-direction that became manifest
before age 18. Mentally retarded persons frequently know
the difference between right and wrong and are competent
to stand trial. Because of their impairments, however, by
definition they have diminished capacities to understand and
process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes and learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand the reactions of
others.23 There is no evidence that they are more likely to
engage in criminal conduct than others, but there is abundant evidence that they often act on impulse rather than
pursuant to a premeditated plan, and that in group settings
they are followers rather than leaders.24 Their deficiencies
do not warrant an exemption from criminal sanctions, but
they do diminish their personal culpability.

In light of these deficiencies, our death penalty jurisprudence provides two reasons consistent with the legislative
consensus that the mentally retarded should be categorically
excluded from execution. First, there is a serious question
as to whether either justification that we have recognized as

Opinion of the Court
a basis for the death penalty applies to mentally retardedoffenders.

Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 183 (1976) ( joint
opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.), identified"retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective

offenders" as the social purposes served by the death pen-alty. Unless the imposition of the death penalty on a mentally retarded person "measurably contributes to one or both
of these goals, it `is nothing more than the purposeless andneedless imposition of pain and suffering,' and hence an unconstitutional punishment." Enmund, 458 U. S., at 798.With respect to retribution--the interest in seeing that
the offender gets his "just deserts"--the severity of the appropriate punishment necessarily depends on the culpability
of the offender. Since Gregg, our jurisprudence has consistently confined the imposition of the death penalty to a narrow category of the most serious crimes. For example, in
Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980), we set aside a death
sentence because the petitioner's crimes did not reflect "a
consciousness materially more `depraved' than that of any
person guilty of murder." Id., at 433. If the culpability of
the average murderer is insufficient to justify the most extreme sanction available to the State, the lesser culpability
of the mentally retarded offender surely does not merit that
form of retribution. Thus, pursuant to our narrowing jurisprudence, which seeks to ensure that only the most deserving of execution are put to death, an exclusion for the mentally retarded is appropriate.

With respect to deterrence--the interest in preventing
capital crimes by prospective offenders--"it seems likely
that `capital punishment can serve as a deterrent only when
murder is the result of premeditation and deliberation,' " Enmund, 458 U. S., at 799. Exempting the mentally retarded
from that punishment will not affect the "cold calculus that
precedes the decision" of other potential murderers. Gregg,
428 U. S., at 186. Indeed, that sort of calculus is at the opposite end of the spectrum from behavior of mentally retarded

536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
320 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Opinion of the Court
offenders. The theory of deterrence in capital sentencing is
predicated upon the notion that the increased severity of the
punishment will inhibit criminal actors from carrying out
murderous conduct. Yet it is the same cognitive and behavioral impairments that make these defendants less morally
culpable--for example, the diminished ability to understand
and process information, to learn from experience, to engage
in logical reasoning, or to control impulses--that also make
it less likely that they can process the information of the
possibility of execution as a penalty and, as a result, control
their conduct based upon that information. Nor will exempting the mentally retarded from execution lessen the deterrent effect of the death penalty with respect to offenders
who are not mentally retarded. Such individuals are unprotected by the exemption and will continue to face the threat
of execution. Thus, executing the mentally retarded will
not measurably further the goal of deterrence.

The reduced capacity of mentally retarded offenders provides a second justification for a categorical rule making such
offenders ineligible for the death penalty. The risk "that
the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which
may call for a less severe penalty," Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U. S.
586, 605 (1978), is enhanced, not only by the possibility of
false confessions,25 but also by the lesser ability of mentally
retarded defendants to make a persuasive showing of mitigation in the face of prosecutorial evidence of one or more
aggravating factors. Mentally retarded defendants may be
less able to give meaningful assistance to their counsel and

25 See Everington & Fulero 212-213. Despite the heavy burden that
the prosecution must shoulder in capital cases, we cannot ignore the fact
that in recent years a disturbing number of inmates on death row have
been exonerated. These exonerations have included at least one mentally
retarded person who unwittingly confessed to a crime that he did not
commit. See Baker, Death-Row Inmate Gets Clemency; Agreement Ends

are typically poor witnesses, and their demeanor may createan unwarranted impression of lack of remorse for their

crimes. As Penry demonstrated, moreover, reliance onmental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged
sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravatingfactor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury.
492 U. S., at 323-325. Mentally retarded defendants in the
aggregate face a special risk of wrongful execution.Our independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason

to disagree with the judgment of "the legislatures that haverecently addressed the matter" and concluded that death is
not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal.We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or
the retributive purpose of the death penalty. Construing
and applying the Eighth Amendment in the light of our
"evolving standards of decency," we therefore conclude that
such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution
"places a substantive restriction on the State's power to take
the life" of a mentally retarded offender. Ford, 477 U. S.,
at 405.

The judgment of the Virginia Supreme Court is reversed,
and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Scalia
and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.

The question presented by this case is whether a national
consensus deprives Virginia of the constitutional power to
impose the death penalty on capital murder defendants like
petitioner, i. e., those defendants who indisputably are competent to stand trial, aware of the punishment they are about
to suffer and why, and whose mental retardation has been
found an insufficiently compelling reason to lessen their individual responsibility for the crime. The Court pronounces

536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
322 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
the punishment cruel and unusual primarily because 18States recently have passed laws limiting the death eligibility of certain defendants based on mental retardation alone,despite the fact that the laws of 19 other States besides Virginia continue to leave the question of proper punishment tothe individuated consideration of sentencing judges or juries
familiar with the particular offender and his or her crime.
See ante, at 314-315.I agree with

Justice Scalia, post, at 337-338 (dissenting
opinion), that the Court's assessment of the current legisla-tive judgment regarding the execution of defendants like

petitioner more resembles a post hoc rationalization for the
majority's subjectively preferred result rather than any objective effort to ascertain the content of an evolving standard
of decency. I write separately, however, to call attention to
the defects in the Court's decision to place weight on foreign
laws, the views of professional and religious organizations,
and opinion polls in reaching its conclusion. See ante, at
316-317, n. 21. The Court's suggestion that these sources
are relevant to the constitutional question finds little support
in our precedents and, in my view, is antithetical to considerations of federalism, which instruct that any "permanent
prohibition upon all units of democratic government must
[be apparent] in the operative acts (laws and the application
of laws) that the people have approved." Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 377 (1989) (plurality opinion). The
Court's uncritical acceptance of the opinion poll data brought
to our attention, moreover, warrants additional comment, because we lack sufficient information to conclude that the surveys were conducted in accordance with generally accepted
scientific principles or are capable of supporting valid empirical inferences about the issue before us.

In making determinations about whether a punishment is
"cruel and unusual" under the evolving standards of decency
embraced by the Eighth Amendment, we have emphasized
that legislation is the "clearest and most reliable objective

evidence of contemporary values." Penry v. Lynaugh, 492U. S. 302, 331 (1989). See also

McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S.
279, 300 (1987). The reason we ascribe primacy to legisla-tive enactments follows from the constitutional role legislatures play in expressing policy of a State. " `[I]n a demo-cratic society legislatures, not courts, are constituted to
respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the
people.' " Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 175-176 (1976)( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.) (quoting
Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 383 (1972) (Burger, C. J.,dissenting)). And because the specifications of punishments

are "peculiarly questions of legislative policy," Gore v.
United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393 (1958), our cases have cautioned against using " `the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual
Punishment Clause' " to cut off the normal democratic processes, Gregg, supra, at 176 (quoting Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S.
514, 533 (1968) (plurality opinion)).

Our opinions have also recognized that data concerning the actions of sentencing juries, though entitled to less
weight than legislative judgments, " `is a significant and reliable objective index of contemporary values,' " Coker v.
Georgia, 433 U. S. 584, 596 (1977) (plurality opinion) (quoting
Gregg, supra, at 181), because of the jury's intimate involvement in the case and its function of " `maintain[ing] a link
between contemporary community values and the penal system,' " Gregg, supra, at 181 (quoting Witherspoon v. Illinois,
391 U. S. 510, 519, n. 15 (1968)). In Coker, supra, at 596-597,
for example, we credited data showing that "at least 9 out of
10" juries in Georgia did not impose the death sentence for
rape convictions. And in Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782,
793-794 (1982), where evidence of the current legislative
judgment was not as "compelling" as that in Coker (but more
so than that here), we were persuaded by "overwhelming
[evidence] that American juries . . . repudiated imposition of
the death penalty" for a defendant who neither took life nor
attempted or intended to take life.

324 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
In my view, these two sources--the work product of legislatures and sentencing jury determinations--ought to be the
sole indicators by which courts ascertain the contemporary
American conceptions of decency for purposes of the Eighth
Amendment. They are the only objective indicia of contemporary values firmly supported by our precedents. More
importantly, however, they can be reconciled with the undeniable precepts that the democratic branches of government
and individual sentencing juries are, by design, better suited
than courts to evaluating and giving effect to the complex
societal and moral considerations that inform the selection
of publicly acceptable criminal punishments.

In reaching its conclusion today, the Court does not take
notice of the fact that neither petitioner nor his amici have
adduced any comprehensive statistics that would conclusively prove (or disprove) whether juries routinely consider
death a disproportionate punishment for mentally retarded
offenders like petitioner.* Instead, it adverts to the fact
that other countries have disapproved imposition of the
death penalty for crimes committed by mentally retarded
offenders, see ante, at 316-317, n. 21 (citing the Brief for
European Union as Amicus Curiae 2). I fail to see, how*Apparently no such statistics exist. See Brief for American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as Amici Curiae 19, n. 29 (noting that
"actions by individual prosecutors and by juries are difficult to quantify
with precision"). Petitioner's inability to muster studies in his favor
ought to cut against him, for it is his "heavy burden," Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 373 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted), to establish a national consensus against a punishment deemed acceptable by
the Virginia Legislature and jury who sentenced him. Furthermore, it is
worth noting that experts have estimated that as many as 10 percent of
death row inmates are mentally retarded, see R. Bonner & S. Rimer, Executing the Mentally Retarded Even as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times,
Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1, a number which suggests that sentencing juries are
not as reluctant to impose the death penalty on defendants like petitioner
as was the case in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977), and Enmund v.
Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982).

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
ever, how the views of other countries regarding the punish-ment of their citizens provide any support for the Court's

ultimate determination. While it is true that some of ourprior opinions have looked to "the climate of international
opinion," Coker, supra, at 596, n. 10, to reinforce a conclusionregarding evolving standards of decency, see

Thompson v.
Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 830 (1988) (plurality opinion); Enmund, supra, at 796-797, n. 22; Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86,102-103 (1958) (plurality opinion); we have since explicitly

rejected the idea that the sentencing practices of other coun-tries could "serve to establish the first Eighth Amendment
prerequisite, that [a] practice is accepted among our people."
Stanford, 492 U. S., at 369, n. 1 (emphasizing that "American
conceptions of decency . . . are dispositive" (emphasis in
original)).

Stanford's reasoning makes perfectly good sense, and the
Court offers no basis to question it. For if it is evidence
of a national consensus for which we are looking, then the
viewpoints of other countries simply are not relevant. And
nothing in Thompson, Enmund, Coker, or Trop suggests
otherwise. Thompson, Enmund, and Coker rely only on the
bare citation of international laws by the Trop plurality as
authority to deem other countries' sentencing choices germane. But the Trop plurality--representing the view of
only a minority of the Court--offered no explanation for its
own citation, and there is no reason to resurrect this view
given our sound rejection of the argument in Stanford.

To further buttress its appraisal of contemporary societal
values, the Court marshals public opinion poll results and
evidence that several professional organizations and religious groups have adopted official positions opposing the imposition of the death penalty upon mentally retarded offenders. See ante, at 316-317, n. 21 (citing Brief for American
Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for
American Association on Mental Retardation et al. as Amici
Curiae; noting that "representatives of widely diverse reli536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN

gious communities . . . reflecting Christian, Jewish, Muslim,and Buddhist traditions . . . `share a conviction that the execution of persons with mental retardation cannot be morallyjustified' "; and stating that "polling data shows a widespread
consensus among Americans . . . that executing the mentallyretarded is wrong"). In my view, none should be accorded
any weight on the Eighth Amendment scale when the
elected representatives of a State's populace have notdeemed them persuasive enough to prompt legislative action.

In Penry, 492 U. S., at 334-335, we were cited similar dataand declined to take them into consideration where the "public sentiment expressed in [them]" had yet to find expression
in state law. See also Stanford, 492 U. S., at 377 (plurality
opinion) (refusing "the invitation to rest constitutional law
upon such uncertain foundations" as "public opinion polls, the
views of interest groups, and the positions adopted by various professional associations"). For the Court to rely on
such data today serves only to illustrate its willingness to
proscribe by judicial fiat--at the behest of private organizations speaking only for themselves--a punishment about
which no across-the-board consensus has developed through
the workings of normal democratic processes in the laboratories of the States.

Even if I were to accept the legitimacy of the Court's decision to reach beyond the product of legislatures and practices
of sentencing juries to discern a national standard of decency,
I would take issue with the blind-faith credence it accords
the opinion polls brought to our attention. An extensive
body of social science literature describes how methodological and other errors can affect the reliability and validity of
estimates about the opinions and attitudes of a population
derived from various sampling techniques. Everything
from variations in the survey methodology, such as the choice
of the target population, the sampling design used, the questions asked, and the statistical analyses used to interpret
the data can skew the results. See, e. g., R. Groves, Survey

Errors and Survey Costs (1989); 1 C. Turner & E. Martin,
Surveying Subjective Phenomena (1984).

The Federal Judicial Center's Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence 221-271 (1994) and its Manual for Complex Litigation $ 21.493, pp. 101-103 (3d ed. 1995), offer helpful suggestions to judges called upon to assess the weight and
admissibility of survey evidence on a factual issue before a
court. Looking at the polling data (reproduced in the Appendix to this opinion) in light of these factors, one cannot
help but observe how unlikely it is that the data could support a valid inference about the question presented by this
case. For example, the questions reported to have been
asked in the various polls do not appear designed to gauge
whether the respondents might find the death penalty an
acceptable punishment for mentally retarded offenders in
rare cases. Most are categorical (e. g., "Do you think that
persons convicted of murder who are mentally retarded
should or should not receive the death penalty?"), and, as
such, would not elicit whether the respondent might agree
or disagree that all mentally retarded people by definition
can never act with the level of culpability associated with the
death penalty, regardless of the severity of their impairment
or the individual circumstances of their crime. Second, none
of the 27 polls cited disclose the targeted survey population
or the sampling techniques used by those who conducted the
research. Thus, even if one accepts that the survey instruments were adequately designed to address a relevant question, it is impossible to know whether the sample was representative enough or the methodology sufficiently sound to
tell us anything about the opinions of the citizens of a particular State or the American public at large. Finally, the information provided to us does not indicate why a particular
survey was conducted or, in a few cases, by whom, factors
which also can bear on the objectivity of the results. In
order to be credited here, such surveys should be offered as

There are strong reasons for limiting our inquiry into whatconstitutes an evolving standard of decency under the

Eighth Amendment to the laws passed by legislatures andthe practices of sentencing juries in America. Here, the
Court goes beyond these well-established objective indica-tors of contemporary values. It finds "further support to

defendants in international opinion, the views of professionaland religious organizations, and opinion polls not demonstrated to be reliable. Ante, at 317, n. 21. Believing thisview to be seriously mistaken, I dissent.

Scalia, J., dissenting
an otherwise just death penalty inappropriate. Seldom hasan opinion of this Court rested so obviously upon nothing

but the personal views of its Members.

I
I begin with a brief restatement of facts that are abridgedby the Court but important to understanding this case.

After spending the day drinking alcohol and smoking mari-juana, petitioner Daryl Renard Atkins and a partner in crime
drove to a convenience store, intending to rob a customer.Their victim was Eric Nesbitt, an airman from Langley Air
Force Base, whom they abducted, drove to a nearby auto-mated teller machine, and forced to withdraw $200. They
then drove him to a deserted area, ignoring his pleas to leavehim unharmed. According to the co-conspirator, whose testimony the jury evidently credited, Atkins ordered Nesbittout of the vehicle and, after he had taken only a few steps,
shot him one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight times inthe thorax, chest, abdomen, arms, and legs.

The jury convicted Atkins of capital murder. At resen-tencing (the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed his conviction
but remanded for resentencing because the trial court hadused an improper verdict form, 257 Va. 160, 179, 510 S. E. 2d
445, 457 (1999)), the jury heard extensive evidence of peti-tioner's alleged mental retardation. A psychologist testified
that petitioner was mildly mentally retarded with an IQ of59, that he was a "slow learner," App. 444, who showed a
"lack of success in pretty much every domain of his life," id.,at 442, and that he had an "impaired" capacity to appreciate
the criminality of his conduct and to conform his conductto the law,

id., at 453. Petitioner's family members offeredadditional evidence in support of his mental retardation

claim (e. g., that petitioner is a "follower," id., at 421). TheCommonwealth contested the evidence of retardation and
presented testimony of a psychologist who found "absolutelyno evidence other than the IQ score . . . indicating that [peti536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tioner] was in the least bit mentally retarded" and concludedthat petitioner was "of average intelligence, at least." Id.,

at 476.The jury also heard testimony about petitioner's 16 prior
felony convictions for robbery, attempted robbery, abduction,use of a firearm, and maiming. Id., at 491-522. The victims of these offenses provided graphic depictions of peti-tioner's violent tendencies: He hit one over the head with a
beer bottle, id., at 406; he slapped a gun across another vic-tim's face, clubbed her in the head with it, knocked her to
the ground, and then helped her up, only to shoot her in thestomach,

id., at 411-413. The jury sentenced petitioner todeath. The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed petitioner's

sentence. 260 Va. 375, 534 S. E. 2d 312 (2000).

II
As the foregoing history demonstrates, petitioner's mentalretardation was a

central issue at sentencing. The jury con-cluded, however, that his alleged retardation was not a compelling reason to exempt him from the death penalty in lightof the brutality of his crime and his long demonstrated propensity for violence. "In upsetting this particularized judg-ment on the basis of a constitutional absolute," the Court
concludes that no one who is even slightly mentally retardedcan have sufficient "moral responsibility to be subjected to
capital punishment for any crime. As a sociological andmoral conclusion that is implausible; and it is doubly implausible as an interpretation of the United States Constitution."
Thompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 815, 863-864 (1988)(

Scalia, J., dissenting).Under our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence, a punishment is "cruel and unusual" if it falls within one of two cate-gories: "those modes or acts of punishment that had been
considered cruel and unusual at the time that the Bill ofRights was adopted,"

Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U. S. 399, 405(1986), and modes of punishment that are inconsistent with

modern " `standards of decency,' " as evinced by objectiveindicia, the most important of which is "legislation enacted

by the country's legislatures," Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S.302, 330-331 (1989).

The Court makes no pretense that execution of the mildlymentally retarded would have been considered "cruel and
unusual" in 1791. Only the severely or profoundly mentally
retarded, commonly known as "idiots," enjoyed any specialstatus under the law at that time. They, like lunatics, suffered a "deficiency in will" rendering them unable to tellright from wrong. 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 24 (1769) (hereinafter Blackstone); see also
Penry, 492 U. S., at 331-332 ("[T]he term `idiot' was generally used to describe persons who had a total lack of reason
or understanding, or an inability to distinguish between good
and evil"); id., at 333 (citing sources indicating that idiots
generally had an IQ of 25 or below, which would place them
within the "profound" or "severe" range of mental retardation under modern standards); 2 A. Fitz-Herbert, Natura
Brevium 233B (9th ed. 1794) (originally published 1534) (An
idiot is "such a person who cannot account or number twenty
pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how
old he is, etc., so as it may appear that he hath no understanding of reason what shall be for his profit, or what for
his loss"). Due to their incompetence, idiots were "excuse[d] from the guilt, and of course from the punishment, of
any criminal action committed under such deprivation of the
senses." 4 Blackstone 25; see also Penry, supra, at 331.
Instead, they were often committed to civil confinement or
made wards of the State, thereby preventing them from
"go[ing] loose, to the terror of the king's subjects." 4 Blackstone 25; see also S. Brakel, J. Parry, & B. Weiner, The Mentally Disabled and the Law 12-14 (3d ed. 1985); 1 Blackstone
292-296; 1 M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 33 (1st Am. ed. 1847).

and punishment, including capital punishment. See, e. g., I.Ray, Medical Jurisprudence of Insanity 65, 87-92 (W. Overholser ed. 1962) (recounting the 1834 trial and execution inConcord, New Hampshire, of an apparent "imbecile"--imbecility being a less severe form of retardation which "differsfrom idiocy in the circumstance that while in [the idiot] there
is an utter destitution of every thing like reason, [imbeciles]
possess some intellectual capacity, though infinitely less thanis possessed by the great mass of mankind"); A. Highmore,

Law of Idiocy and Lunacy 200 (1807) ("The great difficultyin all these cases, is to determine where a person shall be
said to be so far deprived of his sense and memory as not to
have any of his actions imputed to him: or where notwithstanding some defects of this kind he still appears to have
so much reason and understanding as will make him accountable for his actions . . .").

The Court is left to argue, therefore, that execution of the
mildly retarded is inconsistent with the "evolving standards
of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society."
Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)
(Warren, C. J.). Before today, our opinions consistently
emphasized that Eighth Amendment judgments regarding
the existence of social "standards" "should be informed by
objective factors to the maximum possible extent" and
"should not be, or appear to be, merely the subjective
views of individual Justices." Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S.

584, 592 (1977) (plurality opinion); see also Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 369 (1989); McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S.
279, 300 (1987); Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 788
(1982). "First" among these objective factors are the "statutes passed by society's elected representatives," Stanford,
supra, at 370; because it "will rarely if ever be the case that
the Members of this Court will have a better sense of the
evolution in views of the American people than do their
elected representatives," Thompson, supra, at 865 (Scalia,
J., dissenting).

342 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Court pays lipservice to these precedents as it miraculously extracts a "national consensus" forbidding execution
of the mentally retarded, ante, at 316, from the fact that 18
States--less than half (47%) of the 38 States that permit
capital punishment (for whom the issue exists)--have very
recently enacted legislation barring execution of the mentally retarded. Even that 47% figure is a distorted one. If
one is to say, as the Court does today, that all executions of
the mentally retarded are so morally repugnant as to violate
our national "standards of decency," surely the "consensus"
it points to must be one that has set its righteous face against
all such executions. Not 18 States, but only 7--18% of
death penalty jurisdictions--have legislation of that scope.
Eleven of those that the Court counts enacted statutes prohibiting execution of mentally retarded defendants convicted
after, or convicted of crimes committed after, the effective
date of the legislation;1 those already on death row, or consigned there before the statute's effective date, or even (in
those States using the date of the crime as the criterion of
retroactivity) tried in the future for murders committed
many years ago, could be put to death. That is not a statement of absolute moral repugnance, but one of current preference between two tolerable approaches. Two of these
States permit execution of the mentally retarded in other
situations as well: Kansas apparently permits execution of all

But let us accept, for the sake of argument, the Court'sfaulty count. That bare number of States alone--18--
should be enough to convince any reasonable person that no"national consensus" exists. How is it possible that agreement among 47% of the death penalty jurisdictions amountsto "consensus"? Our prior cases have generally required a
much higher degree of agreement before finding a punish-ment cruel and unusual on "evolving standards" grounds.
In Coker, supra, at 595-596, we proscribed the death penaltyfor rape of an adult woman after finding that only one jurisdiction, Georgia, authorized such a punishment. In Enmund, supra, at 789, we invalidated the death penalty formere participation in a robbery in which an accomplice took

a life, a punishment not permitted in 28 of the death penaltyStates (78%). In

Ford, 477 U. S., at 408, we supported thecommon-law prohibition of execution of the insane with the

observation that "[t]his ancestral legacy has not outlived itstime," since not a single State authorizes such punishment.
In Solem v. Helm, 463 U. S. 277, 300 (1983), we invalidated alife sentence without parole under a recidivist statute by
which the criminal "was treated more severely than hewould have been in any other State." What the Court calls
evidence of "consensus" in the present case (a fudged 47%)more closely resembles evidence that we found inadequate

2 The Kansas statute defines "mentally retarded" as "having significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning . . . to an extent which
substantially impairs one's capacity to appreciate the criminality of one's
conduct or to conform one's conduct to the requirements of law." Kan.
Stat. Ann. $ 21-4623(e) (2001). This definition of retardation, petitioner
concedes, is analogous to the Model Penal Code's definition of a "mental
disease or defect" excusing responsibility for criminal conduct, see ALI,
Model Penal Code $ 4.01 (1985), which would not include mild mental retardation. Reply Brief for Petitioner 3, n. 4.

Scalia, J., dissenting
to establish consensus in earlier cases. Tison v. Arizona,
481 U. S. 137, 154, 158 (1987), upheld a state law authorizing
capital punishment for major participation in a felony with
reckless indifference to life where only 11 of the 37 death
penalty States (30%) prohibited such punishment. Stanford, 492 U. S., at 372, upheld a state law permitting execution of defendants who committed a capital crime at age 16
where only 15 of the 36 death penalty States (42%) prohibited death for such offenders.

Moreover, a major factor that the Court entirely disregards is that the legislation of all 18 States it relies on is still
in its infancy. The oldest of the statutes is only 14 years
old; 3 five were enacted last year; 4 over half were enacted
within the past eight years.5 Few, if any, of the States have
had sufficient experience with these laws to know whether
they are sensible in the long term. It is "myopic to base
sweeping constitutional principles upon the narrow experience of [a few] years." Coker, 433 U. S., at 614 (Burger,
C. J., dissenting); see also Thompson, 487 U. S., at 854-855
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

The Court attempts to bolster its embarrassingly feeble
evidence of "consensus" with the following: "It is not so much
the number of these States that is significant, but the consistency of the direction of change." Ante, at 315 (emphasis added). But in what other direction could we possibly
see change? Given that 14 years ago all the death penalty
statutes included the mentally retarded, any change (except
precipitate undoing of what had just been done) was bound

to be in the one direction the Court finds significant enough
to overcome the lack of real consensus. That is to say, to be
accurate the Court's "consistency-of-the-direction-of-change"
point should be recast into the following unimpressive observation: "No State has yet undone its exemption of the mentally retarded, one for as long as 14 whole years." In any
event, reliance upon "trends," even those of much longer
duration than a mere 14 years, is a perilous basis for constitutional adjudication, as Justice O'Connor eloquently
explained in Thompson:

"In 1846, Michigan became the first State to abolish the
death penalty . . . . In succeeding decades, other American States continued the trend towards abolition . . . .
Later, and particularly after World War II, there ensued
a steady and dramatic decline in executions . . . . In
the 1950's and 1960's, more States abolished or radically
restricted capital punishment, and executions ceased
completely for several years beginning in 1968. . . .

"In 1972, when this Court heard arguments on the
constitutionality of the death penalty, such statistics
might have suggested that the practice had become
a relic, implicitly rejected by a new societal consensus. . . . We now know that any inference of a societal
consensus rejecting the death penalty would have been
mistaken. But had this Court then declared the existence of such a consensus, and outlawed capital punishment, legislatures would very likely not have been able
to revive it. The mistaken premise of the decision
would have been frozen into constitutional law, making
it difficult to refute and even more difficult to reject."
487 U. S., at 854-855.

Her words demonstrate, of course, not merely the peril of
riding a trend, but also the peril of discerning a consensus
where there is none.

346 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Court's thrashing about for evidence of "consensus"
includes reliance upon the margins by which state legislatures have enacted bans on execution of the retarded.
Ante, at 316. Presumably, in applying our Eighth Amendment "evolving-standards-of-decency" jurisprudence, we will
henceforth weigh not only how many States have agreed, but
how many States have agreed by how much. Of course if
the percentage of legislators voting for the bill is significant,
surely the number of people represented by the legislators
voting for the bill is also significant: the fact that 49% of the
legislators in a State with a population of 60 million voted
against the bill should be more impressive than the fact that
90% of the legislators in a State with a population of 2 million
voted for it. (By the way, the population of the death penalty States that exclude the mentally retarded is only 44%
of the population of all death penalty States. U. S. Dept.
of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the
United States 21 (121st ed. 2001).) This is quite absurd.
What we have looked for in the past to "evolve" the Eighth
Amendment is a consensus of the same sort as the consensus
that adopted the Eighth Amendment: a consensus of the
sovereign States that form the Union, not a nose count of
Americans for and against.

Even less compelling (if possible) is the Court's argument,
ante, at 316, that evidence of "national consensus" is to
be found in the infrequency with which retarded persons
are executed in States that do not bar their execution. To
begin with, what the Court takes as true is in fact quite
doubtful. It is not at all clear that execution of the mentally
retarded is "uncommon," ibid., as even the sources cited by
the Court suggest, see ante, at 316, n. 20 (citing D. Keyes,

See also Bonner & Rimer, Executing the Mentally RetardedEven as Laws Begin to Shift, N. Y. Times, Aug. 7, 2000, p. A1
(reporting that 10% of death row inmates are retarded). If,however, execution of the mentally retarded is "uncommon";
and if it is not a sufficient explanation of this that the re-tarded constitute a tiny fraction of society (1% to 3%), Brief
for American Psychological Association et al. as Amici Curiae 7; then surely the explanation is that mental retardationis a constitutionally mandated mitigating factor at sentencing, Penry, 492 U. S., at 328. For that reason, even if therewere uniform national sentiment in favor of executing the
retarded in appropriate cases, one would still expect execu-tion of the mentally retarded to be "uncommon." To adapt
to the present case what the Court itself said in Stanford,492 U. S., at 374: "[I]t is not only possible, but overwhelmingly probable, that the very considerations which induce [to-day's majority] to believe that death should

never be imposedon [mentally retarded] offenders . . . cause prosecutors and

juries to believe that it should rarely be imposed."But the Prize for the Court's Most Feeble Effort to fabricate "national consensus" must go to its appeal (deservedlyrelegated to a footnote) to the views of assorted professional
and religious organizations, members of the so-called "worldcommunity," and respondents to opinion polls.

Ante, at

and religious organizations and the results of opinion pollsare irrelevant.

it is a Constitution for the United States of America that weare expounding. . . . [W]here there is not first a settled consensus among our own people, the views of other nations,however enlightened the Justices of this Court may think

Beyond the empty talk of a "national consensus," theCourt gives us a brief glimpse of what really underlies today's decision: pretension to a power confined neither by the
moral sentiments originally enshrined in the Eighth Amend-ment (its original meaning)

nor even by the current moral
sentiments of the American people. " `[T]he Constitution,' "the Court says, "contemplates that in the end

our own judgment will be brought to bear on the question of the accept-ability of the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment.' "

Ante, at 312 (quoting Coker, 433 U. S., at 597) (emphasisadded). (The unexpressed reason for this unexpressed "contemplation" of the Constitution is presumably that reallygood lawyers have moral sentiments superior to those of the
common herd, whether in 1791 or today.) The arrogance of
this assumption of power takes one's breath away. And itexplains, of course, why the Court can be so cavalier about

the evidence of consensus. It is just a game, after all." `[I]n the end,' "

Thompson, supra, at 823, n. 8 (plurality
opinion (quoting Coker, supra, at 597 (plurality opinion))), itis the

feelings and intuition of a majority of the Justices
that count--"the perceptions of decency, or of penology, orof mercy, entertained . . . by a majority of the small and

ment are so far from being representative, even of the views of Catholics,
that they are currently the object of intense national (and entirely ecumenical) criticism.

unrepresentative segment of our society that sits on thisCourt."

Thompson, supra, at 873 (Scalia, J., dissenting).
The genuinely operative portion of the opinion, then, isthe Court's statement of the reasons why it agrees with the

contrived consensus it has found, that the "diminished capac-ities" of the mentally retarded render the death penalty excessive. Ante, at 317-321. The Court's analysis rests on
two fundamental assumptions: (1) that the Eighth Amend-ment prohibits excessive punishments, and (2) that sentencing juries or judges are unable to account properly for the"diminished capacities" of the retarded. The first assumption is wrong, as I explained at length in Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 966-990 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.).
The Eighth Amendment is addressed to always-and-everywhere "cruel" punishments, such as the rack and the

thumbscrew. But where the punishment is in itself permis-sible, "[t]he Eighth Amendment is not a ratchet, whereby a
temporary consensus on leniency for a particular crime fixesa permanent constitutional maximum, disabling the States
from giving effect to altered beliefs and responding to
changed social conditions." Id., at 990. The second as-sumption--inability of judges or juries to take proper account of mental retardation--is not only unsubstantiated, butcontradicts the immemorial belief, here and in England, that
they play an indispensable role in such matters:

"[I]t is very difficult to define the indivisible line that
divides perfect and partial insanity; but it must restupon circumstances duly to be weighed and considered

both by the judge and jury, lest on the one side there be
a kind of inhumanity towards the defects of human nature, or on the other side too great an indulgence given
to great crimes . . . ." 1 Hale, Pleas of the Crown, at 30.

Proceeding from these faulty assumptions, the Court gives
two reasons why the death penalty is an excessive punishment for all mentally retarded offenders. First, the "dimin536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
350 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
ished capacities" of the mentally retarded raise a "seriousquestion" whether their execution contributes to the "social

purposes" of the death penalty, viz., retribution and deter-rence.

Ante, at 318-319. (The Court conveniently ignores
a third "social purpose" of the death penalty--"incapacita-tion of dangerous criminals and the consequent prevention

of crimes that they may otherwise commit in the future,"
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 183, n. 28 (1976) ( joint opin-ion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.). But never mind;
its discussion of even the other two does not bear analysis.)Retribution is not advanced, the argument goes, because the

mentally retarded are no more culpable than the average
murderer, whom we have already held lacks sufficient culpability to warrant the death penalty, see Godfrey v. Georgia,
446 U. S. 420, 433 (1980) (plurality opinion). Ante, at 319.
Who says so? Is there an established correlation between
mental acuity and the ability to conform one's conduct to
the law in such a rudimentary matter as murder? Are the
mentally retarded really more disposed (and hence more
likely) to commit willfully cruel and serious crime than others? In my experience, the opposite is true: being childlike
generally suggests innocence rather than brutality.

Assuming, however, that there is a direct connection between diminished intelligence and the inability to refrain
from murder, what scientific analysis can possibly show that
a mildly retarded individual who commits an exquisite
torture-killing is "no more culpable" than the "average" murderer in a holdup-gone-wrong or a domestic dispute? Or a
moderately retarded individual who commits a series of 20
exquisite torture-killings? Surely culpability, and deservedness of the most severe retribution, depends not merely (if
at all) upon the mental capacity of the criminal (above the
level where he is able to distinguish right from wrong) but
also upon the depravity of the crime--which is precisely why
this sort of question has traditionally been thought answerable not by a categorical rule of the sort the Court today

536US1 Unit: $U70 [12-22-03 07:35:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

351Cite as: 536 U. S. 304 (2002)
Scalia, J., dissenting
imposes upon all trials, but rather by the sentencer's weigh-ing of the circumstances (both degree of retardation and depravity of crime) in the particular case. The fact that juriescontinue to sentence mentally retarded offenders to death
for extreme crimes shows that society's moral outrage some-times demands execution of retarded offenders. By what
principle of law, science, or logic can the Court pronounce
that this is wrong? There is none. Once the Court admits(as it does) that mental retardation does not render the offender morally blameless, ante, at 318, there is no basis forsaying that the death penalty is

never appropriate retribution, no matter how heinous the crime. As long as a mentally retarded offender knows "the difference between right
and wrong," ibid., only the sentencer can assess whether his
retardation reduces his culpability enough to exempt him
from the death penalty for the particular murder in question.

As for the other social purpose of the death penalty that
the Court discusses, deterrence: That is not advanced, the
Court tells us, because the mentally retarded are "less
likely" than their nonretarded counterparts to "process the
information of the possibility of execution as a penalty
and . . . control their conduct based upon that information."
Ante, at 320. Of course this leads to the same conclusion
discussed earlier--that the mentally retarded (because they
are less deterred) are more likely to kill--which neither I
nor the society at large believes. In any event, even the
Court does not say that all mentally retarded individuals
cannot "process the information of the possibility of execution as a penalty and . . . control their conduct based upon
that information"; it merely asserts that they are "less
likely" to be able to do so. But surely the deterrent effect
of a penalty is adequately vindicated if it successfully deters
many, but not all, of the target class. Virginia's death penalty, for example, does not fail of its deterrent effect simply
because some criminals are unaware that Virginia has the
death penalty. In other words, the supposed fact that some

352 ATKINS v. VIRGINIA

Scalia, J., dissenting
retarded criminals cannot fully appreciate the death penaltyhas nothing to do with the deterrence rationale, but is simply

an echo of the arguments denying a retribution rationale,discussed and rejected above. I am not sure that a murderer is somehow less blameworthy if (though he knew hisact was wrong) he did not fully appreciate that he could die
for it; but if so, we should treat a mentally retarded mur-derer the way we treat an offender who may be "less likely"
to respond to the death penalty because he was abused as achild. We do not hold him immune from capital punishment,
but require his background to be considered by the sentenceras a mitigating factor.

Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U. S. 104,113-117 (1982).

The Court throws one last factor into its grab bag of rea-sons why execution of the retarded is "excessive" in all cases:
Mentally retarded offenders "face a special risk of wrongfulexecution" because they are less able "to make a persuasive
showing of mitigation," "to give meaningful assistance totheir counsel," and to be effective witnesses.

Ante, at 320-321. "Special risk" is pretty flabby language (even flabbier

than "less likely")--and I suppose a similar "special risk"could be said to exist for just plain stupid people, inarticulate
people, even ugly people. If this unsupported claim has anysubstance to it (which I doubt), it might support a due process claim in all criminal prosecutions of the mentally re-tarded; but it is hard to see how it has anything to do with
an Eighth Amendment claim that execution of the mentallyretarded is cruel and unusual. We have never before held
it to be cruel and unusual punishment to impose a sentencein violation of some other constitutional imperative.

Today's opinion adds one more to the long list of substan-tive and procedural requirements impeding imposition of the

death penalty imposed under this Court's assumed power toinvent a death-is-different jurisprudence. None of those

requirements existed when the Eighth Amendment wasadopted, and some of them were not even supported by current moral consensus. They include prohibition of the deathpenalty for "ordinary" murder,

Godfrey, 446 U. S., at 433, for
rape of an adult woman, Coker, 433 U. S., at 592, and forfelony murder absent a showing that the defendant possessed a sufficiently culpable state of mind, Enmund, 458
U. S., at 801; prohibition of the death penalty for any personunder the age of 16 at the time of the crime,

Thompson,
487 U. S., at 838 (plurality opinion); prohibition of the deathpenalty as the mandatory punishment for any crime,

Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 305 (1976) (plurality
opinion), Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U. S. 66, 77-78 (1987); a
requirement that the sentencer not be given unguided discretion, Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam), a requirement that the sentencer be empowered to
take into account all mitigating circumstances, Lockett v.
Ohio, 438 U. S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion), Eddings v.
Oklahoma, supra, at 110; and a requirement that the accused
receive a judicial evaluation of his claim of insanity before
the sentence can be executed, Ford, 477 U. S., at 410-411
(plurality opinion). There is something to be said for popular abolition of the death penalty; there is nothing to be said
for its incremental abolition by this Court.

This newest invention promises to be more effective than
any of the others in turning the process of capital trial into
a game. One need only read the definitions of mental retardation adopted by the American Association on Mental Retardation and the American Psychiatric Association (set
forth in the Court's opinion, ante, at 308, n. 3) to realize that
the symptoms of this condition can readily be feigned. And
whereas the capital defendant who feigns insanity risks commitment to a mental institution until he can be cured (and
then tried and executed), Jones v. United States, 463 U. S.
354, 370, and n. 20 (1983), the capital defendant who feigns
mental retardation risks nothing at all. The mere pendency

of the present case has brought us petitions by death rowinmates claiming for the first time, after multiple habeas

petitions, that they are retarded. See, e. g., Moore v. Texas,535 U. S. 1044 (2002) (

Scalia, J., dissenting from grant of
applications for stay of execution).Perhaps these practical difficulties will not be experienced

by the minority of capital-punishment States that have very
recently changed mental retardation from a mitigating factor(to be accepted or rejected by the sentencer) to an absolute

immunity. Time will tell--and the brief time those Stateshave had the new disposition in place (an average of 6.8
years) is surely not enough. But if the practical difficul-ties do not appear, and if the other States share the Court's
perceived moral consensus that all mental retardation ren-ders the death penalty inappropriate for

all crimes, then that
majority will presumably follow suit. But there is no justi-fication for this Court's pushing them into the experiment--

and turning the experiment into a permanent practice--onconstitutional pretext. Nothing has changed the accuracy of
Matthew Hale's endorsement of the common law's traditional
method for taking account of guilt-reducing factors, writtenover three centuries ago:

"[Determination of a person's incapacity] is a matter of
great difficulty, partly from the easiness of counterfeiting this disability . . . and partly from the variety of thedegrees of this infirmity, whereof some are sufficient,

and some are insufficient to excuse persons in capitaloffenses. . . .

"Yet the law of England hath afforded the best
method of trial, that is possible, of this and all other
matters of fact, namely, by a jury of twelve men all
concurring in the same judgment, by the testimony of
witnesses . . . , and by the inspection and direction of
the judge." 1 Pleas of the Crown, at 32-33.

I respectfully dissent.

355OCTOBER TERM, 2001
Syllabus

RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 00-1021. Argued January 16, 2002--Decided June 20, 2002
Petitioner Rush Prudential HMO, Inc., a health maintenance organization

(HMO) that contracts to provide medical services for employee welfare
benefit plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974 (ERISA), denied respondent Moran's request to have surgery
by an unaffiliated specialist on the ground that the procedure was not
medically necessary. Moran made a written demand for an independent
medical review of her claim, as guaranteed by $ 4-10 of Illinois's HMO
Act, which further provides that "[i]n the event that the reviewing physician determines the covered service to be medically necessary," the
HMO "shall provide" the service. Rush refused her demand, and
Moran sued in state court to compel compliance with the Act. That
court ordered the review, which found the treatment necessary, but
Rush again denied the claim. While the suit was pending, Moran had
the surgery and amended her complaint to seek reimbursement. Rush
removed the case to federal court, arguing that the amended complaint
stated a claim for ERISA benefits. The District Court treated Moran's
claim as a suit under ERISA and denied it on the ground that ERISA
preempted $ 4-10. The Seventh Circuit reversed. It found Moran's
reimbursement claim preempted by ERISA so as to place the case in
federal court, but it concluded that the state Act was not preempted as
a state law that "relate[s] to" an employee benefit plan, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1144(a), because it also "regulates insurance" under ERISA's saving
clause, $ 1144(b)(2)(A).

Held: ERISA does not preempt the Illinois HMO Act. Pp. 364-387.

(a) In deciding whether a law regulates insurance, this Court starts
with a commonsense view of the matter, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 740, which requires a law to "be specifically directed toward" the insurance industry, Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 50. It then tests the results of the commonsense
enquiry by employing the three factors used to point to insurance laws
spared from federal preemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
Pp. 365-375.

(1) The Illinois HMO Act is directed toward the insurance industry,
and thus is an insurance regulation under a commonsense view. Although an HMO provides health care in addition to insurance, nothing

536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
356 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN

Syllabus
in the saving clause requires an either-or choice between health care
and insurance. Congress recognized, the year before passing ERISA,
that HMOs are risk-bearing organizations subject to state insurance
regulation. That conception has not changed in the intervening years.
States have been adopting their own HMO enabling Acts, and at least
40, including Illinois, regulate HMOs primarily through state insurance
departments. Rush cannot submerge HMOs' insurance features beneath an exclusive characterization of HMOs as health care providers.
And the argument of Rush and its amici that $ 4-10 sweeps beyond the
insurance industry, capturing organizations that provide no insurance
and regulating noninsurance activities of HMOs that do, is based on
unsound assumptions. Pp. 366-373.

(2) The McCarran-Ferguson factors confirm this conclusion. A
state law does not have to satisfy all three factors to survive preemption, and $ 4-10 clearly satisfies two. The independent review requirement satisfies the factor that a provision regulate "an integral part of
the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured." Union
Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno, 458 U. S. 119, 129. Illinois adds an extra
review layer when there is an internal disagreement about an HMO's
denial of coverage, and the reviewer both applies a medical care standard and construes policy terms. Thus, the review affects a policy relationship by translating the relationship under the HMO agreement into
concrete terms of specific obligation or freedom from duty. The factor
that the law be aimed at a practice "limited to entities within the insurance industry," ibid., is satisfied for many of the same reasons that the
law passes the commonsense test: It regulates application of HMO contracts and provides for review of claim denials; once it is established
that HMO contracts are contracts for insurance, it is clear that $ 4-10
does not apply to entities outside the insurance industry. Pp. 373-375.

(b) This Court rejects Rush's contention that, even though ERISA's
saving clause ostensibly forecloses preemption, congressional intent
to the contrary is so clear that it overrides the statutory provision.
Pp. 375-386.

(1) The Court has recognized an overpowering federal policy of exclusivity in ERISA's civil enforcement provisions located at 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(a); and it has anticipated that in a conflict between congressional
polices of exclusively federal remedies and the States' regulation of insurance, the state regulation would lose out if it allows remedies that
Congress rejected in ERISA, Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 54. Rush argues
that $ 4-10 is preempted for creating the kind of alternative remedy
that this Court disparaged in Pilot Life, one that subverts congressional
intent, clearly expressed through ERISA's structure and legislative history, that the federal remedy displace state causes of action. Rush

Syllabus
overstates Pilot Life's rule. The enquiry into state processes alleged
to "supplemen[t] or supplan[t]" ERISA remedies, id., at 56, has, up to
now, been more straightforward than it is here. Pilot Life, Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, and Ingersoll-Rand Co.
v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, all involved an additional claim or remedy
that ERISA did not authorize. In contrast, the review here may settle
a benefit claim's fate, but the state statute does not enlarge the claim
beyond the benefits available in any $ 1132(a) action. And although the
reviewer's determination would presumably replace the HMO's as to
what is medically necessary, the ultimate relief available would still be
what ERISA authorizes in a $ 1132(a) suit for benefits. This case therefore resembles the claims-procedure rule that the Court sustained in
UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358. Section 4-10's
procedure does not fall within Pilot Life's categorical preemption.
Pp. 377-380.

(2) Nor does $ 4-10's procedural imposition interfere unreasonably
with Congress's intention to provide a uniform federal regime of "rights
and obligations" under ERISA. Although this Court has recognized a
limited exception from the saving clause for alternative causes of action
and alternative remedies, further limits on insurance regulation preserved by ERISA are unlikely to deserve recognition. A State might
provide for a type of review that would so resemble an adjudication as
to fall within Pilot Life's categorical bar, but that is not the case here.
Section 4-10 is significantly different from common arbitration. The
independent reviewer has no free-ranging power to construe contract
terms, but instead confines review to the single phrase "medically necessary." That reviewer must be a physician with credentials similar to
those of the primary care physician and is expected to exercise independent medical judgment, based on medical records submitted by the
parties, in deciding what medical necessity requires. This process does
not resemble either contract interpretation or evidentiary litigation before a neutral arbiter as much as it looks like the practice of obtaining
a second opinion. In addition, $ 4-10 does not clash with any deferential
standard for reviewing benefit denials in judicial proceedings. ERISA
itself says nothing about a standard. It simply requires plans to afford
a beneficiary some mechanism for internal review of a benefit denial and
provides a right to a subsequent judicial forum for a claim to recover
benefits. Although certain "discretionary" plan interpretations may
receive deference from a reviewing court, see Firestone Tire & Rubber
Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 115, nothing in ERISA requires that medical
necessity decisions be "discretionary" in the first place. Pp. 381-386.

230 F. 3d 959, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Section 4-10 of Illinois's Health Maintenance OrganizationAct, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 4-10 (2000), provides recipients of health coverage by such organizations with a rightto independent medical review of certain denials of benefits.
The issue in this case is whether the statute, as applied tohealth benefits provided by a health maintenance organization under contract with an employee welfare benefit plan, ispreempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA), 88 Stat. 832, as amended, 29 U. S. C.$ 1001

beneficiary is covered under the certificate. The certificate
specifies that a service is covered as "medically necessary"
if Rush finds:

"(a) [The service] is furnished or authorized by a Participating Doctor for the diagnosis or the treatment of a
Sickness or Injury or for the maintenance of a person's
good health.

"(b) The prevailing opinion within the appropriate
specialty of the United States medical profession is that
[the service] is safe and effective for its intended use,
and that its omission would adversely affect the person's
medical condition.

"(c) It is furnished by a provider with appropriate
training, experience, staff and facilities to furnish that
particular service or supply." Record, Pl. Exh. A, p. 21.

As the certificate explains, Rush contracts with physicians
"to arrange for or provide services and supplies for medical
care and treatment" of covered persons. Each covered person selects a primary care physician from those under contract to Rush, while Rush will pay for medical services by
an unaffiliated physician only if the services have been "authorized" both by the primary care physician and Rush's
medical director. See id., at 11, 16.

In 1996, when Moran began to have pain and numbness in
her right shoulder, Dr. Arthur LaMarre, her primary care
physician, unsuccessfully administered "conservative" treatments such as physiotherapy. In October 1997, Dr. LaMarre
recommended that Rush approve surgery by an unaffiliated
specialist, Dr. Julia Terzis, who had developed an unconventional treatment for Moran's condition. Although Dr. LaMarre said that Moran would be "best served" by that procedure, Rush denied the request and, after Moran's internal
appeals, affirmed the denial on the ground that the procedure
was not "medically necessary." 230 F. 3d 959, 963 (CA7

2000). Rush instead proposed that Moran undergo standardsurgery, performed by a physician affiliated with Rush.

In January 1998, Moran made a written demand for anindependent medical review of her claim, as guaranteed by

$ 4-10 of Illinois's HMO Act, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125,$ 4-10 et seq. (2000), which provides:

"Each Health Maintenance Organization shall provide amechanism for the timely review by a physician holding
the same class of license as the primary care physician,who is unaffiliated with the Health Maintenance Organization, jointly selected by the patient . . . , primary carephysician and the Health Maintenance Organization in
the event of a dispute between the primary care physi-cian and the Health Maintenance Organization regarding
the medical necessity of a covered service proposed bya primary care physician. In the event that the reviewing physician determines the covered service to be medi-cally necessary, the Health Maintenance Organization
shall provide the covered service."
The Act defines a "Health Maintenance Organization" as

"any organization formed under the laws of this or an-other state to provide or arrange for one or more health

care plans under a system which causes any part of therisk of health care delivery to be borne by the organization or its providers." Ch. 125, $ 1-2.1
1 In the health care industry, the term "Health Maintenance Organization" has been defined as "[a] prepaid organized delivery system where
the organization and the primary care physicians assume some financial
risk for the care provided to its enrolled members. . . . In a pure HMO,
members must obtain care from within the system if it is to be reimbursed." Weiner & de Lissovoy, Razing a Tower of Babel: A Taxonomy
for Managed Care and Health Insurance Plans, 18 J. of Health Politics,
Policy and Law 75, 96 (Spring 1993) (emphasis in original). The term
"Managed Care Organization" is used more broadly to refer to any number
of systems combining health care delivery with financing. Id., at 97.

362 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN

Opinion of the Court
When Rush failed to provide the independent review, Moransued in an Illinois state court to compel compliance with the

state Act. Rush removed the suit to Federal District Court,arguing that the cause of action was "completely preempted"
under ERISA. 230 F. 3d, at 964.While the suit was pending, Moran had surgery by
Dr. Terzis at her own expense and submitted a $94,841.27reimbursement claim to Rush. Rush treated the claim as
a renewed request for benefits and began a new inquiry todetermine coverage. The three doctors consulted by Rush
said the surgery had been medically unnecessary.Meanwhile, the federal court remanded the case back to
state court on Moran's motion, concluding that because Mor-an's request for independent review under $ 4-10 would not
require interpretation of the terms of an ERISA plan, theclaim was not "completely preempted" so as to permit removal under 28 U. S. C. $ 1441.2 230 F. 3d, at 964. Thestate court enforced the state statute and ordered Rush to
submit to review by an independent physician. The doctorselected was a reconstructive surgeon at Johns Hopkins
Medical Center, Dr. A. Lee Dellon. Dr. Dellon decided thatDr. Terzis's treatment had been medically necessary, based
on the definition of medical necessity in Rush's Certificate of
tional usage of that term, but instead is likely to encompass a variety of
different structures (although Illinois does distinguish HMOs from pure
insurers by regulating "traditional" health insurance in a different portion
of its insurance laws, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 5 (2000)). Except where
otherwise indicated, we use the term "HMO" because that is the term
used by the State and the parties; what we intend is simply to describe
the structures covered by the Illinois Act.

2 In light of our holding today that $ 4-10 is not preempted by ERISA,

the propriety of this ruling is questionable; a suit to compel compliance
with $ 4-10 in the context of an ERISA plan would seem to be akin to a
suit to compel compliance with the terms of a plan under 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(a)(3). Alternatively, the proper course may have been to bring a
suit to recover benefits due, alleging that the denial was improper in the
absence of compliance with $ 4-10. We need not resolve today which of
these options is more consonant with ERISA.

Opinion of the Court
Group Coverage, as well as his own medical judgment.Rush's medical director, however, refused to concede that the

surgery had been medically necessary, and denied Moran'sclaim in January 1999.

Moran amended her complaint in state court to seek reim-bursement for the surgery as "medically necessary" under
Illinois's HMO Act, and Rush again removed to federal court,arguing that Moran's amended complaint stated a claim for
ERISA benefits and was thus completely preempted byERISA's civil enforcement provisions, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a),
as construed by this Court in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Taylor, 481 U. S. 58 (1987). The District Court treated Mor-an's claim as a suit under ERISA, and denied the claim on

the ground that ERISA preempted Illinois's independent re-view statute.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.230 F. 3d 959 (2000). Although it found Moran's state-law

reimbursement claim completely preempted by ERISA so asto place the case in federal court, the Seventh Circuit did not
agree that the substantive provisions of Illinois's HMO Actwere so preempted. The court noted that although ERISA
broadly preempts any state laws that "relate to" employeebenefit plans, 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), state laws that "regulat[e]

3 No party has challenged Rush's status as defendant in this case, despite
the fact that many lower courts have interpreted ERISA to permit suits
under $ 1132(a) only against ERISA plans, administrators, or fiduciaries.
See, e. g., Everhart v. Allmerica Financial Life Ins. Co., 275 F. 3d 751,
754-756 (CA9 2001); Garren v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 114 F. 3d
186, 187 (CA11 1997); Jass v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 88 F. 3d
1482, 1490 (CA7 1996). Without commenting on the correctness of such
holdings, we assume (although the information does not appear in the record) that Rush has failed to challenge its status as defendant because it
is, in fact, the plan administrator. This conclusion is buttressed by the
fact that the plan's sponsor has granted Rush discretion to interpret the
terms of its coverage, and by the fact that one of Rush's challenges to the
Illinois statute is based on what Rush perceives as the limits that statute
places on fiduciary discretion. Whatever Rush's true status may be, however, it is immaterial to our holding.

insurance" are saved from preemption, $ 1144(b)(2)(A). Thecourt held that the Illinois HMO Act was such a law, the

independent review requirement being little different froma state-mandated contractual term of the sort this Court had
held to survive ERISA preemption. See 230 F. 3d, at 972(citing UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S.
358, 375-376 (1999)). The Seventh Circuit rejected the con-tention that Illinois's independent review requirement constituted a forbidden "alternative remedy" under this Court'sholding in

Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41 (1987),and emphasized that $ 4-10 does not authorize any particular

form of relief in state courts; rather, with respect to anyERISA health plan, the judgment of the independent reviewer is only enforceable in an action brought underERISA's civil enforcement scheme, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a). 230
F. 3d, at 971.Because the decision of the Court of Appeals conflicted
with the Fifth Circuit's treatment of a similar provision ofTexas law in

Corporate Health Ins., Inc. v. Texas Dept. ofIns., 215 F. 3d 526 (2000), we granted certiorari, 533 U. S.

948 (2001). We now affirm.

contains an express preemption provision that ERISA "shallsupersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now
or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . ."$ 1144(a). A saving clause then reclaims a substantial
amount of ground with its provision that "nothing in thissubchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance,banking, or securities." $ 1144(b)(2)(A). The "unhelpful"

ence of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins.Co., 514 U. S. 645, 656 (1995), occupies a substantial share of

this Court's time, see, e. g., Egelhoff v. Egelhoff, 532 U. S.141 (2001); UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, supra;
California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dilling-ham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316 (1997); Metropolitan
Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985). In try-ing to extrapolate congressional intent in a case like this,
when congressional language seems simultaneously to pre-empt everything and hardly anything, we "have no choice"
but to temper the assumption that " `the ordinary mean-ing . . . accurately expresses the legislative purpose,' "

id.,at 740 (quoting Park 'N Fly v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc.,

469 U. S. 189, 194 (1985)), with the qualification " `that thehistoric police powers of the States were not [meant] to be
superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear andmanifest purpose of Congress.' " Travelers, supra, at 655
(quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230(1947)).

It is beyond serious dispute that under existing precedent$ 4-10 of the Illinois HMO Act "relates to" employee benefit
plans within the meaning of $ 1144(a). The state law bears"indirectly but substantially on all insured benefit plans,"
Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 739, by requiring them tosubmit to an extra layer of review for certain benefit denials
if they purchase medical coverage from any of the commontypes of health care organizations covered by the state law's
definition of HMO. As a law that "relates to" ERISA plansunder $ 1144(a), $ 4-10 is saved from preemption only if it
also "regulates insurance" under $ 1144(b)(2)(A). Rush in-sists that the Act is not such a law.

In Metropolitan Life, we said that in deciding whether alaw "regulates insurance" under ERISA's saving clause, we

start with a "common-sense view of the matter," 471 U. S.,

Opinion of the Court
at 740, under which "a law must not just have an impacton the insurance industry, but must be specifically directed

toward that industry." Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux,supra, at 50. We then test the results of the commonsense
enquiry by employing the three factors used to point to in-surance laws spared from federal preemption under the
McCarran-Ferguson Act, 15 U. S. C. $ 1011 et seq.4 Althoughthis is not the place to plot the exact perimeter of the saving
clause, it is generally fair to think of the combined "common-sense" and McCarran-Ferguson factors as parsing the "who"
and the "what": when insurers are regulated with respect totheir insurance practices, the state law survives ERISA.
Cf. Group Life & Health Ins. Co. v. Royal Drug Co., 440 U. S.205, 211 (1979) (explaining that the "business of insurance"
is not coextensive with the "business of insurers").

1
The commonsense enquiry focuses on "primary elementsof an insurance contract[, which] are the spreading and underwriting of a policyholder's risk." Ibid. The Illinoisstatute addresses these elements by defining "health maintenance organization" by reference to the risk that it bears.See 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 1-2(9) (2000) (an HMO
"provide[s] or arrange[s] for . . . health care plans under asystem which causes any part of the risk of health care delivery to be borne by the organization or its providers").Rush contends that seeing an HMO as an insurer distorts
the nature of an HMO, which is, after all, a health care pro-vider, too. This, Rush argues, should determine its characterization, with the consequence that regulation of an HMOis not insurance regulation within the meaning of ERISA.

4 The McCarran-Ferguson Act requires that the business of insurance
be subject to state regulation, and, subject to certain exceptions, mandates
that "[n]o Act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate . . . any law
enacted by any State for the purpose of regulating the business of
insurance . . . ." 15 U. S. C. $ 1012(b).

Opinion of the Court
The answer to Rush is, of course, that an HMO is both: itprovides health care, and it does so as an insurer. Nothing

in the saving clause requires an either-or choice betweenhealth care and insurance in deciding a preemption question,
and as long as providing insurance fairly accounts for theapplication of state law, the saving clause may apply. There
is no serious question about that here, for it would ignore
the whole purpose of the HMO-style of organization to con-ceive of HMOs (even in the traditional sense, see n. 1,

supra)
without their insurance element."The defining feature of an HMO is receipt of a fixed fee

for each patient enrolled under the terms of a contract to
provide specified health care if needed." Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211, 218 (2000). "The HMO thus assumes
the financial risk of providing the benefits promised: if a participant never gets sick, the HMO keeps the money regardless, and if a participant becomes expensively ill, the HMO
is responsible for the treatment . . . ." Id., at 218-219. The
HMO design goes beyond the simple truism that all contracts
are, in some sense, insurance against future fluctuations in
price, R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 104 (4th ed.
1992), because HMOs actually underwrite and spread risk
among their participants, see, e. g., R. Shouldice, Introduction to Managed Care 450-462 (1991), a feature distinctive to insurance, see, e. g., SEC v. Variable Annuity Life
Ins. Co. of America, 359 U. S. 65, 73 (1959) (underwriting of
risk is an "earmark of insurance as it has commonly been
conceived of in popular understanding and usage"); Royal
Drug, supra, at 214-215, n. 12 ("[U]nless there is some element of spreading risk more widely, there is no underwriting
of risk").

So Congress has understood from the start, when the
phrase "Health Maintenance Organization" was established
and defined in the HMO Act of 1973. The Act was intended
to encourage the development of HMOs as a new form of
health care delivery system, see S. Rep. No. 93-129, pp. 7-9

536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
368 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN

Opinion of the Court
(1973), and when Congress set the standards that the newhealth delivery organizations would have to meet to get certain federal benefits, the terms included requirements thatthe organizations bear and manage risk. See

, e. g., Health
Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, $ 1301(c), 87 Stat. 916,as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 300e(c); S. Rep. No. 93-129, at 14

(explaining that HMOs necessarily bear some of the risk of
providing service, and requiring that a qualifying HMO "as-sum[e] direct financial responsibility, without benefit of reinsurance, for care . . . in excess of the first five thousand dol-lars per enrollee per year"). The Senate Committee Report
explained that federally qualified HMOs would be required
to provide "a basic package of benefits, consistent with existing health insurance patterns," id., at 10, and the very text
of the Act assumed that state insurance laws would apply to
HMOs; it provided that to the extent state insurance capitalization and reserve requirements were too stringent to permit the formation of HMOs, "qualified" HMOs would be exempt from such limiting regulation. See $ 1311, 42 U. S. C.

$ 300e-10. This congressional understanding that it was
promoting a novel form of insurance was made explicit in the
Senate Report's reference to the practices of "health insurers to charge premium rates based upon the actual claims
experience of a particular group of subscribers," thus "raising costs and diminishing the availability of health insurance
for those suffering from costly illnesses," S. Rep. No. 93-129,
at 29-30. The federal Act responded to this insurance practice by requiring qualifying HMOs to adopt uniform capitation rates, see $ 1301(b), 42 U. S. C. $ 300e(b), and it was
because of that mandate "pos[ing] substantial competitive
problems to newly emerging HMOs," S. Rep. No. 93-129, at
30, that Congress authorized funding subsidies, see $ 1304,
42 U. S. C. $ 300e-4. The Senate explanation left no doubt
that it viewed an HMO as an insurer; the subsidy was justified because "the same stringent requirements do not apply
to other indemnity or service benefits insurance plans."

Opinion of the Court
S. Rep. No. 93-129, at 30. In other words, one year beforeit passed ERISA, Congress itself defined HMOs in part by

reference to risk, set minimum standards for managing therisk, showed awareness that States regulated HMOs as insurers, and compared HMOs to "indemnity or service bene-fits insurance plans."

This conception has not changed in the intervening years.Since passage of the federal Act, States have been adopting
their own HMO enabling Acts, and today, at least 40 of them,including Illinois, regulate HMOs primarily through the
States' insurance departments, see Aspen Health Law andCompliance Center, Managed Care Law Manual 31-32 (Supp.
6, Nov. 1997), although they may be treated differently fromtraditional insurers, owing to their additional role as health
care providers,5 see, e. g., Alaska Ins. Code $ 21.86.010 (2000)(health department reviews HMO before insurance commissioner grants a certificate of authority); Ohio Rev. Code Ann.$ 1742.21 (West 1994) (health department may inspect HMO).
Finally, this view shared by Congress and the States haspassed into common understanding. HMOs (broadly defined) have "grown explosively in the past decade and [are]now the dominant form of health plan coverage for privately
insured individuals." Gold & Hurley, The Role of ManagedCare "Products" in Managed Care "Plans," in Contemporary
Managed Care 47 (M. Gold ed. 1998). While the originalform of the HMO was a single corporation employing its own
physicians, the 1980's saw a variety of other types of struc-tures develop even as traditional insurers altered their own

5 We have, in a limited number of cases, found certain contracts not to
be part of the "business of insurance" under McCarran-Ferguson, notwithstanding their classification as such for the purpose of state regulation.
See, e. g., SEC v. Variable Annuity Life Ins. Co. of America, 359 U. S. 65
(1959). Even then, however, we recognized that such classifications are
relevant to the enquiry, because Congress, in leaving the "business of insurance" to the States, "was legislating concerning a concept which had
taken on its coloration and meaning largely from state law, from state
practice, from state usage." Id., at 69.

plans by adopting HMO-like cost-control measures. SeeWeiner & de Lissovoy, Razing a Tower of Babel: A Taxonomy for Managed Care and Health Insurance Plans, 18 J. ofHealth Politics, Policy and Law 75, 83 (Spring 1993). The
dominant feature is the combination of insurer and provider,see Gold & Hurley, supra, at 47, and "an observer may be
hard pressed to uncover the differences among products thatbill themselves as HMOs, [preferred provider organizations],
or managed care overlays to health insurance," ManagedCare Law Manual,

supra, at 1. Thus, virtually all commen-tators on the American health care system describe HMOs

as a combination of insurer and provider, and observe thatin recent years, traditional "indemnity" insurance has fallen
out of favor. See, e. g., Weiner & de Lissovoy, supra, at 77("A common characteristic of the new managed care plans
was the degree to which the roles of insurer and providerbecame integrated"); Gold, Understanding the Roots: Health
Maintenance Organizations in Historical Context, in Contem-porary Managed Care,

supra, at 7, 8, 13; Managed Care LawManual, supra, at 1; R. Rosenblatt, S. Law, & S. Rosenbaum,

Law and the American Health Care System 552 (1997);Shouldice, Introduction to Managed Care, at 13, 20. Rush
cannot checkmate common sense by trying to submergeHMOs' insurance features beneath an exclusive characterization of HMOs as providers of health care.

2
On a second tack, Rush and its amici dispute that $ 4-10is aimed specifically at the insurance industry. They say the

law sweeps too broadly with definitions capturing organiza-tions that provide no insurance, and by regulating noninsurance activities of HMOs that do. Rush points out that Illi-nois law defines HMOs to include organizations that cause
the risk of health care delivery to be borne by the organi-zation itself, or by "its providers." 215 Ill. Comp. Stat.,
ch. 125, $ 1-2(9) (2000). In Rush's view, the reference to "its

536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

371Cite as: 536 U. S. 355 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
providers" suggests that an organization may be an HMOunder state law (and subject to $ 4-10) even if it does not

bear risk itself, either because it has "devolve[d]" the risk ofhealth care delivery onto others, or because it has contracted
only to provide "administrative" or other services for self-funded plans. Brief for Petitioner 38.

These arguments, however, are built on unsound assump-tions. Rush's first contention assumes that an HMO is no
longer an insurer when it arranges to limit its exposure, aswhen an HMO arranges for capitated contracts to compensate its affiliated physicians with a set fee for each HMOpatient regardless of the treatment provided. Under such
an arrangement, Rush claims, the risk is not borne by theHMO at all. In a similar vein, Rush points out that HMOs
may contract with third-party insurers to protect themselvesagainst large claims.

The problem with Rush's argument is simply that a rein-surance contract does not take the primary insurer out of
the insurance business, cf. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Califor-nia, 509 U. S. 764 (1993) (applying McCarran-Ferguson to a
dispute involving primary insurers and reinsurers); id., at772-773 ("[P]rimary insurers . . . usually purchase insurance
to cover a portion of the risk they assume from the con-sumer"), and capitation contracts do not relieve the HMO of
its obligations to the beneficiary. The HMO is still bound toprovide medical care to its members, and this is so regardless
of the ability of physicians or third-party insurers to honortheir contracts with the HMO.

Nor do we see anything standing in the way of applyingthe saving clause if we assume that the general state definition of HMO would include a contractor that provides onlyadministrative services for a self-funded plan.

6 Rush points

6 ERISA's "deemer" clause provides an exception to its saving clause
that prohibits States from regulating self-funded plans as insurers. See
29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(B); FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 61 (1990).
Therefore, Illinois's Act would not be "saved" as an insurance law to the

372 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN

Opinion of the Court
out that the general definition of HMO under Illinois lawincludes not only organizations that "provide" health care

plans, but those that "arrange for" them to be provided, solong as "any part of the risk of health care delivery" rests
upon "the organization or its providers." 215 Ill. Comp.Stat., ch. 125, $ 1-2(9) (2000). See Brief for Petitioner 38.
Rush hypothesizes a sort of medical matchmaker, bring-ing together ERISA plans and medical care providers;
even if the latter bear all the risks, the matchmaker wouldbe an HMO under the Illinois definition. Rush would
conclude from this that $ 4-10 covers noninsurers, and so isnot directed specifically to the insurance industry. Ergo,
ERISA's saving clause would not apply.It is far from clear, though, that the terms of $ 4-10 would
even theoretically apply to the matchmaker, for the require-ment that the HMO "provide" the covered service if the independent reviewer finds it medically necessary seems to as-sume that the HMO in question is a provider, not the mere
arranger mentioned in the general definition of an HMO.Even on the most generous reading of Rush's argument,
however, it boils down to the bare possibility (not the likeli-hood) of some overbreadth in the application of $ 4-10 beyond
orthodox HMOs, and there is no reason to think Congresswould have meant such minimal application to noninsurers
to remove a state law entirely from the category of insuranceregulation saved from preemption.

In sum, prior to ERISA's passage, Congress demonstratedan awareness of HMOs as risk-bearing organizations subject
to state insurance regulation, the state Act defines HMOsby reference to risk bearing, HMOs have taken over much
business formerly performed by traditional indemnity insur-ers, and they are almost universally regulated as insurers
under state law. That HMOs are not traditional "indemextent it applied to self-funded plans. This fact, however, does not bear
on Rush's challenge to the law as one that is targeted toward non-riskbearing organizations.

when these Federal Acts were passed." SEC v. VariableAnnuity Life Ins. Co. of America, 359 U. S., at 71. Thus,
the Illinois HMO Act is a law "directed toward" the insur-ance industry, and an "insurance regulation" under a "commonsense" view. B

The McCarran-Ferguson factors confirm our conclusion.A law regulating insurance for McCarran-Ferguson purposes
targets practices or provisions that "ha[ve] the effect oftransferring or spreading a policyholder's risk; . . . [that are]
an integral part of the policy relationship between the in-surer and the insured; and [are] limited to entities within the
insurance industry." Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v. Pireno,458 U. S. 119, 129 (1982). Because the factors are guideposts, a state law is not required to satisfy all threeMcCarran-Ferguson criteria to survive preemption, see
UNUM Life Ins. Co. v. Ward, 526 U. S., at 373, and so wefollow our precedent and leave open whether the review
mandated here may be described as going to a practice that"spread[s] a policyholder's risk." For in any event, the second and third factors are clearly satisfied by $ 4-10.It is obvious enough that the independent review requirement regulates "an integral part of the policy relationshipbetween the insurer and the insured." Illinois adds an
extra layer of review when there is internal disagreementabout an HMO's denial of coverage. The reviewer applies
both a standard of medical care (medical necessity) and char-acteristically, as in this case, construes policy terms. Cf. Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S., at 228-229. The review affectsthe "policy relationship" between HMO and covered persons
by translating the relationship under the HMO agreementinto concrete terms of specific obligation or freedom from
duty. Hence our repeated statements that the interpreta-tion of insurance contracts is at the "core" of the business of

Opinion of the Court
insurance. E. g., SEC v. National Securities, Inc., 393 U. S.
453, 460 (1969).

Rush says otherwise, citing Union Labor Life Ins. Co. v.
Pireno, supra, and insisting that that case holds external
review of coverage decisions to be outside the "policy relationship." But Rush misreads Pireno. We held there that
an insurer's use of a "peer review" committee to gauge the
necessity of particular treatments was not a practice integral
to the policy relationship for the purposes of McCarranFerguson. 458 U. S., at 131-132. We emphasized, however,
that the insurer's resort to peer review was simply the insurer's unilateral choice to seek advice if and when it cared to
do so. The policy said nothing on the matter. The insurer's
contract for advice from a third party was no concern of the
insured, who was not bound by the peer review committee's
recommendation any more, for that matter, than the insurer
was. Thus it was not too much of an exaggeration to conclude that the practice was "a matter of indifference to the
policyholder," id., at 132. Section 4-10, by contrast, is different on all counts, providing as it does a legal right to the
insured, enforceable against the HMO, to obtain an authoritative determination of the HMO's medical obligations.

The final factor, that the law be aimed at a "practice . . .
limited to entities within the insurance industry," id., at 129,
is satisfied for many of the same reasons that the law passes
the commonsense test. The law regulates application of
HMO contracts and provides for review of claim denials; once
it is established that HMO contracts are, in fact, contracts
for insurance (and not merely contracts for medical care), it
is clear that $ 4-10 does not apply to entities outside the insurance industry (although it does not, of course, apply to all
entities within it).

Even if we accepted Rush's contention, rejected already,
that the law regulates HMOs even when they act as pure
administrators, we would still find the third factor satisfied.

Opinion of the Court
That factor requires the targets of the law to be limited toentities within the insurance industry, and even a matchmaking HMO would fall within the insurance industry. But theimplausibility of Rush's hypothesis that the pure administrator would be bound by $ 4-10 obviates any need to say moreunder this third factor. Cf. Barnett Bank of Marion Cty.,
N. A. v. Nelson, 517 U. S. 25, 39 (1996) (holding that a federalstatute permitting banks to act as agents of insurance companies, although not insurers themselves, was a statute regu-lating the "business of insurance" for McCarran-Ferguson
purposes). III

Given that $ 4-10 regulates insurance, ERISA's mandatethat "nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State whichregulates insurance," 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A), ostensibly
forecloses preemption. See Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at746 ("If a state law `regulates insurance,' . . . it is not preempted"). Rush, however, does not give up. It argues forpreemption anyway, emphasizing that the question is ultimately one of congressional intent, which sometimes is soclear that it overrides a statutory provision designed to save
state law from being preempted. See American Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Central Office Telephone, Inc., 524U. S. 214, 227 (1998)

(AT&T) (clause in Communications Actof 1934 purporting to save "the remedies now existing at

common law or by statute," 47 U. S. C. $ 414 (1994 ed.), de-feated by overriding policy of the filed-rate doctrine);

In ERISA law, we have recognized one example of thissort of overpowering federal policy in the civil enforcement
provisions, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a), authorizing civil actions for

six specific types of relief.7 In Massachusetts Mut. Life
Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134 (1985), we said those provisions amounted to an "interlocking, interrelated, and interdependent remedial scheme," id., at 146, which Pilot Life
described as "represent[ing] a careful balancing of the need
for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the
public interest in encouraging the formation of employee
benefit plans," 481 U. S., at 54. So, we have held, the civil
enforcement provisions are of such extraordinarily preemptive power that they override even the "well-pleaded complaint" rule for establishing the conditions under which a
cause of action may be removed to a federal forum. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S., at 63-64.

7 Title 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a) provides in relevant part:
"A civil action may be brought--
"(1) by a participant or beneficiary--
"(A) for the relief provided for in subsection (c) of this section [concerning requests to the administrator for information], or

"(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to

"(3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or

Opinion of the Court

A
Although we have yet to encounter a forced choice be-tween the congressional policies of exclusively federal remedies and the "reservation of the business of insurance to theStates,"

Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 744, n. 21, we haveanticipated such a conflict, with the state insurance regulation losing out if it allows plan participants "to obtainremedies . . . that Congress rejected in ERISA," Pilot Life,
supra, at 54.In Pilot Life, an ERISA plan participant who had been
denied benefits sued in a state court on state tort and con-tract claims. He sought not merely damages for breach of
contract, but also damages for emotional distress and puni-tive damages, both of which we had held unavailable under
relevant ERISA provisions. Russell, supra, at 148. Wenot only rejected the notion that these common law contract
claims "regulat[ed] insurance," Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 50-51,but went on to say that, regardless, Congress intended a
"federal common law of rights and obligations" to developunder ERISA,

id., at 56, without embellishment by inde-pendent state remedies. As in AT&T, we said the saving

clause had to stop short of subverting congressional intent,clearly expressed "through the structure and legislative history[,] that the federal remedy . . . displace state causes ofaction." 481 U. S., at 57.

Rush says that the day has come to turn dictum into hold-ing by declaring that the state insurance regulation, $ 4-10,

is preempted for creating just the kind of "alternative rem-edy" we disparaged in

Pilot Life. As Rush sees it, the inde8 Rush and its amici interpret Pilot Life to have gone a step further to
hold that any law that presents such a conflict with federal goals is simply
not a law that "regulates insurance," however else the "insurance" test
comes out. We believe the point is largely academic. As will be discussed further, even under Rush's approach, a court must still determine
whether the state law at issue does, in fact, create such a conflict. Thus,
we believe that it is more logical to proceed as we have done here.

Opinion of the Court
pendent review procedure is a form of binding arbitrationthat allows an ERISA beneficiary to submit claims to a new

decisionmaker to examine Rush's determination de novo,supplanting judicial review under the "arbitrary and capricious" standard ordinarily applied when discretionary planinterpretations are challenged.

Firestone Tire & Rubber
Co. v. Bruch, 489 U. S. 101, 110-112 (1989). Rush says that
the beneficiary's option falls within Pilot Life's notion of aremedy that "supplement[s] or supplant[s]" the remedies

available under ERISA. 481 U. S., at 56.We think, however, that Rush overstates the rule expressed in Pilot Life. The enquiry into state processes alleged to "supplemen[t] or supplan[t]" the federal scheme by
allowing beneficiaries "to obtain remedies under state law
that Congress rejected in ERISA," id., at 54, has, up to now,
been far more straightforward than it is here. The first case
touching on the point did not involve preemption at all; it
arose from an ERISA beneficiary's reliance on ERISA's own
enforcement scheme to claim a private right of action for
types of damages beyond those expressly provided. Russell, 473 U. S., at 145. We concluded that Congress had not
intended causes of action under ERISA itself beyond those
specified in $ 1132(a). Id., at 148. Two years later we determined in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, supra, that
Congress had so completely preempted the field of benefits
law that an ostensibly state cause of action for benefits was
necessarily a "creature of federal law" removable to federal
court. Id., at 64 (internal quotation marks omitted). Russell and Taylor naturally led to the holding in Pilot Life
that ERISA would not tolerate a diversity action seeking
monetary damages for breach generally and for consequential emotional distress, neither of which Congress had authorized in $ 1132(a). These monetary awards were claimed
as remedies to be provided at the ultimate step of plan enforcement, and even if they could have been characterized as
products of "insurance regulation," they would have signifi536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
cantly expanded the potential scope of ultimate liability im-posed upon employers by the ERISA scheme.

Since Pilot Life, we have found only one other state law to"conflict" with $ 1132(a) in providing a prohibited alternative
remedy. In Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133(1990), we had no trouble finding that Texas's tort of wrongful discharge, turning on an employer's motivation to avoid
paying pension benefits, conflicted with ERISA enforcement;while state law duplicated the elements of a claim available

under ERISA, it converted the remedy from an equitableone under $ 1132(a)(3) (available exclusively in federal district courts) into a legal one for money damages (available in
a state tribunal). Thus, Ingersoll-Rand fit within the category of state laws Pilot Life had held to be incompatible
with ERISA's enforcement scheme; the law provided a form
of ultimate relief in a judicial forum that added to the judicial
remedies provided by ERISA. Any such provision patently
violates ERISA's policy of inducing employers to offer benefits by assuring a predictable set of liabilities, under uniform
standards of primary conduct and a uniform regime of ultimate remedial orders and awards when a violation has occurred. See Pilot Life, supra, at 56 (" `The uniformity of
decision . . . will help administrators . . . predict the legality
of proposed actions without the necessity of reference to
varying state laws' " (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 93-533, p. 12
(1973))); 481 U. S., at 56 ("The expectations that a federal common law of rights and obligations under ERISAregulated plans would develop . . . would make little sense if
the remedies available to ERISA participants and beneficiaries under [$ 1132(a)] could be supplemented or supplanted
by varying state laws").

But this case addresses a state regulatory scheme that
provides no new cause of action under state law and authorizes no new form of ultimate relief. While independent review under $ 4-10 may well settle the fate of a benefit claim
under a particular contract, the state statute does not en536US1 Unit: $U71 [12-16-03 22:43:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
large the claim beyond the benefits available in any action
brought under $ 1132(a). And although the reviewer's determination would presumably replace that of the HMO as
to what is "medically necessary" under this contract,9 the
relief ultimately available would still be what ERISA authorizes in a suit for benefits under $ 1132(a).10 This case
therefore does not involve the sort of additional claim or
remedy exemplified in Pilot Life, Russell, and IngersollRand, but instead bears a resemblance to the claimsprocedure rule that we sustained in UNUM Life Ins. Co. of
America v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358 (1999), holding that a state
law barring enforcement of a policy's time limitation on submitting claims did not conflict with $ 1132(a), even though the
state "rule of decision," id., at 377, could mean the difference
between success and failure for a beneficiary. The procedure provided by $ 4-10 does not fall within Pilot Life's categorical preemption.

9 The parties do not dispute that $ 4-10, as a matter of state law, purports to make the independent reviewer's judgment dispositive as to what
is "medically necessary." We accept this interpretation of the meaning of
the statute for the purposes of our opinion.

10 This is not to say that the court would have no role beyond ordering

compliance with the reviewer's determination. The court would have the
responsibility, for example, to fashion appropriate relief, or to determine
whether other aspects of the plan (beyond the "medical necessity" of a
particular treatment) affect the relative rights of the parties. Rush, for
example, has chosen to guarantee medically necessary services to plan
participants. For that reason, to the extent $ 4-10 may render the independent reviewer the final word on what is necessary, see n. 9, supra,
Rush is obligated to provide the service. But insurance contracts do not
have to contain such guarantees, and not all do. Some, for instance, guarantee medically necessary care, but then modify that obligation by excluding experimental procedures from coverage. See, e. g., Tillery v. Hoffman Enclosures, Inc., 280 F. 3d 1192 (CA8 2002). Obviously, $ 4-10 does
not have anything to say about whether a proposed procedure is experimental. There is also the possibility, though we do not decide the issue
today, that a reviewer's judgment could be challenged as inaccurate or
biased, just as the decision of a plan fiduciary might be so challenged.

Rush still argues for going beyond Pilot Life, making thepreemption issue here one of degree, whether the state procedural imposition interferes unreasonably with Congress'sintention to provide a uniform federal regime of "rights and
obligations" under ERISA. However, "[s]uch disuniformi-ties . . . are the inevitable result of the congressional decision
to `save' local insurance regulation." Metropolitan Life, 471U. S., at 747.

11 Although we have recognized a limited exception from the saving clause for alternative causes of ac-tion and alternative remedies in the sense described above,

we have never indicated that there might be additional jus-tifications for qualifying the clause's application. Rush's
arguments today convince us that further limits on insuranceregulation preserved by ERISA are unlikely to deserve
recognition.To be sure, a State might provide for a type of "review"
that would so resemble an adjudication as to fall within PilotLife's categorical bar. Rush, and the dissent, post, at 394
(opinion of Thomas, J.), contend that $ 4-10 fills that bill byimposing an alternative scheme of arbitral adjudication at

11 Thus, we do not believe that the mere fact that state independent
review laws are likely to entail different procedures will impose burdens
on plan administration that would threaten the object of 29 U. S. C.

$ 1132(a); it is the HMO contracting with a plan, and not the plan itself,
that will be subject to these regulations, and every HMO will have to
establish procedures for conforming with the local laws, regardless of what
this Court may think ERISA forbids. This means that there will be no
special burden of compliance upon an ERISA plan beyond what the HMO
has already provided for. And although the added compliance cost to the
HMO may ultimately be passed on to the ERISA plan, we have said that
such "indirect economic effect[s]," New York State Conference of Blue
Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 659 (1995),
are not enough to preempt state regulation even outside of the insurance
context. We recognize, of course, that a State might enact an independent review requirement with procedures so elaborate, and burdens
so onerous, that they might undermine $ 1132(a). No such system is
before us.

odds with the manifest congressional purpose to confine adjudication of disputes to the courts. It does not turn out to
be this simple, however, and a closer look at the state law
reveals a scheme significantly different from common arbitration as a way of construing and applying contract terms.

In the classic sense, arbitration occurs when "parties in
dispute choose a judge to render a final and binding decision
on the merits of the controversy and on the basis of proofs
presented by the parties." 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel, & T.
Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law $ 2.1.1 (1995) (internal
quotation marks omitted); see also Uniform Arbitration Act

$ 5, 7 U. L. A. 173 (1997) (discussing submission evidence and
empowering arbitrator to "hear and determine the controversy upon the evidence produced"); Commercial Dispute
Resolution Procedures of the American Arbitration Association |||| R33-R35 (Sept. 2000) (discussing the taking of evidence). Arbitrators typically hold hearings at which parties
may submit evidence and conduct cross-examinations, e. g.,
Uniform Arbitration Act $ 5, and are often invested with
many powers over the dispute and the parties, including the
power to subpoena witnesses and administer oaths, e. g., Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U. S. C. $ 7; 28 U. S. C. $ 653; Uniform
Arbitration Act $ 7, 7 U. L. A., at 199; Cal. Civ. Proc. Code
Ann. $$ 1282.6, 1282.8 (West 1982).

Section 4-10 does resemble an arbitration provision, then,
to the extent that the independent reviewer considers disputes about the meaning of the HMO contract 12 and receives
"evidence" in the form of medical records, statements from

12 Nothing in the Act states that the reviewer should refer to the definitions of medical necessity contained in the contract, but the reviewer did,
in this case, refer to that definition. Thus, we will assume that some
degree of contract interpretation is required under the Act. Were no interpretation required, there would be a real question as to whether $ 4-10
is properly characterized as a species of mandated-benefit law of the type
we approved in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S.
724 (1985).

Opinion of the Court
physicians, and the like. But this is as far as the resem-blance to arbitration goes, for the other features of review

under $ 4-10 give the proceeding a different character, onenot at all at odds with the policy behind $ 1132(a). The Act
does not give the independent reviewer a free-ranging powerto construe contract terms, but instead, confines review to a
single term: the phrase "medical necessity," used to definethe services covered under the contract. This limitation, in
turn, implicates a feature of HMO benefit determinationsthat we described in

Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211(2000). We explained that when an HMO guarantees medically necessary care, determinations of coverage "cannot beuntangled from physicians' judgments about reasonable medical treatment." Id., at 229. This is just how the IllinoisAct operates; the independent examiner must be a physician
with credentials similar to those of the primary care physi-cian, 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 4-10 (2000), and is expected to exercise independent medical judgment in decidingwhat medical necessity requires. Accordingly, the reviewer
in this case did not hold the kind of conventional evidentiaryhearing common in arbitration, but simply received medical
records submitted by the parties, and ultimately came toa professional judgment of his own. Tr. of Oral Arg. 30-32.

Once this process is set in motion, it does not resembleeither contract interpretation or evidentiary litigation before
a neutral arbiter, as much as it looks like a practice (havingnothing to do with arbitration) of obtaining another medical
opinion. The reference to an independent reviewer is simi-lar to the submission to a second physician, which many
health insurers are required by law to provide before deny-ing coverage.

13

The practice of obtaining a second opinion, however, is farremoved from any notion of an enforcement scheme, and

384 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN

Opinion of the Court
once $ 4-10 is seen as something akin to a mandate forsecond-opinion practice in order to ensure sound medical

judgments, the preemption argument that arbitration under$ 4-10 supplants judicial enforcement runs out of steam.

Next, Rush argues that $ 4-10 clashes with a substantiverule intended to be preserved by the system of uniform enforcement, stressing a feature of judicial review highlyprized by benefit plans: a deferential standard for reviewing
benefit denials. Whereas Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.
Bruch, 489 U. S., at 115, recognized that an ERISA plancould be designed to grant "discretion" to a plan fiduciary,

deserving deference from a court reviewing a discretionaryjudgment, $ 4-10 provides that when a plan purchases medical services and insurance from an HMO, benefit denials aresubject to apparently de novo review. If a plan should continue to balk at providing a service the reviewer has foundmedically necessary, the reviewer's determination could
carry great weight in a subsequent suit for benefits under$ 1132(a),

14 depriving the plan of the judicial deference a fiduciary's medical judgment might have obtained if judicialreview of the plan's decision had been immediate.

15

Again, however, the significance of $ 4-10 is not whollycaptured by Rush's argument, which requires some perspec14 See n. 10, supra.
15 An issue implicated by this case but requiring no resolution is the

degree to which a plan provision for unfettered discretion in benefit determinations guarantees truly deferential review. In Firestone Tire itself,
we noted that review for abuse of discretion would home in on any conflict
of interest on the plan fiduciary's part, if a conflict was plausibly raised.
That last observation was underscored only two Terms ago in Pegram v.
Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211 (2000), when we again noted the potential for conflict when an HMO makes decisions about appropriate treatment, see id.,
at 219-220. It is a fair question just how deferential the review can be
when the judicial eye is peeled for conflict of interest. Moreover, as we
explained in Pegram, "it is at least questionable whether Congress would
have had mixed eligibility decisions in mind when it provided that decisions administering a plan were fiduciary in nature." Id., at 232. Our
decision today does not require us to resolve these questions.

Opinion of the Court
tive for evaluation. First, in determining whether stateprocedural requirements deprive plan administrators of any

right to a uniform standard of review, it is worth recallingthat ERISA itself provides nothing about the standard. It
simply requires plans to afford a beneficiary some mechanismfor internal review of a benefit denial, 29 U. S. C. $ 1133(2),
and provides a right to a subsequent judicial forum for aclaim to recover benefits, $ 1132(a)(1)(B). Whatever the
standards for reviewing benefit denials may be, they cannotconflict with anything in the text of the statute, which we
have read to require a uniform judicial regime of categoriesof relief and standards of primary conduct, not a uniformly
lenient regime of reviewing benefit determinations. See
Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 56.16Not only is there no ERISA provision directly providing

a lenient standard for judicial review of benefit denials, butthere is no requirement necessarily entailing such an effect
even indirectly. When this Court dealt with the reviewstandards on which the statute was silent, we held that a
general or default rule of de novo review could be replaced

16 Rush presents the alternative argument that $ 4-10 is preempted as
conflicting with ERISA's requirement that a benefit denial be reviewed by
a named fiduciary, 29 U. S. C. $ 1133(2). Rush contends that $ 4-10 interferes with fiduciary discretion by forcing the provision of benefits over a
fiduciary's objection. Happily, we need not decide today whether $ 1133(2)
carries the same preemptive force of $ 1132(a) such that it overrides even
the express saving clause for insurance regulation, because we see no conflict. Section 1133 merely requires that plans provide internal appeals of
benefit denials; $ 4-10 plays no role in this process, instead providing for
extra review once the internal process is complete. Nor is there any conflict in the removal of fiduciary "discretion"; as described below, ERISA
does not require that such decisions be discretionary, and insurance regulation is not preempted merely because it conflicts with substantive plan
terms. See UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358, 376
(1999) ("Under [Petitioner's] interpretation . . . insurers could displace any
state regulation simply by inserting a contrary term in plan documents.
This interpretation would virtually rea[d] the saving clause out of ERISA"

Opinion of the Court
by deferential review if the ERISA plan itself provided thatthe plan's benefit determinations were matters of high or

unfettered discretion, see Firestone Tire, supra, at 115.Nothing in ERISA, however, requires that these kinds of
decisions be so "discretionary" in the first place; whetherthey are is simply a matter of plan design or the drafting
of an HMO contract. In this respect, then, $ 4-10 prohibitsdesigning an insurance contract so as to accord unfettered
discretion to the insurer to interpret the contract's terms.As such, it does not implicate ERISA's enforcement scheme
at all, and is no different from the types of substantive stateregulation of insurance contracts we have in the past permitted to survive preemption, such as mandated-benefit statutesand statutes prohibiting the denial of claims solely on the
ground of untimeliness.17 See Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.
Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985); UNUM Life Ins. Co. ofAmerica v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358 (1999).

In sum, $ 4-10 imposes no new obligation or remedy likethe causes of action considered in

Russell, Pilot Life, andIngersoll-Rand. Even in its formal guise, the State Act

bears a closer resemblance to second-opinion requirementsthan to arbitration schemes. Deferential review in the
HMO context is not a settled given; $ 4-10 operates beforethe stage of judicial review; the independent reviewer's de
novo examination of the benefit claim mirrors the general or

17 We do not mean to imply that States are free to create other forms of
binding arbitration to provide de novo review of any terms of insurance
contracts; as discussed above, our decision rests in part on our recognition
that the disuniformity Congress hoped to avoid is not implicated by decisions that are so heavily imbued with expert medical judgments. Rather,
we hold that the feature of $ 4-10 that provides a different standard of
review with respect to mixed eligibility decisions from what would be
available in court is not enough to create a conflict that undermines congressional policy in favor of uniformity of remedies.

Opinion of the Court
default rule we have ourselves recognized; and its effect isno greater than that of mandated-benefit regulation.

In deciding what to make of these facts and conclusions, ithelps to go back to where we started and recall the ways
States regulate insurance in looking out for the welfare of
their citizens. Illinois has chosen to regulate insurance as
one way to regulate the practice of medicine, which we have
previously held to be permissible under ERISA, see Metropolitan Life, 471 U. S., at 741. While the statute designed
to do this undeniably eliminates whatever may have remained of a plan sponsor's option to minimize scrutiny of
benefit denials, this effect of eliminating an insurer's autonomy to guarantee terms congenial to its own interests is the
stuff of garden variety insurance regulation through the imposition of standard policy terms. See id., at 742 ("[S]tate
laws regulating the substantive terms of insurance contracts
were commonplace well before the mid-70's"). It is therefore hard to imagine a reservation of state power to regulate
insurance that would not be meant to cover restrictions of
the insurer's advantage in this kind of way. And any lingering doubt about the reasonableness of $ 4-10 in affecting the
application of $ 1132(a) may be put to rest by recalling that
regulating insurance tied to what is medically necessary is
probably inseparable from enforcing the quintessentially
state-law standards of reasonable medical care. See Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S., at 236. "[I]n the field of health
care, a subject of traditional state regulation, there is no
ERISA preemption without clear manifestation of congressional purpose." Id., at 237. To the extent that benefit
litigation in some federal courts may have to account for the
effects of $ 4-10, it would be an exaggeration to hold that the
objectives of $ 1132(a) are undermined. The saving clause is
entitled to prevail here, and we affirm the judgment.

It is so ordered.

388 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN

Thomas, J., dissenting
Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.

This Court has repeatedly recognized that ERISA's civilenforcement provision, $ 502 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C. $ 1132, pro-vides the exclusive vehicle for actions asserting a claim for
benefits under health plans governed by ERISA, and there-fore that state laws that create additional remedies are preempted. See, e. g., Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S.41, 52 (1987);

Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell,
473 U. S. 134, 146-147 (1985). Such exclusivity of remedies
is necessary to further Congress' interest in establishing auniform federal law of employee benefits so that employers

are encouraged to provide benefits to their employees: "Torequire plan providers to design their programs in an environment of differing state regulations would complicate theadministration of nationwide plans, producing inefficiencies
that employers might offset with decreased benefits." FMC
Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52, 60 (1990).

Of course, the "expectations that a federal common law of
rights and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans would
develop . . . would make little sense if the remedies available
to ERISA participants and beneficiaries under $ 502(a) could
be supplemented or supplanted by varying state laws."
Pilot Life, supra, at 56. Therefore, as the Court concedes,
see ante, at 377, even a state law that "regulates insurance"
may be pre-empted if it supplements the remedies provided
by ERISA, despite ERISA's saving clause, $ 514(b)(2)(A), 29
U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A). See Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corp.,
464 U. S. 238, 248 (1984) (noting that state laws that stand as
an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and
objectives of Congress are pre-empted).1 Today, however,

1 I would assume without deciding that 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125,

$ 4-10 (2000) is a law that "regulates insurance." We can begin and end
the pre-emption analysis by asking if $ 4-10 conflicts with the provisions

the Court takes the unprecedented step of allowing respond-ent Debra Moran to short circuit ERISA's remedial scheme

by allowing her claim for benefits to be determined in thefirst instance through an arbitral-like procedure provided
under Illinois law, and by a decisionmaker other than a court.See 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 4-10 (2000). This decision
not only conflicts with our precedents, it also eviscerates theuniformity of ERISA remedies Congress deemed integral to
the "careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claimssettlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans." Pilot Life,
supra, at 54. I would reverse the Court of Appeals' judg-ment and remand for a determination whether Moran was

entitled to reimbursement absent the independent reviewconducted under $ 4-10.

I
From the facts of this case one can readily understand whyMoran sought recourse under $ 4-10. Moran is covered

by a medical benefits plan sponsored by her husband's em-ployer and governed by ERISA. Petitioner Rush Prudential HMO, Inc., is the employer's health maintenance organi-zation (HMO) provider for the plan. Petitioner's Member
Certificate of Coverage (Certificate) details the scope ofcoverage under the plan and provides petitioner with "the
broadest possible discretion" to interpret the terms of theplan and to determine participants' entitlement to benefits.
1 Record, Exh. A, p. 8. The Certificate specifically excludesfrom coverage services that are not "medically necessary."

520 U. S. 833, 841 (1997).

2 While the Court characterizes it as an "unconventional treatment," the

Court of Appeals described this surgery more clinically as "rib resection,
extensive scale-nectomy," and "microneurolysis of the lower roots of the
brachial plexus under intraoperative microscopic magnification." 230

Thomas, J., dissenting
Moran's surgery, which was performed by an unaffiliateddoctor, petitioner denied coverage for the procedure on at

least three separate occasions, concluding that this surgerywas not "medically necessary." For the same reason, petitioner denied Moran's request for postsurgery reimburse-ment in the amount of $94,841.27. Before finally determining that the specific treatment sought by Moran was not"medically necessary," petitioner consulted no fewer than six
doctors, reviewed Moran's medical records, and consultedpeer-reviewed medical literature.

3

In the course of its review, petitioner informed Moran that"there is no prevailing opinion within the appropriate specialty of the United States medical profession that the proce-dure proposed [by Moran] is safe and effective for its intended use and that the omission of the procedure wouldadversely affect [her] medical condition." 1 Record, Exh. E,
at 2. Petitioner did agree to cover the standard treatmentfor Moran's ailment, see n. 2,

supra; n. 4, infra, concludingthat peer-reviewed literature "demonstrates that [the standard surgery] is effective therapy in the treatment of [Moran'scondition]." 1 Record, Exh. E, at 3.

Moran, however, was not satisfied with this option. Afterexhausting the plan's internal review mechanism, Moran

F. 3d 959, 963 (CA7 2000). The standard procedure for Moran's condition,
as described by the Court of Appeals, involves (like the nonstandard surgery) rib resection with scale-nectomy, but it does not include "microneurolysis of the brachial plexus," which is the procedure Moran wanted and
her primary care physician recommended. See id., at 963-964. In any
event, no one disputes that the procedure was not the standard surgical
procedure for Moran's condition or that the Certificate covers even nonstandard surgery if it is "medically necessary."

3 Petitioner thus appears to have complied with $ 503 of ERISA, which

requires every employee benefit plan to "provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the
plan has been denied," and to "afford a reasonable opportunity to any
participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair
review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the
claim." 29 U. S. C. $ 1133.

chose to bypass the relief provided by ERISA. She invoked$ 4-10 of the Illinois HMO Act, which requires HMOs to provide a mechanism for review by an independent physicianwhen the patient's primary care physician and HMO disagree
about the medical necessity of a treatment proposed by theprimary care physician. See 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125,

$ 4-10 (2000). While Moran's primary care physician ac-knowledged that petitioner's affiliated surgeons had not recommended the unconventional surgery and that he was not"an expert in this or any other area of surgery," 1 Record,
Exh. C, he nonetheless opined, without explanation, that
Moran would be "best served" by having that surgery, ibid.Dr. A. Lee Dellon, an unaffiliated physician who served as

the independent medical reviewer, concluded that the sur-gery for which petitioner denied coverage "was appropriate,"
that it was "the same type of surgery" he would have done,and that Moran "had all of the indications and therefore the
medical necessity to carry out" the nonstandard surgery.Appellant's Separate App. (CA7), pp. A42-A43.

4 Under $ 4-

10, Dr. Dellon's determination conclusively established Moran's right to benefits under Illinois law. See 215 Ill. Comp.Stat., ch. 125, $ 4-10 ("In the event that the reviewing physician determines the covered service to be medically neces-sary, the [HMO]

shall provide the covered service" (emphasis added)). 230 F. 3d 959, 972-973 (CA7 2000).Nevertheless, petitioner again denied benefits, steadfastly

maintaining that the unconventional surgery was not medi-cally necessary.

ment of the District Court based solely on Dr. Dellon's judg-ment that the surgery was "medically necessary."

II
Section 514(a)'s broad language provides that ERISA"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they . . .

relate to any employee benefit plan," except as provided in$ 514(b). 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a). This language demonstrates
"Congress's intent to establish the regulation of employeewelfare benefit plans `as exclusively a federal concern.' "
New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield
Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 656 (1995) (quot-ing Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504, 523

(1981)). It was intended to "ensure that plans and plansponsors would be subject to a uniform body of benefits law"
so as to "minimize the administrative and financial burden ofcomplying with conflicting directives among States or between States and the Federal Government" and to prevent"the potential for conflict in substantive law . . . requiring the
tailoring of plans and employer conduct to the peculiarities ofthe law of each jurisdiction." Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 142 (1990). See also Egelhoff v.Egelhoff, 532 U. S. 141, 148 (2001).

To be sure, this broad goal of uniformity is in some tensionwith the so-called "saving clause," which provides that
ERISA does not "exempt or relieve any person from any lawof any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities." $ 514(b)(2)(A) of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(2)(A).As the Court has suggested on more than one occasion, the
pre-emption and saving clauses are almost antitheticallybroad and " `are not a model of legislative drafting.' "

cluded that federal pre-emption occurs where state law gov-erning insurance " `stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' "
Harris Trust, supra, at 99 (quoting Silkwood, 464 U. S., at
248).Consequently, the Court until today had consistently held

that state laws that seek to supplant or add to the exclusive
remedies in $ 502(a) of ERISA, 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a), are pre-empted because they conflict with Congress' objective that

rights under ERISA plans are to be enforced under a uni-form national system. See,

e. g., Ingersoll-Rand Co., supra,
at 142-145; Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, 481 U. S.
58, 64-66 (1987); Pilot Life, supra, at 52-57. The Court has
explained that $ 502(a) creates an "interlocking, interrelated,
and interdependent remedial scheme," and that a beneficiary
who claims that he was wrongfully denied benefits has
"a panoply of remedial devices" at his disposal. Russell, 473
U. S., at 146. It is exactly this enforcement scheme that
Pilot Life described as "represent[ing] a careful balancing of
the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures
against the public interest in encouraging the formation of
employee benefit plans," 481 U. S., at 54. Central to that
balance is the development of "a federal common law of
rights and obligations under ERISA-regulated plans." Id.,
at 56.

In addressing the relationship between ERISA's remedies
under $ 502(a) and a state law regulating insurance, the
Court has observed that "[t]he policy choices reflected in the
inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others
under the federal scheme would be completely undermined
if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in
ERISA." Id., at 54. Thus, while the preeminent federal
interest in the uniform administration of employee benefit
plans yields in some instances to varying state regulation of
the business of insurance, the exclusivity and uniformity of

Thomas, J., dissenting
ERISA's enforcement scheme remains paramount. "Con-gress intended $ 502(a) to be the exclusive remedy for rights

guaranteed under ERISA." Ingersoll-Rand Co., supra, at144. In accordance with ordinary principles of conflict preemption, therefore, even a state law "regulating insurance"will be pre-empted if it provides a separate vehicle to assert
a claim for benefits outside of, or in addition to, ERISA'sremedial scheme. See,

e. g., Pilot Life, supra, at 54 (citingRussell, supra, at 146); Harris Trust, supra, at 99 (citing

Silkwood, supra, at 248). III

The question for the Court, therefore, is whether $ 4-10provides such a vehicle. Without question, Moran had a
"panoply of remedial devices," Russell, supra, at 146, avail-able under $ 502 of ERISA when petitioner denied her claim
for benefits.5 Section 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA provided themost obvious remedy: a civil suit to recover benefits due
under the terms of the plan. 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(1)(B).But rather than bring such a suit, Moran sought to have her
right to benefits determined outside of ERISA's remedialscheme through the arbitral-like mechanism available under

$ 4-10.Section 4-10 cannot be characterized as anything other
than an alternative state-law remedy or vehicle for seekingbenefits. In the first place, $ 4-10 comes into play only if the
HMO and the claimant dispute the claimant's entitlement tobenefits; the purpose of the review is to determine whether
a claimant is entitled to benefits. Contrary to the majority'scharacterization of $ 4-10 as nothing more than a state law

5 Commonly included in the panoply constituting part of this enforcement scheme are: suits under $ 502(a)(1)(B) (authorizing an action to recover benefits, obtain a declaratory judgment that one is entitled to benefits, and to enjoin an improper refusal to pay benefits); suits under

$$ 502(a)(2) and 409 (authorizing suit to seek removal of the fiduciary); and
a claim for attorney's fees under $ 502(g). See Russell, 473 U. S., at 146-
147; Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U. S. 41, 53 (1987).

regarding medical standards, ante, at 383-384, it is in fact abinding determination of whether benefits are due: "In the

event that the reviewing physician determines the coveredservice to be medically necessary, the [HMO]

shall provide
the covered service." 215 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 125, $ 4-10(2000) (emphasis added). Section 4-10 is thus most precisely

characterized as an arbitration-like mechanism to settle benefits disputes. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23 (conceding as much).

There is no question that arbitration constitutes an alter-native remedy to litigation. See,

e. g., Air Line Pilots v.
Miller, 523 U. S. 866, 876, 880 (1998) (referring to "arbitral
remedy" and "arbitration remedy"); DelCostello v. Teamsters, 462 U. S. 151, 163 (1983) (referring to "arbitration remedies"); Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny,
442 U. S. 366, 377-378 (1979) (noting that arbitration and
litigation are "alternative remedies"); 3 D. Dobbs, Law of
Remedies $ 12.23 (2d ed. 1993) (explaining that arbitration
"is itself a remedy"). Consequently, although a contractual
agreement to arbitrate--which does not constitute a "State
law" relating to "any employee benefit plan"--is outside

$ 514(a) of ERISA's pre-emptive scope, States may not circumvent ERISA pre-emption by mandating an alternative
arbitral-like remedy as a plan term enforceable through an
ERISA action.

To be sure, the majority is correct that $ 4-10 does not
mirror all procedural and evidentiary aspects of "common
arbitration." Ante, at 381-383. But as a binding decision
on the merits of the controversy the $ 4-10 review resembles
nothing so closely as arbitration. See generally 1 I. MacNeil, R. Spediel, & T. Stipanowich, Federal Arbitration Law

$ 2.1.1 (1995). That the decision of the $ 4-10 medical reviewer is ultimately enforceable through a suit under $ 502(a)
of ERISA further supports the proposition that it tracks the
arbitral remedy. Like the decision of any arbitrator, it is
enforceable through a subsequent judicial action, but judicial

review of an arbitration award is very limited, as was theCourt of Appeals' review in this case. See, e. g., Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 36-37 (1987) (quoting Steel-workers v. American Mfg. Co., 363 U. S. 564, 567-568 (1960)).
Although the Court of Appeals recharacterized Moran'sclaim for reimbursement under $ 4-10 as a claim for benefits
under $ 502(a)(1)(B) of ERISA, the Court of Appeals did notinterpret the plan terms or purport to analyze whether the
plan fiduciary had engaged in the "full and fair review" ofMoran's claim for benefits that $ 503(2) of ERISA, 29 U. S. C.

$ 1133(2), requires. Rather, it rubberstamped the independ-ent medical reviewer's judgment that Moran's surgery was
"medically necessary," granting summary judgment toMoran on her claim for benefits solely on that basis. Thus,
as Judge Posner aptly noted in his dissent from the denialof rehearing en banc below, $ 4-10 "establishes a system of
appellate review of benefits decisions that is distinct fromthe provision in ERISA for suits in federal court to enforce
entitlements conferred by ERISA plans." 230 F. 3d, at 973.

The Court of Appeals attempted to evade the pre-emptiveforce of ERISA's exclusive remedial scheme primarily by

characterizing the alternative enforcement mechanism cre-ated by $ 4-10 as a "contract term" under state law.

because it is a law that "regulates insurance," and that it does not conflict

sort that survived ERISA pre-emption in UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America
v. Ward, 526 U. S. 358, 375-376 (1999). In the Court of Appeals' view, the
independent review provision, like any other mandatory contract term,
can be enforced through an action brought under $ 502(a) of ERISA, 29
U. S. C. $ 1132(a), pursuant to state law. 230 F. 3d, at 972.

claim beyond the benefits available in any action broughtunder $ 1132(a)," and characterizing it as "something akin to

a mandate for second-opinion practice in order to ensuresound medical judgments."

Ante, at 379-380, 384. Neither
approach is sound.The Court of Appeals' approach assumes that a State may

impose an alternative enforcement mechanism through mandated contract terms even though it could not otherwise im-pose such an enforcement mechanism on a health plan governed by ERISA. No party cites any authority for thatnovel proposition, and I am aware of none. Cf.

Fort Halifax
Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1987) (noting that
a State cannot avoid ERISA pre-emption on the ground that
its regulation only mandates a benefit plan; such an approach
would "permit States to circumvent ERISA's pre-emption
provision, by allowing them to require directly what they
are forbidden to regulate"). To hold otherwise would be to
eviscerate ERISA's comprehensive and exclusive remedial
scheme because a claim to benefits under an employee benefits plan could be determined under each State's particular
remedial devices so long as they were made contract terms.
Such formalist tricks cannot be sufficient to bypass ERISA's
exclusive remedies; we should not interpret ERISA in such
a way as to destroy it.

With respect to the Court's position, Congress' intention
that $ 502(a) be the exclusive remedy for rights guaranteed
under ERISA has informed this Court's weighing of the
pre-emption and saving clauses. While the Court has previously focused on ERISA's overall enforcement mechanism
and remedial scheme, see infra, at 393-394, the Court today
ignores the "interlocking, interrelated, and interdependent"
nature of that remedial scheme and announces that the relevant inquiry is whether a state regulatory scheme "provides
[a] new cause of action" or authorizes a "new form of ultimate
relief." Ante, at 379. These newly created principles have
no roots in the precedents of this Court. That $ 4-10 also

effectively provides for a second opinion to better ensuresound medical practice is simply irrelevant to the question

whether it, in fact, provides a binding mechanism for a par-ticipant or beneficiary to pursue a claim for benefits because
it is on this latter basis that $ 4-10 is pre-empted.The Court's attempt to diminish $ 4-10's effect by characterizing it as one where "the reviewer's determination would
presumably replace that of the HMO," ante, at 380 (emphasisadded), is puzzling given that the statute makes such a determination conclusive and the Court of Appeals treated it as abinding adjudication. For these same reasons, it is troubling that the Court views the review under $ 4-10 as noth-ing more than a practice "of obtaining a second [medical]
opinion." Ante, at 383. The independent reviewer may,like most arbitrators, possess special expertise or knowledge
in the area subject to arbitration. But while a second medi-cal opinion is nothing more than that--an opinion--a determination under $ 4-10 is a conclusive determination with re-spect to the award of benefits. And the Court's reference
to Pegram v. Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211 (2000), as support for
its Alice in Wonderland-like claim that the $ 4-10 proceedingis "far removed from any notion of an enforcement scheme,"

ante, at 383, is equally perplexing, given that the treatmentis long over and the issue presented is purely an eligibility
decision with respect to reimbursement.7

7 I also disagree with the Court's suggestion that, following Pegram v.
Herdrich, 530 U. S. 211 (2000), HMOs are exempted from ERISA whenever a coverage or reimbursement decision relies in any respect on medical judgment. Ante, at 383, 386, n. 17. Pegram decided the limited question whether relief was available under $ 1109 for claims of fiduciary
breach against HMOs based on its physicians' medical decisions. Quite
sensibly, in my view, that question was answered in the negative because
otherwise, "for all practical purposes, every claim of fiduciary breach by
an HMO physician making a mixed decision would boil down to a malpractice claim, and the fiduciary standard would be nothing but the malpractice
standard traditionally applied in actions against physicians." 530 U. S.,
at 235.

Thomas, J., dissenting
As we held in Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts,471 U. S. 724 (1985), a State may, of course, require that employee health plans provide certain substantive benefits.See

id., at 746 (holding that a state law mandating mental
health benefits was not within ERISA's pre-emptive reach).Indeed, were a State to require that insurance companies

provide all "medically necessary care" or even that it must
provide a second opinion before denying benefits, I have lit-tle doubt that such

substantive requirements would withstand ERISA's pre-emptive force. But recourse to thosebenefits, like all others, could be sought only through an action under $ 502 and not, as is the case here, through an
arbitration-like remedial device. Section 4-10 does not, in
any event, purport to extend a new substantive benefit.
Rather, it merely sets up a procedure to conclusively determine whether the HMO's decision to deny benefits was correct when the parties disagree, a task that lies within the
exclusive province of the courts through an action under

$ 502(a).

By contrast, a state law regulating insurance that merely
affects whether a plan participant or beneficiary may pursue
the remedies available under ERISA's remedial scheme, such
as California's notice-prejudice rule, is not pre-empted because it has nothing to do with $ 502(a)'s exclusive enforcement scheme. In UNUM Life Ins. Co. of America v. Ward,
526 U. S. 358 (1999), the Court evaluated California's socalled notice-prejudice rule, which provides that an insurer
cannot avoid liability in cases where a claim is not filed in
a timely fashion absent proof that the insurer was actually
prejudiced because of the delay. In holding that it was not
pre-empted, the Court did not suggest that this rule provided a substantive plan term. The Court expressly declined to address the Solicitor General's argument that the
saving clause saves even state law "conferring causes of action or affecting remedies that regulate insurance." See id.,
at 376-377, n. 7 (internal quotation marks omitted). While

Thomas, J., dissenting
a law may "effectively creat[e] a mandatory contract term,"id., at 374 (internal quotation marks omitted), and even provide the rule of decision with respect to whether a claimis out of time, and thus whether benefits will ultimately be
received, such laws do not create an alternative enforcementmechanism with respect to recovery of plan benefits. They
merely allow the participant to proceed via ERISA's enforce-ment scheme. To my mind, neither

Metropolitan Life norUNUM addresses, let alone purports to answer, the question

before us today. * * *

Section 4-10 constitutes an arbitral-like state remedythrough which plan members may seek to resolve conclusively a disputed right to benefits. Some 40 other Stateshave similar laws, though these vary as to applicability, procedures, standards, deadlines, and consequences of independ-ent review. See Brief for Respondent State of Illinois 12,
n. 4 (citing state independent review statutes); see also Kai-ser Family Foundation, K. Politz, J. Crowley, K. Lucia, & E.
Bangit, Assessing State External Review Programs and theEffects of Pending Federal Patients' Rights Legislation (May
2002) (comparing state program features). Allowing dispar-ate state laws that provide inconsistent external review requirements to govern a participant's or beneficiary's claim to
benefits under an employee benefit plan is wholly destructiveof Congress' expressly stated goal of uniformity in this area.

Moreover, it is inimical to a scheme for furthering and pro-tecting the "careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair
claims settlement procedures against the public interest inencouraging the formation of employee benefit plans," given
that the development of a federal common law underERISA-regulated plans has consistently been deemed central to that balance.8 Pilot Life, 481 U. S., at 54, 56. While

Thomas, J., dissenting
it is true that disuniformity is the inevitable result of the
congressional decision to save local insurance regulation, this
does not answer the altogether different question before the
Court today, which is whether a state law "regulating insurance" nonetheless provides a separate vehicle to assert a
claim for benefits outside of, or in addition to, ERISA's remedial scheme. See, e. g., id., at 54 (citing Russell, 473 U. S.,
at 146); Harris Trust, 510 U. S., at 99 (citing Silkwood, 464
U. S., at 248). If it does, the exclusivity and uniformity of
ERISA's enforcement scheme must remain paramount and
the state law is pre-empted in accordance with ordinary principles of conflict pre-emption.9

v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 662 (1995), which holds that a state
law providing for surcharges on hospital rates did not, based solely on
their indirect economic effect, "bear the requisite `connection with' ERISA
plans to trigger pre-emption." But Travelers addressed only the question whether a state law "relates to" an ERISA plan so as to fall within

$ 514(a)'s broad pre-emptive scope in the first place and is not relevant to
the inquiry here. The Court holds that "[i]t is beyond serious dispute,"
ante, at 365, that $ 4-10 does "relate to" an ERISA plan; $ 4-10's economic
effects are necessarily relevant to the extent that they upset the object of

$ 1132(a). See Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 142 (1990)
("Section 514(a) was intended to ensure that plans and plan sponsors would
be subject to a uniform body of benefits law; the goal was to minimize the
administrative and financial burden of complying with conflicting directives among States or between States and the Federal Government. Otherwise, the inefficiencies created could work to the detriment of plan
beneficiaries").

9 The Court isolates the "plan" from the HMO and then concludes that

the independent review provision does not "threaten the object of 29
U. S. C. $ 1132" because it does not affect the plan, but only the HMO.
Ante, at 381, n. 11. To my knowledge such a distinction is novel.
Cf. Pegram, 530 U. S., at 223 (recognizing that the agreement between an
HMO and an employer may provide elements of a plan by setting out the
rules under which care is provided). Its application is particularly novel
here, where the Court appears to view the HMO as the plan administrator,
leaving one to wonder how the myriad state independent review procedures can help but have an impact on plan administration. Ante, at 363,
n. 3.

402 RUSH PRUDENTIAL HMO, INC. v. MORAN

Thomas, J., dissenting
For the reasons noted by the Court, independent reviewprovisions may sound very appealing. Efforts to expand

the variety of remedies available to aggrieved beneficiariesbeyond those set forth in ERISA are obviously designed to
increase the chances that patients will be able to receivetreatments they desire, and most of us are naturally sympathetic to those suffering from illness who seek further op-tions. Nevertheless, the Court would do well to remember
that no employer is required to provide any health benefitplan under ERISA and that the entire advent of managed
care, and the genesis of HMOs, stemmed from spiralinghealth costs. To the extent that independent review provisions such as $ 4-10 make it more likely that HMOs will haveto subsidize beneficiaries' treatments of choice, they undermine the ability of HMOs to control costs, which, in turn,undermines the ability of employers to provide health care
coverage for employees.As a consequence, independent review provisions could
create a disincentive to the formation of employee healthbenefit plans, a problem that Congress addressed by making
ERISA's remedial scheme exclusive and uniform. While itmay well be the case that the advantages of allowing States
to implement independent review requirements as a supple-ment to the remedies currently provided under ERISA outweigh this drawback, this is a judgment that, pursuant toERISA, must be made by Congress. I respectfully dissent.

403OCTOBER TERM, 2001
Syllabus

CHRISTOPHER, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE,

et al. v. HARBURY

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe district of columbia circuit

No. 01-394. Argued March 18, 2002--Decided June 20, 2002
Respondent-plaintiff Harbury alleges that Government officials intentionally deceived her in concealing information that her husband, a Guatemalan dissident, had been detained, tortured, and executed by Guatemalan army officers paid by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and
that this deception denied her access to the courts by leaving her

without information, or reason to seek information, with which she
could have brought a lawsuit that might have saved her husband's life.
In the District Court, Harbury raised against the CIA, State Department, National Security Council, and officials of each, common- and international law tort claims, and claims under Bivens v. Six Unknown
Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, on behalf of her husband's estate,
and on her own behalf for violation of, inter alia, her constitutional right
of access to courts. The District Court dismissed the Bivens claims.
With respect to the access-to-courts counts, the court held that Harbury
had not stated a valid cause of action because (1) having filed no prior
suit, she could only guess how the alleged coverup might have prejudiced her rights to bring a separate action, and (2) the defendants would
be entitled to qualified immunity. Harbury appealed the dismissal of
her Bivens claims, but the District of Columbia Circuit reversed only
the dismissal of her Bivens claim against petitioners for denial of access
to courts.

Held: Harbury has not stated a claim for denial of judicial access.

Pp. 412-422.

(a) Access-to-courts claims fall into two categories: claims that systemic official action frustrates a plaintiff in preparing and filing suits at
the present time, where the suits could be pursued once the frustrating
condition has been removed; and claims of specific cases that cannot be
tried, no matter what official action may be in the future. Regardless
of whether the claim turns on a litigating opportunity yet to be gained
or an opportunity already lost, the point of recognizing an access claim
is to provide some effective vindication for a separate and distinct right
to seek judicial relief for some wrong. Thus, the access-to-courts right
is ancillary to the underlying claim, without which a plaintiff cannot
have suffered injury by being shut out of court. It follows that the

536US1 Unit: $U72 [12-16-03 22:55:02] PAGES PGT: OPIN
404 CHRISTOPHER v. HARBURY

Syllabus
underlying claim is an element that must be described in the complaint
as though it were being independently pursued; and that, when the access claim (like this one) looks backward, the complaint must identify a
remedy that may be awarded as recompense but not otherwise available
in some suit that may yet be brought. The underlying cause of action
and its lost remedy must be addressed by allegations in the complaint
sufficient to give the defendant fair notice. The facts of this case underscore the need for care in stating a tenable predicate cause of action.
The alleged acts were apparently taken in the conduct of foreign relations by the National Government, and any judicial enquiry will raise
concerns for the separation of powers in trenching on matters committed to the other branches. Since the need to resolve such constitutional issues should be avoided where possible, the trial court should be
in a position as soon as possible to know whether a constitutional ruling
may be obviated because the denied access allegations fail to state a
claim. Pp. 412-418.

(b) Harbury's complaint did not come even close to stating a constitutional denial-of-access claim upon which relief could be granted. It did
not identify the underlying cause of action that the alleged disruption
had compromised, leaving the District Court and the defendants to
guess as to the unstated action supposedly lost and at the remedy being
sought independently of relief that might be available on the complaint's
other counts. Harbury's position did not improve when the Court of
Appeals gave her counsel an opportunity at oral argument to supply
the missing allegations. He stated that she would have brought an
action for intentional infliction of emotional distress as one wrong for
which she could have sought the injunctive relief that might have saved
her husband's life. But that does not satisfy the requirement that a
backward-looking denial-of-access claim provide a remedy that could not
be obtained on an existing claim, for the complaint's counts naming the
CIA defendants, including the Guatemalan officer who allegedly tortured and killed her husband, are among the tort claims that survived
the motion to dismiss in the District Court. Harbury can seek damages
and possibly some sort of injunctive relief for the consequences of

the infliction of emotional distress alleged in those counts, although she
cannot obtain the order that might have saved her husband's life. But
neither can she obtain such an order in her access claim, which therefore cannot recompense her for the unique loss she claims as a consequence of her inability to bring an intentional-infliction action earlier.
Pp. 418-422.

Respondent-plaintiff in this case alleges that Governmentofficials intentionally deceived her in concealing information

that her husband, a foreign dissident, was being detainedand tortured in his own country by military officers of his
government, who were paid by the Central IntelligenceAgency (CIA). One count of the complaint, brought after
the husband's death, charges that the official deception de-nied respondent access to the courts by leaving her without
information, or reason to seek information, with which shecould have brought a lawsuit that might have saved her husband's life. The issue is whether this count states an action-able claim. We hold that it does not, for two reasons. As
stated in the complaint, it fails to identify an underlyingcause of action for relief that the plaintiff would have raised
had it not been for the deception alleged. And even after a

406 CHRISTOPHER v. HARBURY

Opinion of the Court
subsequent, informal amendment accepted by the Court ofAppeals, respondent fails to seek any relief presently available for denial of access to courts that would be unavailableotherwise.

I
Respondent Jennifer Harbury, a United States citizen, isthe widow of Efrain Bamaca-Velasquez, a Guatemalan rebel

leader who vanished in his own country in March 1992.Since we are reviewing a ruling on motion to dismiss, we
accept Harbury's factual allegations and take them in thelight most favorable to her. See

Leatherman v. Tarrant
County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507U. S. 163, 164 (1993). Bamaca was captured by Guatemalan

army forces, including officers trained (in the United States),paid, and used as informants by the CIA. App. 27-28 (Respondent's Second Amended Complaint |||| 35-42, 46-47).He was detained and tortured for more than a year to obtain
information of interest to the CIA, for which it paid. Id., at28 (|||| 43, 46-47). Bamaca was summarily executed on orders of the same Guatemalan officers affiliated with the CIA,id., at 28-29 (|||| 48-49), sometime before September 1993,
id., at 31 (|| 66), 34 (|| 84).1The CIA knew as early as March 18, 1992, that the Guatemalan army had captured Bamaca alive and shared this in-formation with the White House and State Department.
Id., at 27 (|| 35). Officials there, however, "intentionally mis-led" Harbury, by "deceptive statements and omissions, into
believing that concrete information about her husband's fatedid not exist because they did not want to threaten their
ability to obtain information from Mr. Bamaca through hisdetention and torture."

Id., at 31 (|| 67).

1 Harbury says in a footnote in her brief before this Court that "[n]ew
evidence exists suggesting that Mr. Bamaca in fact survived well into 1994
if not longer," Brief for Respondent 23, n. 3, but the factual allegations in
her complaint unequivocally state that the Government knew that Bamaca
had been killed by September 1993.

407Cite as: 536 U. S. 403 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Harbury makes three specific allegations of such Govern-ment deception, all involving State Department officials,

while Bamaca was still alive. First, she says she contactedseveral unnamed State Department officials in March 1993
to express concerns about her husband, who, according toan eyewitness, was still alive.

Id., at 29 (|||| 50, 55). They
"promised to look into the matter and to assist her," ibid.,
but they neither gave her nor made public any informationabout Bamaca, though CIA reports from as early as May

1993 confirmed he was still alive. Id., at 30 (|||| 56-59).Second, in August 1993, Marilyn McAfee, then Ambassador
to Guatemala, advised Harbury to submit a written report
to the effect that remains found in a grave purported to be
her husband's were not in fact his, as Harbury promptly did.
Id., at 30-31 (|||| 60-63). Although McAfee promised that
she would "investigate the matter immediately[,] report her
findings," and keep Harbury "properly informed regarding
her husband's situation," ibid. (|| 62), she gave Harbury no
information, id., at 31 (|| 64). Third, in September 1993 (the
same month that the Government learned Bamaca was dead,
ibid. (|| 66)), Harbury engaged in a week-long hunger strike
in Guatemala City to focus public attention on her husband's
plight, but the State Department told her nothing, id., at
31-32 (|||| 64-68).

According to Harbury's allegations, the Government's deceptions and omissions continued and intensified after Bamaca was killed. From October 1993 until March 1995, officials of the State Department and National Security Council
(NSC) repeatedly met and communicated with Harbury, id.,
at 32 (|||| 70-71), 34 (|||| 80, 83), 35 (|| 86), conveying the impression that they knew nothing for sure but were seeking
"concrete information" about her husband and would keep
her informed, id., at 33 (|| 75). At one point, in November
1994, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake told Harbury
that the Government had " `scraped the bottom of the barrel' " to no avail in seeking information about her husband,

536US1 Unit: $U72 [12-16-03 22:55:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
408 CHRISTOPHER v. HARBURY

Opinion of the Court
id., at 34 (|| 83). All along, however, the Government offi-cials knew that Bamaca had been killed by the Guatemalan

army, ibid. (|| 84), but engaged in misleading statements andomissions because they did not want their complicity in Bamaca's torture and death revealed, id., at 36 (|| 92). Harburylearned that her husband was dead only in March 1995 when
a congressman publicly announced that Bamaca had beenkilled on the orders of a Guatemalan army colonel who was
also a paid agent of the CIA, ibid. (|| 91).

II
A year later, in March 1996, Harbury filed suit in theDistrict Court for the District of Columbia against the

CIA, the State Department, the NSC, and members of eachin their official and individual capacities. The complaint, as
amended, listed 28 causes of action under federal, state, andinternational law. App. 38-62. Although only the accessto-courts counts directly concern us here, it is important toknow Harbury's other claims, in order to determine whether
she has stated a tenable claim for denial of judicial access.

A
Harbury's complaint sought relief in four categories otherthan access to courts. First, on behalf of Bamaca's estate,

she raised claims against the CIA defendants under the DueProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment for his imprisonment, torture, and execution, seeking declaratory and injunc-tive relief,

2 and money damages against the officials in their

individual capacities on the theory of Bivens v. Six Unknown
Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). App. 38-42(counts 1-5). Next, on her own behalf, Harbury sued all the

Government defendants for declaratory and injunctive relief

2 The injunctive relief Harbury sought in these (and other) counts was
disclosure of information "concerning her husband's death and the location
of his body" and an order to prevent "[d]efendants from taking such
actions in the future." App. 63.

Opinion of the Court
and money damages under Bivens for violating her "right to
familial integrity" under the First, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments by imprisoning, torturing, and executing her husband.
Id., at 42-48 (counts 6-13). Third, she alleged common law
torts invoking the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U. S. C.

$$ 2401(b) and 2675, App. 54, (1) on behalf of herself and her
husband's estate against the CIA defendants for intentional
infliction of emotional distress by causing and conspiring to
cause Bamaca's imprisonment, torture, and execution, id., at
55 (counts 18-19); (2) on behalf of her husband's estate
against the CIA defendants for negligent supervision resulting in his false imprisonment, assault and battery, and
wrongful death, id., at 56-58 (counts 20-22); and (3) on her
own behalf against the State Department and NSC defendants for intentional and negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, interference with the right to possess a
spouse's dead body, id., at 58-62 (counts 24-27), and intentional infliction of emotional distress by making "intentionally deceptive statements and omissions . . . about her husband, including concealing whether or not he was alive"
id., at 58 (count 23). Fourth, Harbury brought a tort claim
said to arise under international law against the CIA defendants on behalf of herself and her husband's estate. Id., at
62 (count 28).

In addition to these counts for direct harm, Harbury relied
on the First and Fifth Amendments in raising four claims
that the deceptive statements and omissions of the State Department and NSC defendants had unconstitutionally impeded her access to courts, id., at 49-51 (counts 14-15), as
well as her rights to speak freely and to petition the Government, id., at 51-54 (counts 16-17). The basic theory as to
access to courts was that if the officials had shared what they
knew or simply said "no comment" rather than affirmatively
misleading Harbury into thinking they were doing something, she might have been able "to take appropriate actions

Opinion of the Court
to save her husband's life." Id., at 37 (|| 98).3 Harburyalleged that she "was foreclosed from effectively seeking

adequate legal redress." Ibid.

B
For failure to state a claim, the District Court dismissedall counts for declaratory and injunctive relief (counts 1-3,

6-9, 14, 16). It also dismissed all the Bivens counts: thoseon behalf of Bamaca's estate for his torture and execution
said to have violated his Fifth Amendment due processrights (counts 4-5), and those brought on Harbury's own behalf based on the claimed violation of her constitutionalrights of familial association (counts 10-13), access to courts
(count 15), and free speech and access to Government (count17). But the District Court denied the defendants' motion
to dismiss the tort claims at common law (counts 18-27) andinternational law (count 28).

With respect to the access-to-courts claims (including Har-bury's

Bivens claim on this theory), the District Court ac-knowledged that five Courts of Appeals "have held that conspiracies to destroy or cover-up evidence of a crime thatrender a plaintiff 's judicial remedies inadequate or ineffective violat[e] the right of access," App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a,but held that Harbury had not stated a valid cause of action
for two reasons. First, the court held that Harbury's claim"would have to be dismissed" (without prejudice) because,
having filed no prior suit, she had "nothing more than aguess" as to how the alleged coverup might "have prejudiced her rights to bring a separate action." Id., at 46a.Second, the District Court reasoned that the defendants in
any event would be entitled to qualified immunity in theirindividual capacities because, unlike officials in coverup
cases who destroyed, manufactured, or hid evidence, the de3 Harbury did not allege that the State Department and NSC defendants
had an affirmative duty to disclose or to provide information about her
husband in response to her informal requests.

fendants here did not act contrary to "clearly establishedconstitutional norms that a reasonable official would understand" in being less than "forthcoming in discussingthe intelligence that they received about Bamaca." Id., at
48a-49a. C

Harbury did not pursue her claims for declaratory or in-junctive relief, and appealed only the dismissal of the Bivens
causes of action. Harbury v. Deutch, 233 F. 3d 596, 600-601(CADC 2000). The Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the Bivens claimsof violations of Bamaca's due process rights, 233 F. 3d, at
604, Harbury's rights of familial association, id., at 606-607,and her free speech and petition rights.

4 It reversed the

dismissal, however, of Harbury's Bivens claim against theState Department and NSC defendants for denial of access

to courts. Id., at 607-611.The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that
a plaintiff who merely alleges without factual basis in theconduct of a prior lawsuit that " `key witnesses . . . may now
be dead or missing, . . . crucial evidence may have been de-stroyed, and . . . memories may have faded' " generally falls
short of raising a claim for denial of access to courts. Id.,at 609 (quoting the District Court). The court held, however, that Harbury's allegations stated a valid access claiminsofar as she alleged that the Government's conduct had
"effectively prevented her from seeking emergency injunc-tive relief in time to save her husband's life." Ibid. The
District of Columbia Circuit went on to conclude that "[b]e-cause his death completely foreclosed this avenue of relief,
nothing would be gained by requiring Harbury to postponethis aspect of her access to courts cause of action until she

4 The Court of Appeals did not explicitly say that this Bivens claim
(count 17) was dismissed, but, in reversing the District Court, it spoke only
of a single claim of "access to courts." 233 F. 3d, at 611 ("[W]e reverse the

that they may not affirmatively mislead citizens for the purpose of protecting themselves from suit." Id., at 611.5

Three categories of claims were left in the case after the
Court of Appeals's decision: the various common law tort
claims including intentional infliction of emotional distress,
the international law claim against the CIA defendants (neither of which the District Court had dismissed), and Harbury's Bivens claims against the State Department and NSC
defendants for preventing access to courts (which the Court
of Appeals reinstated). The defendant officials petitioned
for review of the court's holding as to the claim of denial of
access to courts, but Harbury did not cross-petition on the
other Bivens claims, leaving the Bivens access claim6 the
sole matter before us. We granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 1064
(2001), because of the importance of this issue to the Government in its conduct of the Nation's foreign affairs, and now

A

This Court's prior cases on denial of access to courts have
not extended over the entire range of claims that have been
brought under that general rubric elsewhere, but if we con5 The District of Columbia Circuit denied rehearing, Harbury v. Deutch,
244 F. 3d 956, 957 (2001) (per curiam), and rehearing en banc, 244 F. 3d
960, 961 (2001), with two judges dissenting from denial of rehearing en
banc.

action under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388

sider examples in the Courts of Appeals 7 as well as our own,two categories emerge. In the first are claims that systemic

official action frustrates a plaintiff or plaintiff class in prepar-ing and filing suits at the present time. Thus, in the prisonlitigation cases, the relief sought may be a law library for aprisoner's use in preparing a case, Bounds v. Smith, 430 U. S.
817, 828 (1977); Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 346-348 (1996),or a reader for an illiterate prisoner,

id., at 347-348, or sim-ply a lawyer, ibid. In denial-of-access cases challenging filing fees that poor plaintiffs cannot afford to pay, the objectis an order requiring waiver of a fee to open the courthouse
door for desired litigation, such as direct appeals or federalhabeas petitions in criminal cases,

8 or civil suits asserting

family-law rights, e. g., Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371,372 (1971) (divorce filing fee); M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519 U. S.

102, 106-107 (1996) (record fee in parental-rights terminationaction). In cases of this sort, the essence of the access claim
is that official action is presently denying an opportunity tolitigate for a class of potential plaintiffs. The opportunity
has not been lost for all time, however, but only in the shortterm; the object of the denial-of-access suit, and the justification for recognizing that claim, is to place the plaintiff in aposition to pursue a separate claim for relief once the frustrating condition has been removed.The second category covers claims not in aid of a class of
suits yet to be litigated, but of specific cases that cannot now

be tried (or tried with all material evidence), no matter whatofficial action may be in the future.

9 The official acts

claimed to have denied access may allegedly have caused theloss or inadequate settlement of a meritorious case, e. g., Foster v. Lake Jackson, 28 F. 3d 425, 429 (CA5 1994); Bell v.Milwaukee, 746 F. 2d 1205, 1261 (CA7 1984) ("[T]he cover-up
and resistance of the investigating police officers renderedhollow [the plaintiff 's] right to seek redress"), the loss of an
opportunity to sue, e. g., Swekel v. River Rouge, 119 F. 3d1259, 1261 (CA6 1997) (police coverup extended throughout
"time to file suit . . . under . . . statute of limitations"), or theloss of an opportunity to seek some particular order of relief,
as Harbury alleges here. These cases do not look forwardto a class of future litigation, but backward to a time when
specific litigation ended poorly, 10 or could not have commenced, or could have produced a remedy subsequently un-obtainable.

11 The ultimate object of these sorts of access

claims, then, is not the judgment in a further lawsuit, but
simply the judgment in the access claim itself, in providingrelief obtainable in no other suit in the future.

While the circumstances thus vary, the ultimate justifi-cation for recognizing each kind of claim is the same.
Whether an access claim turns on a litigating opportunityyet to be gained or an opportunity already lost, the very
point of recognizing any access claim is to provide some ef9 All such cases have been decided in the Courts of Appeals, see n. 7,
supra; we assume, without deciding, the correctness of the decisions.

10 Some Courts of Appeals have held that an actual attempt to sue is a

prerequisite to any such claim. See Delew, supra, at 1222-1223; Swekel,
supra, at 1263-1264. See also App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a (District Court
adopting this requirement). But cf. Swekel, supra, at 1264, n. 2 ("We recognize that in some instances it would be completely futile for a plaintiff
to attempt to access the state court system. The Plaintiff, however, has
not presented evidence that this is such a case").

11 Bifurcation into forward-looking and backward-looking access claims

is a simplification, and not the only possible categorization, but it helps to
focus the issues here.

Opinion of the Court
fective vindication for a separate and distinct right to seekjudicial relief for some wrong. However unsettled the basis

of the constitutional right of access to courts,12 our cases reston the recognition that the right is ancillary to the underlying claim, without which a plaintiff cannot have sufferedinjury by being shut out of court. We indicated as much

in our most recent case on denial of access, Lewis v. Casey,
supra, where we noted that even in forward-looking prisonerclass actions to remove roadblocks to future litigation, the

named plaintiff must identify a "nonfrivolous," "arguable"underlying claim,

id., at 353, and n. 3, and we have been
given no reason to treat backward-looking access claims anydifferently in this respect. It follows that the underlying

cause of action, whether anticipated or lost, is an elementthat must be described in the complaint, just as much as
allegations must describe the official acts frustrating the liti-gation. It follows, too, that when the access claim (like this
one) looks backward, the complaint must identify a remedy
that may be awarded as recompense but not otherwise available in some suit that may yet be brought. There is, after
all, no point in spending time and money to establish the
facts constituting denial of access when a plaintiff would end
up just as well off after litigating a simpler case without the
denial-of-access element.

12 Decisions of this Court have grounded the right of access to courts in
the Article IV Privileges and Immunities Clause, Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 207 U. S. 142, 148 (1907); Blake v. McClung, 172 U. S.

416 CHRISTOPHER v. HARBURY

Opinion of the Court
Like any other element of an access claim, the underlying
cause of action and its lost remedy must be addressed by
allegations in the complaint sufficient to give fair notice to a
defendant. See generally Swierkiewicz v. Sorema N. A.,
534 U. S. 506, 513-515 (2002). Although we have no reason
here to try to describe pleading standards for the entire
spectrum of access claims, this is the place to address a particular risk inherent in backward-looking claims. Characteristically, the action underlying this sort of access claim
will not be tried independently,13 a fact that enhances the
natural temptation on the part of plaintiffs to claim too much,
by alleging more than might be shown in a full trial focused
solely on the details of the predicate action.

Hence the need for care in requiring that the predicate
claim be described well enough to apply the "nonfrivolous"
test and to show that the "arguable" nature of the underlying
claim is more than hope.14 And because these backwardlooking cases are brought to get relief unobtainable in other
suits, the remedy sought must itself be identified to hedge
against the risk that an access claim be tried all the way
through, only to find that the court can award no remedy
that the plaintiff could not have been awarded on a presently
existing claim.

13 It may be the case that an underlying action has already been tried
to an inadequate result due to missing or fabricated evidence in an official
cover-up, see, e. g., Foster, 28 F. 3d, at 427; Bell, 746 F. 2d, at 1223, or

the claim may still be timely and subject to trial, but for a different remedy than the one sought under the access claim, or against different
defendants.

14 The District of Columbia Circuit rejected the holding of some Circuits,

see n. 10, supra, that a filed suit on the underlying claim is a prerequisite
for a backward-looking access claim, 233 F. 3d 596, 608-610 (2000), because
it would foreclose access claims in the most heinous cases where a cover-up
was so pervasive that any timely attempt to litigate would have seemed
futile. In essence, the Court of Appeals rejected a rule requiring an attempt to litigate, even if frivolous, as a condition of bringing a nonfrivolous
backward-looking access claim.

Opinion of the Court
The particular facts of this case underscore the need forcare on the part of the plaintiff in identifying, and by the

court in determining, the claim for relief underlying theaccess-to-courts plea. The action alleged on the part of all
the Government defendants (the State Department and NSCdefendants sued for denial of access and the CIA defendants
who would have been timely sued on the underlying claimbut for the denial) was apparently taken in the conduct of
foreign relations by the National Government. Thus, ifthere is to be judicial enquiry, it will raise concerns for the
separation of powers in trenching on matters committed tothe other branches. See

Department of Navy v. Egan, 484U. S. 518, 529 (1988) (" `[F]oreign policy [is] the province and

responsibility of the Executive' "); Chicago & Southern AirLines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 111 (1948)
("[T]he very nature of executive decisions as to foreign pol-icy is political, not judicial"). Since the need to resolve such
constitutional issues ought to be avoided where possible,cf.

Department of Housing and Urban Development v.Rucker, 535 U. S. 125, 134-135 (2002); Ashwander v. TVA,

297 U. S. 288, 345-348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring), thetrial court should be in a position as soon as possible in the
litigation to know whether a potential constitutional rulingmay be obviated because the allegations of denied access fail
to state a claim on which relief could be granted.In sum, the right of a defendant in a backward-looking
access suit to obtain early dismissal of a hopelessly incom-plete claim for relief coincides in this case with the obligation
of the Judicial Branch to avoid deciding constitutional issuesneedlessly. For the sake of each, the complaint should state
the underlying claim in accordance with Federal Rule ofCivil Procedure 8(a),

15 just as if it were being independently

pursued, and a like plain statement should describe any rem15 "A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief . . . shall contain . . . a

edy available under the access claim and presently uniqueto it.

B
Under these standards, Harbury's complaint did not comeeven close to stating a constitutional claim for denial of access upon which relief could be granted. While we cannotread the complaint without appreciating Harbury's anguish,
neither can we read it without appreciating the position ofthe District Judge who described Harbury's various requests
for relief as "nearly unintelligible." App. to Pet. for Cert.32a. Although the counts stating the

Bivens claim for de-nial of judicial access seemed to confirm that Harbury intended to state a backward-looking claim, the complaintfailed to identify the underlying cause of action that the alleged deception had compromised, going no further than theprotean allegation that the State Department and NSC defendants' "false and deceptive information and concealmentforeclosed Plaintiff from effectively seeking adequate legal
redress." App. 50 (|| 175). The District Court and the de-fendants were left to guess at the unstated cause of action
supposed to have been lost, and at the remedy being soughtindependently of relief that might be available on the 24
other counts set out in the complaint.Nothing happened in the Court of Appeals to improve
Harbury's position. That court, too, was frustrated by thefailure to identify the predicate claim and the need for relief
otherwise unattainable,16 but it gave Harbury's counsel anopportunity at oral argument to supply the missing allega16 The court repeatedly pressed counsel to identify the underlying claim.

tions. Counsel responded that Harbury would have brought
an action for intentional infliction of emotional distress 17 as
one wrong for which she could have sought the injunctive
relief that might have saved her husband's life:

"[I]f defendants had disclosed the information they possessed about Bamaca, Harbury could have sought an
emergency injunction based on an underlying tort claim
for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Even if
the NSC and State Department officials had simply said
they could not discuss Bamaca's situation, counsel explained, Harbury would have filed her FOIA requests
immediately, thus perhaps obtaining the information
necessary to seek an injunction in time to save her husband's life. Instead, believing defendants' reassurances, Harbury waited for the State Department and
NSC officials to complete their `investigation.' " 233
F. 3d, at 609.

The Court of Appeals adopted this theory in saying that the
"adequate legal redress" alleged for purposes of Harbury's
access claims meant emergency injunctive relief in a now
futile lawsuit for intentional infliction of emotional distress,

17 Whether the Court of Appeals should have extended that opportunity
is not an issue before us. We see counsel's answer as amounting to an
amendment of pleadings that still fails to cure the inadequacy of the
denial-of-access claim. In providing the clarification, Harbury's counsel
appears to have been referring to the intentional-infliction counts against
the CIA defendants alleged elsewhere in her complaint, App. 55 (counts
18-19). See infra, at 422. Whatever latitude is allowed by federal notice
pleading, no one says Harbury should be allowed to construe "adequate
legal redress" to mean causes of action that were not even mentioned in
her complaint. As for Harbury's position here, suffice it to say that a
brief to this Court, see Brief for Respondent at 22-33 (listing causes of
action that Harbury could have brought in 1993), is not the place to supplement pleadings in response to a motion in the trial court to dismiss for
failure to state a claim.

Opinion of the Court
and it accepted this amendment as a sufficient statement ofan underlying cause of action.

18 Ibid.

We think, however, that treating the amendment as an ad-equate statement was error. For even on the assumption

that Harbury could surmount all difficulties raised by treat-ing the underlying claim as one for intentional infliction of
emotional distress,19 she could not satisfy the requirement

18 Harbury does not argue, based on her counsel's argument before the
Court of Appeals, that the allegation that official deception delayed a Freedom of Information Act filing, which, presumably, might have involved a
lawsuit down the road if the defendants obstructed compulsory disclosure,
can independently serve as an underlying cause of action for purposes of
her access claim.

19 Because the access claim as "amended" by Harbury's counsel at argument still fails to indicate any remedy that would be available in addition
to potential relief on presently existing tort claims, see infra, at 422, it is
unnecessary to resolve any of the claim's other difficulties in satisfying
the need for nonfrivolous and arguable underlying causes of action. For
example, Harbury alleges no acts of concealment by NSC officials prior to
her husband's death; it would appear that the Bivens access claim should
have been dismissed as to them on this ground alone. Nor does Harbury
allege a plausible causal link between an injunction that might have been
issued by a United States court and the behavior of the Guatemalan military alleged to have killed Harbury's husband. It is also uncertain
whether the underlying cause of action could be pursued consistently with
respect for separation of powers. And, of course, all of this assumes the
unlikely case that the Government would not certify the defendants' action
as exercises of their official capacity, or that if the Government did, an
action could be maintained under the Federal Tort Claims Act. See 28
U. S. C. $ 2680(h) (excluding certain intentional torts including assault, battery, false imprisonment, and misrepresentation); $ 2680(k) (excluding
claims arising in a foreign country); cf. United States v. Shearer, 473 U. S.
52, 57 (1985) (no claim for negligent supervision of an employee resulting
in wrongful death in the military context). But see U. S. Information
Agency v. Krc, 989 F. 2d 1211, 1216 (CADC 1993) ("injunctive relief is
available" under the Federal Tort Claims Act for an intentional-tort claim
when the statute bars a damages remedy), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 1109
(1994).

Indeed, even if Harbury's underlying claim could navigate these concerns, it is not at all apparent that any or all of Harbury's many factual
allegations would make out a claim for intentional infliction of emotional
distress. As a general matter, "[w]here [extreme and outrageous] conduct

Opinion of the Court
that a backward-looking denial-of-access claim provide aremedy that could not be obtained on an existing claim. We

have no choice but to assume that what Harbury intends toclaim as intentional infliction of emotional distress is set out
in the counts of her complaint naming the "CIA defendants,"including the Guatemalan officer who allegedly tortured and
killed her husband, App. 55 (counts 18-19).20 These areamong the tort counts that survived the motion to dismiss
under the portion of the District Court's order not before us.If an intentional-infliction claim can be maintained at all,
Harbury can seek damages and even conceivably some sortof injunctive relief for the demonstrated consequences of the
infliction alleged.21 It is true that she cannot obtain in anypresent tort action the order she would have sought before
her husband's death, the order that might have saved herhusband's life. But neither can she obtain any such order
on her access claim, which therefore cannot recompense Haris directed at a third person, the actor is subject to liability if he intentionally or recklessly causes severe emotional distress to a member of such
person's immediate family who is present at the time, whether or not such
distress results in bodily harm." Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 46(2)(a)
(1965). It is unclear that Harbury's allegations meet either the intent or
the presence requirements. While there is room to argue for an exception to presence in some situations, cf. Jenco v. Islamic Republic of Iran,
154 F. Supp. 2d 27, 33 (DC 2001) (allowing publication to substitute for
presence), far from there being any allegation that the CIA defendants
intended her husband's situation to become known to the public, the entire
thrust of Harbury's pleadings is that every defendant tried to conceal it.

20 See n. 17, supra. There is also an emotional-distress count against

the State Department and NSC defendants, but based on their alleged
deception, see App. 58 (count 23), that is, simply in duplication of the acts
alleged to constitute denial of access, not on the acts underlying the predicate claim.

21 While Harbury, if otherwise successful, might obtain injunctive relief

requiring the CIA to reveal the location of her husband's remains (if
known), she could not get any injunction against continued deception on
the part of the State Department. But this is irrelevant, since Harbury
has given no indication that she contemplates any future litigation to
which continued deception would be relevant; she has not, in other words,
pleaded any surviving, forward-looking access claim.

In Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343 (1996), after a review ofthe constitutional text, this Court's precedent, and tradition,

I could find no basis "for the conclusion that the constitu-tional right of access imposes affirmative obligations on the
States to finance and support prisoner litigation." Id., at384-385 (concurring opinion). Likewise, I find no basis in
the Constitution for a "right of access to courts" that effec-tively imposes an affirmative duty on Government officials
either to disclose matters concerning national security or toprovide information in response to informal requests. Notwithstanding the Court of Appeals' attempt to characterize

22 This might not be the case where, for example, the underlying claim
had been tried or settled for an inadequate amount given official deception,
see Foster, 28 F. 3d, at 427; Bell, 746 F. 2d, at 1223, and thus likely barred
by res judicata, or where the statute of limitations had run, see Swekel,
119 F. 3d, at 1261.

23 If Harbury's existing tort claims should be dismissed for the reasons

identified in n. 19, supra, or other reasons unrelated to the alleged deception by the State Department officials, she would still be unable to identify
a predicate cause of action necessary to state a backward-looking access
claim.

CITY OF COLUMBUS et al. v. OURS GARAGE AND

WRECKER SERVICE, INC., et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 01-419. Argued April 23, 2002--Decided June 20, 2002
Federal law preempts prescriptions by "a State [or] political subdivision

of a State . . . related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . .
with respect to the transportation of property," 49 U. S. C. $ 14501(c)(1).
Exceptions to this general rule provide that the preemption directive
"shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles," $ 14501(c)(2)(A); "does not apply to the transportation of household goods," $ 14501(c)(2)(B); and "does not apply to
the authority of a State or a political subdivision of a State" to regulate
"the price of for-hire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck . . .
performed without the prior consent . . . of the [towed vehicle's] owner
or operator," $ 14501(c)(2)(C). Petitioner Columbus, Ohio (City), extensively regulates the operation of tow trucks seeking to pick up vehicles
within city limits. Plaintiff-respondents, a tow-truck operator and a
trade association of such operators, brought this suit to enjoin enforcement of the City's tow-truck regulations on the ground that they were
preempted by $ 14501(c)(1). The Federal District Court granted the
plaintiffs summary judgment. The Sixth Circuit affirmed based on its
earlier decision in Petrey v. Toledo, in which it held that city tow-truck
regulations similar to those of Columbus were preempted. Observing
that $ 14501(c)(1)'s preemption rule explicitly applies to "a State [or] political subdivision of a State," while the exception for safety regulations,

$ 14501(c)(2)(A), refers only to the "authority of a State," the Petrey
court determined that the contrast in statutory language indicated that
Congress meant to limit the safety exception to States alone. This
reading, the court further reasoned, was consistent with Congress'
deregulatory purpose of encouraging market forces by eliminating a

myriad of complicated and potentially conflicting state regulations. Yet
another level of regulation at the local level, the court inferred, would
be disfavored.

Held: Section 14501(c) does not bar a State from delegating to municipalities and other local units the State's authority to establish safety
regulations governing motor carriers of property, including tow trucks.

(a) Had $ 14501(c) contained no reference at all to "political subdivision[s] of a State," $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s exception for exercises of the
"safety regulatory authority of a State" undoubtedly would have embraced both state and local regulation under Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597. It was there held that the exclusion of
political subdivisions cannot be inferred from a federal law's express
authorization to the "States" to take action, for such subdivisions are
components of the very entity the statute empowers, and are created as
convenient agencies to exercise such of the State's powers as it chooses
to entrust to them, id., at 607-608. This case is a closer call than Mortier because, in contrast to $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s singularly bare reference
to "[s]tate" authority, almost every other provision of $ 14501 links
States and their political subdivisions. Nevertheless, that does not
mean that Congress intended to limit the exception to States alone, as
respondents contend. Respondents rely on Russello v. United States,
464 U. S. 16, 23, in which the Court observed that, where particular
language is included in one section of a federal statute but omitted
from another, Congress is generally presumed to have acted intentionally and purposely. Reading $ 14501(c)'s exceptions in combination and
context, however, leads the Court to conclude that $ 14501 does not provide the requisite "clear and manifest indication that Congress sought
to supplant local authority." Mortier, 501 U. S., at 611. Section
14501(c)(2)(C) refers to the "authority of a State or a political subdivision
of a State to enact or enforce" regulations in particular areas, wording
which parallels that of $ 14501(c)(1). Accord, $ 14501(c)(3). This parallel structure does not imply, however, that $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s concise
statement must be read to use the term "State" restrictively. In contrast to $$ 14501(c)(2)(C) and (c)(3), neither the safety exception,

$ 14501(c)(2)(A), nor the exception for the transportation of household
goods, $ 14501(c)(2)(B), refers to the "authority . . . to enact or enforce a
law, regulation, or other provision." The Russello presumption--that
the presence of a phrase in one provision and its absence in another
reveals Congress' design--grows weaker with each difference in the
formulation of the provisions under inspection. Furthermore, the
Court notes, $ 14501(c)(1) preempts the power of both States and localities to "enact or enforce" rules related to the "price, route, or service of
any motor carrier . . . with respect to the transportation of property";
reading the term "State" in $ 14501(c)(2)(A) to exclude localities would
prevent those units not only from enacting such rules but also from
enforcing them, even when such rules were enacted by the state legislature. Finally, resort to the Russello presumption here would yield a
decision at odds with our federal system's traditional comprehension of
the regulatory authority of a State. Local governmental units are cre536US1 Unit: $U73 [01-14-04 18:31:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ated to exercise such of the State's powers as the State may entrust
to them in its absolute discretion. Mortier, 501 U. S., at 607-608. In
contrast to programs in which Congress restricts that discretion
through its spending power, $ 14501(c)(2)(A) evinces a clear purpose to
ensure that the preemption of States' economic authority over motor
carriers of property "not restrict" the preexisting and traditional state
police power over safety, "a field which the States have traditionally
occupied." Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485. Preemption
analysis "start[s] with the assumption that the historic police powers of
the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that
was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." Ibid. Because a
State's "safety regulatory authority" includes the choice to delegate
power to localities, forcing a State to refrain from doing so would effectively "restrict" that very authority. Absent a basis more reliable than
statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a "clear and manifest
purpose" to the contrary, federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State's decision on the division of authority
between the State's central and local units over safety on municipal
streets and roads. Pp. 432-440.

(b) Contrary to the Sixth Circuit's reading, declarations of deregulatory purpose in the statute and legislative history do not justify interpreting through a deregulatory prism aspects of the state regulatory
process that Congress determined should not be preempted. Giving

$ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s safety exception the narrowest possible construction
is resistible here, for that provision does not necessarily conflict with
Congress' deregulatory purposes. The area Congress sought to deregulate was state economic regulation; the exemption in question is for
state safety regulation. Local regulation of tow-truck prices, routes,
or services that is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garners
no exemption from preemption. The construction of $ 14501 that respondents advocate, moreover, does not guarantee uniform regulation.
On their reading as on petitioners', for example, a State could, without affront to the statute, pass discrete, nonuniform safety regulations
applicable to each of its several constituent municipalities. Furthermore, $ 31141--which authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to void
any state safety law or regulation upon finding that it has no safety
benefit or would cause an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce--affords a means to prevent $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s safety exception
from overwhelming Congress' deregulatory purpose. Pp. 440-442.

Opinion of the Court

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
Federal preemption prescriptions relating to motor carriers, contained in 49 U. S. C. $ 14501(c) (1994 ed., Supp. V),specifically save to States "safety regulatory authority . . .

with respect to motor vehicles," $ 14501(c)(2)(A). This casepresents the question whether the state power preserved in

$ 14501(c)(2)(A) may be delegated to municipalities, permit-ting them to exercise safety regulatory authority over local
tow-truck operations.The federal legislation preempts provisions by "a State
[or] political subdivision of a State . . . related to a price,
route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect to thetransportation of property." $ 14501(c)(1). As an exception

to this general rule, Congress provided that the preemptiondirective "shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority
of a State with respect to motor vehicles." $ 14501(c)(2)(A).Section 14501(c)(1)'s statement of the general rule explicitly
includes "State[s]" and their "political subdivision[s]." Theexception for safety regulation, however, specifies only
"State[s]" and does not mention "political subdivision[s]."

$ 14501(c)(2)(A).

We hold that $ 14501(c) does not bar a State from delegating to municipalities and other local units the State's authority to establish safety regulations governing motor carriers
of property, including tow trucks. A locality, as $ 14501(c)
recognizes, is a "political subdivision" of the State. Ordinarily, a political subdivision may exercise whatever portion

Opinion of the Court
of state power the State, under its own constitution and laws,chooses to delegate to the subdivision. Absent a clear statement to the contrary, Congress' reference to the "regulatoryauthority of a State" should be read to preserve, not preempt, the traditional prerogative of the States to delegatetheir authority to their constituent parts.

I
The Interstate Commerce Act, as amended by the FederalAviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, 108 Stat.

1606, and the ICC Termination Act of 1995, 109 Stat. 899,generally preempts state and local regulation "related to a
price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respectto the transportation of property"; enumerated matters,
however, are not covered by the preemption provision. TheAct prescribes:

"(1) General Rule.--Except as provided in para-graphs (2) and (3), a State, political subdivision of a
State, or political authority of 2 or more States may notenact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision
having the force and effect of law related to a price,route, or service of any motor carrier . . . with respect
to the transportation of property."(2)

Matters not covered.--Paragraph (1)--"(A) shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles . . . orthe authority of a State to regulate motor carriers with
regard to minimum amounts of financial responsibilityrelating to insurance requirements and self-insurance

Tow trucks, all parties to this case agree, are "motor carri-er[s] of property" falling within $ 14501(c)'s compass. This

reading is corroborated by $ 14501(c)(2)(C), which relates tononconsensual tows,

e. g., of illegally parked or abandonedvehicles. That provision plainly indicates that tow trucks

qualify as "motor carrier[s] of property"; it exempts fromfederal preemption state and local regulation of "the price of
for-hire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck" whenthe towing "is performed without the prior consent . . . of
the [towed vehicle's] owner or operator."Petitioner, the City of Columbus, Ohio (City), extensively
regulates the operation of any tow truck that seeks to pickup vehicles within city limits. Columbus' regulations require tow-truck operators to obtain city licenses, submit tocity inspections, meet city standards for insurance and recordkeeping, and conform their vehicles to the City's detailedequipment requirements.

and two city officials to enjoin enforcement of the City's tow-truck regulations. The complaint alleged that Columbus'

regulations were preempted by $ 14501(c)(1). On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled for
the plaintiffs; the court declared the City's tow-truck regula-tions preempted and enjoined their enforcement. Columbus
and its officials appealed to the United States Court of Ap-peals for the Sixth Circuit.

During the pendency of Columbus' appeal, the Sixth Cir-cuit decided

Petrey v. Toledo, 246 F. 3d 548 (2001). Petreyheld that city of Toledo tow-truck regulations, resembling

those of Columbus, were preempted by $ 14501(c).1 Thecourt observed first that $ 14501(c)(1)'s preemption rule
explicitly applies to "a State [or] political subdivisionof a State," while the exception for safety regulations,

$ 14501(c)(2)(A), refers only to the "authority of a State."The contrast in statutory language indicated to the court
that Congress meant to limit the safety exception to Statesalone.

Id., at 563. This reading, the court further rea-soned, was consistent with Congress' deregulatory purpose.

"Congress intended to encourage market forces . . . throughthe elimination of a myriad of complicated and potentially
conflicting state regulations," the court observed; "yet an-other level of regulation at the local level," the court inferred, "would be disfavored." Ibid.Eleven weeks after rendering its judgment in Petrey, the
Sixth Circuit decided this case. Holding Petrey dispositive,the appeals court affirmed the District Court's injunction
against enforcement of Columbus' tow-truck regulations.257 F. 3d 506, 507-508 (2001).

safety and insurance regulations are not preempted). We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, see 534 U. S. 1073
(2002), and now reverse the Sixth Circuit's judgment.

II
We begin our consideration of the question presented with
an observation that is beyond genuine debate. Had 49
U. S. C. $ 14501(c) contained no reference at all to "political
subdivision[s] of a State," the preemption provision's exception for exercises of the "safety regulatory authority of a
State," $ 14501(c)(2)(A), undoubtedly would have embraced
both state and local regulation. Accord, post, at 445
(Scalia, J., dissenting). The Court's decision in Wisconsin
Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S. 597 (1991), would
have been definitive. There the Court considered a provision of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide
Act authorizing a "State [to] regulate the sale or use of any
federally registered pesticide or device in the State," 7
U. S. C. $ 136v(a); the provision was "silent with reference to
local governments." 501 U. S., at 607. "Mere silence," we
held, "cannot suffice to establish a clear and manifest purpose to pre-empt local authority." Ibid. (internal quotation
marks omitted).

As Justice White stated for the Court in Mortier, "[w]hen
considering pre-emption, `we start with the assumption that
the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' " Id., at 605 (quoting Rice v.

536US1 Unit: $U73 [01-14-04 18:31:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

433Cite as: 536 U. S. 424 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218, 230 (1947)). Fur-thermore, Justice White explained:

"The principle is well settled that local governmentalunits are created as convenient agencies for exercising
such of the governmental powers of the State as may beentrusted to them in its absolute discretion. The exclusion of political subdivisions cannot be inferred from theexpress authorization to the States because political
subdivisions are components of the very entity the stat-ute empowers." 501 U. S., at 607-608 (internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).
This case is a closer call than Mortier. Here, the general
preemption provision, $ 14501(c)(1)--from which $ 14501(c)(2)(A) excepts "the safety regulatory authority of a State"--

explicitly preempts regulation both by "a State" and by a"political subdivision of a State." The exception for state
safety regulation is the first in a series of four statutoryexceptions to the preemption rule. The third exception in
the series, covering regulation of prices for nonconsensualtow-truck services, matches the general preemption provision; it explicitly applies to the "authority of a State or a
political subdivision of a State." $ 14501(c)(2)(C). Statesand their political subdivisions are likewise linked in almost every other provision of $ 14501. See $$ 14501(a),14501(b)(1), 14501(c)(3)(A), 14501(c)(3)(B), 14501(c)(3)(C).

Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, in line with severalCourts of Appeals, home in on the statute's repeated references to both States and their political subdivisions; in con-trast, they urge, the singularly bare reference to "[s]tate"
authority in $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s exception for safety regulation
must mean that Congress intended to limit the exception to
States alone. See Brief for Respondents 15-16, 26-29. Respondents rely particularly on Russello v. United States,
464 U. S. 16 (1983). In that case, we observed: "Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute

Opinion of the Court

but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generallypresumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in

the disparate inclusion or exclusion." Id., at 23 (internalquotation marks omitted) (cited in

Petrey, 246 F. 3d, at 561;
Stucky, 260 F. 3d, at 441; and Tocher, 219 F. 3d, at 1051).The dissent asserts the same argument vigorously. In its

words: "The only conceivable reason" for the separate
enumeration of States and their political subdivisions in$ 14501(c)(1) is to "

establish . . . two separate categories of
state power--state power exercised through political sub-divisions and state power exercised by the State directly--

that are later treated differently in the exceptions to the
rule." Post, at 445.

We acknowledge that $ 14501(c)'s "disparate inclusion [and]
exclusion" of the words "political subdivisions" support an
argument of some force, one that could not have been made
in Mortier. Nevertheless, reading $ 14501(c)'s set of exceptions in combination, and with a view to the basic tenets of
our federal system pivotal in Mortier, we conclude that the
statute does not provide the requisite "clear and manifest
indication that Congress sought to supplant local authority."
501 U. S., at 611.

Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, as just noted, contrast the first statutory exception to $ 14501(c)'s preemption
rule, i. e., the exception preserving "the safety regulatory
authority of a State," $ 14501(c)(2)(A), with the third exception, preserving the "authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision relating to the price" charged for nonconsensual towing,

$ 14501(c)(2)(C). See Brief for Respondents 15-16. The
nonconsensual towing exception tracks the language and
structure of the general preemption rule, omitting only the
reference to a "political authority of 2 or more States."
Similarly styled, the fourth exception, for carrier-requested
regulations in areas such as "uniform cargo liability" and antitrust immunity, $ 14501(c)(3), completely parallels the word536US1 Unit: $U73 [01-14-04 18:31:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

435Cite as: 536 U. S. 424 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
ing of $ 14501(c)(1): It provides that preemption "shall notaffect any authority of a State, political subdivision of a

State, or political authority of 2 or more States to enact orenforce a law, regulation, or other provision" in those areas.

The safety exception of $ 14501(c)(2)(A), however, does notborrow language from $ 14501(c)(1). It simply states that
preemption "shall not restrict the safety regulatory author-ity of a State." Notably, the second statutory exception, on
which respondents train no attention, is stated with similareconomy. That exception mentions neither States nor political subdivisions; it simply says that the general preemptionrule, $ 14501(c)(1), "does not apply to the transportation of
household goods," $ 14501(c)(2)(B). Yet it is abundantlyclear that, notwithstanding this difference in verbal formulation, $ 14501(c)(2)(B), like its neighbor $ 14501(c)(2)(C), per-mits both state and local regulation. Accord,

post, at 446(
Scalia, J., dissenting).The inclusion of the phrase "the authority of a State or

a political subdivision of a State to enact or enforce alaw, regulation, or other provision" no doubt synchronizes
the nonconsensual towing provision with $ 14501(c)(1)'smain rule. The parallel structure of $$ 14501(c)(1) and
14501(c)(2)(C) does not imply, however, that $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'sconcise statement must be read to use the term "State"
restrictively. Respondents' inference from the absence of"political subdivision of a State" in $ 14501(c)(2)(A) would
be more persuasive if the omission were the sole differencein the expression of the general rule and the safety exception. In contrast to $$ 14501(c)(2)(C) and (c)(3), however,neither the safety exception nor the household-goods exception refers to the "authority . . . to enact or enforce a law,regulation, or other provision."

2 The Russello presump2 The dissent insists that $ 14501(c)(2)(B) is irrelevant because its phrasing "ha[s] nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority." Post, at 446 (emphasis deleted). We ultimately draw the same
conclusion, of course, regarding the phrasing of the safety exception in

SERVICE, INC.

Opinion of the Court

tion--that the presence of a phrase in one provision and itsabsence in another reveals Congress' design--grows weaker

with each difference in the formulation of the provisionsunder inspection.

Respondents' restrictive reading of the term "State," we
note, introduces an interpretive conundrum of another kind.
Section 14501(c)(1) preempts the power of both States and
localities to "enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision." (Emphasis added.) Those conjoined words travel
together. If, as Ours Garage and TRAO argue, the safety
exception of $ 14501(c)(2)(A) reaches only States, then localities are preempted not only from enacting, but equally from
enforcing, safety regulations governing motor carriers of
property--even if those regulations are enacted by the state
legislature. It is unlikely that Congress would preserve
States' power to enact safety rules and, at the same time, bar
the ordinary method by which States enforce such rules--
through their local instrumentalities.3

$ 14501(c)(2)(A). The dissent, although it urges that "we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear," post, at 447, rests upon the fact that subdivisions of States do not
appear in the safety exception--as they also do not in the household-goods
exception of $ 14501(c)(2)(B). That $ 14501(c)(2) comprises three exceptions, each differently stated, seems to us indeed relevant to the interpretive weight that may be attached to the variation among them.

3 Faced with this argument, the dissent is converted, however temporarily, to the view that "federal interference with the `historic powers of the
States' must be evinced by a `plain statement.' " Post, at 450, n. 4 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461 (1991)). The dissent finds no
plain statement in $ 14501(c)(1)'s prohibition on local enforcement because
it can be read to mean only that "a political subdivision may not enact new
laws or enforce its previously enacted laws" relating to motor carriage of
property. Post, at 450, n. 4. This is by no means the most natural reading of the preemption provision. The suggestion of the dissent is that, as
applied to localities, $ 14501(c)(1) preempts only local enforcement of

Opinion of the Court
Finally, we reiterate, reading the term "State" as used in$ 14501 to exclude political subdivisions would yield a decision at odds with our federal system's traditional compre-hension of "the safety regulatory authority of a State,"

$ 14501(c)(2)(A). To repeat the essential observation madein Mortier: "The principle is well settled that local governmental units are created as convenient agencies for exercis-ing such of the governmental powers of the State as may be
entrusted to them in its absolute discretion." 501 U. S., at607-608 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).
Whether and how to use that discretion is a question centralto state self-government. See,

e. g., Holt Civic Club v. Tus-caloosa, 439 U. S. 60, 71 (1978) (States enjoy "extraordinarily

wide latitude . . . in creating various types of political sub-divisions and conferring authority upon them").

In Ohio, as in other States, the delegation of governingauthority from State to local unit has long occupied the attention of the State's lawmakers. See D. Wilcox, MunicipalGovernment in Michigan and Ohio: A Study in the Relations
of City and Commonwealth 52-54, 63 (1896) (citing OhioConst., Art. XIII (1851)). The Ohio Constitution currently
grants municipalities within the State general authority "toexercise all powers of local self-government and to adopt and
enforce within their limits such local police, sanitary andother similar regulations, as are not in conflict with the
general laws." Art. XVIII, $ 3. Ohio's Legislature hasenacted several statutes empowering cities to regulate
motor vehicles and highways. See, e. g., Ohio Rev. CodeAnn. $ 715.22 (Anderson 2000) (municipality may regulate
motor vehicles and highways); $ 723.01 ("Municipal corpora-tions shall have special power to regulate the use of the
streets."). Particularly relevant here, Ohio has exemptedtow trucks from the State's regulation of motor carriers,

from "enact[ing]" new laws, it permits localities (but not States) to enforce
previously enacted state laws relating to motor carriage of property.

Cincinnati v. Reed, 27 Ohio App. 3d 115, 500 N. E.
2d 333 (1985).It is the expressed intent of $ 14501(c)(2)(A) that the

preemption rule of $ 14501(c)(1) "not restrict" the existing "safety regulatory authority of a State." Compare

$ 14501(c)(2)(A) with $$ 14501(c)(2)(B) and (C) (preemption
"does not apply" to state or local power to regulate in partic-ular areas), and $ 14501(c)(3) (preemption rule "shall not

affect" multistate, state, or local authority to regulate par-ticular areas at the behest of carriers). Preemption analysis "start[s] with the assumption that the historic police
powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of
Congress." Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr, 518 U. S. 470, 485
(1996) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Section 14501(c)(2)(A) seeks to save from preemption state
power "in a field which the States have traditionally occupied." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). A saving provision of that order is hardly comparable
to exercises of congressional spending authority that, as a
condition for receipt of funds, explicitly restrict the prerogative of States to entrust governance of a matter to localities.
Such programs typically make uniform statewide regulation
a condition of funding, or, conversely, provide funds to localities on the condition that they be spent at that level in accordance with federal prescriptions and without state interference. See, e. g., 23 U. S. C. $ 153 (grants to support traffic
safety conditioned on a motorcycle helmet law that applies
"throughout the State"); $ 158 (highway grants withheld unless "State has in effect a law" setting the drinking age at

if a State ensures that its plan for medical assistance is "in

the United States makes available to localities to spend at
their discretion).4

This case, by contrast, deals not with States' voluntary
agreements to relinquish authority vis-a` -vis their political
subdivisions in exchange for federal funds, but with preemption stemming from Congress' power to regulate commerce,
in a field where States have traditionally allowed localities to address local concerns. Congress' clear purpose in

$ 14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States'
economic authority over motor carriers of property,

$ 14501(c)(1), "not restrict" the preexisting and traditional
state police power over safety. That power typically includes the choice to delegate the State's "safety regulatory
authority" to localities. Forcing a State to refrain from
doing so would effectively "restrict" that very authority.

local political boundaries. See 42 U. S. C. $$ 7407(c), 7410(a)(1) (1994 ed.)
(States must develop implementation plans for air quality in each of its
"air quality control region[s]," whose borders are defined by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency based not upon local jurisdictional lines but upon criteria she "deems necessary or appropriate for

"waters within its boundaries for which . . . effluent limitations . . . are not
stringent enough to implement [applicable] water quality standard[s]").
Even so, States may delegate implementation authority under the Clean
Air Act to their political subdivisions, subject to the requirement that
the State bear ultimate oversight responsibility. See $ 7410(a)(2)(E)(iii)
(State must provide "necessary assurances that, where the State has relied on a local or regional government, agency, or instrumentality for the

T h e C o ur t o f A p p ea l s s u p po r t e d i t s r ea d i n g o f$ 14501(c)(2)(A) to disallow delegation from State to city in

part by reference to the statute's deregulatory purpose.See Petrey, 246 F. 3d, at 563; accord, Stucky, 260 F. 3d, at
444-446; Tocher, 219 F. 3d, at 1048, 1051; R. Mayer, 158 F. 3d,at 546. We now turn to that justification.

The Conference Report on the Federal Aviation Adminis-tration Authorization Act of 1994 observed that "[s]tate economic regulation of motor carrier operations . . . is a hugeproblem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a standard way of doing business." H. R. Conf. Rep.No. 103-677, p. 87 (1994). Carrying more weight, in the Act
itself Congress reported its finding that "the regulation ofintrastate transportation of property by the States" unreasonably burdened free trade, interstate commerce, andAmerican consumers. Pub. L. 103-305, $ 601(a)(1), 108 Stat.
1605. Congress therefore concluded that "certain aspectsof the State regulatory process should be preempted."

$ 601(a)(2). These declarations of deregulatory purpose,however, do not justify interpreting through a deregulatory
prism "aspects of the State regulatory process" that Con-gress determined should not be preempted.

A congressional decision to enact both a general policythat furthers a particular goal and a specific exception that
might tend against that goal does not invariably call for thenarrowest possible construction of the exception. Such a
construction is surely resistible here, for $ 14501(c)(1)'s pre-emption rule and $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s safety exception to it do
not necessarily conflict. The problem to which the congres-sional conferees attended was "[s]tate

economic regulation";

Opinion of the Court
the exemption in question is for state safety regulation.Corroboratively, the measure's legislative history shows that

the deregulatory aim of the legislation had been endorsed bya key interest group--the American Trucking Association--
subject to "some conditions that would allow regulatory pro-tection to continue for non-economic factors, such as . . . insurance [and] safety." H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-677, at 88.
The conferees believed that the legislation "address[ed] theseconditions."

Ibid.; see also Ace Auto Body, 171 F. 3d, at 776.
The construction of $ 14501 that respondents Ours Garageand TRAO advocate, moreover, does not guarantee uniform

regulation. On respondents' reading as on petitioners', a
State could, without affront to the statute, pass discrete,
nonuniform safety regulations applicable to each of its several constituent municipalities. Ohio thus could adopt the
Columbus regulations to govern in that city, the Toledo regulations to govern there, and so on down the line. See Tr. of
Oral Arg. 37-38. Indeed, because $ 14501(c)(2)(A) refers
only to "political" subdivisions, nothing in the statute's text
would impede a State from creating an administrative
agency organized into local offices, each of which could craft
local rules suitable to its assigned jurisdiction. There is no
reason to suppose that Congress meant to stop the States
from spreading their authority among municipalities unless
they employ such artificial or inefficient schemes.

Furthermore, 49 U. S. C. $ 31141 (1994 ed.) affords the
Secretary of Transportation a means to prevent the safety
exception from overwhelming the lawmakers' deregulatory

purpose. That provision authorizes the Secretary to void
any "State law or regulation on commercial motor vehicle
safety" that, in the Secretary's judgment, "has no safety
benefit . . . [or] would cause an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce." $$ 31141(a), (c)(4); see also $ 31132(8)
(" `State law' includes [for the purposes of $ 31141] a law
enacted by a political subdivision of a State"); $ 31132(9) (parallel definition of "State regulation"). Under this authority,

the Secretary can invalidate local safety regulations uponfinding that their content or multiplicity threatens to clog

the avenues of commerce.We reiterate that $ 14501(c)(2)(A) shields from preemption
only "safety regulatory authority" (and "authority of a Stateto regulate . . . with regard to minimum amounts of financial
responsibility relating to insurance requirements"). Localregulation of prices, routes, or services of tow trucks that
is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garners noexemption from $ 14501(c)(1)'s preemption rule.

* * *
For the reasons stated, we hold that $ 14501(c)(2)(A) sparesfrom preemption local as well as state regulation. We express no opinion, however, on the question whether Colum-bus' particular regulations, in whole or in part, qualify
as exercises of "safety regulatory authority" or otherwisefall within $ 14501(c)(2)(A)'s compass. This question, which
was not reached by the Court of Appeals,5 remains open onremand.

meant to include only that power or authority exercised atthe state level (as, for example, in the phrase "State and local

governmental authority"). The issue is whether, when 49U. S. C. $ 14501(c)(2)(A) (1994 ed., Supp. V) excepts from the
preclusionary command of $ 14501(c)(1) "the safety regula-tory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles," it
means to except the safety regulatory authority of cities andcounties as well. In my view it plainly does not.

by motor carriers, related to--[inter alia] uniformcargo liability rules, . . . if such law, regulation, or provision meets the requirements of subparagraph (B)."$$ 14501(c)(2), (3) (emphases added).

It is impossible to read this text without being struckby the fact that the term "political subdivision of a State"
is added to the term "State" in some of the exceptions,$$ 14501(c)(2)(C), (c)(3), but

not in the exception at issue here,

$ 14501(c)(2)(A). " `[W]here Congress includes particularlanguage in one section of a statute but omits it in another

section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Con-gress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.' " Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16,
23 (1983). The only way to impart some purpose and intenthere is to assume that the word "State" is used in its narrower sense, so that political subdivisions are not covered bythe term. The Court admits that the rule applied in

Russello "support[s] an argument of some force," ante, at 434,that the exception for the "safety regulatory authority of a

State" does not include local safety regulation.But while the

Russello argument is strong, it alone does
not fully describe the clarity with which $ 14501(c)(2)(A) ex-cludes political subdivisions. For the clarity begins not just

with the various exceptions, but with the very preemptionrule to which the exceptions are appended. That rule reads:

"Except as provided [in $$ 14501(c)(2), (3)], a State, polit-ical subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or
more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation,
or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . .
or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder with respect to the transportation of property."

Since the lawmaking power of a political subdivision of aState is a subset of the lawmaking power of the State, Hess

v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30,47 (1994); Wisconsin Public Intervenor v. Mortier, 501 U. S.
597, 607-608 (1991), the preemption rule would have pre-cisely the same scope if it omitted the reference to "political
subdivision of a State." It is a well-established principle ofstatutory construction (and of common sense) that when such
a situation occurs, when "two words or expressions are cou-pled together, one of which generically includes the other, it
is obvious that the more general term is used in a meaningexcluding the specific one." J. Sutherland, Statutes and
Statutory Construction $ 266, p. 349 (1891). The only con-ceivable reason for this specification of "political subdivision"
apart from "State" is to establish, in the rule, the two separate categories of state power--state power exercisedthrough political subdivisions and state power exercised by

the State directly--that are later treated differently in theexceptions to the rule.

The situation is comparable to the following hypotheticalusing the term "football" (which may be used to include
soccer, see Webster's New International Dictionary 983 (2ded. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that "football and
soccer shall not be played on the town green" ($ 14501(c)(1)),except that "football and soccer may be played on Saturdays"
($ 14501(c)(2)(C)), "football and soccer may be played on sum-mer nights" ($ 14501(c)(3)(A)), and "football may be played
on Mondays" ($ 14501(c)(2)(A)). In today's opinion, theCourt says soccer may be played on Mondays. I think it
clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of footballbut as a separate category. And the same is true of "political subdivision" here. II

The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because$ 14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting. First, the Court notes
that $ 14501(c)(2)(A) does not "trac[k] the language and

structure of the general preemption rule." Ante, at 434.Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority

of a State or other political entity "to enact or enforce a law,regulation, or other provision," $ 14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers
to the "safety regulatory authority of a State." Second, theCourt notes that another exception to the preemption rule,

$ 14501(c)(2)(B), is "stated with similar economy." Ante,at 435. It addresses merely the

subject of regulation (trans-portation of household goods) instead of both the subject and

the source of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or po-litical authority of two or more States). This has, the Court
notes, the same effect as its neighbor, $ 14501(c)(2)(C), ofpermitting both state and local regulation.

1 Ibid. These

inconsistencies in the statute's drafting style, the Courtcontends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily

draw from the absence of the term " `political subdivision' "in $ 14501(c)(2)(A).

Ibid.
The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.
How can inconsistencies of style, on points that have nothing
to do with the issue of separating state and local authority,
cause the text's crystal-clear distinction between state andlocal authority to disappear? It would certainly reflect

more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently usedthe formulation "to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or
other provision," rather than replacing it in $ 14501(c)(2)(A)with the equivalent phrase "regulatory authority of a State";
and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (a` la$ 14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else

whenever the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisionsof States, and political authorities of two or more States.

1 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in
principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two
neighboring sections produce the same result with different language. It
is true enough that $ 14501(c)(2)(C), like $ 14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state
and local regulation. But $ 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike $ 14501(c)(2)(B), also
permits regulation by a "political authority of 2 or more States."

But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect drafts-manship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisionswhere they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some
hitherto unknown canon of interpretation--perhaps (bor-rowed from the law of evidence) negligens in uno, negligens
in omnibus--the diverse styles of $ 14501(c)'s exceptionshave nothing to do with whether we should take seriously
the references to States and subdivisions of States wherethey appear.

What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the ter-minology of $ 14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today comeup with a judicial interpretation of $ 14501(c) that renders
the term "political subdivision of a State," which appearsthroughout,

utterly superfluous throughout. Although theCourt claims that the "Russello presumption . . . grows

weaker with each difference in the formulation of the provi-sions under inspection,"

ante, at 435-436, it cites no author-ity for that proposition--nor could it, because we have routinely applied the Russello presumption in cases where astatute employs different "verbal formulation[s]" in sections
that include particular language and in sections that omitsuch language. See, e. g., Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534
U. S. 438, 452-454 (2002); Duncan v. Walker, 533 U. S. 167,173-174 (2001); Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 249-250

units over safety on municipal streets and roads." Ante,at 439-440. Well of course we think there is "clear and manifest purpose here"; but besides that, the Court`s federalismconcerns are overblown. To begin with, it should not be
thought that the States' power to control the relationshipbetween themselves and their political subdivisions--their
"traditional prerogative . . . to delegate" (or to refuse to dele-gate) "their authority to their constituent parts,"

ante, at429--has hitherto been regarded as sacrosanct. To the contrary. To take only a few examples,2 the Federal Govern-ment routinely gives directly to municipalities substantial
grants of funds that cannot be reached or directed by "thepoliticians upstate" (or "downstate"), see, e. g., Office of Management and Budget, 2001 Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance AEI-1 to AEI-29; Lawrence County v. LeadDeadwood School Dist. No. 40-1, 469 U. S. 256, 270 (1985);and many significant federal programs require laws or regulations that must be adopted by the state governmentand cannot be delegated to political subdivisions, see,

e. g.,42 U. S. C. $ 1396a(a) (Medicaid); 23 U. S. C. $$ 153, 158

(Federal-Aid Highway System); 42 U. S. C. $$ 7407(a), 7410(1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act).

3 This "interference" of the Fed2 The Court thinks these examples are "hardly comparable" to $ 14501(c)
because many involve Spending Clause legislation. Ante, at 438. A
sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 42 U. S. C. $ 7410 (1994
ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending
Clause legislation could be added, see, e. g., 33 U. S. C. $$ 1313(d), 1362(3)
(Clean Water Act). But in any event, a siphoning off of the States' "historic powers" to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come
about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or
through other means. The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to
interfere in this matter.

3 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State's
implementation plan. Ante, at 439, n. 4; see 42 U. S. C. $$ 7407(a),

plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities. Moreover, as I explain in

eral Government with the States' "traditional preroga-tive . . . to delegate their authority to their constituent parts"

has long been a subject of considerable debate and contro-versy. See, e. g., Hills, Dissecting the State: The Use of
Federal Law to Free State and Local Officials from StateLegislatures' Control, 97 Mich. L. Rev. 1201 (1999).

With such major impositions as these already on the books,treating $ 14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd. That provisionpreempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate
"a price, route, or service of any motor carrier . . . or anymotor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder

with re-spect to the transportation of property." (Emphasis added.)

The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemp-tion to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions
that single out for special treatment "motor carriers of prop-erty." $ 14501(c). States and political subdivisions remain free to enact and enforce general traffic safety laws,general restrictions on the weight of cars and trucks that
may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regula-tions that do not target motor carriers "with respect to the
transportation of property." In addition, the exception con-tained in $ 14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State--but not a political
subdivision--to apply special safety rules (rules adoptedunder its "safety regulatory authority") to motor carriers of
property.4
n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different. Under 49 U. S. C.

$$ 14501(c)(1) and (c)(2)(A), a State may enact regulations pursuant to
its "safety regulatory authority" and rely on localities to enforce those

Scalia, J., dissenting

This relatively modest burden on the "historic powers ofthe States" to delegate authority to political subdivisions,

Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 461 (1991) (internal quo-tation marks omitted), is unambiguously imposed by the
statute. The Court repeatedly emphasizes the fact that$ 14501(c)(2)(A) declares that $ 14501(c)(1) shall " `not restrict'
the existing `safety regulatory authority of a State,' " ante,at 438--which, it says, "includes the choice to delegate . . .
to localities," ante, at 439. This entirely begs the question,which is

precisely whether the statute's reference to the au-thority of a "State" includes authority possessed by a municipality on delegation from the State. As I have described,the text and structure of the statute leave no doubt that it
does not--that "State" does not include "subdivision of aState." Even when we are dealing with the traditional
powers of the States, "[e]vidence of pre-emptive purpose issought in the text and structure of the statute at issue."
CSX Transp., Inc. v. Easterwood, 507 U. S. 658, 664 (1993)(emphasis added); see also

to "enforce" rules adopted under its "safety regulations." Ante, at 435-
436. But the conclusion that $ 14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision
from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by
ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the "historic powers of the States"
must be evinced by a "plain statement," Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452,
461 (1991). A natural reading of the phrase "a . . . political subdivision of
a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law"--and a reading faithful to
Gregory's plain statement rule--is that a political subdivision may not
enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws. The Court believes this reading "raises the startling possibility," ante, at 436, n. 3, that

$ 14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing
previously enacted state regulations relating to motor carriage of property. I think not. A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is
well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted
to produce absurd results. The municipalities' reserved power to enforce
state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State
has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

et al.

appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of utah

No. 01-714. Argued March 27, 2002--Decided June 20, 2002
The Census Bureau derives most census information from forms it mails

to a nationwide list of addresses. If no one replies to a particular form
or the information supplied is confusing, contradictory, or incomplete,
the Bureau follows up with visits by its field personnel. Occasionally,
despite the visits, the Bureau may still have conflicting indications
about, e. g., whether a listed address is a housing unit, office building, or
vacant lot, whether a residence is vacant or occupied, or the number
of persons in a unit. The Bureau may then use a methodology called
"imputation," by which it infers that the address or unit about which
it is uncertain has the same population characteristics as those of its
geographically closest neighbor of the same type (i. e., apartment or
single-family dwelling) that did not return a form. In the year 2000
census, the Bureau used "hot-deck imputation" to increase the total population count by about 0.4%. But because this small percentage was
spread unevenly across the country, it made a difference in the apportionment of congressional Representatives. In particular, imputation
increased North Carolina's population by 0.4% while increasing Utah's
by only 0.2%, so that North Carolina will receive one more Representative and Utah one less than if the Bureau had simply filled relevant
informational gaps by counting the related number of individuals as
zero. Utah brought this suit against appellees, the officials charged
with conducting the census, claiming that the Bureau's use of "hot-deck
imputation" violates 13 U. S. C. $ 195, which prohibits use of "the statistical method known as `sampling,' " and is inconsistent with the Constitution's statement that an "actual Enumeration shall be made," Art. I,

official census results. North Carolina intervened. The District Court
found for the Bureau.

Held:

1. The Court rejects North Carolina's argument that Utah lacks
standing because this action is not a "Case" or "Controversy," Art. III,

$ 2, in that the federal courts do not have the power to "redress" the
"injury" that appellees allegedly "caused" Utah, e. g., Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 561. Because there is no significant dif536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ference between Utah and the plaintiff in Franklin v. Massachusetts,
505 U. S. 788, in which the Court rejected a similar standing argument,
North Carolina must convince the Court that it should reconsider
Franklin. It has not done so. It argues that ordering appellees to
recalculate the census numbers and recertify the official result cannot
help Utah because North Carolina is "entitled" to the number of Representatives already certified to it under the statutes that require a decennial census, 13 U. S. C. $ 141(a); mandate that the results be reported to
the President, $ 141(b); obligate the President to send Congress a statement showing the number of Representatives to which each State is
"entitled" by the census data, 2 U. S. C. $ 2a(a); and specify that the
House must then send each State a certificate of the number of Representatives to which it is "entitled." The statutes also say that once all
that is done, each State "shall be entitled" to the number of Representatives the "certificate" specifies. $ 2a(b). Unlike North Carolina, the
Court does not read these statutes as absolutely barring a certificate's
revision in all cases. The statutes do not expressly address what is to
occur in the case of a serious mistake--say, a clerical, mathematical,
or calculation error in census data or in its transposition. Guided by
Franklin, which found standing despite $ 2a's presence, the Court reads
the statute as permitting certificate revision in such cases of error, including cases of court-determined legal error leading to a court-required
revision of the underlying census report. So read, the statute poses no
legal bar to "redress." Nor does Pub. L. 105-119, Title II, $ 209(b), 111
Stat. 2481, which entitles "[a]ny person aggrieved by the use of any
[unlawful] statistical method" to bring "a civil action" for declaratory
or injunctive "relief against the use of such method." Despite North
Carolina's argument that this statute implicitly forbids a suit after the
census' conclusion, the statute does not say that and does not explain
why Congress would wish to deprive of its day in court a State that did
not learn of a counting method's representational consequences until
after the census' completion--and hence had little, if any, incentive to
bring a precensus action. The Court reads limitations on its jurisdiction narrowly, see, e. g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U. S. 592, 603, and will not
read into a statute an unexpressed congressional intent to bar jurisdiction the Court has previously exercised, e. g., Franklin, supra. Because neither statute poses an absolute legal barrier to relief, it is likely
that Utah's victory here would bring about the ultimate relief it seeks.
See id., at 803. Thus, Utah has standing. Pp. 459-464.

2. The Bureau's use of "hot-deck imputation" does not violate 13
U. S. C. $ 195, which "authorize[s] the use of the statistical method
known as `sampling,' " "[e]xcept for the determination of population for
purposes of apportionment of Representatives." Bureau imputation in

the year 2000 census differs from sampling in several critical respects:
(1) As to the nature of the enterprise, sampling seeks to extrapolate the
features of a large population from a small one, but the Bureau's imputation process sought simply to fill in missing data as part of an effort to
count individuals one by one. (2) As to methodology, sampling seeks to
find a subset that will resemble a whole through the use of artificial,
random selection processes, whereas the Bureau's methodology was not
that typically used by statisticians, but that used to assure that an individual unit (not a "subset"), chosen nonrandomly, will resemble other
individuals (not a "whole") selected by the fortuitous unavailability of
data. (3) As to the immediate objective, sampling seeks to extrapolate
the sample's relevant population characteristics to the whole population,
while the Bureau seeks simply to determine the characteristics of missing individual data. These differences, whether of degree or of kind,
are important enough to place imputation outside the scope of $ 195's
phrase "the statistical method known as `sampling.' " That phrase--
using the words "known as" and the quotation marks around "sampling"--suggests a term of art with a technical meaning. And the technical literature, which the Court has examined, see Corning Glass
Works v. Brennan, 417 U. S. 188, 201, contains definitions that focus
upon the sorts of differences discussed above. Also, insofar as the parties rely on statisticians' expert opinion, that opinion uniformly favors
the Government. Further, $ 195's legislative history suggests that the
"sampling" to which the statute refers is the practice that the Secretary
called "sampling" in 1958 when Congress wrote that law, and that the
statutory word does not apply to imputation, which Congress did not
consider. Finally, Utah provides no satisfactory alternative account of
the meaning of the phrase "the statistical method known as `sampling.' "
Its several arguments--that "sampling" occurs whenever information
on a portion of the population is used to infer information about the
whole population; that the Court found that two methods, allegedly virtually identical to imputation, constituted "sampling" in Department of
Commerce v. United States House of Representatives, 525 U. S. 316,
324-326; that the Bureau, if authorized to engage in imputation, might
engage in wide-scale substitution of imputation for person-by-person
counting; and that two of the Bureau's imputation methods are inaccurate--are not convincing. Utah has failed to overcome the fact that
the Bureau has long and consistently interpreted $ 195 as permitting
imputation, while Congress, aware of this interpretation, has enacted
related legislation without changing the statute. Pp. 464-473.

3. The Bureau's use of "hot-deck imputation" does not violate the Census Clause, which requires the "actual Enumeration" of each State's pop536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ulation "within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress . . . ,
in such Manner as they shall by Law direct." Utah argues that the
words "actual Enumeration" require the Census Bureau to seek out each
individual and prohibit it from relying on imputation, but the Constitution's text does not make the distinction that Utah seeks to draw.
Rather, it uses a general word, "enumeration," that refers to a counting
process without describing the count's methodological details. The textual word "actual" refers in context to the enumeration that would be
used for apportioning the Third Congress, succinctly clarifying the fact
that the constitutionally described basis for apportionment would not
apply to the First and Second Congresses. The final part of the sentence says that the "actual Enumeration" shall take place "in such Manner as" Congress itself "shall by Law direct," thereby suggesting the
breadth of congressional methodological authority, rather than its limitation. See, e. g., Wisconsin v. City of New York, 517 U. S. 1, 19. This
understanding of the text is supported by the history of the Constitutional Convention of 1787, which demonstrates that "actual Enumeration" does not limit census methodology as Utah proposes, but was intended to distinguish the census from the apportionment process for the
First Congress, which was based on conjecture rather than a deliberately taken count. Further support is added by contemporaneous general usage, as exemplified by late-18th-century dictionaries defining
"enumeration" simply as an act of numbering or counting over, without
reference to counting methodology, and by contemporaneous legal documents, in which "enumeration" does not require contact between a census taker and each enumerated individual, but is used almost interchangeably with the phrase "cause the number of the inhabitants . . . to
be taken." Indeed, the Bureau's imputation method is similar in principle to other efforts used since 1800 to determine the number of missing
persons, including asking heads of households, neighbors, landlords,
postal workers, or other proxies about the number of inhabitants in a
particular place. Nor can Utah draw support from the Census Clause's
basic purposes: to use population rather than wealth to determine representation, to tie taxes and representation together, to insist upon periodic recounts of the population, and to take from the States the power
to determine the manner of conducting the census. Those matters of
general principle do not directly help determine the issue of detailed
methodology before the Court. Nonetheless, certain basic constitutional choices may prove relevant. The decisions, for example, to use
population rather than wealth, to tie taxes and representation together,
to insist upon periodic recounts, and to take from the States the power
to determine methodology all suggest a strong constitutional interest in

accuracy. And an interest in accuracy here favors the Bureau, which
uses imputation as a last resort after other methods have failed. The
Court need not decide here the precise methodological limits foreseen
by the Census Clause. It need say only that in this instance, where all
efforts have been made to reach every household, where the methods
used consist not of statistical sampling but of inference, where that inference involves a tiny percent of the population, where the alternative
is to make a far less accurate assessment of the population, and where
consequently manipulation of the method is highly unlikely, those limits
are not exceeded. Pp. 473-479.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question before us is whether the Census Bureau's use
in the year 2000 census of a methodology called "hot-deckimputation" either (1) violates a statutory provision forbidding use of "the statistical method known as `sampling' " or(2) is inconsistent with the Constitution's statement that

an "actual Enumeration" be made. 13 U. S. C. $ 195; U. S.Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3. We conclude that use of "hot-deck
imputation" violates neither the statute nor the Constitution.

I
A

"Hot-deck imputation" refers to the way in which the Cen-sus Bureau, when conducting the year 2000 census, filled in

certain gaps in its information and resolved certain conflictsin the data. The Bureau derives most census information
through reference to what is, in effect, a nationwide list ofaddresses. It sends forms by mail to each of those addresses. If no one writes back or if the information supplied
is confusing, contradictory, or incomplete, it follows up with
several personal visits by Bureau employees (who may also
obtain information on addresses not listed). Occasionally,
despite the visits, the Bureau will find that it still lacks adequate information or that information provided by those in
the field has somehow not been integrated into the master
list. The Bureau may have conflicting indications, for example, about whether an address on the list (or a newly generated address) represents a housing unit, an office building,
or a vacant lot; about whether a residential building is vacant
or occupied; or about the number of persons an occupied unit
contains. These conflicts and uncertainties may arise because no one wrote back, because agents in the field produced
confused responses, or because those who processed the responses made mistakes. There may be too little time left
for further personal visits. And the Bureau may then de536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
458 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
cide "imputation" represents the most practical way to re-solve remaining informational uncertainties.

The Bureau refers to different kinds of "imputation" de-pending upon the nature of the missing or confusing information. Where, for example, the missing or confused informa-tion concerns the existence of a housing unit, the Bureau
speaks of "status imputation." Where the missing or confused information concerns whether a unit is vacant or occu-pied, the Bureau speaks of

"occupancy imputation." And
where the missing or confused information concerns thenumber of people living in a unit, the Bureau refers to

"household size imputation." In each case, however, the
Bureau proceeds in a somewhat similar way: It imputes the
relevant information by inferring that the address or unit
about which it is uncertain has the same population characteristics as those of a "nearby sample or `donor' " address or
unit--e. g., its "geographically closest neighbor of the same
type (i. e., apartment or single-family dwelling) that did not
return a census questionnaire" by mail. Brief for Appellants 7-8, 11. Because the Bureau derives its information
about the known address or unit from the current 2000 census rather than from prior censuses, it refers to its imputation as "hot-deck," rather than "cold-deck," imputation.

These three forms of imputation increased the final year
2000 count by about 1.2 million people, representing 0.4% of
the total population. But because this small percentage was
spread unevenly across the country, it makes a difference
in the next apportionment of congressional Representatives.
In particular, imputation increased North Carolina's population by 0.4% while increasing Utah's population by only 0.2%.
And the parties agree that that difference means that North
Carolina will receive one more Representative, and Utah
will receive one less Representative, than if the Bureau had
not used imputation but instead had simply filled relevant
informational gaps by counting the related number of individuals as zero.

North Carolina argues at the outset that the federal courts
lack the constitutional power to hear this case. Article III,

$ 2, of the Constitution extends the "judicial Power" of the
United States to actual "Cases" and "Controversies." A
lawsuit does not fall within this grant of judicial authority
unless, among other things, courts have the power to "redress" the "injury" that the defendant allegedly "caused" the
plaintiff. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 561
(1992); Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984). And, in
North Carolina's view, the courts cannot "redress" the injury
that Utah claims to have suffered here. Hence Utah does
not have the "standing" that the Constitution demands.

In Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788 (1992), this
Court considered, and rejected, a similar claim. A private
plaintiff had sued the Secretary of Commerce, challenging
the legality of a 1990 census counting method as "arbitrary
and capricious" and contrary to certain specific statutes.

Id., at 790-791. That plaintiff sought to require the Sec-retary to recalculate the numbers and recertify the official

results. The plaintiff hoped that would ultimately lead toa reapportionment that would assign an additional Representative to his own State.Eight Members of the Court found that the plaintiff had
standing. Four Justices considered only whether the lawpermitted courts to review Census Bureau decisions under
the Administrative Procedure Act. They concluded thatit did. And they saw no further standing obstacle.

Id., at807 (
Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring injudgment).

Four other Justices went further. They found that thecontroversy between the plaintiff and the Secretary was concrete and adversary. They said:

"The Secretary certainly has an interest in defendingher policy determinations concerning the census; even

though she cannot herself change the reapportionment,she has an interest in litigating its accuracy." Id., at
803 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).
They also found that, as a practical matter, redress seemedlikely. They said:

"[A]s the Solicitor General has not contended to the con-trary, we may assume it is substantially likely that the
President and other executive and congressional officialswould abide by an authoritative interpretation of the
census statute and constitutional provision . . . eventhough they would not be directly bound by such a
determination." Ibid.
They saw no further potential obstacle to standing. Ibid.We can find no significant difference between the plaintiff

in Franklin and the plaintiff (Utah) here. Both broughttheir lawsuits after the census was complete. Both claimed
that the Census Bureau followed legally improper countingmethods. Both sought an injunction ordering the Secretary

Opinion of the Court
of Commerce to recalculate the numbers and recertify theofficial result. Both reasonably believed that the Secretary's recertification, as a practical matter, would likely leadto a new, more favorable, apportionment of Representatives.
Given these similarities, North Carolina must convince usthat we should reconsider

Franklin. It has not done so.
North Carolina does not deny that the courts can order
the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate the numbers andto recertify the official census result. Rather it points out

that Utah suffers, not simply from the lack of a proper census"report" (a document), but more importantly from the lack of
the additional congressional Representative to which North
Carolina believes itself entitled as a consequence of the filing
of that document. Whatever we may have said in Franklin,
North Carolina argues, court-ordered relief simply cannot
reach beyond the "report" and, here, a proper "report" cannot help bring about that ultimate "redress."

The reason North Carolina believes that court-ordered relief, i. e., the new document, cannot help is that, in its view,
the statutes that set forth the census process make ultimate
redress legally impossible. Those statutes specify that the
Secretary of Commerce must "take a decennial census of
population as of the first day of April" 2000, 13 U. S. C.

$ 141(a); he must report the results to the President by January 1, 2001, $ 141(b); the President must transmit to Congress
by January 12, 2001, a statement showing the "whole number
of persons in each State . . . and the number of Representatives to which each State would be entitled," 2 U. S. C.

$ 2a(a); and, within 15 days of receiving that statement, the
Clerk of the House of Representatives must "send to the
executive of each State a certificate of the number of Representatives to which such State is entitled," $ 2a(b). The
statutes also say that, once all that is done, each State "shall
be entitled" to the number of Representatives that the "certificate" specifies "until the taking effect of a reapportionment under this section or subsequent statute." Ibid.

462 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
North Carolina points out that all of this was done by Jan-uary 16, 2001. And North Carolina concludes that it is "entitled" to the number of Representatives that the "certificate"specifies (

i. e., one more than Utah would like)--come what
may.We disagree with North Carolina because we do not read

these statutes so absolutely--as if they barred a certificate's
revision in all cases no matter what. The statutes them-selves do not expressly say what is to occur should the "report" or the "statement" upon which the Clerk's "certificate"rests turn out to contain, or to reflect, a serious mistake.
The language is open to a more flexible reading that would
permit correction of a certificate found to rest upon a serious
error--say, a clerical, a mathematical, or a calculation error,
in census data or in its transposition. And if that error is
uncovered before new Representatives are actually selected,
and its correction translates mechanically into a new apportionment of Representatives without further need for exercise of policy judgment, such mechanical revision makes good
sense. In such cases, the "certificate" previously sent would
have turned out not to have been a proper or valid certificate, it being understood that these statutes do not bar the
substitution of a newer, more accurate version. Guided by
Franklin, which found standing despite the presence of this
statute, we read the statute as permitting "certificate" revision in such cases of error, and we include among them cases
of court-determined legal error leading to a court-required
revision of the underlying Secretarial "report." So read,
the statute poses no legal bar to "redress."

North Carolina adds that another statute, enacted after
Franklin, nonetheless bars our consideration of this case.
That statute authorizes "[a]ny person aggrieved by the use
of any [unlawful] statistical method" to bring "a civil action"
for declaratory or injunctive "relief against the use of such
method." Pub. L. 105-119, Title II, $ 209(b), 111 Stat. 2481.
North Carolina argues that this statute, by directly authoriz536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ing a lawsuit prior to conclusion of the census, implicitlyforbids a lawsuit

after its conclusion. And it supports
this reading by pointing to a legislative finding that it would"be impracticable" to provide relief "after" that time.

Id.,

$ 209(a)(8).This statute, however, does not say that it bars postcensus

lawsuits. It does not explain why Congress would have
wished to deprive of its day in court a State that did notlearn about a counting method's representational consequences until after the census is complete--and hence hadlittle, if any, incentive to bring a precensus action. Nor (as
we have just explained), if a lawsuit is brought soon enough
after completion of the census and heard quickly enough, is
relief necessarily "impracticable." We read limitations on
our jurisdiction to review narrowly. See Webster v. Doe, 486
U. S. 592, 603 (1988); see also Bowen v. Michigan Academy
of Family Physicians, 476 U. S. 667, 670 (1986). But see

circumstances warrant reading statute as limiting the persons authorized to bring suit). We do not normally read into
a statute an unexpressed congressional intent to bar jurisdiction that we have previously exercised. Franklin; Department of Commerce v. Montana, 503 U. S. 442 (1992). And
we shall not do so here.

Neither statute posing an absolute legal barrier to relief,
we believe it likely that Utah's victory here would bring
about the ultimate relief that Utah seeks. Victory would
mean a declaration leading, or an injunction requiring, the
Secretary to substitute a new "report" for the old one.
Should the new report contain a different conclusion about
the relative populations of North Carolina and Utah, the
relevant calculations and consequent apportionment-related
steps would be purely mechanical; and several months
would remain prior to the first post-2000 census congressional election. Under these circumstances, it would seem,

Opinion of the Court
as in Franklin, "substantially likely that the Presidentand other executive and congressional officials would abide

by an authoritative interpretation of the census statute andconstitutional provision . . . ." 505 U. S., at 803 (opinion of
O'Connor, J.).Moreover, in terms of our "standing" precedent, the courts
would have ordered a change in a legal status (that ofthe "report"), and the practical consequence of that change
would amount to a significant increase in the likelihood thatthe plaintiff would obtain relief that directly redresses the
injury suffered. We have found standing in similar circum-stances. See,

e. g., Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524U. S. 11, 25 (1998) (standing to obtain court determination

that the organization was a "political committee" where thatdetermination would make agency more likely to require
reporting, despite agency's power not to order reportingregardless); Bennett v. Spear, 520 U. S. 154, 169-171 (1997)
(similar in respect to determination of the lawfulness of anagency's biological report);

Metropolitan Washington Air-ports Authority v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft Noise,

Inc., 501 U. S. 252, 264-265 (1991) (similar in respect to de-termination that transfer of airport control to local agency
is unlawful). And related cases in which we have deniedstanding involved a significantly more speculative likelihood
of obtaining ultimate relief. See Lujan, 504 U. S., at 564-565, n. 2 (obtaining ultimate relief "speculative"); Simon v.
Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U. S. 26, 42(1976) (same). We consequently conclude that Utah has
standing here, and we have jurisdiction.

Utah rests its statutory claim on a federal sampling stat-ute which reads as follows:

"Except for the determination of population for pur-poses of apportionment of Representatives in Congress
among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he con536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
siders it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical
method known as `sampling' . . . ." 13 U. S. C. $ 195.

We have previously read this language as forbidding
apportionment-related use of "the statistical method known
as `sampling.' " Department of Commerce v. United States
House of Representatives, 525 U. S. 316, 343 (1999). Utah
claims that imputation, as practiced by the Census Bureau,
is a form of that forbidden "sampling" method.

The Government argues that imputation is not "sampling."
And it has used a simplified example to help explain why this
is so. Imagine a librarian who wishes to determine the total
number of books in a library. If the librarian finds a statistically sound way to select a sample (e. g., the books contained
on every 10th shelf) and if the librarian then uses a statistically sound method of extrapolating from the part to the
whole (e. g., multiplying by 10), then the librarian has determined the total number of books by using the statistical
method known as "sampling." If, however, the librarian
simply tries to count every book one by one, the librarian
has not used sampling. Nor does the latter process suddenly become "sampling" simply because the librarian, finding empty shelf spaces, "imputes" to that empty shelf space
the number of books (currently in use) that likely filled
them--not even if the librarian goes about the imputation
process in a rather technical way, say, by measuring the size
of nearby books and dividing the length of each empty shelf
space by a number representing the average size of nearby
books on the same shelf.

This example is relevant here both in the similarities and
in the differences that it suggests between sampling and imputation. In both, " `information on a portion of a population is used to infer information on the population as a
whole.' " Brief for Appellants 18. And in Utah's view, and
that of Justice O'Connor, see post, at 482-483 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), that similarity brings

the Census Bureau imputation process within the relevantstatutory phrase.

On the other hand, the two processes differ in several criti-cal respects: (1) In respect to the

nature of the enterprise,
the librarian's sampling represents an overall approach tothe counting problem that from the beginning relies on data

that will be collected from only a part of the total population,
Declaration of Howard Hogan |||| 19-23, App. 257-259 (here-inafter Hogan); (2) in respect to

methodology, the librarian's

Declaration of David W. Peterson || 8, id., at 352 (hereinafter Peterson).

By way of contrast, the librarian's imputation (1) does not
represent an overall approach to the counting problem that
will rely on data collected from only a subset of the total
population, since it is a method of processing data (giving a
value to missing data), not its collection, |||| 21, 29, id., at

determining the characteristics of missing individual books,
not extrapolating characteristics from the sample to the entire book population, Hogan || 17, id., at 256-257; Peterson
|| 9, id., at 352.

These same differences distinguish Bureau imputation in
the year 2000 census from "the statistical method known as
`sampling.' " 13 U. S. C. $ 195. The nature of the Bureau's

Opinion of the Court
enterprise was not the extrapolation of the features of alarge population from a small one, but the filling in of missing

data as part of an effort to count individuals one by one.But cf.

post, at 482-483 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) (suggesting the contrary). The Bureau'smethodology was not that typically used by statisticians

seeking to find a subset that will resemble a whole through
the use of artificial, random selection processes; but thatused to assure that an individual unit (not a "subset"), chosen

nonrandomly, will resemble other individuals (not a "whole")selected by the fortuitous unavailability of data. L. Kish,
Survey Sampling 26 (1965) ("In statistical literature [sampling] is generally synonymous with random sampling").
And the Bureau's immediate objective was the filling in of
missing data; not extrapolating the characteristics of the
"donor" units to an entire population.

These differences, whether of degree or of kind, are important enough to place imputation outside the scope of the statute's phrase "the statistical method known as `sampling.' "
For one thing, that statutory phrase--using the words
"known as" and the quotation marks that surround "sampling"--suggests a term of art with a technical meaning.
And the technical literature, which we have consequently examined, see Corning Glass Works v. Brennan, 417 U. S. 188,
201 (1974), contains definitions that focus upon differences of
the sort discussed above. One text, for example, says that
"[s]urvey sampling, or population sampling, deals with
methods for selecting and observing a part (sample) of the
population in order to make inferences about the whole population." Kish, supra, at 18. Another says that "sample, as
it is used in the [statistics] literature . . . means a subset of
the population that is used to gain information about the entire population," G. Henry, Practical Sampling 11 (1990), or,
in other words, "a model of the population," ibid. Yet another says that a "sampling method is a method of selecting
a fraction of the population in a way that the selected sample

468 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
represents the population." P. Sukhatme, Sampling Theoryof Surveys with Applications 1 (1954). A 1953 treatise, to

which Utah refers, says that a broader definition of "sample"is imprecise, adding that the term "should be reserved for a
set of units . . . which has been selected in the belief that itwill be representative of the whole aggregate." F. Yates,
Sampling Methods for Censuses and Surveys $ 1.1, p. 2 (2d
rev. ed. 1953) (hereinafter Yates). And Census Bureau doc-uments state that "professional statisticians" reserve the

term " `sample' . . . for instances when the selection of thesmaller population is based on the methodology of their
science." Report to Congress--The Plan for Census 2000,
p. 23 (revised and reissued Aug. 1997) (hereinafter Report
to Congress).

These definitions apply easily and naturally to what we
called "sampling" in the librarian example, given its nature, methods, and immediate objectives. These definitions
do not apply to the librarian's or to the Bureau's imputation process--at least not without considerable linguistic
squeezing.

For another thing, Bureau statisticians testified in the District Court that, in their expert opinion, Bureau imputation
was not "sampling" as that term is used in the field of statistics. Hogan |||| 18-30, App. 257-262; Waksberg |||| 6-10, id.,
at 290-294 (former Bureau statistician). Their reasons parallel those to which we have referred. Ibid. Although
Utah presented other experts who testified to the contrary,
Utah has not relied upon their testimony or expert knowledge here. Insofar as the parties now rely on expert opinion, that opinion uniformly favors the Government.

Further, the history of the sampling statute suggests that
Congress did not have imputation in mind in 1958 when it
wrote that law. At that time, the Bureau already was engaged in what it called "sampling," a practice that then involved asking a small subset of the population subsidiary
census questions about, say, automobiles, telephones, or dish536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
washers, and extrapolating the responses to produce nationalfigures about, say, automobile ownership. See M. Anderson,

The American Census: A Social History 199 (1988) (discuss-ing "long form" survey, sent in 1950 to about 20% of population). The Secretary of Commerce asked Congress to enacta law that would make clear the Bureau had legal authority
to engage in this "practice." Amendment of Title 13, United
States Code, Relating to Census: Hearing on H. R. 7911 be-fore the House Committee on the Post Office and Civil Service, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 7 (1957) (Statement of Purpose andNeed) (Secretary of Commerce, describing Bureau's ability
to obtain "some . . . information . . . efficiently through a
sample survey . . . rather than a complete enumeration
basis"). The Secretary did not object to a legislative restriction that would, in effect, deny the Bureau sampling authority in the area of apportionment. And Congress, in part
to help achieve cost savings, responded with the present
statute which provides that limited authority. See S. Rep.
No. 698, 85th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1957) ("[P]roper use of sampling methods can result in substantial economies in census
taking"); S. Rep. No. 94-1256, p. 5 (1976) ("use of sampling
procedures and surveys . . . urged for the sake of economy
and reducing respondent burden").

This background suggests that the "sampling" to which
the statute refers is the practice that the Secretary called
"sampling" at the time--for that is what Congress considered. And it suggests that the statutory word does not
apply to imputation--for that is a matter that Congress did
not consider. Indeed, had the Secretary believed that Congress intended to restrict the Bureau's authority to engage
in apportionment-related imputation, he would likely have
expressed an objection, for the Bureau had used such imputation in the past and intended to use it in the future.
Hogan || 39, App. 266-267. Moreover, the Bureau's rationale
for using sampling was quite different from its rationale for
using imputation. An advance plan to sample a subset saves

536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
470 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
money, for it restricts a survey's potential scope. Bureauimputation does not save money, for the Bureau turns to imputation only after ordinary questionnaires and interviewshave failed. Rather, imputation reflects a Bureau decision
to spend at least a small amount of additional money in orderto avoid placing the figure "zero" next to a listed address
when it is possible to do better. See || 34, id., at 264 ("The
goal in Census 2000 was to conduct a census that was bothnumerically and distributively accurate").

Finally, Utah provides no satisfactory alternative accountof the meaning of the phrase "the statistical method known
as `sampling.' " Its arguments suggest that the phrase
should apply to any use of statistics that would help the Bureau extrapolate from items about which the Bureau knows
to other items, the characteristics of which it does not know.
Brief for Appellants 9. But that definitional view would
include within the statutory phrase matters that could not
possibly belong there--for example, the use of statistics to
determine whether it is better to ask a postal worker or a
neighbor about whether an apparently empty house is occupied. And it would come close to forbidding the use of all
statistics, not simply one statistical method ("sampling").
Utah's express definitional statement--that "sampling" occurs whenever "information on a portion of a population is
used to infer information on the population as a whole"--
suffers from a similar defect. Indeed, it is even broader,
coming close to a description of the mental process of inference itself. While the Census Bureau and at least one treatise have used somewhat similar language to define "sampling," they have immediately added the qualification that
such is the "layman's" view, while professional statisticians,
when speaking technically, speak more narrowly and more
precisely. Report to Congress 23; Yates 1-2.

Utah makes several additional arguments. It says that in
House of Representatives, the Court found that two methods, virtually identical to imputation, constituted "sampling."

536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

471Cite as: 536 U. S. 452 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
It says that the Bureau, if authorized to engage in imputa-tion, might engage in wide-scale substitution of imputation

for person-by-person counting. And it says that, in anyevent, the Bureau's methods for imputing

status and occupancy, see supra, at 458, are inaccurate.In our view, however,

House of Representatives is distinguishable. The two instances of Bureau methodology at
issue there satisfied the technical criteria for "sampling" inways that the imputation here at issue does not. In both

instances, the Bureau planned at the outset to produce a sta-tistically sound sample from which it extrapolated characteristics of an entire population. In the first instance it did so
by selecting census blocks randomly from which to extrapolate global census figures in order to compare (and adjust)
the accuracy of figures obtained in traditional ways with
figures obtained through statistical sampling. 525 U. S., at
325-326. In the second instance it used a sample drawn
from questionnaire nonrespondents in particular census
tracts in order to obtain the population figure for the entire
tract. The "sampling" in the second instance more closely
resembles the present effort to fill in missing data, for the
"sample" of nonrespondents was large (about 20% of the
tract) compared to the total nonresponding population (about
30% of the entire tract). Id., at 324-325. Nonetheless, we
believe that the Bureau's view of the enterprise as sampling,
the deliberate decision taken in advance to find an appropriate sample, the sampling methods used to do so, the immediate objective of determining through extrapolation the size
of the entire nonresponding population, and the quantitative
figures at issue (10% of the tract there; 0.4% here), all taken
together, distinguish it--in degree if not in kind--from the
imputation here at issue.

Nor are Utah's other two arguments convincing. As to
the first, Utah has not claimed that the Bureau has used
imputation to manipulate results. It has not explained how
census-taking that fills in ultimate blanks through imputa536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN
472 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
tion is more susceptible to manipulation than census-takingthat fills in ultimate blanks with a zero. And given the advance uncertainties as to which States imputation mightfavor, manipulation would seem difficult to arrange. If

Justice O'Connor's speculation comes to pass--that the Bu-reau would decide, having litigated this case and utilized imputation in a subsequent census, to forgo the benefits of that
process because of its results--the Court can address theproblem at that time. As to the second, Utah's claim concerns the nature of the imputation method, not its accuracyas applied--though we add that neither the record, see

infra,
at 477, nor Justice O'Connor's opinion, see post, at 487-488,
gives us any reason to doubt that accuracy here.

We note one further legal hurdle that Utah has failed to
overcome--the Bureau's own interpretation of the statute.
The Bureau, which recommended this statute to Congress,
has consistently, and for many years, interpreted the statute
as permitting imputation. Hogan |||| 39, 41, 43, 46, 47, 52,
App. 266-273. Congress, aware of this interpretation, has
enacted related legislation without changing the statute.
See, e. g., Census Address List Improvement Act of 1994,
Pub. L. 103-430, 108 Stat. 4393; Foreign Direct Investment
and International Financial Data Improvements Act of 1990,
Pub. L. 101-533, 104 Stat. 2344; Act of Oct. 14, 1986, Pub. L.
99-467, 100 Stat. 1192. (Indeed, the Bureau told Congress
of its planned use of imputation in the year 2000 census without meeting objection.) And the statute itself delegates to
the Secretary the authority to conduct the decennial census
"in such form and content as he may determine." 13 U. S. C.

$ 141(a). Although we do not rely on it here, under these
circumstances we would grant legal deference to the Bureau's own legal conclusion were that deference to make the
difference. Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984).

In sum, imputation differs from sampling in respect to the
nature of the enterprise, the methodology used, and the im536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

473Cite as: 536 U. S. 452 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
mediate objective sought. And as we have explained, thesedifferences are of both kind and degree. That the differences may be of degree does not lessen their significancewhere we are charged with interpreting statutory language
and we are faced with arguments that suggest that it coverseven the most ordinary of inferences. Since that cannot be
so, we have found the keys to understanding the operativephrase in its history: the fact that the Bureau itself believed
imputation to stand outside the prohibition it requested Con-gress pass, the fact that the Bureau has consistently used
imputation, and the fact that Congress, on notice of that use,has not suggested otherwise. For these reasons, we conclude that the statutory phrase "the statistical methodknown as `sampling' " does not cover the Bureau's use of
imputation. IV

Utah's constitutional claim rests upon the words "actualEnumeration" as those words appear in the Constitution's
Census Clause. That Clause, as changed after the Civil War(in ways that do not matter here), reads as follows:

"Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportionedamong the several States . . . according to their respective Numbers . . . counting the whole number of personsin each State. . . . The

actual Enumeration shall bemade within three Years after the first Meeting of the

Congress of the United States, . . . in such Manner asthey shall by Law direct." Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3 (emphasis
added); see also Amdt. 14, $ 2.
Utah argues that the words "actual Enumeration" requirethe Census Bureau to seek out each individual. In doing

so, the Bureau may rely upon documentary evidence that anindividual exists, say, a postal return, or upon eyewitness
evidence, say, by a census taker. It can fill in missing datathrough the use of testimonial reports, including secondhand
or thirdhand reports, made by a family member, neighbor,

474 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of the Court
or friend. But it may not rely upon imputation, which fillsin data by assuming, for example, that an unknown house

has the same population characteristics as those of the clos-est similar house nearby.

We do not believe the Constitution makes the distinctionthat Utah seeks to draw. The Constitution's text does not
specify any such limitation. Rather, the text uses a general
word, "enumeration," that refers to a counting process with-out describing the count's methodological details. The textual word "actual" refers in context to the enumeration thatwill be used for apportioning the Third Congress, succinctly
clarifying the fact that the constitutionally described basis
for apportionment will not apply to the First and Second
Congresses. The final part of the sentence says that the
"actual Enumeration" shall take place "in such Manner as"
Congress itself "shall by Law direct," thereby suggesting the
breadth of congressional methodological authority, rather
than its limitation. See, e. g., Wisconsin v. City of New
York, 517 U. S. 1, 19 (1996).

The history of the constitutional phrase supports our
understanding of the text. The Convention sent to its
Committee of Detail a draft stating that Congress was to
"regulate the number of representatives by the number of
inhabitants, . . . which number shall . . . be taken in such
manner as . . . [Congress] shall direct." 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 178, 182-183 (rev.
ed. 1966) (hereinafter Farrand). After making minor, here
irrelevant, changes, the Committee of Detail sent the draft
to the Committee of Style, which, in revising the language,
added the words "actual Enumeration." Id., at 590, 591.
Although not dispositive, this strongly suggests a similar
meaning, for the Committee of Style "had no authority from
the Convention to alter the meaning" of the draft Constitution submitted for its review and revision. Powell v. McCormack, 395 U. S. 486, 538-539 (1969); see 2 Farrand 553;
see also Nixon v. United States, 506 U. S. 224, 231 (1993).

475Cite as: 536 U. S. 452 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
Hence, the Framers would have intended the current phrase,"the actual Enumeration shall be made . . . in such Manner

as [Congress] . . . shall by Law direct," as the substantiveequivalent of the draft phrase, "which number [of inhabitants] shall . . . be taken in such manner as [Congress] shalldirect." 2 Farrand 183. And the Committee of Style's
phrase offers no linguistic temptation to limit census methodology in the manner that Utah proposes.Moreover, both phrases served to distinguish the census

from the process of apportionment for the first Congress.Read in conjunction with the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, the text of Article I makes clear that the
original allocation of seats in the House was based on a kind
of "conjectur[e]," 1 id., at 578-579, in contrast to the deliberately taken count that was ordered for the future. U. S.
Const., Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3; 1 Farrand 602; 2 id., at 106; 2 The
Founders' Constitution 135-136, 139 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner
eds. 1987) (hereinafter Kurland & Lerner); see also Department of Commerce, 503 U. S., at 448, and n. 15; post, at 498-
500 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(describing colonial estimates). What was important was
that contrast--rather than the particular phrase used to describe the new process.

Contemporaneous general usage of the word "enumeration" adds further support. Late-18th-century dictionaries
define the word simply as an "act of numbering or counting
over," without reference to counting methodology. 1 S.
Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 658 (4th rev.
ed. 1773); N. Bailey, An Etymological English Dictionary
(26th ed. 1789) ("numbering or summing up"); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 759 (1961 ed.)
("the act of counting," "a count of something (as a population)"). Utah's strongest evidence, a letter from George
Washington contrasting a population "estimate" with a "census" or "enumeration," does not demonstrate the contrary,
for one can indeed contrast, say, a rough estimate with an

Opinion of the Court
enumeration, without intending to encompass in the former
anything like the Bureau's use of imputation to fill gaps or
clarify confused information about individuals. 31 Writings
of George Washington 329 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1931); see 8
Writings of Thomas Jefferson 236 (A. Lipscomb ed. 1903)
(comparing the "actual returns" with "conjectures"); 1 Farrand 602; 2 id., at 106; Kurland & Lerner 135-136. And the
evidence Justice Thomas sets forth, post, at 498-500 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part), demonstrates
the same. The kinds of estimates to which his sources refer
are those based on "the number of taxable polls, or the number of the militia." Post, at 494 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Such sources show nothing other than that "enumeration" may be "incompatible (or at least arguably incompatible . . .) with gross statistical estimates," House of Representatives, 525 U. S., at 347 (Scalia, J., concurring in part),
but such "gross statistical estimates" are not at stake here.

Contemporaneous legal documents do not use the term
"enumeration" in any specialized way. The Constitution itself, in a later article, refers to the words "actual Enumeration" as meaning "Census or Enumeration," Art. I, $ 9, cl. 4,
thereby indicating that it did not intend the term "actual
Enumeration" as a term of art requiring, say, contact (directly or through third parties) between a census taker and
each enumerated individual. The First Census Act uses the
term "enumeration" almost interchangeably with the phrase
"cause the number of the inhabitants . . . to be taken." And
the marshals who implemented that Act did not try to contact each individual personally, as they were required only
to report the names of all heads of households. Act of Mar.
1, 1790, ch. 2, $ 1, 1 Stat. 102. Cf. House of Representatives,

Census Acts of 1810 through 1950 required census workers
to "visit each home in person"); see also post, at 504

Opinion of the Court
Of course, this last limitation suggests that the Framersexpected census enumerators to seek to reach each individual household. And insofar as statistical methods substitutefor any such effort, it may be argued that the Framers did
not believe that the Constitution authorized their use. See
House of Representatives, supra, at 346-349 (Scalia, J., concurring in part). But we need not decide this matter here,
for we do not deal with the substitution of statistical meth-ods for efforts to reach households and enumerate each individual. Here the Census Bureau's method is used sparinglyonly after it has exhausted its efforts to reach each individual, and it does not differ in principle from other efforts used
since 1800 to determine the number of missing persons.
Census takers have long asked heads of households, "neighbors, landlords, postal workers, or other proxies" about the
number of inhabitants in a particular place, Hogan || 11, App.
253. Such reliance on hearsay need be no more accurate,
is no less inferential, and rests upon no more of an individualized effort for its inferences than the Bureau's method of
imputation.

Nor can Utah draw support from a consideration of the
basic purposes of the Census Clause. That Clause reflects
several important constitutional determinations: that comparative state political power in the House would reflect
comparative population, not comparative wealth; that comparative power would shift every 10 years to reflect population changes; that federal tax authority would rest upon the
same base; and that Congress, not the States, would determine the manner of conducting the census. See Wesberry
v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 9-14, and n. 34 (1964); 1 Farrand

Opinion of the Court
ture of the Framers' concerns. Insofar as Justice Thomas
proves that the Framers chose to use population, rather than
wealth or a combination of the two, as the basis for representation, post, at 500-503, we agree with him. What he does
not show, however, is that, in order to avoid bias or for other
reasons, they prescribed, or meant to prescribe, the precise
method by which Congress was to determine the population.
And he cannot show the latter because, for the most part, the
choice to base representation on population, like the other
fundamental choices the Framers made, are matters of general principle that do not directly help determine the issue
of detailed methodology before us. Declaration of Jack N.
Rakove in Department of Commerce v. United States House
of Representatives, O. T. 1998, No. 98-404, p. 387 ("What was
at issue . . . were fundamental principles of representation
itself . . . not the secondary matter of exactly how census
data was [sic] to be compiled").

Nonetheless, certain basic constitutional choices may
prove relevant. The decisions, for example, to use population rather than wealth, to tie taxes and representation together, to insist upon periodic recounts, and to take from the
States the power to determine methodology all suggest a
strong constitutional interest in accuracy. And an interest
in accuracy here favors the Bureau. That is because, as we
have said, the Bureau uses imputation only as a last resort--
after other methods have failed. In such instances, the Bureau's only choice is to disregard the information it has, using
a figure of zero, or to use imputation in an effort to achieve
greater accuracy. And Bureau information provided in the
District Court suggests that those efforts have succeeded.

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Of course, the Framers did not consider the imputationprocess. At the time they wrote the Constitution "statisticks" referred to " `a statement or view of the civil conditionof a people,' " not the complex mathematical discipline it has
become. P. Cohen, A Calculating People 150-151 (1982).Yet, however unaware the Framers might have been of specific future census needs, say, of automobiles for transport orof computers for calculation, they fully understood that those
future needs might differ dramatically from those of theirown times. And they were optimists who might not have
been surprised to learn that a year 2000 census of the Nationthat they founded required "processed data for over 120 million households, including over 147 million paper question-naires and 1.5 billion pages of printed material." Hogan || 8,
App. 251. Consequently, they did not write detailed censusmethodology into the Constitution. As we have said, we
need not decide here the precise methodological limits fore-seen by the Census Clause. We need say only that in this
instance, where all efforts have been made to reach everyhousehold, where the methods used consist not of statistical
sampling but of inference, where that inference involves atiny percent of the population, where the alternative is to
make a far less accurate assessment of the population, andwhere consequently manipulation of the method is highly unlikely, those limits are not exceeded.For these reasons the judgment of the District Court is

Affirmed.
Justice O'Connor, concurring in part and dissenting inpart.

In the year 2000 census, the Census Bureau used the sta-tistical technique known as "hot-deck imputation" to calculate the state population totals that were used to appor-tion congressional Representatives. While I agree with the
Court's general description of the imputation process, itsconclusion that the appellants have standing to challenge

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
its use, and its conclusion that we otherwise have jurisdictionto consider that challenge, I would find that the Bureau's use

of imputation constituted a form of sampling and thus wasprohibited by $ 195 of the Census Act, 13 U. S. C. $ 1 et seq.
Therefore, while I concur in Parts I and II of the majority'sopinion, I respectfully dissent from Part III and have no
occasion to decide whether the Constitution prohibits im-putation, which the majority addresses in Part IV.

I
To conduct the year 2000 census, the Census Bureau (Bu-reau) first created a master address file that attempted to

list every residential housing unit in the United States. SeeU. S. Dept. of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Admin.,
Census 2000 Operational Plan VI (Dec. 2000) (hereinafterCensus 2000 Operational Plan). The Bureau then conducted
a survey of every address on that list, primarily through theuse of mail-back questionnaires. See

id., at IX.A to IX.E;ante, at 457. As relevant here, these questionnaires requested the name of each person living at a given address.See Census 2000 Operational Plan V.B.

Because not every address returned a questionnaire, theBureau had its enumerators attempt to contact nonresponding addresses up to six times by phone or in person inan effort to obtain population information for each address.
See Declaration of Howard Hogan || 73, App. 285 (hereinafterHogan); Census 2000 Operational Plan IX.G. This was
known as "nonresponse followup." Ibid. Also during thisfollowup procedure, addresses that appeared vacant were
marked as such while addresses determined to be nonexist-ent were noted for later deletion. See Hogan |||| 69, 73, App.
283, 285. When all followup procedures were completed, theBureau still lacked population information for approximately
0.4% of the addresses on the master address list because theBureau had been unable to classify them as either "occupied,
vacant, or nonexistent." Id., at 188. Additionally, the

536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

481Cite as: 536 U. S. 452 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Bureau lacked household size information for approximately0.2% of addresses that were classified as occupied. See id.,

at 191.At this point, the Bureau employed the statistical technique known as "hot-deck imputation." For each unsuccess-fully enumerated address, the Bureau imputed population
data by copying corresponding data from a " `donor' " ad-dress.

Ante, at 458. The donor address was the " `geo-graphically closest neighbor of the same type (i. e., apartment or single-family dwelling) that did not return a censusquestionnaire' by mail." Ibid. (quoting Brief for Appellants
7-8, 11). What this means is that donor addresses were se-lected only from addresses that had been personally surveyed by the Bureau's enumerators, primarily through thenonresponse followup procedure described above. See App.
156. After imputation was completed, every address on themaster address list was associated with a household size
number that had been determined either by imputation or byenumeration (although that number was zero for addresses
ultimately classified as vacant or nonexistent).The Bureau used the imputation-adjusted data to calculate
state population totals. Ante, at 458. Because these totalswere used to determine the apportionment of congressional
Representatives, ibid., we must determine whether the Bu-reau's use of imputation constituted a form of sampling. If
it did, it was prohibited by $ 195 of the Census Act, 13 U. S. C.$ 1

et seq. See Department of Commerce v. United StatesHouse of Representatives, 525 U. S. 316, 338 (1999).

II
As initially enacted, $ 195 provided that "[e]xcept for thedetermination of population for apportionment purposes, the

Secretary [of Commerce] may, where he deems it appro-priate, authorize the use of the statistical method known as
`sampling' in carrying out the provisions of this title." 13U. S. C. $ 195 (1970 ed.). As relevant here, Congress re536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

placed "may, where he deems it appropriate" with "shall, ifhe considers it feasible" when it amended $ 195 in 1976.

Pub. L. 94-521, 90 Stat. 2464. In House of Representatives,we found that this amended language "might reasonably be
read as either permissive or prohibitive with regard to theuse of sampling for apportionment purposes." 525 U. S., at
339. Even so, we held that $ 195 maintained the prohibition
on sampling with respect to apportionment given the"broader context" of "over 200 years during which federal

statutes [had] prohibited the use of statistical samplingwhere apportionment [was] concerned."

Id., at 339-341.
With respect to $ 195, then, the only question is whether"hot-deck imputation" is a form of sampling.

To answer this question, I begin with the definition ofsampling the Bureau provided to Congress in connection
with the year 2000 census:

"In our common experience, `sampling' occurs whenever
the information on a portion of a population is used toinfer information on the population as a whole[,] . . .

[although] [a]mong professional statisticians, the term`sample' is reserved for instances when the selection of
the smaller population is based on the methodology oftheir science." Report to Congress--The Plan for Census 2000, p. 23 (revised and reissued Aug. 1997).
Under this definition, the Bureau's use of imputation was a
form of sampling. The Bureau used a predefined, determin-istic method to select a portion of the population and then

used that portion of the population to estimate unknown in-formation about the overall population. The Bureau's imputation process first selected a group of "donor" addresses,
one for each address that had not been successfully enumerated. This donor group was a subset of the overall population. Indeed, the donor group was actually a subset of a
subset of the population because it was selected from only
those addresses that had not returned an initial question536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

483Cite as: 536 U. S. 452 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
naire but were successfully enumerated through othermeans. This highlights the Bureau's reliance on a selected

portion of collected data.Next, the Bureau used the population of the donor group
as a direct estimate of the number of people who had notbeen successfully enumerated. This estimate related to the
"population as a whole" because it was an estimate of the
overall number of people in the population who had not re-sponded (or had not provided a consistent response, see

ante,
at 457) to the Bureau's survey efforts. See, e. g., F. Yates,Sampling Methods for Censuses and Surveys 64, 130 (2d rev.

ed. 1953) (describing the use of sampling to estimate survey
nonresponse); ante, at 471 (describing the sampling at issue
in House of Representatives as one for estimating nonresponse). Because the imputation process selected a portion
of the population to estimate the number of people who had
not been successfully enumerated, the process constituted a
form of sampling.

To counter this conclusion, the majority contends that the
Bureau's use of imputation differs from sampling in several
different ways. First, the majority argues that the Bureau's
use of imputation differs quantitatively from other forms of
sampling, suggesting that estimating nonresponse is not
sampling when the amount of nonresponse is very small.
See ante, at 471 (contrasting the use of sampling to estimate
a 10% level of nonresponse with the use of imputation to
estimate a 0.4% level of nonresponse). But the majority
provides no statistical basis to suggest that sampling is confined to "large" estimates. Moreover, we have already decided that the extent of the Bureau's reliance on sampling is
irrelevant when we held that $ 195 prohibits sampling for
apportionment purposes regardless of whether it is used as
a " `substitute' " for or " `supplement' " to a traditional enumeration. House of Representatives, supra, at 342.

Indeed, the majority more generally acknowledges that
the Bureau's reliance on imputation may be distinguishable

536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
484 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
only in degree from other forms of sampling. See ante, at471 (stating that the sampling at issue in

House of Representatives differs "in degree if not in kind" from the imputa-tion at issue here). But the majority provides no statistical

basis for claiming a difference of degree matters to the ques-tion of what constitutes sampling, nor does it explain how a
meaningful line between sampling and nonsampling could be
drawn on such a basis.Second, the majority contends that imputation is not sampling because the sample selection method used by the Bu-reau does not look like "typica[l],"

ante, at 467, selection
methods in terms of when or how the relevant sample is selected. With respect to when a sample is selected, the majority contends that imputation is not sampling because it
occurs after all data have been collected. See ante, at 466.
This presumes that one cannot sample from already-collected
data. But sampling from collected data is a recognized form
of sampling, even when the collected data result from an attempt to survey the entire population. See Yates, supra,
at 128.

With respect to how a sample is selected, the majority argues that imputation does not look like methods employed
"to find a subset that will resemble a whole through the
use of artificial, random selection processes." Ante, at 467.
But the Bureau's "nearest neighbor" imputation process is
just as artificial as any other form of nonrandom selection,
and it is beyond dispute that nonrandom selection methods--
including those that produce nonrepresentative samples--
may be used for sampling. See, e. g., W. Hendricks, Mathematical Theory of Sampling 239-241 (1956); P. Sukhatme,
Sampling Theory of Surveys with Applications 10 (1954);
F. Stephan, History of the Uses of Modern Sampling Procedures, 43 J. Am. Statistical Assn. 12, 21 (1948) (all indicating that nonrandom selection methods may be used for
sampling); see also Yates, supra, at 17; R. Jessen, Statistical
Survey Techniques 16 (1978); W. Deming, Sample Design in

536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

485Cite as: 536 U. S. 452 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
Business Research 32 (1960) (together indicating that theselection of nonrepresentative or "biased" samples may be

permissible, preferred, or even deliberate). Finally, even ifrandom and unbiased selection methods were assumed to
be more accurate than other methods of sampling, it wouldmake little sense to construe $ 195 as prohibiting only the
most accurate forms of sampling.

Third, the majority contends that imputation is not sam-pling because the Bureau never meant to engage in sampling.

Along these lines, the majority stresses that the Bureau's"overall approach to the counting problem,"

ante, at 466, did
not reflect a "deliberate decision," ante, at 471, to engage in
sampling. Instead, according to the majority, the Bureau's
"immediate objective was the filling in of missing data," in
an effort to ascertain population information on "individual"
units, not "extrapolating the characteristics of the `donor'
units to an entire population." Ante, at 467.

The majority provides no statistical basis for defining sampling in terms of intent or immediate objectives, however,
and to do so would allow the Bureau to engage in any form
of sampling so long as it was characterized as something else
or appeared to serve some nonsampling objective. But that
would render hollow the statutory prohibition on sampling
for apportionment purposes. The majority allows this to
happen, however, by focusing on the Bureau's "immediate
objective" of filling in missing data, which overlooks the fact
that the Bureau estimated nonresponse using a selected subset of the population and imputation was simply a means
to that end.

Fourth, the majority contends that some definitions of
sampling, if viewed broadly, contain no limiting principle and
thus might encompass even "the mental process of inference." Ante, at 470. But recognizing the Bureau's use of
imputation as a form of sampling does not require that sampling be read so broadly. Instead, sampling under $ 195 can
be confined to situations where a selected subset of the popu536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
486 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of O'Connor, J.
lation has been directly surveyed on a particular attributeand then that subset is used to estimate population characteristics of that same attribute. Such a limitation is neitherill defined nor all encompassing.

Apart from the above arguments, which primarily relateto the statistical characterization of imputation, the majority
makes several additional arguments. It contends that Congress' use of the term "sampling" should be read narrowly,limited to what "the Secretary called `sampling,' at the

time." Ante, at 469. But the statutory prohibition was notwritten in terms of what the Secretary viewed as sampling,
nor is there any reason to think Congress intended the term
"sampling" to be read narrowly as a tight restriction on the
Bureau's ability to gather data for nonapportionment purposes. Rather, the "purpose . . . [was] to permit the utilization of something less than a complete enumeration, as implied by the word `census,' . . . except with respect to
apportionment." H. R. Rep. No. 1043, 85th Cong., 1st Sess.,
10 (1957) (emphasis added). This suggests "sampling" was
meant in a broad rather than narrow sense.

Moreover, because the Bureau's authorization to use sampling for nonapportionment purposes was simultaneously a
prohibition on the use of sampling for apportionment purposes, it makes even less sense to construe "sampling" narrowly when viewed as a prohibition given the broader
historical context in which $ 195 marked "the first departure
from the requirement that the enumerators collect all census
information through personal visits to every household in
the Nation." House of Representatives, 525 U. S., at 336.
Finally, even if one were willing to assume that the statutory
prohibition should not be read to cover statistical techniques
the Bureau had used for apportionment purposes prior to
1957, that still would not justify the use of imputation since
the Bureau had never before added people to the apportionment count using that process. See Hogan |||| 39, 41, App.
266-268.

487Cite as: 536 U. S. 452 (2002)
Opinion of O'Connor, J.
The majority also notes the possibility of Chevron def-erence with respect to the scope of the term "sampling."

Ante, at 472 (citing Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U. S. 837, 842-845 (1984)).
But the majority ultimately does not rely on this form ofdeference,

ante, at 472, nor does it indicate where the Bureau
has provided an interpretation of $ 195 that would have the
"force of law" on this issue. See Christensen v. Harris
County, 529 U. S. 576, 587 (2000) (explaining that agency
"[i]nterpretations . . . which lack the force of law . . . do notwarrant

Chevron-style deference"). Additionally, based on
the reasons provided by Justice Thomas' partial dissent,
I would find that the Bureau's use of imputation to calculate
state population totals for apportionment purposes at least
raises a difficult constitutional question. This provides a
basis to construe $ 195 as precluding imputation, regardless
of whether the Bureau is entitled to any form of deference.
See Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 574-575 (1988).

The majority downplays the idea that imputation could be
used to manipulate census results, arguing that "manipulation would seem difficult to arrange" in light of the "uncertainties as to which States imputation might favor." Ante,
at 472. But in every census where imputation would alter

the resulting apportionment, the mere decision to impute or
not to impute is a source of possible manipulation. While
that might be averted if the Bureau were required to use
imputation, I do not read the majority's opinion to demand
that. Moreover, in the past, we have given deference to the
Secretary's decision not to statistically adjust the census,
even when a final decision on that matter was not made until
after the census was completed. See Wisconsin v. City of
New York, 517 U. S. 1, 10-11, 20-24 (1996).

Finally, the majority suggests that imputation is somehow
"better" than making no statistical adjustment at all. Ante,
at 470. But no party has cited a study suggesting that

536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
488 UTAH v. EVANS

Opinion of Thomas, J.
imputation improves distributive accuracy, and the Bureauadmits that numeric rather than distributive accuracy "drove

the process." Hogan || 34, App. 264; see also id., at |||| 34-35,App. 265 (acknowledging that it may be "impossible to know
a priori the effects of a particular census operation ondistributive accuracy" and that "[i]n designing Census 2000,
the Census Bureau did not reject operations that would im-prove numeric accuracy . . . even if these operations might
affect distributive accuracy negatively" (emphasis added)).I therefore would not assume that imputation necessarily resulted in a "better" census given the recognized importanceof distributive accuracy in assessing overall accuracy. See
Wisconsin, supra, at 20 (stating that "a preference for dis-tributive accuracy (even at the expense of some numerical
accuracy) would seem to follow from the constitutional pur-pose of the census, viz., to determine the apportionment of
the Representatives among the States").

III
Because the Bureau used "hot-deck imputation" to makethe same statistical inferences it could not make through

more transparent reliance on sampling, I would find that theBureau's use of imputation was a form of sampling and thus
was prohibited by $ 195. I therefore respectfully dissentfrom Part III of the majority's opinion and have no occasion
to decide whether the Constitution prohibits imputation,which the majority addresses in Part IV. For these reasons,
I would reverse the judgment of the District Court.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,concurring in part and dissenting in part.

Conducting a census to count over 200 million people is anenormously complicated and difficult undertaking. To facilitate the task, statisticians have created various methods tosupplement the door-to-door inquiries associated with the

of persons in each State" required by the Constitution.
Art. I, $ 2, cl. 3; Amdt. 14, $ 2. Today we consider whether
13 U. S. C. $ 195 prohibits the use of one of these methods--
hot-deck imputation--for apportionment purposes, and if
not, whether its use is permissible under the Constitution.
In accordance with our decision in Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788 (1992), I believe that we have jurisdiction
to consider these questions concerning the year 2000 census.
For essentially the same reasons given by the Court, I agree
that imputation is not prohibited by 13 U. S. C. $ 195.

I cannot agree, however, with the Court's resolution of the
constitutional question. The Constitution apportions power
among the States based on their respective populations; consequently, changes in population shift the balance of power
among them. Mindful of the importance of calculating the
population, the Framers chose their language with precision,
requiring an "actual Enumeration," U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2,
cl. 3. They opted for this language even though they were
well aware that estimation methods and inferences could be
used to calculate population. If the language of the Census
Clause leaves any room for doubt, the historical context, debates accompanying ratification, and subsequent early Census Acts confirm that the use of estimation techniques--such
as "hot-deck imputation," sampling, and the like--do not
comply with the Constitution.

I
The use of the statistical technique known as hot-deck
imputation increased the final year 2000 census count by
1,172,144 people, representing 0.42 percent of the Nation's
total population. U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Economics and
Statistics Admin., Census 2000 Informational Memorandum
No. 110, App. 443. Utilization of this method in the year
2000 census had important consequences for two States in
particular, North Carolina and Utah: North Carolina gained

Opinion of Thomas, J.
one Representative and Utah lost one Representative as aresult of hot-deck imputation. See ante, at 458.

While the Court has aptly described the process of "hot-deck imputation," several facts about this method are worth
noting at the outset. The Census Bureau refers to hot-deckimputation procedures as "estimation." U. S. Dept. of
Commerce, Decennial Statistical Studies Division, Census2000 Procedures and Operations, Memorandum Series Q-34
(hereinafter Memorandum Series), App. 153, 156. It usedthis form of "estimation" for three different categories of
units: (1) those units classified as occupied but with no popu-lation count (household size imputation), (2) those units that
are unclassified (either occupied or vacant) but that "weknow exist" (occupancy imputation), and (3) those units that
are unclassified and are "either occupied, vacant, or delete"(status imputation). Memorandum Series B-17,

id., at 194-195. The "status imputation" category is the most troubling, because, as explained by the Department of Com-merce, it refers to households "for which we know nothing,"
id., at 195, and therefore which may not even exist.The Census Bureau explains that "[f]or estimation purposes, six categories are defined" because each of the pre-ceding types of units are divided into two groups: single
unit addresses and multiunit addresses. Ibid. The Bureaucalls the six categories "estimation categories," and permits
only certain types of units for each category to be used as"donors."

Ibid. The Bureau then uses these donor units,for which data has already been obtained, to impute characteristics to a neighboring unit that falls within the abovecategories.

Whether this "estimation" technique passes constitutionalmuster depends on an evaluation of the language of the Census Clause and its original understanding.1

Commerce v. United States House of Representatives, 525 U. S. 316 (1999),

II
The Framers constitutionalized the requirement that a
census be conducted every decade. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 2,
cl. 3. In so doing, they chose their words with precision.
Chief Justice Marshall instructed that "[a]s men whose intentions require no concealment, generally employ the words
which most directly and aptly express the ideas they intend
to convey, the enlightened patriots who framed our constitution, and the people who adopted it, must be understood to
have employed words in their natural sense, and to have intended what they have said." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1,
188 (1824). We should be guided, therefore, by the Census
Clause's "original meaning, for `[t]he Constitution is a written instrument. As such its meaning does not alter. That
which it meant when adopted, it means now.' " McIntyre v.
Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334, 359 (1995) (Thomas,
J., concurring in judgment) (quoting South Carolina v.
United States, 199 U. S. 437, 448 (1905)).

Article I, $ 2, cl. 3, as modified by $ 2 of the Fourteenth
Amendment, provides: "Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each
State, excluding Indians not taxed." The Census Clause
specifies that this "actual Enumeration shall be made within
three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the
United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten

The Constitution describes the process both as "countingthe whole numbers of persons" and as an "actual Enumeration." Dictionary definitions contemporaneous with the rat-ification of the Constitution inform our understanding. "Actual" was defined at the time of the founding as "really done:In

Metaphysics, that is actual, or in act, which has a realbeing or existence, and is opposite to Potential." N. Bailey,

An Universal Etymological English Dictionary (26th ed.1789); see also T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the
English Language (6th ed. 1796) (defining "actual" as"[r]eally in act, not merely potential; in act, not purely in
speculation"). Sheridan defined "[e]numeration" as "[t]heact of numbering or counting over" and "[t]o enumerate" as
"to reckon up singly; to count over distinctly." See also 1S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language 658 (4th
rev. ed. 1773) (defining "enumerate" as "[t]o reckon up singly;to count over distinctly; to number"; and "enumeration" as
"[t]he act of numbering or counting over; number told out")."Count" was defined as "to number; to tell."

initions contemporaneous with the founding "demonstrate
that an `enumeration' requires an actual counting, and
not just an estimation of number." "The notion of counting
`singly,' `separately,' `number by number,' `distinctly,' which
runs through these definitions is incompatible (or at least
arguably incompatible, which is all that needs to be established) with gross statistical estimates." Id., at 347.4 Nor
can it be said that these definitions encompass estimates by
imputation.5

In addition, at the time of the founding, "conjecture" and
"estimation" were often contrasted with the actual enumeration that was to take place pursuant to the Census Clause.
During debate over the first Census Act, James Madison
made such a distinction, noting that the census would
provide an "exact number of every division" as compared to
"assertions and conjectures." 2 The Founders' Constitution
139 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987) (hereinafter Founders' Constitution). Similarly, when describing a document
containing the results of the first census, Thomas Jefferson noted the difference between the returns that were
"actual" and those that were added in red ink by "conjectur[e]." 8 The Writings of Thomas Jefferson 229 (A. Lipscomb ed. 1903). George Mason, at one point, observed that
he "doubted much whether the conjectural rule which was

a statutory provision so as to avoid serious constitutional doubt. See
House of Representatives, supra, at 346 (opinion concurring in part).

5 Moreover, while the Court states that the Constitution "uses a general

word, `enumeration,' that refers to a counting process without describing
the count's methodological details," ante, at 474, the meaning of "enumeration" has not materially changed since the time of the founding. To "enumerate" is now defined as "to ascertain the number of: count," and also
"to specify one after another: list." See Webster's Ninth New Collegiate
Dictionary 416 (1988). "Enumeration" meant at the time of the founding,
as it does now, to count individually and specifically and simply does not
admit of various counting methodologies.

to precede the census, would be as just, as it would be rendered by an actual census." Founders' Constitution 108.6

Historians and commentators after the founding also distinguished actual enumerations from conjectures, demonstrating that there was a common understanding of these
terms. For instance, an 1835 book about statistics in the
United States explains that "[t]he number of inhabitants in
this country, prior to its separation from Great Britain, rests
principally on conjectural estimates." T. Pitkin, A Statistical View of the Commerce of the United States of America
582 (hereinafter Pitkin); see also Brief for Appellants 40-41.
Prior to the revolution, when the British Board of Trade
called upon the Governors to provide an account of their populations, some Colonies made "actual enumerations," such as
Connecticut in 1756 and in 1774, while others made estimates
"founded upon the number of taxable polls, or the number of
the militia." Pitkin 582-583. A widely cited 1800 article
published in England by John Rickman after the first United
States census also used the term "actual enumeration" several times to describe the count that "must always be under
the real number," noting at the same time that this "method
(fraught with trouble and expence) attempts an accuracy not
necessary, or indeed attainable, in a fluctuating subject."
John Rickman's Article on the Desirability of Taking A Census, reprinted in D. Glass, Numbering the People 111 (1973)
(hereinafter Glass). See also Brief for Appellants 47. Discussion of an "actual enumeration" can be contrasted to his
subsequent proposal for England, which included estimation
methods resembling both sampling and imputation since
Rickman deemed it appropriate to make "general inferences"

6 By "conjectural rule," we can presume that he meant to refer to the
population estimates used by the Constitutional Convention to determine
the number of Representatives of Congress from each State prior to the
first census. See H. Alterman, Counting People: The Census in History
188 (1969) (hereinafter Alterman).

from modern registers to make up for deficient registers.
Glass 111-112.

To be sure, the Census Clause enables Congress to prescribe the "Manner" in which the enumeration is taken.
The Court suggests that "enumeration" implies the breadth
of Congress' methodological authority, rather than its constraints. See ante, at 474. But while Congress may dictate
the manner in which the census is conducted,7 it does not
have unbridled discretion. For the purposes of apportionment, it must follow the Constitution's command of an "actual Enumeration." Madison made this point clear during
debate of the first Census Act when he noted the difficulties
"attendant on the taking the census, in the way required
by the constitution, and which we are obliged to perform."
Founders' Constitution 139.

The Court also places undue weight on the penultimate
version of the Clause, the iteration that was given to the
Committee of Detail and Committee of Style. See ante, at
474-475. Whatever may be said of the earlier version, the
Court rejected a similar reliance in Nixon v. United States,
506 U. S. 224, 231 (1993), because "we must presume that the
Committee's reorganization or rephrasing accurately captured what the Framers meant in their unadorned lan7 As described infra, at 503-504, Congress has implemented this power
in a variety of ways, such as by authorizing marshals to "cause the number
of the inhabitants to be taken" and to appoint as many assistants as necessary, establishing the timeframe within which the census is to be completed, and setting methods of payment for assistants. Act of Mar. 1,

years, the Bureau through its delegated power has adopted a number of
measures to reduce error, including "an extensive advertising campaign,
a more easily completed census questionnaire, and increased use of automation, which among other things facilitated the development of accurate

draft would govern in every instance where the Committeeof Style added an arguably substantive word. Such a result
is at odds with the fact that the Convention passed the Com-mittee's version, and with the well-established rule that the
plain language of the enacted text is the best indicator ofintent."

Id., at 231-232. Rather than rely on the draft,I focus on the words of the adopted Constitution.

The original understanding can be discerned not only byexamining the text but also by considering the "meaning and

intention of the convention which framed and proposed it foradoption and ratification to the conventions of the people of
and in the several states." Rhode Island v. Massachusetts,12 Pet. 657, 721 (1838). The history of census taking in the
Colonies and elsewhere, discussions surrounding the ratifi-cation of the Census Clause, and the early statutes implementing the Clause provide insight into its meaning.

A
Census taking is an age-old practice. With only a few ex-ceptions, however, before the 19th century most countries

conducted partial enumerations that were supplemented byestimates of the unenumerated portion of the population.
Wolfe, Population Censuses Before 1790, 27 J. Am. StatisticalAssn. 357 (1932) (hereinafter Wolfe). The contentious history of censuses, partial or otherwise, has long influenceddecisions about whether to undertake them. See

id., at 358("The Biblical account of the Lord's wrath at the taking of

is a history rampant with manipulation for political and fiscal gains. See generally id., at 359-370; Alterman 43, 54;
Glass 19-20.

At times, political resistance to censuses precluded their
taking. Suspicion of government and opposition on religious grounds, for example, prevented a general census in
France during the 18th century. Wolfe 367; see also Alterman 49. And in England, while "estimates and conjectures"
as to changes in the population were frequently made in the
18th century, a 1753 proposal to provide for a general enumeration was rejected by Parliament, because it was
thought that a census might reveal England's "weakness to
her enemies," and that it might be followed by "some public
misfortune or epidemical distemper." Wolfe 368 (internal
quotation marks omitted).9

England was in part responsible for the first colonial censuses, as the British Board of Trade required population
counts so that it could properly administer the Colonies. D.
Halacy, Census: 190 Years of Counting America 29 (1980)
(hereinafter Halacy). The Colonies had their own encounters with various population counting methods. Prior to
1790, there were at least 38 population counts taken in the
Colonies. See Alterman 165. According to one historian,
however, there was "reason to suspect, [that the censuses
were] often intentionally misleading, when officials, on the
one hand of the boastful, or on the other hand of the timid
type, thought to serve some interest by exaggeration or by
understatement." F. Dexter, Estimates of Population in the

n. 24 (1982) (hereinafter Cohen). Some colonial governors apparently
blamed their inability to administer censuses on this fear, although it is
unclear to what extent this actually reflected public sentiment. Ibid.

9 The 1753 bill contemplated by the British Parliament received a great

deal of publicity and attention. Glass 17. The proposal provided that
overseers would "go from house to house in their parishes, recording the
numbers of persons actually dwelling in each house during the twelve
preceeding hours." Id., at 18.

Many Americans resisted census-taking efforts. Accord-ing to an 1887 inventory of the Colonies' attempts at population estimates, "Connecticut pursued in her colonial historythe policy of hiding her strength in quietness; so far as might
not be inconsistent with general truthfulness, she preferred
to make no exhibit of her actual condition." Id., at 31.10 A1712 census in New York "met with so much opposition, from

superstitious fear of its breeding sickness, that only partialreturns were obtained."

Id., at 34 (citations omitted). See
also Century 3. In New Jersey, the population counts ofthe mid-18th century apparently comprised "such guesses

as the Royal Governors could make, for the satisfaction oftheir superiors." Dexter 36. In 1766, Benjamin Franklin
"supposed that there might be about 160,000 whites inPennsylvania . . . but he did not profess to speak with accuracy, and was under a bias which led him, perhaps unconsciously, into cautious understatement." Id., at 38. Georgia was apparently "singularly misrepresented, being
overestimated in the Federal Convention of 1787 at nearly
half as much again as her real amount of population, while
the rest of the colonies were underestimated considerably,--
the total of the Convention's figures falling short of the reality by more than half a million." Id., at 49.

The Framers also had experience with various statistical
techniques. For example, Thomas Jefferson, who as Secretary of State would later be charged with running the first
official national census, had a great interest in mathematics

disadvantage").

and numbers. See Halacy 33; Cohen 112-113. In 1782, Jef-ferson estimated Virginia's population and his calculation exhibited an awareness that statistical estimation techniquescould be used to calculate population. Virginia had been unable to manage a full census for the Continental Congress;eight counties had failed to turn in any census data. J.
Cassedy, Demography in Early America: Beginnings of

the Statistical Mind, 1600-1800, p. 228 (1969) (hereinafterCassedy). Jefferson had to extrapolate from incomplete tax

returns, militia muster rolls, and other data. Nonetheless,he produced an estimate of 567,614.

Ibid. First, he listed
certain known facts, including data about Virginia's population in all but eight counties. In the eight counties for which
information was not available, he knew that there had been
3,161 men in the militia in 1779 and 1780. He then listed
five assumptions, such as "[t]he number of people under 16
years of age was equal to the number 16 years and over," on
which he based his final estimate. Alterman 168-169.

Another elaborate effort at population calculation was
undertaken by the Governor of Massachusetts in 1763, who
estimated his Colony's population in three ways. First, he
made an estimate from a return to the General Court of
" `rateable polls' " of males over 16 eligible to vote. He
added an estimate of males who were too poor to pay the
poll tax, and then added similar numbers of females. He
made another estimate by multiplying the militia returns by
four. He calculated a third estimate from the number of
houses. Since many believed that houses averaged five occupants and others "preferred five and a half," he used both
numbers. After giving the British Board of Trade several
numbers, however, he concluded that the "actual population
was none of these figures" and the population was in fact
higher. Cassedy 73. In any event, "[s]ince all of the returns used in the estimates had been made for tax purposes,
it was understood that they would be well on the low side."

Opinion of Thomas, J.
The Framers were quite familiar not only with variouscensus-taking methods but also with impediments to their

successful completion. The Continental Congress had al-ready used population estimates to make decisions about taxation, and such efforts were met with resistance. In 1775,the Continental Congress had ascertained population estimates for the Colonies in order to apportion the taxes andcosts of the Revolutionary War. Pitkin 583. See also
Halacy 30-31 ("Debts incurred in the Revolutionary Warhastened the ordering of a standard form of census. A census of the colonies had been ordered, but some of them nevercomplied, and the rest did so in different ways"). New
Hampshire in particular complained that the estimate of itspopulation for the purposes of calculating Revolutionary War
costs was too high. Pitkin 583. It had "caused an actualenumeration to be . . . made, by which it appeared, that the
number of her inhabitants" was 20,000 lower than the es-timate.

Ibid. See also Brief for Appellants 47. NewHampshire petitioned the Continental Congress to change

the amount of taxation. New Hampshire's effort was invain, because Congress "refused to alter her proportion of
her taxes on that account." Ibid. See also 10 New Hamp-shire Provincial and State Papers 580 (reprint 1973) ("[T]he
[proportion of taxes assigned New Hampshire by Congressin 1781] is too high by a very considerable sum, that by our
numbers which were taken in the year 1775 by the selectmenof the several Towns & Parishes & Return made under
Oath . . . this proportion will appear much too large").

B
The Framers knew that the calculation of populationscould be and often were skewed for political or financial purposes. Debate about apportionment and the census conse-quently focused for the most part on creating a standard that
would limit political chicanery. While the Framers didnot extensively discuss the method of census-taking, many

Opinion of Thomas, J.
expressed the desire to bind or "shackle" the legislature sothat neither future Congresses nor the States would be able

to let their biases influence the manner of apportionment.See Founders' Constitution 103-104. As James Madison
explained:

"In one respect, the establishment of a common measure
for representation and taxation will have a very salu-tary effect. As the accuracy of the census to be obtained by the Congress will necessarily depend, in aconsiderable degree, on the disposition, if not on the cooperation of the States, it is of great importance thatthe States should feel as little bias as possible to swell
or to reduce the amount of their numbers. Were their
share of representation alone to be governed by thisrule, they would have an interest in exaggerating their

inhabitants. Were the rule to decide their share of tax-ation alone, a contrary temptation would prevail. By
extending the rule to both objects, the States will haveopposite interests which will control and balance each
other and produce the requisite impartiality." The Fed-eralist No. 54, pp. 340-341 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).

Alexander Hamilton likewise noted, in a discussion about theproportion of taxes that "[a]n actual census or enumeration
of the people must furnish the rule, a circumstance whicheffectually shuts the door to partiality or oppression."

Id.,
No. 36, at 220.Discussion revealed a keen awareness that absent some

fixed standard, the numbers were bound to be subject to po-litical manipulation. While Gouverneor Morris appears to
have been one of the strongest opponents of "fettering the
Legislature too much," he at least recognized that if the
mode for taking the census was "unfixt the Legislature may
use such a mode as will defeat the object: and perpetuate
the inequality." Founders' Constitution 102. He believed,
however, that "[i]f we can't agree on a rule that will be just

at this time, how can we expect to find one that will be justin all times to come."

Id., at 104. Edmund Randolph, on
the other hand, noted that if dangers suggested by Gouver-neor Morris were "real, of advantage being taken of the Legislature in pressing moments, it was an additional reason, fortying their hands in such a manner that they could not sacrifice their trust to momentary considerations." Id., at 103.

During debate of a proposal "to take a periodical census,"George Mason noted that he "did not object to the conjectural ratio which was to prevail in the outset" for apportion-ment, prior to the census, but "considered a Revision from
time to time according to some permanent & precise standard as essential to . . . fair representation." Id., at 102-103.
"From the nature of man," Mason observed, "we may be
sure, that those who have power in their hands will not give
it up while they can retain it. On the Contrary we know
they will always when they can rather increase it." Id.,
at 103.

Some who initially believed that the Congress should have
discretion changed their minds after listening to the arguments by Randolph, Mason, and others. Roger Sherman,
for example, "was at first for leaving the matter wholly to
the discretion of the Legislature; but he had been convinced
by the observations of (Mr. Randolph & Mr. Mason) that the
periods & the rule of revising the Representation ought
to be fixt by the Constitution." Id., at 104. Nathaniel
Ghorum perceptively noted that "[i]f the Convention who are
comparatively so little biassed by local views are so much
perplexed, How can it be expected that the Legislature hereafter under the full biass of those views, will be able to settle
a standard." Ibid. On the other hand, Reid continued to
believe that "the Legislature ought not to be too much shackled." Ibid. He also thought that "[it] would make the Constitution like Religious Creeds, embarrassing to those bound
to conform to them & more likely to produce dissatisfaction
and Scism, than harmony and union." Ibid.

While debate continued, with various iterations of theClause considered, it was clear that the principle concern was

that the Constitution establish a standard resistant to manip-ulation. As Justice Story later observed, "apportion[ing]
representatives among the states according to their relativenumbers . . . had the recommendation of great simplicity and
uniformity in its operation, of being generally acceptable tothe people, and of being less liable to fraud and evasion, than
any other, which could be devised." Commentaries on theConstitution of the United States $ 327, p. 238 (R. Rotunda &
J. Nowak eds. 1987). C

We have long relied on contemporaneous constructions ofthe Constitution when interpreting its provisions, for "early
congressional enactments `provid[e] "contemporaneous andweighty evidence" of the Constitution's meaning.' "

From the first census, Congress directed that the censusbe taken by actually counting the people.

House of Repre-sentatives, 525 U. S., at 335. Congress enacted a series of

requirements for how to accomplish the counting; none men-tion the use of sampling or any other statistical technique or
method of estimation. Rather, the first Census Act de-scribed, among other things, how many census takers (or
deputies) could be used, their pay, the consequences of falsi-fying papers, what address to attribute to persons who had

more than one address, and how to count those who did nothave an address. Congress ordered the first census to begin

on August 2, 1790, and to be completed within nine months.Century 45. Marshals and their assistants were required to
"take an oath or affirmation" to " `truly cause to be made, ajust and perfect enumeration and description of all persons
resident within [their] district[s].' " Act of Mar. 1, 1790, $ 1,
reprinted in Wright 925.The Act required marshals to aggregate the numbers, but

there was no provision allowing the marshals to estimate orextrapolate in order to fill in missing data. The Act provided that the "assistants" could, for a particular family, use
data given by one member of that family. But the information could be taken only from persons over age 16, and these
persons were required to give the assistant "a true account."

$ 6, id., at 926. No other method of counting appears to have
been permissible. And failure to make a return or falsifying
a return triggered heavy monetary penalties and the threat
of prosecution. $$ 2, 3, ibid. In 1810, Congress added an
express statement that " `the said enumeration shall be made
by an actual inquiry at every dwelling-house, or of the head
of every family within each district, and not otherwise.' "
House of Representatives, supra, at 335 (citing Act of Mar.
26, 1810, $ 1, 2 Stat. 565-566). The provision requiring census takers to visit personally each home appeared in statutes
governing the next 14 censuses. See 525 U. S., at 335-336,
and n. 5 (surveying Census Acts).

There was widespread awareness that the early censuses
were not entirely accurate. The enumerators confronted
many problems, including confusion regarding which houses
belonged to which districts, danger on the roads, the unwillingness of citizens to give the required information, superstition, and a fear from some that the census was connected to
taxation. Century 45-46. For example, in a 1791 letter
from George Washington to Gouverneor Morris dated before
the first census was complete, Washington noted the differ536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Thomas, J.
ence between the "enumeration" and an estimate he had pre-viously given, and acknowledged that the official census

would not be accurate:

"In one of my letters to you the account which I gave ofthe number of inhabitants which would probably be

found in the United States on enumeration, was toolarge. The estimate was then founded on the ideas held
out by the Gentlemen in Congress of the population oftheir several States, each of whom (as was very natural)
looking thro' a magnifying glass would speak of thegreatest extent, to which there was any probability of
their numbers reaching. Returns of the Census havealready been made from several of the States and a tolerably just estimate has been formed now in others, bywhich it appears that we shall hardly reach four millions;
but one thing is certain our real numbers will exceed,greatly, the official returns of them." 31 Writings of
George Washington 329 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1931).
Apparently concerned about the effect that the results ofthe first census would have on foreign opinion, Jefferson, in

a 1791 letter sending the results abroad, explained: "I encloseyou a copy of our census, which, so far as it is written in

won independence, as well as to the unrealistic estimates of the colonial

no suggestion, however, that his additional "conjectures"were used for apportionment. See T. Woolsey, The First

Century of the Republic 221 (1876); Alterman 205. "Despiteits deficiencies, the census provided the factual base about
the American people which officials and scholars needed."Cassedy 220. Thus, while the Court asserts that there was
a "strong constitutional interest in accuracy," ante, at 478,the stronger suggestion is that the Framers placed a higher
value on preventing political manipulation.

IV
The text, history, and a review of the original understand-ing of the Census Clause confirm that an actual enumeration

means an actual count, without estimation. While more so-phisticated statistical techniques may be available today than
at the time of the founding, the Framers had a great deal offamiliarity with alternative methods of calculating population. They decided to constitutionalize the arduous task ofan actual enumeration. I am persuaded that much like the
earlier methods of estimation, hot-deck imputation--a mod-ern statistical technique that the Census Bureau refers to as
"estimation"--is not constitutionally permissible.In recent decades, decisions regarding whether, and what
kind of, imputation and other statistical methods should beutilized have changed from administration to administration.
Departing from past practice, imputation was first used inthe year 1960 census. The Bureau has used some form of it
in every decennial census since then. Plaintiffs' Statementof Undisputed Facts, App. 44; Response to Plaintiffs' Statement of Material Facts, id., at 222. In the year 1970 census,about 900,000 persons were imputed to the apportionment
count through household size and occupancy imputation.The Census Bureau also used a form of estimation that combined imputation and sampling. Declaration of HowardHogan,

id., at 268-269 (hereinafter Hogan). In 1980, the useof imputation shifted one seat in the House of Representa536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tives from Indiana to Florida, id., at 46, 224, making the year2000 census at least the second time that its use has

changed apportionment.12At the earliest, status imputation was used in the year
1990 census, although there is some dispute as to whether itwas even used then. Id., at 45-46, n. 4; but see id., at
223 (stating that "the 1990 imputation procedures contin-ued the prior practice of using household size imputation and
occupancy imputation but added status imputation"). Re-gardless, it apparently had no impact on apportionment.
See id., at 45-46, n. 4. In the year 1990 census, the Secre-tary specifically decided against using a different form of estimation. The "Secretary's administrative decision declin-ing to make an adjustment observed that `[t]he imputation
scheme used . . . [was] based on a series of assumptions thatare mostly guesswork.' " Brief for Federal Petitioners in
Wisconsin v. City of New York, O. T. 1995, Nos. 94-1614 etc.,p. 8. The Secretary even noted that "large-scale statistical
adjustment of the census through [this method] would `aban-don a two hundred year tradition of how we actually count
people,' " and that "statistical adjustment of the 1990 censusmight open the door to political tampering in the future."
Wisconsin v. City of New York, 517 U. S. 1, 10-12 (1996).Though different in kind, our recent history of experimentation with census-taking methods bears similarity to thevarious preratification estimates and enumerations. While
I would not speculate about the Bureau's decisionmakingprocess, it is quite evident that the Framers, aware that the
use of any estimation left the door open to political abuse,adopted the words "actual Enumeration" to preclude the
availability of methods that permit political manipulation.Additionally, hot-deck imputation is properly understood
as an estimation, which by definition cannot be an actual

whether count imputation affected apportionment in the 1960 or the 1970
Censuses." App. 224.

counting of persons. The Court contends that imputationdoes not differ in principle from other traditional methods of

counting, such as questioning of " `neighbors, landlords,postal workers, or other proxies' " about the number of
inhabitants in a particular place. Ante, at 477. But thatpoint is flawed in several important respects. To begin
with, from the first census, such information was taken
through an actual inquiry of a family member who was overthe age of 16. Act of Mar. 1, 1790, $ 6, reprinted in Wright

926. That household member was "obliged to render to suchassistant of the division, a true account, if required, to the
best of his or her knowledge, of all and every person belong-ing to such family respectively . . . on pain of forfeiting
twenty dollars, to be sued for and recovered by such assist-ant."

Ibid. Estimation was not allowed and family members who were caught providing false information were sub-ject to fines.

Questioning neighbors was not permitted until 1880 andeven then census data could only be based on information
provided by those "living nearest to such place of abode."
Act of Mar. 3, 1879, $ 8, id., at 937. Again, family membersor agents of families were required by law "to render a true

account" and those who "willfully fail[ed] or refuse[d]" were
"guilty of a misdemeanor" and required to "pay a sum not
exceeding one hundred dollars." $ 14, id., at 938. That
process is far different from a computation where data about
one "donor" house, that appears on "Census Burea[u] records," Hogan, App. 255, compiled far away from the actual
residence, is used to estimate data about another. With
"status imputation," for example, the Census Bureau is willing to impute data even though it categorizes these households as "Donees" "for which we know nothing." Memorandum Series B-17, id., at 195. While subsequent Acts may
permit other forms of proxy, they do not assist with our analysis of the original understanding. Nor are we called upon
to judge their constitutionality here. Because hot-deck imputation is an estimation procedure that includes persons not

Opinion of Thomas, J.
"actually" counted, its use to adjust the census for apportionment purposes runs afoul of the Constitution.

The Court's further reflection that "the Bureau's only
choice is to disregard the information it has, using a figure
of zero, or to use imputation in an effort to achieve greater
accuracy," ante, at 478, makes no difference as to whether it
is constitutionally permissible. Even if hot-deck imputation
produces more accurate results (and we do not have the
means to answer that question), the Framers well understood that some Americans would go uncounted. Accuracy
is not the dispositive factor in the constitutional consideration. Despite their awareness that estimation techniques
could be used to supplement data, the Framers chose instead
to require an "actual Enumeration" or "counting of whole
persons." Disappointment following the first census did not
prompt a change in this view or in the text. A zero must
remain a zero under the dictates of the Constitution.

The Court takes the position that "enumeration" may be
incompatible with gross statistical estimates, but concludes
that such gross estimates are not at stake here. See ante,
at 476. I derive little comfort from the fact that the Court
has drawn a constitutional line at " `gross statistical estimates.' " Ibid. The Court neglects to explain the boundaries of such gross estimates, begging the question of how
"gross" must "gross" be? The Court nonchalantly comments that the Census Bureau used the method "sparingly,"
see ante, at 477, and that the "inference involves a tiny percent of the population," ante, at 479. But the consequences
are far from trivial. One State's representation in Congress
is reduced while another's is fortified. If the use of hot-deck
imputation in the next Census shifts the balance of power in
"only" two or three seats, will the Court continue to defend
the method? Today, we deal with hot-deck imputation.
But if history is our guide, surely other statistical methods
will be employed in future censuses and there will be similar
challenges. By accepting one method of estimation as con536US1 Unit: $U74 [01-14-04 18:32:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
stitutionally permissible, the Court has opened the door, andwe will be continually called to judge whether one form of

estimation is more acceptable than another.13

* * *
After much debate and faced with a long history of politi-cal manipulation, the Framers decided to make the taking

of an "actual Enumeration" a constitutional requirement.While other nations had attempted population counts, none
had made the count itself an important method of main-taining democracy by mandating it through a founding
document. As a leading French statistician noted: "TheUnited States presents in its history a phenomenon that has
no parallel--that of a people who initiated the statistics oftheir country on the very day that they formed their government, and who regulated, in the same instrument, thecensus of their citizens, their civil and political rights,
and the destiny of their people." Alterman 164. Well fa-miliar with methods of estimation, the Framers chose to
make an "actual Enumeration" part of our constitutionalstructure. Today, the Court undermines their decision,
leaving the basis of our representative government vulnera-ble to political manipulation.

For the reasons stated above, I respectfully dissent fromPart IV of the Court's opinion and would reverse the judgment of the District Court.

case--I disagree with the Court's holding that appellantshave standing under Article III of the Constitution to bring

this suit.As the Court acknowledges, in order to establish standing,
appellants must show that the federal courts "have thepower to redress the injury that the [federal appellees] allegedly caused [them]." Ante, at 459 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Yet the Court does not dispute that, even if appel-lants were to succeed in their challenge and a court were to

order the Secretary of Commerce to recalculate the final cen-sus, their injury would

not be redressed "unless the President accepts the new numbers, changes his calculations accordingly, and issues a new reapportionment statement to
Congress . . . ." Franklin, supra, at 824. That fact is fatal
to appellants' standing because appellants have not sued the
President to force him to take these steps--and could not
successfully do so even if they tried, since "no court has authority to direct the President to take an official act," 505
U. S., at 826. As the Court acknowledged in Franklin, the
President enjoys the discretion to refuse to issue a new reapportionment statement to Congress: "[H]e is not . . . required
to adhere to the policy decisions reflected in the Secretary's
report." Id., at 799; see also id., at 800. It displays gross
disrespect to the President to assume that he will obediently
follow the advice of his subordinates--in this case, a new
report by his Secretary, recommending that he alter his
prior determination. Id., at 824-825 (Scalia, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment). Thus, because appellants' "standing depends on the unfettered choices made by
independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise
of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume
either to control or to predict," Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 562 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted), standing in this case does not exist.

The case for appellants' standing is even weaker than I
described it in Franklin. Redress of their alleged injuries

Scalia, J., dissenting
depends not only on a particular exercise of the President's
discretion, but also on the exercise of the unbridled discretion of a majority of 435 Representatives and 100 Senators (or two-thirds if the President does not agree), whom
federal courts are equally powerless to order to take official
acts.

Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that
"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several
States according to their respective numbers, counting the
whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians
not taxed." Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that "[t]he Congress shall have power to enforce, by
appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." Pursuant to that authorization, Congress has provided that, once
the President transmits to Congress the decennial reapportionment statement that the statute requires, 46 Stat. 26, 2
U. S. C. $ 2a(a), "[e]ach State shall be entitled, . . . until the
taking effect of a reapportionment under this section or subsequent statute, to the number of Representatives shown in
[that] statement," $ 2a(b). Thus, the law provides only two
means by which Utah's entitlement can be altered: "the taking effect of a reapportionment under this section or subsequent statute." Ibid. The first means refers to the next
decennial census; 1 the second to a new law enacted in the
interim. Thus, even if the President wanted to transfer one
congressional seat from North Carolina to Utah, he could
not do so before 2011 unless Congress enacted a new law
authorizing such a reapportionment.

1 It cannot be deemed to refer to reapportionment under the new Presidential statement that appellants seek, because "reapportionment under
this section" pursuant to the 2000 census has already occurred. The
Presidential statement effecting "reapportionment under this section"
must be transmitted "[o]n the first day, or within one week thereafter, of
the first regular session" of the first Congress after the census, $ 2a(a)--a
deadline met by the President's statement under challenge here, but now
long since passed.

Scalia, J., dissenting
The Court no doubt realizes that it is not even conceivablethat appellants could have standing if redress of their injuries hinged on action by Congress; accordingly, it is drivento assert that the law does not mean what it says. The statute, the Court argues, "do[es] not expressly say" what is tooccur when the numbers the Secretary reported to the President are flawed; accordingly, because it "makes good sense"
to do so, the Court reads into the statute a third means bywhich the reapportionment can be altered: judicially decreed

"mechanical revision" of "a clerical, a mathematical, or acalculation error" in the Secretary's report.

Ante, at 462.
This is an astonishing exercise of raw judicial power. The
statute says very clearly what is to occur when anything
(including a clerical, mathematical, or calculation error in the
Secretary's report) renders the completed apportionment
worthy of revision: nothing at all, unless Congress deems it
worthy of revision and enacts a new law making or authorizing the revision that Congress thinks appropriate. There
was no reason for the statute to list "expressly" the infinite
number of circumstances in which the reapportionment could
not be altered by other means, because it expressly said that
the States' "entitle[ment]" to the number of Representatives
shown in the presidential statement could be altered only
by the two prescribed means. There is simply no other way
to read the governing text: that the States "shall be entitled"
to the reapportionment set forth in the President's statement
"until" one of two events occurs, undeniably means that unless one of those two events occurs the States remain "entitled" to the reapportionment. What a wild principle of interpretation the Court today embraces: When a statute says
that an act can be done only by means x or y, it can also
be done by other means that "make good sense" under the
circumstances, unless all the circumstances in which it cannot be done have been listed.

I would not subscribe to application of this deformed new
canon of construction even if there were something about

"clerical error" that made it uniquely insusceptible of correc-tion by the means set forth in the statute. But there is not.

Indeed, what more plausible and predictable occasion forcongressional revision could there be than the demonstration
of an error in the reported census count? By taking theresponsibility for determining and remedying that error
away from Congress, where the statute has placed it, andgrasping it with its own hands, the Court commits a flagrant
violation of the separation of powers.The Court can find no excuse in our precedents for today's
holding. It relies on three of our cases in which it says we"found standing in similar circumstances,"

ante, at 464.They are similar as day and night are similar. Two of them,

Federal Election Comm'n v. Akins, 524 U. S. 11 (1998), andMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority v. Citizens
for Abatement of Aircraft Noise, Inc., 501 U. S. 252 (1991),are inapposite because redress of the plaintiffs' injuries did
not require action by an independent third party that wasnot (and could not be) brought to answer before a federal
court, much less by a third party for whom (as for the Presi-dent) it would be disrespectful for us to presume a course of
action, and much, much less in violation of the explicit textof a statute.

2 Although in the third case, Bennett v. Spear,

520 U. S. 154 (1997), we found standing to challenge the ac-tion of one agency (Fish and Wildlife Service) despite the

fact that redress ultimately depended upon action by anotheragency (Bureau of Reclamation) not before the Court, we
made it quite clear that we came to this conclusion only be-cause in the matter at issue the one agency had the power
to coerce action by the other: "[I]t does not suffice," we said,"if the injury complained of is the result of the independent
action of some third party not before the court." Id., at 169

2 Moreover, in Metropolitan Washington there was no doubt that, if a
court enjoined the challenged action, the injuries it allegedly caused would
be redressed automatically by operation of law. See 501 U. S., at 265
(citing 49 U. S. C. App. $ 2456(h)).

(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). We foundthat, "while the [Service] theoretically serves an advisory

function, in reality it has a powerful coercive effect on theaction agency." Ibid. (internal quotation marks and citation
omitted). In this case, by contrast, we simply cannot say--both because it is not true and because it displays gross disrespect to do so--that the action of the President is "co-erced" by the Secretary. Not to mention, once again, the
statute that explicitly leaves this question to Congress.For these reasons, I would vacate the judgment of the District Court and remand with instructions to dismiss for wantof jurisdiction.

RELATIONS BOARD et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 01-518. Argued April 16, 2002--Decided June 24, 2002
Petitioner, who had a contract to modernize a steel mill, and the mill

owner filed a federal lawsuit against respondent unions, claiming that
the unions had engaged in lobbying, litigation, and other concerted activities in order to delay the project because petitioner had nonunion
employees. Ultimately, petitioner lost on or withdrew each of its
claims. In the meantime, two unions lodged complaints against petitioner with respondent National Labor Relations Board (Board). After
the federal court proceedings ended, the Board's general counsel issued
an administrative complaint, alleging that petitioner, by filing and
maintaining its lawsuit, had violated $ 8(a)(1) of the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA), which prohibits employers from restraining,
coercing, or interfering with employees' exercise of rights related to
self-organization, collective bargaining, and other concerted activities.
29 U. S. C. $$ 157, 158(a)(1). The Board ruled in the general counsel's
favor, finding that the lawsuit was unmeritorious because its claims
were dismissed or voluntarily withdrawn with prejudice, and that it was
filed to retaliate against the unions, whose conduct was protected under
the NLRA. It ordered petitioner to cease and desist from prosecuting
such suits, to post notice to its employees acknowledging the Board's
finding and promising not to pursue such litigation in the future, and to
pay the unions' legal fees and expenses incurred in the lawsuit. The
Sixth Circuit granted the Board's enforcement petition. Relying on
Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 747, it held
that because the Judiciary had already found petitioner's claims against
the unions unmeritorious or dismissed, evidence of a simple retaliatory
motive sufficed to adjudge petitioner of committing an unfair labor practice. It also rejected petitioner's argument that under Professional
Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508
U. S. 49, only baseless or sham suits can restrict the otherwise unfettered right to seek court resolution of differences, finding that case inapplicable because its immunity standard was established in the antitrust
context.

Held: The Board's standard for imposing liability is invalid. Pp. 524-537.

(a) The right to petition is one of the most precious liberties safeguarded by the Bill of Rights. This Court has considered that right
when interpreting federal law, recognizing in the antitrust context, for
example, that genuine petitioning is immune from liability, but sham
petitioning is not. The two-part definition adopted in Professional
Real Estate Investors requires that sham antitrust litigation must be
objectively baseless such that no reasonable litigant could realistically
expect success on the merits, and that the litigant's subjective motivation must conceal an attempt to interfere directly with a competitor's
business relationship through the use of the governmental process as an
anticompetitive weapon. 508 U. S., at 60-61. This suit raises the same
underlying issue of when litigation may be found to violate federal law,
but with respect to the NLRA. Recognizing the connection, the Court
has previously decided that the Board can enjoin lawsuits by analogizing
to the antitrust context, holding that the Board could enjoin ongoing
baseless suits brought with a retaliatory motive. Here, however, the
issue is the standard for declaring completed suits unlawful. In Bill
Johnson's, the Court addressed that issue in dicta, noting a standard
which would allow the Board to declare that a lost or withdrawn suit
violated the NLRA if it was retaliatory. However, at issue in Bill
Johnson's were ongoing suits, and the Court did not consider the precise
scope of the term "retaliation." Although its statements regarding
completed litigation were intended to guide further proceedings, the
Court did not expressly order the Board to adhere to its prior unlawfulness finding under the stated standard. Exercising its customary refusal to be bound by dicta, the Court turns to the question presented.
Pp. 524-528.

(b) Because of its objective component, Professional Real Estate Investors' sham litigation standard protects reasonably based petitioning
from antitrust liability; because of its subjective component, it also protects petitioning that is unmotivated by anticompetitive intent, whether
it is reasonably based or not. The Board argues that the broad immunity necessary in the antitrust context, with, e. g., its treble damages
remedy and privately initiated lawsuits, is unnecessary in the labor law
context where, e. g., most adjudication cannot be launched solely by private action and the Board cannot issue punitive remedies. At most,
those arguments show that the NLRA poses less of a burden on petitioning, not that its burdens raise no First Amendment concerns. If the
Board may declare that a reasonably based, but unsuccessful, retaliatory
lawsuit violates the NLRA, the resulting illegality finding is a burden
by itself. The finding also poses a threat of reputational harm that is

Syllabus
different and additional to any burden imposed by other penalties.
Having identified this burden, the Court must examine the petitioning
activity it affects. The Bill Johnson's Court said that the Board could
enjoin baseless retaliatory suits because they fell outside the First
Amendment and thus were analogous to "false statements." 461 U. S.,
at 743. At issue here, however, is a class of reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuits. Whether this class falls outside the Petition Clause
at least presents a difficult constitutional question, given the following
considerations. First, even though all lawsuits in this class are unsuccessful, the class includes suits involving genuine grievances because
genuineness does not turn on whether the grievance succeeds. Second,
even unsuccessful but reasonably based suits advance some First
Amendment interests. Finally, the analogy of baseless suits to false
statements does not directly extend to suits that are unsuccessful but
reasonably based. Because the Board confines its penalties to unsuccessful suits brought with a retaliatory motive, this Court must also
consider the significance of that particular limitation, which is fairly included within the question presented. Pp. 528-533.

(c) The Board's definition of a retaliatory suit as one brought with a
motive to interfere with the exercise of protected NLRA $ 7 rights covers a substantial amount of genuine petitioning. For example, an employer's suit to stop what the employer reasonably believes is illegal
union conduct may interfere with or deter some employees' exercise of
NLRA rights. But if the employer's motive still reflects a subjectively
genuine desire to test the conduct's legality, then declaring the suit illegal affects genuine petitioning. The Board also claims to rely on evidence of antiunion animus to infer retaliatory motive. Yet ill will is
not uncommon in litigation, and this Court, in other First Amendment
contexts, has found it problematic to regulate some demonstrably false
expression based on the presence of ill will. Thus, the difficult constitutional question is not made significantly easier by the Board's retaliatory
motive limitation. The final question is whether in light of the NLRA's
important goals, the Board may nevertheless burden an unsuccessful
but reasonably based suit that was brought with a retaliatory purpose.
While the speech burdens are different here than in the antitrust context, the Court is still faced with the difficult constitutional question
whether a class of petitioning may be declared unlawful when a substantial portion is subjectively and objectively genuine. This Court avoided
a similarly difficult First Amendment issue in Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485
U. S. 568, 575, by adopting a limiting construction of the relevant NLRA
provision. Section 158(a)(1)'s prohibition on interfering, restraining, or
coercing is facially as broad as the prohibition in DeBartolo, and it need

Opinion of the Court
not be read so broadly as to reach the entire class of cases the Board
has deemed retaliatory. Because nothing in $ 158(a)(1)'s text indicates
that it must be read to reach all reasonably based but unsuccessful suits
filed with a retaliatory purpose, the Court declines to do so. And because the Board's standard for imposing NLRA liability allows it to
penalize such suits, its standard is invalid. Pp. 533-537.

520 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
lacked authority to assess liability using this standard, wereverse and remand.

I
Petitioner, an industrial general contractor, received a con-tract to modernize a California steel mill near the beginning

of 1987. 246 F. 3d 619, 621 (CA6 2001). According to peti-tioner, various unions attempted to delay the project because
petitioner's employees were nonunion. Ibid. That Sep-tember, petitioner and the mill operator filed suit against
those unions in the District Court for the Northern Districtof California. App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a. The suit was
based on the following basic allegations: First, the unionshad lobbied for adoption and enforcement of an emissions
standard, despite having no real concern the project wouldharm the environment. 246 F. 3d, at 621. Second, the
unions had handbilled and picketed at petitioner's site--andalso encouraged strikes among the employees of petitioner's
subcontractors--without revealing reasons for their dis-agreement. Ibid. Third, to delay the construction project
and raise costs, the unions had filed an action in state courtalleging violations of California's Health and Safety Code.
Id., at 621-622. Finally, the unions had launched griev-ance proceedings against petitioner's joint venture partner based on inapplicable collective bargaining agreements.
Id., at 622.Initially, petitioner and the mill operator sought damages

under $ 303 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947(LMRA), 61 Stat. 158, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 187, which
provides a cause of action against labor organizations forinjuries caused by secondary boycotts prohibited under

$ 158(b)(4). 246 F. 3d, at 622. But after the District Courtgranted the unions' motion for summary judgment on the
plaintiffs' lobbying- and grievance-related claims, the plain-tiffs amended their complaint to allege that the unions' activities violated $$ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 209, asamended, 15 U. S. C. $$ 1-2, which prohibit certain agree536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ments in restraint of trade, monopolization, and attempts tomonopolize. 246 F. 3d, at 622. The District Court dismissed the amended complaint, however, because it reallegedclaims that had already been decided.

Id., at 622-623. The
District Court also dismissed the plaintiffs' claim regardingthe unions' state court lawsuit since the plaintiffs had no evidence that the suit was not reasonably based and because
two unions that the plaintiffs sued were never parties to thatstate court action.

Id., at 623.
The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. It in-cluded their remaining claims but again realleged claims that

had already been decided. Ibid.; App. 32-33. The District
Court dismissed the decided claims and imposed sanctions
on the plaintiffs under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.
246 F. 3d, at 623. At that point, the mill operator dismissed
its remaining claims with prejudice. Ibid. The District
Court then granted summary judgment to the unions on
petitioner's antitrust claim once petitioner was unable to
show the unions had formed a combination with nonlabor
entities for an illegitimate purpose. Ibid. Petitioner dismissed its remaining claims and appealed. Id., at 623-624.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
affirmed the dismissal of petitioner's antitrust claim. It held
that the District Court erred in requiring petitioner to prove
that the unions combined with nonlabor entities for an illegitimate purpose, but found the error harmless since the
unions had antitrust immunity when lobbying officials or petitioning courts and agencies, unless the activity was a sham.
USS-POSCO Industries v. Contra Costa County Bldg. &
Const. Trades Council, AFL-CIO, 31 F. 3d 800, 810 (CA9
1994). Petitioner did not argue that the unions' litigation
activity had been objectively baseless, but maintained that
"the unions [had] engaged in a pattern of automatic petitioning of governmental bodies . . . without regard to . . . the
merits of said petitions." Ibid. (internal quotation marks
omitted; emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit allowed that

522 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
petitioner's claim, if proved, could overcome the unions' anti-trust immunity, but rejected it nonetheless because "fifteen

of the twenty-nine [actions filed by the unions] . . . haveproven successful. The fact that more than half of all the
actions . . . turn out to have merit cannot be reconciled withthe charge that the unions were filing [them] willy-nilly without regard to success." Id., at 811 (footnote omitted).

The Ninth Circuit reversed the District Court's award ofRule 11 sanctions, however, after petitioner explained that

it had realleged decided claims based on Circuit precedentsuggesting that doing so was necessary to preserve them on
appeal. Ibid. Although the Ninth Circuit decided that rule
did not apply to amended complaints following summary
judgment, it held that petitioner's view was not frivolous and
that its counsel could not be blamed for "err[ing] on the side
of caution." Id., at 812.

In the meantime, two unions had lodged complaints
against petitioner with the National Labor Relations Board
(Board), 246 F. 3d, at 624, and after the federal proceedings
ended, the Board's general counsel issued an administrative
complaint against petitioner, alleging that it had violated

$ 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49
Stat. 452, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 158(a)(1), by filing and
maintaining the federal lawsuit. App. to Pet. for Cert. 29a.
Section 8(a)(1) prohibits employers from restraining, coercing, or interfering with employees' exercise of rights related
to self-organization, collective bargaining, and other concerted activities. 29 U. S. C. $$ 157, 158(a)(1).

A three-member panel of the Board addressed crossmotions for summary judgment and ruled in favor of the general counsel. The panel determined that petitioner's federal
lawsuit had been unmeritorious because all of petitioner's
claims were dismissed or voluntarily withdrawn with prejudice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a, 47a, 49a. The panel then
examined whether petitioner's suit had been filed to retaliate
against the unions for engaging in activities protected under

536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

523Cite as: 536 U. S. 516 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
the NLRA. The panel first concluded that the unions' con-duct was protected activity,

id., at 50a-59a, and then decided
that petitioner's lawsuit had been unlawfully motivated be-cause it was "directed at protected conduct" and "necessarily

tended to discourage similar protected activity," and becausepetitioner admitted it had filed suit " `to stop certain [u]nion
conduct which it believed to be unprotected,' " id., at 59a-
60a. The panel found additional evidence of retaliatory mo-tive because petitioner had sued some unions that were not

parties to the state court lawsuit. Id., at 60a. The panelalso found evidence of retaliatory motive because petitioner's
LMRA claims had an "utter absence of merit" and had been
dismissed on summary judgment. Id., at 61a. After determining that petitioner's suit had violated the NLRA because
it was unsuccessful and retaliatory, the panel ordered petitioner to cease and desist from prosecuting such suits and to
post notice to its employees admitting it had been found to
have violated the NLRA and promising not to pursue such
litigation in the future. Id., at 65a-67a. The panel also ordered petitioner to pay the unions' legal fees and expenses
incurred in defense of the federal suit. Id., at 65a.

Petitioner sought review of the Board's decision in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and
the Board cross-petitioned for enforcement of its order. The
Sixth Circuit granted the Board's petition. Relying on Bill
Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 747
(1983), the Sixth Circuit held that "because the judicial
branch of government had already determined that [petitioner's] claims against the unions were unmeritorious or dismissed, evidence of a simple retaliatory motive . . . suffice[d]
to adjudge [petitioner] of committing an unfair labor practice." 246 F. 3d, at 628. The court rejected petitioner's argument that under Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc.
v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49 (1993),
"only baseless or `sham' suits serve to restrict the otherwise
unfettered right to seek court resolution of differences."

524 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
246 F. 3d, at 629. Instead, the court decided Professional
Real Estate Investors was inapplicable because its immunity
standard had been established in the antitrust context without reference to any standard for determining if completed
litigation violates the NLRA. 246 F. 3d, at 629. The Sixth
Circuit found that substantial evidence supported the
Board's inference of retaliatory motive because petitioner
had filed an unmeritorious suit, realleged previously decided
claims, sought treble damages on its antitrust claim, and
sought damages from unions not parties to the state court
suit. Id., at 629-631. The court also upheld the Board's
award of attorney's fees. Id., at 632.

Petitioner sought review of the Sixth Circuit's judgment
by a petition for certiorari that raised four separate questions. We granted certiorari on the following rephrased
question:

"Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that under Bill
Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731
(1983), the NLRB may impose liability on an employer
for filing a losing retaliatory lawsuit, even if the employer could show the suit was not objectively baseless
under Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49 (1993)?"
534 U. S. 1074 (2002).

We now reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and
remand.

II

The First Amendment provides, in relevant part, that
"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging . . . the right of
the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of
grievances." We have recognized this right to petition as
one of "the most precious of the liberties safeguarded by the
Bill of Rights," Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn., 389 U. S.
217, 222 (1967), and have explained that the right is implied

536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
by "[t]he very idea of a government, republican in form,"
United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 552 (1876).

We have also considered the right to petition when inter-preting federal law. In the antitrust context, for example,

we held that "the Sherman Act does not prohibit . . . personsfrom associating . . . in an attempt to persuade the legislature
or the executive to take particular action with respect to a
law that would produce a restraint or a monopoly." Eastern
Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight,
Inc., 365 U. S. 127, 136 (1961). We based our interpretationin part on the principle that we would not "lightly impute to

Congress an intent to invade . . . freedoms" protected by the
Bill of Rights, such as the right to petition. Id., at 138. We
later made clear that this antitrust immunity "shields from
the Sherman Act a concerted effort to influence public officials regardless of intent or purpose." Mine Workers v.
Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 670 (1965).

These antitrust immunity principles were then extended
to situations where groups "use . . . courts to advocate their
causes and points of view respecting resolution of their business and economic interests vis-a` -vis their competitors."
California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlimited, 404
U. S. 508, 511 (1972) (emphasis added). We thus made explicit that "the right to petition extends to all departments
of the Government," and that "[t]he right of access to the
courts is . . . but one aspect of the right of petition." Id.,
at 510.

Even then, however, we emphasized that such immunity
did not extend to "illegal and reprehensible practice[s] which
may corrupt the . . . judicial proces[s]," id., at 513, hearkening
back to an earlier statement that antitrust immunity would
not extend to lobbying "ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action [that] is a mere sham to cover what
is actually nothing more than an attempt to interfere directly
with the business relationships of a competitor." Noerr,
supra, at 144. This line of cases thus establishes that while

536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
526 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
genuine petitioning is immune from antitrust liability, shampetitioning is not.

In Professional Real Estate Investors, we adopted a two-part definition of sham antitrust litigation: first, it "must be
objectively baseless in the sense that no reasonable litigantcould realistically expect success on the merits"; second, the
litigant's subjective motivation must "concea[l] an attempt
to interfere directly with the business relationships of acompetitor . . . through the use [of] the governmental

process--as opposed to the outcome of that process--as an anti-competitive weapon." 508 U. S., at 60-61 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). For a suit to
violate the antitrust laws, then, it must be a sham both objectively and subjectively.

This case raises the same underlying issue of when litigation may be found to violate federal law, but this time with
respect to the NLRA rather than the Sherman Act. Recognizing this underlying connection, we previously decided
whether the Board could enjoin state court lawsuits by analogizing to the antitrust context. In Bill Johnson's, a restaurant owner had filed a state court lawsuit against individuals
who picketed its restaurant after a waitress was fired. 461
U. S., at 733-734. The owner alleged that the picketing was
harassing and dangerous and that a leaflet distributed by
the picketers was libelous. Id., at 734. The waitress filed
a charge with the Board claiming the suit had been filed in
retaliation for participation in protected activities. Id., at
735. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) decided that the
owner's suit lacked a reasonable basis and was intended to
penalize protected activity based on his assessment of the
evidence and its credibility. Id., at 736, 744. The Board upheld this determination and ordered the owner to withdraw
its suit and pay the defendants' legal expenses. Id., at 737.
The Court of Appeals enforced the order. Ibid.

We vacated the judgment, however, holding that First
Amendment and federalism concerns prevented "[t]he filing

Opinion of the Court
and prosecution of a well-founded lawsuit" from being "en-joined as an unfair labor practice, even if it would not have

been commenced but for the plaintiff 's desire to retaliateagainst the defendant for exercising rights protected by the
[NLRA]." Id., at 737, 743. We also held that the Boardmay not decide that a suit is baseless by making credibility
determinations, as the ALJ had done, when genuine issues
of material fact or state law exist. Id., at 745, 746-747. Inrecognition of our sham exception to antitrust immunity,

however, we reasoned that "[w]e should follow a similarcourse under the NLRA" and held that the Board could
enjoin baseless suits brought with a retaliatory motive, id.,at 744 (citing

California Motor Transport, supra), and then
remanded for further proceedings, 461 U. S., at 749.At issue today is not the standard for enjoining ongoing

suits but the standard for declaring completed suits unlawful.In

Bill Johnson's, we remarked in dicta about that situation:

"If judgment goes against the employer in the statecourt, . . . or if his suit is withdrawn or is otherwise

shown to be without merit, the employer has had its dayin court, the interest of the State in providing a forum
for its citizens has been vindicated, and the Board maythen proceed to adjudicate the . . . unfair labor practice
case. The employer's suit having proved unmeritorious, the Board would be warranted in taking that factinto account in determining whether the suit had been

filed in retaliation for the exercise of the employees'[NLRA] $ 7 rights. If a violation is found, the Board
may order the employer to reimburse the employees
whom he had wrongfully sued for their attorney's fees
and other expenses. It may also order any other proper
relief that would effectuate the policies of the [NLRA]."
Id., at 747.

Under this standard, the Board could declare that a lost or
withdrawn suit violated the NLRA if it was retaliatory. In

536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
528 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
Bill Johnson's, however, the issue before the Court waswhether the Board could enjoin an ongoing state lawsuit

without finding that the suit lacked a reasonable basis in lawor fact. Id., at 733. To resolve that issue, we had no actual
need to decide whether the Board could declare unlawful rea-sonably based suits that were ultimately unsuccessful. Indeed, the Board had yet to declare such a suit unlawful: Ithad attempted to enjoin an

uncompleted suit that it had de-clared baseless. Id., at 736-737. Nor did we have occasion

to consider the precise scope of the term "retaliation." Seeinfra, at 533, 537.

Moreover, although our statements regarding completedlitigation were intended to guide further proceedings, we did
not expressly order the Board to adhere to its prior findingof unlawfulness under the standard we stated. See 461
U. S., at 749-750, n. 15 ("[O]n remand the Board may re-instate its finding that petitioner acted unlawfully . . . if
the Board adheres to its previous finding that the suit wasfiled for a retaliatory purpose" (emphasis added)). Thus, exercising our "customary refusal to be bound by dicta," U. S.
Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513U. S. 18, 24 (1994), we turn to the question presented.

III
Because of its objective component, the sham litigationstandard in Professional Real Estate Investors protects reasonably based petitioning from antitrust liability. Becauseof its subjective component, it also protects petitioning that
is unmotivated by anticompetitive intent, whether it is rea-sonably based or not. The Board admits such broad immunity is justified in the antitrust context because it properly"balances the risk of anticompetitive lawsuits against the
chilling effect" on First Amendment petitioning that mightbe caused by "the treble-damages remedy and other distinct
features of antitrust litigation," such as the fact that anti-trust claims may be privately initiated and may impose high

Opinion of the Court
discovery costs. Brief for Respondent NLRB 40-41. Ac-cording to the Board, however, such broad protection is

unnecessary in the labor law context because, outside ofthe LMRA, enforcement of the NLRA requires the Board's
general counsel to first authorize the issuance of an adminis-trative complaint; thus, an adjudication cannot be launched
solely by private action. See 29 U. S. C. $ 153(d); NLRB v.
Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U. S. 112, 118-119 (1987).Nor can the Board issue punitive remedies, see

Republic
Steel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U. S. 7, 10-12 (1940), and insteadis limited to restoring the previolation status quo, see

id.,
at 12-13; NLRB v. J. H. Rutter-Rex Mfg. Co., 396 U. S. 258,
265 (1969). The Board also allows "little prehearing discovery." NLRB v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U. S. 214,
236 (1978).

At most, however, these arguments demonstrate that the
threat of an antitrust suit may pose a greater burden on petitioning than the threat of an NLRA adjudication. This does
not mean the burdens posed by the NLRA raise no First
Amendment concerns. To determine if they do, we must
first isolate those burdens.

Here, the Board's determination that petitioner's lawsuit
violated the NLRA resulted in an order requiring petitioner
to post certain notices, refrain from filing similar suits, and
pay the unions' attorney's fees. Petitioner did not challenge
below the Board's authority to impose the notice and injunction penalties upon a finding of illegality, but did challenge
the Board's authority to award attorney's fees, albeit unsuccessfully. 246 F. 3d, at 631-632. Although petitioner
sought review of the fee issue, Pet. for Cert. i, we did not
grant certiorari on that specific question, instead asking the
parties to address whether the Board may impose liability
for a retaliatory lawsuit that was unsuccessful even if it was
not objectively baseless. 534 U. S. 1074 (2002).

As we see it, a threshold question here is whether the
Board may declare that an unsuccessful retaliatory lawsuit

536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN
530 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
violates the NLRA even if reasonably based. If it may, theresulting finding of illegality is a burden by itself. In addition to a declaration of illegality and whatever legal conse-quences flow from that, the finding also poses the threat of
reputational harm that is different and additional to any bur-den posed by other penalties, such as a fee award. Because
we can resolve this case by looking only at the finding of
illegality, we need not decide whether the Board otherwisehas authority to award attorney's fees when a suit is found

to violate the NLRA.Having identified this burden, we must examine the petitioning activity it affects. In Bill Johnson's, we held that
the Board may not enjoin reasonably based state court lawsuits in part because of First Amendment concerns. 461
U. S., at 742-743. We implied those concerns are no longer
present when a suit ends because "the employer has had its
day in court." Id., at 747. By analogy to other areas of
First Amendment law, one might assume that any concerns
related to the right to petition must be greater when enjoining ongoing litigation than when penalizing completed litigation. After all, the First Amendment historically provides
greater protection from prior restraints than after-the-fact
penalties, see Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 553-
554 (1993), and enjoining a lawsuit could be characterized
as a prior restraint, whereas declaring a completed lawsuit
unlawful could be characterized as an after-the-fact penalty
on petitioning. But this analogy at most suggests that injunctions may raise greater First Amendment concerns, not
that after-the-fact penalties raise no concerns. Likewise,
the fact that Bill Johnson's allowed certain baseless suits to
be enjoined tells little about the propriety of imposing penalties on various classes of nonbaseless suits.

We said in Bill Johnson's that the Board could enjoin baseless retaliatory suits because they fell outside of the First
Amendment and thus were analogous to "false statements."
461 U. S., at 743. We concluded that "[ j]ust as false state536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

531Cite as: 536 U. S. 516 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
ments are not immunized by the First Amendment right to
freedom of speech, baseless litigation is not immunized by
the First Amendment right to petition." Ibid. (citations
omitted). While this analogy is helpful, it does not suggest
that the class of baseless litigation is completely unprotected:
At most, it indicates such litigation should be unprotected
"just as" false statements are. And while false statements
may be unprotected for their own sake, "[t]he First Amendment requires that we protect some falsehood in order to
protect speech that matters." Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,
418 U. S. 323, 341 (1974) (emphasis added); id., at 342 (noting
the need to protect some falsehoods to ensure that "the freedoms of speech and press [receive] that `breathing space' essential to their fruitful exercise" (quoting NAACP v. Button,
371 U. S. 415, 433 (1963))). An example of such "breathing
space" protection is the requirement that a public official
seeking compensatory damages for defamation prove by
clear and convincing evidence that false statements were
made with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.
See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 279-280,
285 (1964).

It is at least consistent with these "breathing space" principles that we have never held that the entire class of objectively baseless litigation may be enjoined or declared unlawful even though such suits may advance no First Amendment
interests of their own. Instead, in cases like Bill Johnson's
and Professional Real Estate Investors, our holdings limited
regulation to suits that were both objectively baseless and
subjectively motivated by an unlawful purpose. But we
need not resolve whether objectively baseless litigation requires any "breathing room" protection, for what is at issue
here are suits that are not baseless in the first place. Instead, as an initial matter, we are dealing with the class of
reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuits. But whether
this class of suits falls outside the scope of the First Amend536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
532 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
ment's Petition Clause at the least presents a difficult consti-tutional question, given the following considerations.

First, even though all the lawsuits in this class are unsuc-cessful, the class nevertheless includes a substantial proportion of all suits involving genuine grievances because thegenuineness of a grievance does not turn on whether it succeeds. Indeed, this is reflected by our prior cases which
have protected petitioning whenever it is genuine, not simplywhen it triumphs. See,

e. g., Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U. S., at 58-61 (protecting suits from antitrustliability whenever they are objectively or subjectively genuine); Pennington, 381 U. S., at 670 (shielding from antitrust
immunity any "concerted effort to influence public officials").
Nor does the text of the First Amendment speak in terms
of successful petitioning--it speaks simply of "the right of
the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of
grievances."

Second, even unsuccessful but reasonably based suits advance some First Amendment interests. Like successful
suits, unsuccessful suits allow the " `public airing of disputed
facts,' " Bill Johnson's, supra, at 743 (quoting Balmer, Sham
Litigation and the Antitrust Law, 29 Buffalo L. Rev. 39, 60
(1980)), and raise matters of public concern. They also promote the evolution of the law by supporting the development
of legal theories that may not gain acceptance the first time
around. Moreover, the ability to lawfully prosecute even
unsuccessful suits adds legitimacy to the court system as a
designated alternative to force. See Andrews, A Right of
Access to Court Under the Petition Clause of the First
Amendment: Defining the Right, 60 Ohio St. L. J. 557, 656
(1999) (noting the potential for avoiding violence by the filing
of unsuccessful claims).

Finally, while baseless suits can be seen as analogous to
false statements, that analogy does not directly extend to
suits that are unsuccessful but reasonably based. For even
if a suit could be seen as a kind of provable statement, the

536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

533Cite as: 536 U. S. 516 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
fact that it loses does not mean it is false. At most it meansthe plaintiff did not meet its burden of proving its truth.

That does not mean the defendant has proved--or couldprove--the contrary.

Because the Board confines its penalties to unsuccessfulsuits brought with a retaliatory motive, however, we must
also consider the significance of that particular limitation,which is fairly included within the question presented. See
534 U. S. 1074 (2002) (granting certiorari on whether theBoard "may impose liability on an employer for filing a losing
retaliatory lawsuit, even if the employer could show the suitwas not objectively baseless" (emphasis added)).

IV
In the context of employer-filed lawsuits, we previouslyindicated that retaliatory suits are those "filed in retaliation

for the exercise of the employees' [NLRA] $ 7 rights." Bill
Johnson's, 461 U. S., at 747. Because we did not specificallyaddress what constitutes "retaliation," however, the precise

scope of that term was not defined. The Board's view isthat a retaliatory suit is one "brought with a motive to interfere with the exercise of protected [NLRA $ ]7 rights."Brief for Respondent NLRB 46 (emphasis added). As we
read it, however, the Board's definition broadly covers a sub-stantial amount of genuine petitioning.

For example, an employer may file suit to stop conduct bya union that he reasonably believes is illegal under federal
law, even though the conduct would otherwise be protectedunder the NLRA. As a practical matter, the filing of the
suit may interfere with or deter some employees' exercise ofNLRA rights. Yet the employer's motive may still reflect
only a subjectively genuine desire to test the legality of theconduct. Indeed, in this very case, the Board's first basis
for finding retaliatory motive was the fact that petitioner'ssuit related to protected conduct that petitioner believed
was unprotected. App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a-60a. If such

Opinion of the Court
a belief is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable, then declaring the resulting suit illegal affects genuine petitioning.

The Board also claims to rely on evidence of antiunion
animus to infer retaliatory motive. Brief for Respondent
NLRB 47. Yet ill will is not uncommon in litigation.
Cf. Professional Real Estate Investors, 508 U. S., at 69 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) ("We may presume that
every litigant intends harm to his adversary"). Disputes
between adverse parties may generate such ill will that recourse to the courts becomes the only legal and practical
means to resolve the situation. But that does not mean such
disputes are not genuine. As long as a plaintiff 's purpose is
to stop conduct he reasonably believes is illegal, petitioning
is genuine both objectively and subjectively. See id., at
60-61.

Even in other First Amendment contexts, we have found it
problematic to regulate some demonstrably false expression
based on the presence of ill will. For example, we invalidated a criminal statute prohibiting false statements about
public officials made with ill will. See Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U. S. 64, 73-74 (1964) ("Debate on public issues will
not be uninhibited if the speaker must run the risk that it
will be proved in court that he spoke out of hatred"). Indeed, the requirement that private defamation plaintiffs
prove the falsity of speech on matters of public concern may
indirectly shield much speech concealing ill motives. See
Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Hepps, 475 U. S. 767, 776-
777 (1986); see also Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485
U. S. 46, 53 (1988) (prohibiting use of ill motive to create
liability for speech in the realm of public debate about public figures).

For these reasons, the difficult constitutional question we
noted earlier, supra, at 531-533, is not made significantly
easier by the Board's retaliatory motive limitation since that

535Cite as: 536 U. S. 516 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
limitation fails to exclude a substantial amount of petitioningthat is objectively and subjectively genuine.

The final question is whether, in light of the importantgoals of the NLRA, the Board may nevertheless burden an
unsuccessful but reasonably based suit when it concludes thesuit was brought with a retaliatory purpose. As explained
above, supra, at 525-526, we answered a similar question in
the negative in the antitrust context. And while the bur-dens on speech at issue in this case are different from those

at issue in Professional Real Estate Investors, we are stillfaced w ith a difficult constituti onal questi on: namely,
whether a class of petitioning may be declared unlawful
when a substantial portion of it is subjectively and objectively genuine.

In a prior labor law case, we avoided a similarly difficult
First Amendment issue by adopting a limiting construction
of the relevant NLRA provision. See Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades
Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988). At issue there was the
scope of $ 8(b)(4) of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. $ 158(b)(4), which
limits unions from "threaten[ing], coerc[ing], or restrain[ing]
any person engaged in commerce or in an industry affecting
commerce" with respect to certain prohibited purposes.

$ 158(b)(4)(ii). The Board read this provision to cover handbilling that urged customers not to shop at a mall where the
purpose of the handbilling was to convince the mall's proprietor to influence a tenant to quit dealing with a nonunion contractor. 485 U. S., at 574. A prior case had held that the
same statutory prohibition on threats, coercion, and restraints was " `nonspecific, indeed vague,' and [thus] should
be interpreted with `caution' and not given a `broad sweep.' "
Id., at 578 (quoting NLRB v. Drivers, 362 U. S. 274, 290
(1960)). Likewise, in DeBartolo, we found that the statutory provisions and their legislative history indicated no
clear intent to reach the handbilling in question, 485 U. S., at
578-588, and so we simply read the statute not to cover it,

536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
536 BE&K CONSTR. CO. v. NLRB

Opinion of the Court
thereby avoiding the First Amendment question altogether,
id., at 588.

Here, the relevant NLRA provision is $ 8(a)(1), 29 U. S. C.$ 158(a)(1), which prohibits employers from "interfer[ing]

with, restrain[ing], or coerc[ing] employees in the exerciseof the rights guaranteed in [29 U. S. C. $ ]157." Section 157
provides, in relevant part:

"Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to
form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain col-lectively through representatives of their own choosing,

and to engage in other concerted activities for the pur-pose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or
protection . . . ."
Section 158(a)(1)'s prohibition on interfering, restraining, or
coercing in connection with the above rights is facially asbroad as the prohibition at issue in

DeBartolo. And while
it might be read to reach the entire class of suits the Boardhas deemed retaliatory, it need not be read so broadly. Indeed, even considered in context, there is no suggestion thatthese provisions were part of any effort to cover that class of
suits. See $$ 158(a)(2)-(5) (generally prohibiting employers
from interfering with the formation and administration of aunion, from discriminating in employment practices based on

union membership, from discharging employees who providetestimony or file charges under the NLRA, and from refusing to bargain collectively with employee representatives).Because there is nothing in the statutory text indicating
that $ 158(a)(1) must be read to reach all reasonably basedbut unsuccessful suits filed with a retaliatory purpose, we
decline to do so. Because the Board's standard for imposing
liability under the NLRA allows it to penalize such suits, its
standard is thus invalid. We do not decide whether the
Board may declare unlawful any unsuccessful but reasonably
based suits that would not have been filed but for a motive
to impose the costs of the litigation process, regardless of the

outcome, in retaliation for NLRA protected activity, sincethe Board's standard does not confine itself to such suits.

Likewise, we need not decide what our dicta in Bill Johnson's may have meant by "retaliation." 461 U. S., at 747;
see supra, at 527-528. Finally, nothing in our holding todayshould be read to question the validity of common litigation

sanctions imposed by courts themselves--such as those authorized under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Proce-dure--or the validity of statutory provisions that merely authorize the imposition of attorney's fees on a losing plaintiff.The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit
is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
concurring.

Although the Court scrupulously avoids deciding the question (which is not presented in this case), I agree with Justice Breyer that the implication of our decision today is
that, in a future appropriate case, we will construe the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in the same way we have
already construed the Sherman Act: to prohibit only lawsuits
that are both objectively baseless and subjectively intended
to abuse process. See Professional Real Estate Investors,
Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49,
60-61 (1993).

Choosing to make explicit what is implied, and then
disagreeing with that result, Justice Breyer describes
a number of differences between the NLRA and the Sherman Act, all of which suggest to him that a complainant enjoys greater First Amendment rights to file a lawsuit in the
face of the latter than the former. Post, at 541-544 (opinion
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Missing
from his list, however, is the most important difference of
all, which suggests--indeed, demands--precisely the oppo536US2 Unit: $U75 [12-17-03 16:00:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Breyer, J.
site conclusion. Under the Sherman Act, the entity makingthe factual determination whether the objectively reasonable

suit was brought with an unlawful motive would have beenan Article III court; even with that protection, we thought
the right of access to Article III courts too much imperiled.Under the NLRA, however, the entity making the factual
finding that determines whether a litigant will be punishedfor filing an objectively reasonable lawsuit will be an executive agency, the National Labor Relations Board. That thisdifference undermines

Justice Breyer's analysis, there canbe no doubt. At the very least, it poses a difficult question

under the First Amendment: whether an executive agencycan be given the power to punish a reasonably based suit
filed in an Article III court whenever it concludes--insulatedfrom de novo judicial review by the substantial-evidence
standard of 29 U. S. C. $$ 160(e), (f )--that the complainanthad one motive rather than another. This makes resort to
the courts a risky venture, dependent upon the findings of abody that does not have the independence prescribed for Article III courts. It would be extraordinary to interpret astatute which is silent on this subject to intrude upon the
courts' ability to decide for themselves which postulants for
their assistance should be punished.For this reason, I am able, unlike

Justice Breyer, to join
the Court's opinion in full--including its carefully circum-scribed statement that "nothing in our holding today should

be read to question the validity of common litigation sanc-tions

imposed by courts themselves," ante, at 537 (emphasis
added).

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, concurring in part andconcurring in the judgment.

As I understand the Court's opinion, it focuses on employer lawsuits that are (1) reasonably based, (2) unsuccessful, and (3) filed with a "retaliatory motive," i. e., a motive to

Opinion of Breyer, J.
interfere with protected union conduct. See ante, at 532-533. The Court holds that the National Labor Relations Act

(NLRA or Act) does not permit the National Labor Rela-tions Board to declare unlawful under $ 8(a) of the Act, 29
U. S. C. $ 158(a), an employer's filing suit in the circumstances present here, which is to say, in the kind of case in
which the Board rests its finding of "retaliatory motive" almost exclusively upon the simple fact that the employer fileda reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuit and the employer did not like the union. Ante, at 522-524. The Courtexpressly leaves open

other circumstances in which the evidence of "retaliation" or antiunion motive might be stronger
or different, showing, for example, an employer, indifferent
to outcome, who intends the reasonably based but unsuccessful lawsuit simply to impose litigation costs on the union.
Ante, at 536-537; see also Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc., 508 U. S. 49,
73-76 (1993) (Stevens, J., joined by O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (discussing colorable suits that would not
be filed but for an illegal purpose). And it does not address
at all lawsuits the employer brings as part of a broader
course of conduct aimed at harming the unions and interfering with employees' exercise of their rights under $ 7(a) of
the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. $ 157.

I concur in the Court's opinion insofar as it holds no more
than I have just set forth. While I recognize the broad leeway the Act gives the Board to make findings and to determine appropriate relief, $ 10(c), 29 U. S. C. $ 160; see NLRB
v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 612, n. 32 (1969); Shepard
v. NLRB, 459 U. S. 344, 349 (1983), I concur because the descriptions given by the Board and the Court of Appeals of
the Board's reasons for finding unlawful employer activity
here, insofar as they are probative, seem to me to rest on
little more than the fact that the employer filed a reasonably based but ultimately unsuccessful lawsuit. See 329
N. L. R. B. No. 68 (1999), App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a-61a

Opinion of Breyer, J.
(finding retaliatory motive because the suit was "directed atprotected conduct," "necessarily tended to discourage similar protected activity," was admittedly brought to stop con-duct BE&K Construction Company thought was unprotected, involved unions other than those parties to certainsuits against the company, and was unmeritorious); 246 F. 3d
619, 629-630 (CA6 2001). Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc.
v. NLRB, 461 U. S. 731, 747 (1983), suggested that "theBoard would be warranted in taking . . . into account" for

unfair labor practice purposes the fact that an employer hadlost its suit, but it did not suggest, as it seems the Board
thought here, that losing a lawsuit against a union, in and
of itself, virtually alone, shows retaliation. See id., at 743
(suggesting that retaliatory suits might be those that "would
not have been commenced but for the plaintiff 's desire to
retaliate against the defendant for exercising rights protected by the Act").

Insofar as language in the Court's opinion might suggest
a more far-reaching rule, see ante, at 524-533, I do not agree.
For one thing, I believe that Bill Johnson's decided many of
the questions the Court declares unanswered. See ante, at
527-528, 537. It held that while the Board may not halt the
prosecution of a lawsuit unless the suit lacks an objectively
reasonable basis, it nonetheless "may . . . proceed to adjudicate the $ 8(a)(1) and $ 8(a)(4) unfair labor practice case"
when an employer brings a merely "unmeritorious" retaliatory suit and loses. 461 U. S., at 747. It added that the
"employer's suit having proved unmeritorious, the Board
would be warranted in taking that fact into account in determining whether the suit had been filed in retaliation for
the exercise of the employees' $ 7 rights." Ibid. (emphasis
added). The courts, the Board, the bar, employers, and
unions alike have treated the Court's discussion of completed
lawsuits in Bill Johnson's as a holding and have followed
it for 20 years. See, e. g., Petrochem Insulation, Inc. v.
NLRB, 240 F. 3d 26, 32 (CADC), cert. denied, 534 U. S. 992

reason to characterize the statements in Bill Johnson's asdicta--though I recognize that the Court's language so characterizing Bill Johnson's is itself dicta.For another thing, I do not believe that this Court's antitrust precedent determines the outcome here. See Professional Real Estate, supra; Eastern Railroad Presidents
Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U. S. 127
(1961). That precedent finds all but sham lawsuits exempt
from the reach of the antitrust laws. Professional Real Estate, supra, at 60-61; Noerr, supra, at 144. It does not hold
employers enjoy a similar exemption from the reach of the
labor laws. And it should not do so, for antitrust law and
labor law differ significantly in respect to their consequences,
administration, scope, history, and purposes.

Certain differences, while minor, are worth noting given
the Court's concern to avoid discouraging legitimate lawsuits. To apply antitrust law to a defendant's reasonably
based but unsuccessful anticompetitive lawsuit, for example,
threatens the defendant with treble damages--a considerable deterrent. See ante, at 528. To apply labor law to an
employer's reasonably based but unsuccessful retaliatory
lawsuit threatens the employer only with a shift in liability
for attorney's fees. See ante, at 529. Similarly, to apply
antitrust law to a defendant's reasonably based but unsuccessful anticompetitive lawsuit threatens the defendant with
high court-defense costs against any and all who initiate suit.
To apply labor law to an employer's reasonably based but
unsuccessful retaliatory lawsuit threatens the employer only
with the typically far lower costs of defending the charge

before a congressionally authorized and politically accountable administrative agency that acts as a screen for meritless
complaints. See ibid.; see also 64 NLRB Ann. Rep. 5 (1999)
(showing that of 27,450 unfair labor practice cases closed in
1999, only 1.4% were resolved by an order of the Board in a
contested case).

Other differences, those related to scope, purpose, and history, are major and determinative. Antitrust law focuses
generally upon anticompetitive conduct that can arise in
myriad circumstances. Anticompetitively motivated lawsuits occupy but one tiny corner of the anticompetitiveactivity universe. To circumscribe the boundaries of that
corner does not significantly limit the scope of antitrust law
or undermine any basic related purpose.

By way of contrast, the NLRA finds in the need to regulate an employer's antiunion lawsuits much of its historical reason for being. Throughout the 19th century, courts
had upheld prosecutions of unions as criminal conspiracies.
C. Tomlins, The State and the Unions 36-45 (1985). They
had struck down protective labor legislation--for, say,
shorter working hours or better working conditions. W.
Forbath, Law and the Shaping of the American Labor Movement 38, and n. 7 (1991) (by 1900, courts had struck down
roughly 60 labor laws, and by 1920, roughly 300). They had
granted injunctions against employees and labor unions that
weakened the unions' ability to organize. Id., at 61-62 (conservatively estimating at least 4,300 injunctions issued in
labor conflicts between 1880 and 1930). And in the process
they had reinterpreted federal statutes that Congress had
not intended for use against the organizing activities of labor
unions. See, e. g., In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564 (1895) (applying
Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 to union activities); Loewe
v. Lawlor, 208 U. S. 274 (1908) (applying Sherman Act); see
generally F. Frankfurter & N. Greene, The Labor Injunction (1930).

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Congress initially passed the Clayton Act, 15 U. S. C.

$$ 12-27, 44, to prevent employers from using the law, particularly antitrust law, in this way. In doing so, Congress
hoped to "substitut[e] the opinion of Congress as to the propriety of the purpose [of union activities] for that of differing
judges" who were "prejudicial to a position of equality between workingman and employer." Duplex Printing Press
Co. v. Deering, 254 U. S. 443, 485-486 (1921) (Brandeis, J.,
joined by Holmes and Clarke, JJ., dissenting). When the
Clayton Act proved insufficient, Congress passed the
Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U. S. C. $ 101, which made the
labor injunction unlawful. See United States v. Hutcheson,
312 U. S. 219, 235-236 (1941) ("The underlying aim of the
Norris-LaGuardia Act was to restore the broad purpose
which Congress thought it had formulated in the Clayton Act
but which was frustrated, so Congress believed, by unduly
restrictive judicial construction"); see also Marine Cooks v.
Panama S. S. Co., 362 U. S. 365, 369-370, n. 7 (1960) (enactment of Norris-LaGuardia "was prompted by a desire . . . to
withdraw federal courts from a type of controversy for which
many believed they were ill-suited"). Similar objectives informed Congress' later enactment of the NLRA, which took
from the courts much of the power to regulate "the relations
between employers of labor and workingmen" by granting
authority to an administrative agency. Duplex Printing,
supra, at 486 (Brandeis, J., dissenting); see Mine Workers v.
Pennington, 381 U. S. 657, 703 (1965) (Goldberg, J., dissenting from opinion but concurring in reversal) (describing how
Justice Brandeis' dissent in Duplex Printing "carried the
day in the courts of history" when Congress passed NorrisLaGuardia and the NLRA).

The upshot is that an employer's antiunion lawsuit occupies a position far closer to the heart of the labor law than
does a defendant's anticompetitive lawsuit in respect to antitrust law. And that fact makes all the difference. Indeed,

given these differences of history and purpose, I do not seehow the Court could treat labor law, which sought to give the

Board power to regulate an employer's antiunion conduct,including retaliatory lawsuits, as if it were antitrust law,
where no comparable purpose is evident. Perhaps that iswhy this Court previously made clear that these two areas
of law significantly differ. Compare Professional Real
Estate, 508 U. S., at 55-60, with Bill Johnson's, 461 U. S.,at 747.

I do not know why the Court reopens these matters in itsopinion today. See ante, at 528, 536-537. But I note that
it has done so only to leave them open. It does not, in theend, decide them. On that understanding, but only to the
extent that I describe at the outset, see supra, at 538-540,I join the Court's opinion.

Syllabus

HARRIS v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuit

No. 00-10666. Argued March 25, 2002--Decided June 24, 2002
Petitioner, who sold illegal narcotics at his pawnshop with an unconcealed

semiautomatic pistol at his side, was arrested for violating, inter alia,
18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A), which provides in relevant part that a person
who in relation to a drug trafficking crime uses or carries a firearm
"shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime," "(i) be
sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years; (ii) if the
firearm is brandished, be sentenced to . . . not less than 7 years; and (iii)
if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to . . . not less than 10 years."
Because the Government proceeded on the assumption that the provision defines a single crime and that brandishing is a sentencing factor
to be found by the judge following trial, the indictment said nothing
about brandishing or subsection (ii), simply alleging the elements from
the principal paragraph. Petitioner was convicted. When his presentence report recommended that he receive the 7-year minimum sentence, he objected, arguing that brandishing was an element of a separate statutory offense for which he was not indicted or convicted. At
the sentencing hearing, the District Court overruled his objection, found
that he had brandished the gun, and sentenced him to seven years in
prison. Affirming, the Fourth Circuit rejected petitioner's statutory
argument and found that McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, foreclosed his argument that if brandishing is a sentencing factor, the statute is unconstitutional under Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466. In
Apprendi, this Court held that other than the fact of a prior conviction,
any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed
statutory maximum is, in effect, an element of the crime, which must be
submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt (and, in federal prosecutions, alleged in an indictment handed down by a grand
jury). But 14 years earlier, McMillan sustained a statute that increased the minimum penalty for a crime, though not beyond the statutory maximum, when the judge found that the defendant had possessed
a firearm.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
243 F. 3d 806, affirmed.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
Parts I, II, and IV, concluding:

536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:17] PAGES PGT: OPIN
546 HARRIS v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
1. As a matter of statutory interpretation, $ 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single offense, in which brandishing and discharging are sentencing factors
to be found by the judge, not offense elements to be found by the jury.
Pp. 552-556.

(a) The prohibition's structure suggests that brandishing and discharging are sentencing factors. Federal laws usually list all offense
elements in a single sentence and separate the sentencing factors into
subsections. Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, 125. The instant
statute's lengthy principal paragraph lists the elements of a complete
crime. Toward the end of the paragraph is the word "shall," which
often divides offense-defining provisions from sentence-specifying ones.
Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227, 233. And following "shall" are
the separate subsections, which explain how defendants are to "be sentenced." Thus this Court can presume that the principal paragraph
defines a single crime and its subsections identify sentencing factors.
Pp. 552-553.

(b) As Jones illustrates, the statute's text might provide evidence
to the contrary, but the critical textual clues here reinforce the singleoffense interpretation. Brandishing has been singled out as a paradigmatic sentencing factor, Castillo, supra, at 126. Under the Sentencing
Guidelines, moreover, brandishing and discharging are factors that affect sentences for numerous crimes. The incremental changes in the
minimum penalty at issue here are precisely what one would expect to
see in provisions meant to identify matters for the sentencing judge's
consideration. Pp. 553-554.

(c) The canon of constitutional avoidance--which provides that
when a statute is susceptible of two constructions, the Court must adopt
the one that avoids grave and doubtful constitutional questions--plays
no role here. The constitutional principle that petitioner says a singleoffense interpretation of the statute would violate--that any fact increasing the statutory minimum sentence must be accorded the safeguards assigned to elements--was rejected in McMillan. Petitioner's
suggestion that the canon be used to avoid overruling one of this Court's
own precedents is novel and, given that McMillan was in place when

$ 924(c)(1)(A) was enacted, unsound. Congress would have had no reason to believe that it was approaching the constitutional line by following the instruction this Court gave in McMillan. Pp. 554-556.

2. Reaffirming McMillan and employing the approach outlined in that
opinion, the Court concludes that $ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) is constitutional.
Basing a 2-year increase in the defendant's minimum sentence on a judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the Fifth and Sixth Amendments' requirements. Congress simply dictated the precise weight

Syllabus
to be given to one traditional sentencing factor. McMillan, supra, at
89-90. Pp. 568-569.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Scalia, concluded in Part III that $ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)
is constitutional under McMillan, which remains sound authority after
Apprendi. The Court will not overrule a precedent absent a special
justification. The justification offered by petitioner is that Apprendi
and McMillan cannot be reconciled. Those decisions are consistent,
however, because there is a fundamental distinction between the factual
findings at issue in those two cases. Apprendi said that any fact extending the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum authorized by
the jury's verdict would have been considered an element of an aggravated crime by the Framers of the Bill of Rights. That cannot be said
of a fact increasing the mandatory minimum (but not extending the
sentence beyond the statutory maximum), for the jury's verdict has authorized the judge to impose the minimum with or without the finding.
This sort of fact is more like the facts judges have traditionally considered when exercising their discretion to choose a sentence within the
range authorized by the jury's verdict--facts that the Constitution does
not require to be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or
proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Read together, McMillan and Apprendi mean that those facts setting the outer limits of a sentence, and
of the judicial power to impose it, are elements of the crime for the
purposes of the constitutional analysis. Within the range authorized
by the jury's verdict, however, the political system may channel judicial
discretion--and rely upon judicial expertise--by requiring defendants
to serve minimum terms after judges make certain factual findings.
Legislatures have relied upon McMillan's holding, and there is no reason to overturn these statutes or cast uncertainty upon sentences imposed under them. Pp. 556-568.

Justice Breyer concluded that although Apprendi v. New Jersey,
530 U. S. 466, cannot easily be distinguished from this case in terms of
logic, the Sixth Amendment permits judges to apply sentencing factors--whether those factors lead to a sentence beyond the statutory
maximum (as in Apprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum
(as here). This does not mean to suggest approval of mandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy. Mandatory minimum statutes are
fundamentally inconsistent with Congress' simultaneous effort to create
a fair, honest, and rational sentencing system through the use of the
Sentencing Guidelines. They transfer sentencing power to prosecutors,
who can determine sentences through the charges they decide to bring,
and who thereby have reintroduced much of the sentencing disparity

that Congress created the Guidelines to eliminate. Applying Apprendi
in this case would not, however, lead Congress to abolish, or to modify,
such statutes; and it would take from the judge the power to make
a factual determination, while giving that power not to juries, but to
prosecutors. The legal consequences of extending Apprendi are also
seriously adverse, for doing so would diminish further Congress' otherwise broad constitutional authority to define crimes through the specification of elements, to shape criminal sentences through the specification
of sentencing factors, and to limit judicial discretion in applying those
factors in particular cases. Pp. 569-572.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to

Parts I, II, and IV, and an opinion with respect to Part III,in which

The Chief Justice, Justice O'Connor, and
Justice Scalia join.

Once more we consider the distinction the law has drawnbetween the elements of a crime and factors that influence a

criminal sentence. Legislatures define crimes in terms ofthe facts that are their essential elements, and constitutional
guarantees attach to these facts. In federal prosecutions,"[n]o person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictmentof a Grand Jury" alleging all the elements of the crime.
U. S. Const., Amdt. 5; see Hamling v. United States, 418U. S. 87, 117 (1974). "In all criminal prosecutions," state
and federal, "the accused shall enjoy the right to . . . trial . . .by an impartial jury," U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; see Duncan v.
Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), at which the govern-ment must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt,
see In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970).Yet not all facts affecting the defendant's punishment are
elements. After the accused is convicted, the judge may im-pose a sentence within a range provided by statute, basing
it on various facts relating to the defendant and the mannerin which the offense was committed. Though these facts
may have a substantial impact on the sentence, they are notelements, and are thus not subject to the Constitution's indictment, jury, and proof requirements. Some statutes alsodirect judges to give specific weight to certain facts when
choosing the sentence. The statutes do not require these

Opinion of the Court
facts, sometimes referred to as sentencing factors, to be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or established
beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Constitution permits legislatures to make the distinction between elements and sentencing factors, but it imposes
some limitations as well. For if it did not, legislatures could
evade the indictment, jury, and proof requirements by labeling almost every relevant fact a sentencing factor. The
Court described one limitation in this respect two Terms ago
in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490 (2000): "Other
than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases
the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum," whether the statute calls it an element or a sentencing factor, "must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond
a reasonable doubt." Fourteen years before, in McMillan
v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79 (1986), the Court had declined
to adopt a more restrictive constitutional rule. McMillan
sustained a statute that increased the minimum penalty for
a crime, though not beyond the statutory maximum, when
the sentencing judge found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had possessed a firearm.

The principal question before us is whether McMillan
stands after Apprendi.

I

Petitioner William Joseph Harris sold illegal narcotics out
of his pawnshop with an unconcealed semiautomatic pistol at
his side. He was later arrested for violating federal drug
and firearms laws, including 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A). That
statute provides in relevant part:

"[A]ny person who, during and in relation to any crime
of violence or drug trafficking crime . . . uses or carries
a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment
provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking
crime--

Opinion of the Court
"(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of notless than 5 years;

"(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to aterm of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and
"(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to aterm of imprisonment of not less than 10 years."

The Government proceeded on the assumption that$ 924(c)(1)(A) defines a single crime and that brandishing is
a sentencing factor to be considered by the judge after thetrial. For this reason the indictment said nothing of brandishing and made no reference to subsection (ii). Instead,it simply alleged the elements from the statute's principal
paragraph: that "during and in relation to a drug traffickingcrime," petitioner had "knowingly carr[ied] a firearm." At
a bench trial the United States District Court for the MiddleDistrict of North Carolina found petitioner guilty as charged.

Following his conviction, the presentence report recom-mended that petitioner be given the 7-year minimum because he had brandished the gun. Petitioner objected, cit-ing this Court's decision in

Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.227 (1999), and arguing that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, brandishing is an element of a separate offense, anoffense for which he had not been indicted or tried. At the
sentencing hearing the District Court overruled the objec-tion, found by a preponderance of the evidence that petitioner had brandished the gun, and sentenced him to sevenyears in prison.

In the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit petitioneragain pressed his statutory argument. He added that if
brandishing is a sentencing factor as a statutory matter,the statute is unconstitutional in light of

Apprendi--eventhough, as petitioner acknowledged, the judge's finding did

not alter the maximum penalty to which he was exposed.Rejecting these arguments, the Court of Appeals affirmed.
243 F. 3d 806 (2001). Like every other Court of Appeals tohave addressed the question, it held that the statute makes

brandishing a sentencing factor. Id., at 812; accord, UnitedStates v. Barton, 257 F. 3d 433, 443 (CA5 2001); United States

held that the constitutional argument was foreclosed by Mc-Millan. 243 F. 3d, at 809.

We granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 1064 (2001), and nowaffirm.

II
We must first answer a threshold question of statutoryconstruction: Did Congress make brandishing an element or

a sentencing factor in $ 924(c)(1)(A)? In the Government'sview the text in question defines a single crime, and the facts
in subsections (ii) and (iii) are considerations for the sentenc-ing judge. Petitioner, on the other hand, contends that Congress meant the statute to define three different crimes.Subsection (ii), he says, creates a separate offense of which
brandishing is an element. If petitioner is correct, he wasneither indicted nor tried for that offense, and the 7-year
minimum did not apply.So we begin our analysis by asking what $ 924(c)(1)(A)
means. The statute does not say in so many words whetherbrandishing is an element or a sentencing factor, but the
structure of the prohibition suggests it is the latter. Fed-eral laws usually list all offense elements "in a single sentence" and separate the sentencing factors "into subsec-tions."

Castillo v. United States, 530 U. S. 120, 125 (2000).Here, $ 924(c)(1)(A) begins with a lengthy principal paragraph listing the elements of a complete crime--"the basicfederal offense of using or carrying a gun during and in relation to" a violent crime or drug offense. Id., at 124. To-ward the end of the paragraph is "the word `shall,' which
often divides offense-defining provisions from those thatspecify sentences." Jones, 526 U. S., at 233. And following
"shall" are the separate subsections, which explain how de-fendants are to "be sentenced." Subsection (i) sets a catch536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

553Cite as: 536 U. S. 545 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
all minimum and "certainly adds no further element." Ibid.Subsections (ii) and (iii), in turn, increase the minimum penalty if certain facts are present, and those subsections do notrepeat the elements from the principal paragraph.

When a statute has this sort of structure, we can presumethat its principal paragraph defines a single crime and its
subsections identify sentencing factors. But even if a statute "has a look to it suggesting that the numbered subsec-tions are only sentencing provisions,"

id., at 232, the text
might provide compelling evidence to the contrary. Thiswas illustrated by the Court's decision in

Jones, in which the
federal carjacking statute, which had a similar structure, was
interpreted as setting out the elements of multiple offenses.

The critical textual clues in this case, however, reinforce
the single-offense interpretation implied by the statute's
structure. Tradition and past congressional practice, for example, were perhaps the most important guideposts in Jones.
The fact at issue there--serious bodily injury--is an element
in numerous federal statutes, including two on which the carjacking statute was modeled; and the Jones Court doubted
that Congress would have made this fact a sentencing factor
in one isolated instance. Id., at 235-237; see also Castillo,
supra, at 126-127; Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523
U. S. 224, 230 (1998). In contrast, there is no similar federal
tradition of treating brandishing and discharging as offense
elements. In Castillo v. United States, supra, the Court
singled out brandishing as a paradigmatic sentencing factor:
"Traditional sentencing factors often involve . . . special features of the manner in which a basic crime was carried out
(e. g., that the defendant . . . brandished a gun)." Id., at 126.
Under the Sentencing Guidelines, moreover, brandishing
and discharging affect the sentences for numerous federal
crimes. See, e. g., United States Sentencing Commission,
Guidelines Manual $$ 2A2.2(b)(2), 2B3.1(b)(2), 2B3.2(b)(3)(A),
2E2.1(b)(1), 2L1.1(b)(4) (Nov. 2001). Indeed, the Guidelines
appear to have been the only antecedents for the statute's

536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
554 HARRIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
brandishing provision. The term "brandished" does not ap-pear in any federal offense-defining provision save 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c)(1)(A), and did not appear there until 1998, when thestatute was amended to take its current form. The numbered subsections were added then, describing, as sentencingfactors often do, "special features of the manner in which"
the statute's "basic crime" could be carried out. Castillo,
supra, at 126. It thus seems likely that brandishing and dis-charging were meant to serve the same function under the

statute as they do under the Guidelines.We might have had reason to question that inference if
brandishing or discharging altered the defendant's punishment in a manner not usually associated with sentencing factors. Jones is again instructive. There the Court accorded
great significance to the "steeply higher penalties" authorized by the carjacking statute's three subsections, which enhanced the defendant's maximum sentence from 15 years, to
25 years, to life--enhancements the Court doubted Congress
would have made contingent upon judicial factfinding. 526
U. S., at 233; see also Castillo, supra, at 131; AlmendarezTorres, supra, at 235-236. The provisions before us now,
however, have an effect on the defendant's sentence that is
more consistent with traditional understandings about how
sentencing factors operate; the required findings constrain,
rather than extend, the sentencing judge's discretion. Section 924(c)(1)(A) does not authorize the judge to impose
"steeply higher penalties"--or higher penalties at all--once
the facts in question are found. Since the subsections alter
only the minimum, the judge may impose a sentence well in
excess of seven years, whether or not the defendant brandished the firearm. The incremental changes in the minimum--from 5 years, to 7, to 10--are precisely what one
would expect to see in provisions meant to identify matters
for the sentencing judge's consideration.

Nothing about the text or history of the statute rebuts the
presumption drawn from its structure. Against the single536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

555Cite as: 536 U. S. 545 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
offense interpretation to which these considerations point,
however, petitioner invokes the canon of constitutional
avoidance. Under that doctrine, when "a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful
constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such
questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter."
United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909). It is at least an open question, petitioner contends, whether the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments require every fact increasing a federal defendant's minimum sentence to be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
To avoid resolving that question (and possibly invalidating
the statute), petitioner urges, we should read $ 924(c)(1)(A)
as making brandishing an element of an aggravated federal
crime.

The avoidance canon played a role in Jones, for the subsections of the carjacking statute enhanced the maximum sentence, and a single-offense interpretation would have implicated constitutional questions later addressed--and resolved
in the defendant's favor--by Apprendi. See Jones, supra,
at 243, n. 6 ("[A]ny fact (other than prior conviction) that
increases the maximum penalty for a crime must be charged
in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a
reasonable doubt"). Yet the canon has no role to play here.
It applies only when there are serious concerns about the
statute's constitutionality, Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 314,
n. 9 (1993), and petitioner's proposed rule--that the Constitution requires any fact increasing the statutory minimum
sentence to be accorded the safeguards assigned to elements--was rejected 16 years ago in McMillan. Petitioner
acknowledges as much but argues that recent developments
cast doubt on McMillan's viability. To avoid deciding
whether McMillan must be overruled, he says, we should
construe the problem out of the statute.

536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
556 HARRIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Petitioner's suggestion that we use the canon to avoidoverruling one of our own precedents is novel and, given

that McMillan was in place when $ 924(c)(1)(A) was enacted,unsound. The avoidance canon rests upon our "respect for
Congress, which we assume legislates in the light of consti-tutional limitations." Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U. S. 173, 191
(1991). The statute at issue in this case was passed when
McMillan provided the controlling instruction, and Con-gress would have had no reason to believe that it was approaching the constitutional line by following that instruc-tion. We would not further the canon's goal of eliminating
friction with our coordinate branch, moreover, if we allevi-ated our doubt about a constitutional premise we had supplied by adopting a strained reading of a statute that Con-gress had enacted in reliance on the premise. And if we
stretched the text to avoid the question of McMillan's con-tinuing vitality, the canon would embrace a dynamic view of
statutory interpretation, under which the text might meanone thing when enacted yet another if the prevailing view of
the Constitution later changed. We decline to adopt thatapproach.

As the avoidance canon poses no obstacle and the interpre-tive circumstances point in a common direction, we conclude
that, as a matter of statutory interpretation, $ 924(c)(1)(A)defines a single offense. The statute regards brandishing
and discharging as sentencing factors to be found by thejudge, not offense elements to be found by the jury.

III
Confident that the statute does just what McMillansaid it could, we consider petitioner 's argument that

$ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii) is unconstitutional because McMillan is nolonger sound authority.

Stare decisis is not an "inexorablecommand," Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393,

405 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting), but the doctrine is "offundamental importance to the rule of law,"

Welch v. Texas

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 494
(1987). Even in constitutional cases, in which stare decisis
concerns are less pronounced, we will not overrule a precedent absent a "special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey,
467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).

The special justification petitioner offers is our decision in
Apprendi, which, he says, cannot be reconciled with McMillan. Cf. Ring v. Arizona, post, at 609 (overruling Walton
v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), because "Walton and Apprendi are irreconcilable"). We do not find the argument
convincing. As we shall explain, McMillan and Apprendi
are consistent because there is a fundamental distinction between the factual findings that were at issue in those two
cases. Apprendi said that any fact extending the defendant's sentence beyond the maximum authorized by the jury's
verdict would have been considered an element of an aggravated crime--and thus the domain of the jury--by those who
framed the Bill of Rights. The same cannot be said of a fact
increasing the mandatory minimum (but not extending the
sentence beyond the statutory maximum), for the jury's verdict has authorized the judge to impose the minimum with
or without the finding. As McMillan recognized, a statute
may reserve this type of factual finding for the judge without
violating the Constitution.

Though defining criminal conduct is a task generally "left
to the legislative branch," Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S.
197, 210 (1977), Congress may not manipulate the definition
of a crime in a way that relieves the Government of its constitutional obligations to charge each element in the indictment, submit each element to the jury, and prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt, Jones, 526 U. S., at 240-241;
Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 699 (1975). McMillan
and Apprendi asked whether certain types of facts, though
labeled sentencing factors by the legislature, were nevertheless "traditional elements" to which these constitutional safe536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
guards were intended to apply. Patterson v. New York,
supra, at 211, n. 12.

McMillan's answer stemmed from certain historical anddoctrinal understandings about the role of the judge at sentencing. The mid-19th century produced a general shift inthis country from criminal statutes "providing fixed-term
sentences to those providing judges discretion within a permissible range." Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 481. Under thesestatutes, judges exercise their sentencing discretion through

"an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to thekind of information [they] may consider, or the source from
which it may come." United States v. Tucker, 404 U. S. 443,
446 (1972). The Court has recognized that this process is
constitutional--and that the facts taken into consideration
need not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury,
or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g., United
States v. Watts, 519 U. S. 148, 156 (1997) (per curiam); Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 747 (1994); Williams v.
New York, 337 U. S. 241, 246 (1949). As the Court reiterated
in Jones: "It is not, of course, that anyone today would claim
that every fact with a bearing on sentencing must be found
by a jury; we have resolved that general issue and have no
intention of questioning its resolution." 526 U. S., at 248.
Judicial factfinding in the course of selecting a sentence
within the authorized range does not implicate the indictment, jury-trial, and reasonable-doubt components of the
Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

That proposition, coupled with another shift in prevailing
sentencing practices, explains McMillan. In the latter part
of the 20th century, many legislatures, dissatisfied with sentencing disparities among like offenders, implemented measures regulating judicial discretion. These systems maintained the statutory ranges and the judge's factfinding role
but assigned a uniform weight to factors judges often relied
upon when choosing a sentence. See, e. g., Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 820 (1991). One example of reform, the

536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
kind addressed in McMillan, was mandatory minimum
sentencing. The Pennsylvania Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 9712 (1982), imposed a minimum prison term of five years when the sentencing judge
found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had possessed a firearm while committing the crime of
conviction.

In sustaining the statute the McMillan Court placed considerable reliance on the similarity between the sentencing
factor at issue and the facts judges contemplate when exercising their discretion within the statutory range. Given
that the latter are not elements of the crime, the Court explained, neither was the former:

"Section 9712 neither alters the maximum penalty for
the crime committed nor creates a separate offense calling for a separate penalty; it operates solely to limit
the sentencing court's discretion in selecting a penalty
within the range already available to it without the special finding of visible possession of a firearm. Section
9712 `ups the ante' for the defendant only by raising to
five years the minimum sentence which may be imposed
within the statutory plan. . . . Petitioners' claim that
visible possession under the Pennsylvania statute is
`really' an element of the offenses for which they are
being punished . . . would have at least more superficial
appeal if a finding of visible possession exposed them to
greater or additional punishment, . . . but it does not."
477 U. S., at 87-88 (footnote omitted).

In response to the argument that the Act evaded the Constitution's procedural guarantees, the Court noted that the
statute "simply took one factor that has always been considered by sentencing courts to bear on punishment . . . and
dictated the precise weight to be given that factor." Id.,
at 89-90.

536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
560 HARRIS v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
That reasoning still controls. If the facts judges considerwhen exercising their discretion within the statutory range

are not elements, they do not become as much merely be-cause legislatures require the judge to impose a minimum
sentence when those facts are found--a sentence the judgecould have imposed absent the finding. It does not matter,
for the purposes of the constitutional analysis, that in statutes like the Pennsylvania Act the "State provides" that afact "shall give rise both to a special stigma and to a special

punishment." Id., at 103 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Judgeschoosing a sentence within the range do the same, and
"[ j]udges, it is sometimes necessary to remind ourselves, are
part of the State." Apprendi, supra, at 498 (Scalia, J., concurring). These facts, though stigmatizing and punitive,
have been the traditional domain of judges; they have not
been alleged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no reason to believe that those who
framed the Fifth and Sixth Amendments would have thought
of them as the elements of the crime.

This conclusion might be questioned if there were extensive historical evidence showing that facts increasing the defendant's minimum sentence (but not affecting the maximum) have, as a matter of course, been treated as elements.
The evidence on this score, however, is lacking. Statutes
like the Pennsylvania Act, which alter the minimum sentence
without changing the maximum, were for the most part the
product of the 20th century, when legislatures first asserted
control over the sentencing judge's discretion. Courts at
the founding (whose views might be relevant, given the contemporaneous adoption of the Bill of Rights, see Apprendi,
530 U. S., at 478-484) and in the mid-19th century (whose
views might be relevant, given that sentencing ranges first
arose then, see id., at 501-518 (Thomas, J., concurring)) were
not as a general matter required to decide whether a fact
giving rise to a mandatory minimum sentence within the
available range was to be alleged in the indictment and

proved to the jury. See King & Klein, Essential Elements,54 Vand. L. Rev. 1467, 1474-1477 (2001). Indeed, though

there is no clear record of how history treated these facts, itis clear that they did not fall within the principle by which
history determined what facts were elements. That princi-ple defined elements as "fact[s] . . . legally essential to the
punishment to be inflicted." United States v. Reese, 92 U. S.214, 232 (1876) (Clifford, J., dissenting) (citing 1 J. Bishop,
Law of Criminal Procedure $ 81, p. 51 (2d ed. 1872)). Thisformulation includes facts that, as

McMillan put it, "alte[r]the maximum penalty," 477 U. S., at 87, but it does not include facts triggering a mandatory minimum. The mini-mum may be imposed with or without the factual finding;
the finding is by definition not "essential" to the defendant'spunishment.

McMillan was on firm historical ground, then, when itheld that a legislature may specify the condition for a mandatory minimum without making the condition an element ofthe crime. The fact of visible firearm possession was more
like the facts considered by judges when selecting a sentencewithin the statutory range--facts that, as the authorities
from the 19th century confirm, have never been charged inthe indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a
reasonable doubt:

"[W]ithin the limits of any discretion as to the punish-ment which the law may have allowed, the judge, when

he pronounces sentence, may suffer his discretion to beinfluenced by matter shown in aggravation or mitigation, not covered by the allegations of the indictment.Where the law permits the heaviest punishment, on a
scale laid down, to be inflicted, and has merely com-mitted to the judge the authority to interpose its mercy
and inflict a punishment of a lighter grade, no rights ofthe accused are violated though in the indictment there
is no mention of mitigating circumstances. The aggra-vating circumstances spoken of cannot swell the penalty

above what the law has provided for the acts chargedagainst the prisoner, and they are interposed merely to

check the judicial discretion in the exercise of the per-mitted mercy. This is an entirely different thing from
punishing one for what is not alleged against him."Bishop, Criminal Procedure $ 85, at 54.

Since sentencing ranges came into use, defendants have notbeen able to predict from the face of the indictment precisely
what their sentence will be; the charged facts have simplymade them aware of the "heaviest punishment" they face if
convicted. Ibid. Judges, in turn, have always considereduncharged "aggravating circumstances" that, while increasing the defendant's punishment, have not "swell[ed] the pen-alty above what the law has provided for the acts charged."
Ibid. Because facts supporting a mandatory minimum fitsquarely within that description, the legislature's choice to
entrust them to the judge does not implicate the "com-petition . . . between judge and jury over . . . their respective
roles," Jones, 526 U. S., at 245, that is the central concern ofthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

At issue in Apprendi, by contrast, was a sentencing factorthat did "swell the penalty above what the law has provided," Bishop, supra, $ 85, at 54, and thus functioned morelike a "traditional elemen[t]."

Patterson v. New York, 432U. S., at 211, n. 12. The defendant had been convicted of

illegal possession of a firearm, an offense for which New Jer-sey law prescribed a maximum of 10 years in prison. See
N. J. Stat. Ann. $$ 2C:39-4(a), 2C:43-6(a)(2) (1995). He wassentenced to 12 years, however, because a separate statute
permitted an enhancement when the judge found, by a pre-ponderance of the evidence, that the defendant "acted with
a purpose to intimidate an individual or group of individualsbecause of race." $ 2C:44-3(e) (Supp. 2001-2002).

The Court held that the enhancement was unconstitu-tional. "[O]ur cases in this area, and . . . the history upon
which they rely," the Court observed, confirmed the constitu536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tional principle first identified in Jones: "Other than the factof a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for

a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must besubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt."
530 U. S., at 490. Those facts, Apprendi held, were whatthe Framers had in mind when they spoke of "crimes" and
"criminal prosecutions" in the Fifth and Sixth Amendments:
A crime was not alleged, and a criminal prosecution not com-plete, unless the indictment and the jury verdict included all

the facts to which the legislature had attached the maximumpunishment. Any "fact that . . . exposes the criminal defendant to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would re-ceive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury
verdict alone," the Court concluded, id., at 483, would havebeen, under the prevailing historical practice, an element of
an aggravated offense. See id., at 479-481; see also id., at501-518 (

Thomas, J., concurring).
Apprendi's conclusions do not undermine McMillan's.There was no comparable historical practice of submitting

facts increasing the mandatory minimum to the jury, so the
Apprendi rule did not extend to those facts. Indeed, theCourt made clear that its holding did not affect

McMillan
at all:

"We do not overrule McMillan. We limit its holding to
cases that do not involve the imposition of a sentencemore severe than the statutory maximum for the offense

established by the jury's verdict--a limitation identifiedin the

McMillan opinion itself." 530 U. S., at 487, n. 13.

The sentencing factor in McMillan did not increase "the
penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum," 530 U. S., at 490; nor did it, as the concurring opinions
in Jones put it, "alter the congressionally prescribed range
of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed," 526
U. S., at 253 (Scalia, J., concurring). As the Apprendi
Court observed, the McMillan finding merely required the

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
judge to impose "a specific sentence within the range author-ized by the jury's finding that the defendant [was] guilty."

530 U. S., at 494, n. 19; see also Jones, supra, at 242 ("[T]he
Winship issue [in McMillan] rose from a provision that a
judge's finding (by a preponderance) of visible possession ofa firearm would require a mandatory minimum sentence for

certain felonies, but a minimum that fell within the sentencing ranges otherwise prescribed").As its holding and the history on which it was based would

suggest, the Apprendi Court's understanding of the Consti-tution is consistent with the holding in

McMillan. Facts
extending the sentence beyond the statutory maximum hadtraditionally been charged in the indictment and submitted

to the jury, Apprendi said, because the function of the indict-ment and jury had been to authorize the State to impose
punishment:

"The evidence . . . that punishment was, by law, tied to
the offense . . . and the evidence that American judgeshave exercised sentencing discretion within a legally

prescribed range . . . point to a single, consistent conclu-sion: The judge's role in sentencing is constrained at its
outer limits by the facts alleged in the indictment andfound by the jury. Put simply, facts that expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition `elements' of a sepa-rate legal offense." 530 U. S., at 483, n. 10.

The grand and petit juries thus form a " `strong and two-fold
barrier . . . between the liberties of the people and the pre-rogative of the [government].' "

Duncan v. Louisiana, 391
U. S., at 151 (quoting W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the
Laws of England 349 (T. Cooley ed. 1899)). Absent authorization from the trial jury--in the form of a finding, by proof
beyond a reasonable doubt, of the facts warranting the extended sentence under the New Jersey statute--the State
had no power to sentence the defendant to more than

10 years, the maximum "authorized by the jury's guiltyverdict."

Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 494. "[T]hose facts that
determine the maximum sentence the law allows," then, arenecessarily elements of the crime.

Id., at 499 (Scalia, J.,
concurring).Yet once the jury finds all those facts,

Apprendi says that
the defendant has been convicted of the crime; the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments have been observed; and the Govern-ment has been authorized to impose any sentence below the

maximum. That is why, as Apprendi noted, "nothing in thishistory suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion--taking into consideration various factors relating both to offense and offender--in imposing a judgment
within the range." Id., at 481. That is also why, as McMillan noted, nothing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to find facts that give rise to a mandatory
minimum sentence below "the maximum penalty for the
crime committed." 477 U. S., at 87-88. In both instances
the judicial factfinding does not "expose a defendant to a
punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed."
Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10. Whether chosen by the
judge or the legislature, the facts guiding judicial discretion
below the statutory maximum need not be alleged in the
indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. When a judge sentences the defendant to a
mandatory minimum, no less than when the judge chooses a
sentence within the range, the grand and petit juries already
have found all the facts necessary to authorize the Government to impose the sentence. The judge may impose the
minimum, the maximum, or any other sentence within the
range without seeking further authorization from those juries--and without contradicting Apprendi.

Petitioner argues, however, that the concerns underlying
Apprendi apply with equal or more force to facts increasing
the defendant's minimum sentence. Those factual findings,
he contends, often have a greater impact on the defendant

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
than the findings at issue in Apprendi. This is so becausewhen a fact increasing the statutory maximum is found, the

judge may still impose a sentence far below that maximum;but when a fact increasing the minimum is found, the judge
has no choice but to impose that minimum, even if he orshe otherwise would have chosen a lower sentence. Cf.
Almendarez-Torres, 523 U. S., at 244-245. Why, petitioner
asks, would fairness not also require the latter sort of factto be alleged in the indictment and found by the jury under

a reasonable-doubt standard? The answer is that because itis beyond dispute that the judge's choice of sentences within
the authorized range may be influenced by facts not considered by the jury, a factual finding's practical effect cannot by
itself control the constitutional analysis. The Fifth and
Sixth Amendments ensure that the defendant "will never get
more punishment than he bargained for when he did the
crime," but they do not promise that he will receive "anything less" than that. Apprendi, supra, at 498 (Scalia, J.,
concurring). If the grand jury has alleged, and the trial jury
has found, all the facts necessary to impose the maximum,
the barriers between government and defendant fall. The
judge may select any sentence within the range, based on
facts not alleged in the indictment or proved to the jury--
even if those facts are specified by the legislature, and even
if they persuade the judge to choose a much higher sentence
than he or she otherwise would have imposed. That a fact
affects the defendant's sentence, even dramatically so, does
not by itself make it an element.

In light of the foregoing, it is not surprising that the decisions for the Court in both Apprendi and Jones insisted that
they were consistent with McMillan--and that a distinction
could be drawn between facts increasing the defendant's
minimum sentence and facts extending the sentence beyond
the statutory maximum. See, e. g., Apprendi, supra, at 494,
n. 19 ("The term [sentencing factor] appropriately describes
a circumstance, which may be either aggravating or mitigat536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
ing in character, that supports a specific sentence within the
range authorized by the jury's finding that the defendant is
guilty of a particular offense"); Jones, 526 U. S., at 242 ("McMillan, then, recognizes a question under both the Due
Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the juryguarantee of the Sixth: . . . [M]ay judicial factfinding by a

preponderance support the application of a provision that increases the potential severity of the penalty for a variant ofa given crime?"); see also

Almendarez-Torres, supra, at 256
(Scalia, J., dissenting) ("[N]o one can read McMillan . . .without perceiving that the determinative element in our

validation of the Pennsylvania statute was the fact that it
merely limited the sentencing judge's discretion within the
range of penalty already available, rather than substantially
increasing the available sentence"). That distinction may
continue to stand. The factual finding in Apprendi extended the power of the judge, allowing him or her to impose
a punishment exceeding what was authorized by the jury.
The finding in McMillan restrained the judge's power, limiting his or her choices within the authorized range. It is
quite consistent to maintain that the former type of fact
must be submitted to the jury while the latter need not be.

Read together, McMillan and Apprendi mean that those
facts setting the outer limits of a sentence, and of the judicial
power to impose it, are the elements of the crime for the
purposes of the constitutional analysis. Within the range
authorized by the jury's verdict, however, the political system may channel judicial discretion--and rely upon judicial
expertise--by requiring defendants to serve minimum terms
after judges make certain factual findings. It is critical not
to abandon that understanding at this late date. Legislatures and their constituents have relied upon McMillan to
exercise control over sentencing through dozens of statutes
like the one the Court approved in that case. Congress and
the States have conditioned mandatory minimum sentences
upon judicial findings that, as here, a firearm was possessed,

the defendant was a repeat offender, Md. Ann. Code, Art.27, $ 286 (Supp. 2000). We see no reason to overturn those
statutes or cast uncertainty upon the sentences imposedunder them.

IV
Reaffirming McMillan and employing the approach out-lined in that case, we conclude that the federal provision at

issue, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), is constitutional. Basinga 2-year increase in the defendant's minimum sentence on a
judicial finding of brandishing does not evade the require-ments of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Congress "simply took one factor that has always been considered by sen-tencing courts to bear on punishment . . . and dictated the
precise weight to be given that factor." McMillan, 477U. S., at 89-90. That factor need not be alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, or proved beyond a reason-able doubt.

The Court is well aware that many question the wisdomof mandatory minimum sentencing. Mandatory minimums,
it is often said, fail to account for the unique circumstancesof offenders who warrant a lesser penalty. See,

e. g., Brieffor Families Against Mandatory Minimums Foundation as

Amicus Curiae 25, n. 16; cf. Almendarez-Torres, supra, at245 (citing United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory
Minimum Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System26-34 (Aug. 1991)). These criticisms may be sound, but
they would persist whether the judge or the jury foundthe facts giving rise to the minimum. We hold only that the

Constitution permits the judge to do so, and we leave theother questions to Congress, the States, and the democratic

processes.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.
Justice O'Connor, concurring.
Petitioner bases his statutory argument that brandishing
must be interpreted as an offense element on Jones v. United
States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999). He bases his constitutional argument that regardless of how the statute is interpreted,brandishing must be charged in the indictment and found by

the jury beyond a reasonable doubt on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). As I dissented in Jones and Apprendi and still believe both were wrongly decided, I find it
easy to reject petitioner's arguments. Even assuming thevalidity of

Jones and Apprendi, however, I agree that petitioner's arguments that brandishing must be charged in theindictment and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt

are unavailing. I therefore join Justice Kennedy's opinion in its entirety.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I cannot easily distinguish Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U. S. 466 (2000), from this case in terms of logic. For that
reason, I cannot agree with the plurality's opinion insofar as
it finds such a distinction. At the same time, I continue to
believe that the Sixth Amendment permits judges to apply
sentencing factors--whether those factors lead to a sentence
beyond the statutory maximum (as in Apprendi) or the application of a mandatory minimum (as here). And because I
believe that extending Apprendi to mandatory minimums
would have adverse practical, as well as legal, consequences,
I cannot yet accept its rule. I therefore join the Court's

judgment, and I join its opinion to the extent that it holdsthat

Apprendi does not apply to mandatory minimums.
In saying this, I do not mean to suggest my approval ofmandatory minimum sentences as a matter of policy. During the past two decades, as mandatory minimum sentencingstatutes have proliferated in number and importance, judges,
legislators, lawyers, and commentators have criticized those
statutes, arguing that they negatively affect the fair adminis-tration of the criminal law, a matter of concern to judges

and to legislators alike. See, e. g., Remarks of Chief JusticeWilliam H. Rehnquist

, Nat. Symposium on Drugs and Violence in America 9-11 (June 18, 1993); Kennedy, Hearings
before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 103d Cong., 2d Sess., 29 (Mar. 9, 1994) (mandatory
minimums are "imprudent, unwise and often an unjust mechanism for sentencing"); Breyer, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Revisited, 14 Crim. Justice 28 (Spring 1999); Hatch, The
Role of Congress in Sentencing: The United States Sentencing Commission, Mandatory Minimum Sentences, and the
Search for a Certain and Effective Sentencing System, 28
Wake Forest L. Rev. 185, 192-196 (1993); Schulhofer, Rethinking Mandatory Minimums, 28 Wake Forest L. Rev. 199
(1993); Raeder, Rethinking Sentencing and Correctional Policy for Nonviolent Drug Offenders, 14 Crim. Justice 1, 53
(Summer 1999) (noting that the American Bar Association
has opposed mandatory minimum sentences since 1974).

Mandatory minimum statutes are fundamentally inconsistent with Congress' simultaneous effort to create a fair, honest, and rational sentencing system through the use of Sentencing Guidelines. Unlike Guideline sentences, statutory
mandatory minimums generally deny the judge the legal
power to depart downward, no matter how unusual the special circumstances that call for leniency. See Melendez v.
United States, 518 U. S. 120, 132-133 (1996) (Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); cf. Koon v. United
States, 518 U. S. 81, 95-96 (1996). They rarely reflect an ef536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

571Cite as: 536 U. S. 545 (2002)
Opinion of Breyer, J.
fort to achieve sentencing proportionality--a key element of
sentencing fairness that demands that the law punish a drug
"kingpin" and a "mule" differently. They transfer sentencing power to prosecutors, who can determine sentences
through the charges they decide to bring, and who thereby
have reintroduced much of the sentencing disparity that
Congress created Guidelines to eliminate. U. S. Sentencing
Comm'n, Special Report to Congress: Mandatory Minimum
Penalties in the Federal Criminal Justice System i-iv, 31-33
(1991) (Sentencing Report); see also Schulhofer, supra, at
214-220. They rarely are based upon empirical study. See
Rehnquist, supra, at 9-10; Hatch, supra, at 198. And there
is evidence that they encourage subterfuge, leading to more
frequent downward departures (on a random basis), thereby
making them a comparatively ineffective means of guaranteeing tough sentences. See Sentencing Report 53.

Applying Apprendi in this case would not, however, lead
Congress to abolish, or to modify, mandatory minimum sentencing statutes. Rather, it would simply require the prosecutor to charge, and the jury to find beyond a reasonable
doubt, the existence of the "factor," say, the amount of
unlawful drugs, that triggers the mandatory minimum. In
many cases, a defendant, claiming innocence and arguing,
say, mistaken identity, will find it impossible simultaneously
to argue to the jury that the prosecutor has overstated the
drug amount. How, the jury might ask, could this "innocent" defendant know anything about that matter? The upshot is that in many such cases defendant and prosecutor will
enter into a stipulation before trial as to drug amounts to be
used at sentencing (if the jury finds the defendant guilty).
To that extent, application of Apprendi would take from the
judge the power to make a factual determination, while giving that power not to juries, but to prosecutors. And such
consequences, when viewed through the prism of an open,
fair sentencing system, are seriously adverse.

Thomas, J., dissenting
The legal consequences of extending Apprendi to the man-datory minimum sentencing context are also seriously adverse. Doing so would diminish further Congress' other-wise broad constitutional authority to define crimes through
the specification of elements, to shape criminal sentencesthrough the specification of sentencing factors, and to limit
judicial discretion in applying those factors in particularcases. I have discussed these matters fully in my

Apprendidissent. See 530 U. S., at 555. For the reasons set forth

there, and in other opinions, see Jones v. United States, 526U. S. 227, 254 (1999) (

I consequently join Parts I, II, and IV of the Court's opin-ion and concur in its judgment.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The range of punishment to which petitioner William J.Harris was exposed turned on the fact that he brandished a

firearm, a fact that was neither charged in his indictment
nor proved at trial beyond a reasonable doubt. The United
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit nonethelessheld, in reliance on

McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79
(1986), that the fact that Harris brandished a firearm was amere sentencing factor to which no constitutional protections

attach. 243 F. 3d 806, 808-812 (2001).

McMillan, however, conflicts with the Court's later decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), asthe dissenting opinion in

Apprendi recognized. See id., at
533 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). The Court's holding todaytherefore rests on either a misunderstanding or a rejection

of the very principles that animated Apprendi just two yearsago. Given that considerations of

stare decisis are at their
nadir in cases involving procedural rules implicating fundamental constitutional protections afforded criminal defend536US2 Unit: $U76 [12-23-03 07:23:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ants, I would reaffirm Apprendi, overrule McMillan, andreverse the Court of Appeals.

I
Harris was indicted for distributing marijuana in viola-tion of 21 U. S. C. $ 841 and for carrying a firearm "in relation

to" a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c)(1)(A). Harris pleaded guilty to distributing marijuana but disputed that he had carried a firearm "in relationto" a drug trafficking crime. The District Court disagreed,

1

and he was convicted by the judge, having waived his rightto trial by jury. Although the mandatory minimum prison

sentence under $ 924(c)(1)(A)(i) is five years in prison, thepresentence report relied on $ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), which increases the mandatory minimum prison sentence to sevenyears when the firearm is brandished.

2 At sentencing, the

District Court acknowledged that it was a "close question"whether Harris "brandished" a firearm, and noted that "[t]he

only thing that happened here is [that] he had [a gun] duringthe drug transaction." App. 231-232, 244-247. The District Court nonetheless found by a preponderance of the evi-dence that Harris had brandished a firearm and as a result
sentenced him to the minimum mandatory sentence of sevenyears' imprisonment for the violation of $ 924(c)(1)(A).

Relying on McMillan, the Court of Appeals affirmed thesentence and held as a matter of statutory interpretation
that brandishing is a sentencing factor, not an element ofthe $ 924(c)(1)(A) offense. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals

1 Harris owned a pawn shop and routinely wore a gun at work; the District Court accepted that it was Harris' ordinary practice to wear a gun
whether or not he was selling small amounts of marijuana to his friends.
The District Court, however, determined that the gun was carried "in
relation to" a drug trafficking offense within the meaning of $ 924(c) because it was "unable to draw the distinction that if it is [carried] for a
legitimate purpose, it cannot be for an illegitimate purpose." App. 163.

2 The presentence report recommended that Harris be given a term of

imprisonment of zero to six months for the distribution charge.

Thomas, J., dissenting
concluded that the allegation of brandishing a firearm did notneed to be charged in the indictment or proved beyond a

reasonable doubt in order for the 7-year mandatory minimumto be triggered.

II
The Court construes $ 924(c)(1)(A) to "defin[e] a single of-fense,"

ante, at 556, rather than the multiple offenses theCourt found in a similarly structured statute in Jones v.

United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999).3 In reliance on McMil-lan, it then discounts the increasing mandatory minimum
sentences set forth in the statutory provision as constitution-ally irrelevant. In the plurality's view, any punishment less
than the statutory maximum of life imprisonment for anyviolation of $ 924(c)(1)(A) avoids the single principle the
Court now gleans from Apprendi: " `Other than the fact of aprior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a
crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum,' whetherthe statute calls it an element or a sentencing factor, `must
be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonabledoubt.' "

Ante, at 550 (quoting Apprendi, supra, at 490).According to the plurality, the historical practices underlying the Court's decision in Apprendi with respect to pen-alties that exceed the statutory maximum do not support extension of Apprendi's rule to facts that increase a defendant'smandatory minimum sentence. Such fine distinctions with
regard to vital constitutional liberties cannot withstandclose scrutiny.

by a jury if that right is not waived. See In re Winship, 397U. S. 358, 364 (1970). As with

Apprendi, this case thus
turns on the seemingly simple question of what constitutes
a "crime."This question cannot be answered by reference to statutory construction alone solely because the sentence does notexceed the statutory maximum. As I discussed at great
length in Apprendi, the original understanding of what factsare elements of a crime was expansive:

"[I]f the legislature defines some core crime and thenprovides for increasing the punishment of that crime
upon a finding of some aggravating fact--of whateversort, including the fact of a prior conviction--the core
crime and the aggravating fact together constitute anaggravated crime, just as much as grand larceny is an
aggravated form of petit larceny. The aggravating factis an element of the aggravated crime. Similarly, if the
legislature, rather than creating grades of crimes, hasprovided for setting the punishment of a crime based on
some fact . . . that fact is also an element. No multifactor parsing of statutes, of the sort that we have at-tempted since

McMillan, is necessary. One need only
look to the kind, degree, or range of punishment towhich the prosecution is by law entitled for a given set

of facts. Each fact for that entitlement is an element."
530 U. S., at 501 (concurring opinion).

The fact that a defendant brandished a firearm indisputably alters the prescribed range of penalties to which he
is exposed under 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A). Without a finding that a defendant brandished or discharged a firearm, the
penalty range for a conviction under $ 924(c)(1)(A)(i) is five

years to life in prison. But with a finding that a defendant
brandished a firearm, the penalty range becomes harsher,
seven years to life imprisonment. $ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii). And
if the court finds that a defendant discharged a firearm,
the range becomes even more severe, 10 years to life.

$ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii). Thus, it is ultimately beside the point
whether as a matter of statutory interpretation brandishing
is a sentencing factor, because as a constitutional matter
brandishing must be deemed an element of an aggravated
offense. See Apprendi, supra, at 483, n. 10 ("[F]acts that
expose a defendant to a punishment greater than that otherwise legally prescribed were by definition `elements' of a separate legal offense").

I agree with the Court that a legislature is free to decree,
within constitutional limits, which facts are elements that
constitute a crime. See ante, at 550. But when the legislature provides that a particular fact shall give rise " `both to
a special stigma and to a special punishment,' " ante, at 560
(plurality opinion) (quoting McMillan, 477 U. S., at 103 (Stevens, J., dissenting)), the constitutional consequences are
clear. As the Court acknowledged in Apprendi, society has
long recognized a necessary link between punishment and
crime, 530 U. S., at 478 ("The defendant's ability to predict
with certainty the judgment from the face of the felony indictment flowed from the invariable linkage of punishment
with crime"). This link makes a great deal of sense: Why,
after all, would anyone care if they were convicted of murder, as opposed to manslaughter, but for the increased penalties for the former offense, which in turn reflect the greater
moral opprobrium society attaches to the act? We made
clear in Apprendi that if a statute " `annexes a higher degree
of punishment' " based on certain circumstances, exposing a
defendant to that higher degree of punishment requires that
those circumstances be charged in the indictment and proved
beyond a reasonable doubt. Id., at 480 (quoting J. Archbold,
Pleading and Evidence in Criminal Cases 51 (15th ed. 1862)).

This constitutional limitation neither interferes with thelegislature's ability to define statutory ranges of punishment

nor calls into question judicial discretion to impose "judg-ment within the range prescribed by statute." Apprendi,
530 U. S., at 481. But it does protect the criminal defend-ant's constitutional right to know, ex ante, those circumstances that will determine the applicable range of punish-ment and to have those circumstances proved beyond a
reasonable doubt:

"If a defendant faces punishment beyond that providedby statute when an offense is committed under certain

circumstances but not others, it is obvious that both theloss of liberty and the stigma attaching to the offense
are heightened; it necessarily follows that the defendantshould not--at the moment the State is put to proof of
those circumstances--be deprived of protections thathave, until that point, unquestionably attached." Id.,
at 484.

B
The Court truncates this protection and holds that "facts,sometimes referred to as sentencing factors," do not need

to be "alleged in the indictment, submitted to the jury, orestablished beyond a reasonable doubt," ante, at 550, so long
as they do not increase the penalty for the crime beyond thestatutory maximum. This is so even if the fact alters the
statutorily mandated sentencing range, by increasing themandatory minimum sentence. But to say that is in effect
to claim that the imposition of a 7-year, rather than a 5-year,mandatory minimum does not change the constitutionally
relevant sentence range because, regardless, either sentencefalls between five years and the statutory maximum of life,
the longest sentence range available under the statute.This analysis is flawed precisely because the statute provides
incremental sentencing ranges, in which the mandatory mini-mum sentence varies upward if a defendant "brandished" or
"discharged" a weapon. As a matter of common sense, an

increased mandatory minimum heightens the loss of libertyand represents the increased stigma society attaches to the

offense. Consequently, facts that trigger an increased man-datory minimum sentence warrant constitutional safeguards.

Actual sentencing practices appear to bolster this conclu-sion. The suggestion that a 7-year sentence could be imposed even without a finding that a defendant brandished a
firearm ignores the fact that the sentence imposed when adefendant is found only to have "carried" a firearm "in relation to" a drug trafficking offense appears to be, almost uni-formly, if not invariably, five years. Similarly, those found
to have brandished a firearm typically, if not always, aresentenced only to 7 years in prison while those found to
have discharged a firearm are sentenced only to 10 years.Cf. United States Sentencing Commission, 2001 Datafile,
USSCFY01, Table 1 (illustrating that almost all persons sen-tenced for violations of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A) are sentenced to 5, 7, or 10 years' imprisonment). This is true even
though anyone convicted of violating $ 924(c)(1)(A) is theoretically eligible to receive a sentence as severe as life imprisonment.4 Yet under the decision today, those key facts actually responsible for fixing a defendant's punishment need not
be charged in an indictment or proved beyond a reasonable
doubt.

The incremental increase between five and seven years in
prison may not seem so great in the abstract (of course it
must seem quite different to a defendant actually being incarcerated). However, the constitutional analysis adopted
by the plurality would hold equally true if the mandatory

4 Indeed it is a certainty that in virtually every instance the sentence
imposed for a $ 924(c)(1)(A) violation is tied directly to the applicable mandatory minimum. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual $ 2K2.4, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2001) (stating clearly that "the guideline sentence for a defendant convicted under 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c) . . . is
the minimum term required by the relevant statute. . . . A sentence above
the minimum term . . . is an upward departure").

minimum for a violation of $ 924(c)(1) without brandishingwas five years, but the mandatory minimum with brandishing was life imprisonment. The result must be the samebecause surely our fundamental constitutional principles cannot alter depending on degrees of sentencing severity. Solong as it was clear that Congress intended for "brandishing"
to be a sentencing factor, that fact would still have to be
neither charged in the indictment nor proved beyond a rea-sonable doubt. But if this is the case, then

Apprendi can
easily be avoided by clever statutory drafting.It is true that

Apprendi concerned a fact that increased
the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum, but the principles upon which it relied apply with
equal force to those facts that expose the defendant to a
higher mandatory minimum: When a fact exposes a defendant to greater punishment than what is otherwise legally
prescribed, that fact is "by definition [an] `elemen[t]' of a separate legal offense." 530 U. S., at 483, n. 10. Whether one
raises the floor or raises the ceiling it is impossible to dispute
that the defendant is exposed to greater punishment than is
otherwise prescribed.

This is no less true because mandatory minimum sentences
are a 20th-century phenomena. As the Government acknowledged at oral argument, this fact means only that
historical practice is not directly dispositive of the question
whether facts triggering mandatory minimums must be
treated like elements. Tr. of Oral Arg. 47. The Court has
not previously suggested that constitutional protection ends
where legislative innovation or ingenuity begins. Looking
to the principles that animated the decision in Apprendi and
the bases for the historical practice upon which Apprendi
rested (rather than to the historical pedigree of mandatory
minimums), there are no logical grounds for treating facts
triggering mandatory minimums any differently than facts
that increase the statutory maximum. In either case the
defendant cannot predict the judgment from the face of the

felony, see 530 U. S., at 478-479, and the absolute statutorylimits of his punishment change, constituting an increased

penalty. In either case the defendant must be afforded theprocedural protections of notice, a jury trial, and a heightened standard of proof with respect to the facts warrantingexposure to a greater penalty. See id., at 490; Jones, 526

McMillan rested on the premise that the " `applicability ofthe reasonable-doubt standard . . . has always been dependent on how a State defines the offense that is charged in anygiven case.' " 477 U. S., at 85 (quoting Patterson v. New
York, 432 U. S. 197, 211, n. 12 (1977)). Thus, it cannot with-stand the logic of Apprendi, at least with respect to facts for
which the legislature has prescribed a new statutory sen-tencing range. McMillan broke from the "traditional understanding" of crime definition, a tradition that "continuedwell into the 20th century, at least until the middle of the
century." Apprendi, supra, at 518 (Thomas, J., concurring).The Court in McMillan did not, therefore, acknowledge that
the change in the prescribed sentence range upon the findingof particular facts changed the prescribed range of penalties
in a constitutionally significant way. Rather, while recog-nizing applicable due process limits, it concluded that the
mandatory minimum at issue did not increase the prescribedrange of penalties but merely required the judge to impose
a specific penalty "within the range already available to it."477 U. S., at 87-88. As discussed,

supra, at 577-579, thisanalysis is inherently flawed.

Jones called into question, and Apprendi firmly limited,a related precept underlying McMillan: namely, the State's
authority to treat aggravated behavior as a factor increasingthe sentence, rather than as an element of the crime. Although the plurality resurrects this principle, see ante, at559-560, 565, it must do so in the face of the Court's contrary

conclusion in Apprendi, which adopts the position taken by
the dissent in McMillan: "[I]f a State provides that a specific
component of a prohibited transaction shall give rise both
to a special stigma and to a special punishment, that component must be treated as a `fact necessary to constitute the
crime' within the meaning of our holding in In re Winship."
477 U. S., at 103 (Stevens, J., dissenting). See Apprendi,
supra, at 483-484.

Nor should stare decisis dictate the outcome in this case;
the stare decisis effect of McMillan is considerably weakened for a variety of reasons. As an initial matter, where
the Court has wrongly decided a constitutional question, the
force of stare decisis is at its weakest. See Ring v. Arizona,
post, at 608; Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997).
And while the relationship between punishment and the constitutional protections attached to the elements of a crime
traces its roots back to the common law, McMillan was decided only 16 years ago.5 No Court of Appeals, let alone
this Court, has held that Apprendi has retroactive effect.
The United States concedes, with respect to prospective application, that it can charge facts upon which a mandatory
minimum sentence is based in the indictment and prove them
to a jury. Tr. of Oral Arg. 42. Consequently, one is hard
pressed to give credence to the plurality's suggestion that
"[i]t is critical not to abandon" McMillan "at this late date."
Ante, at 567. Rather, it is imperative that the Court maintain absolute fidelity to the protections of the individual af5 Mandatory minimum sentence schemes are themselves phenomena of
fairly recent vintage genesis. See ante, at 558-559; see also Apprendi v.
New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 518 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring) ("In fact, it
is fair to say that McMillan began a revolution in the law regarding the
definition of `crime.' Today's decision, far from being a sharp break with
the past, marks nothing more than a return to the status quo ante--the
status quo that reflected the original meaning of the Fifth and Sixth
Amendments").

forded by the notice, trial by jury, and beyond-a-reasonable-doubt requirements.

Finally, before today, no one seriously believed that theCourt's earlier decision in McMillan could coexist with the
logical implications of the Court's later decisions in Apprendiand Jones. In both cases, the dissent said as much:

"The essential holding of McMillan conflicts with atleast two of the several formulations the Court gives to
the rule it announces today. First, the Court endorsesthe following principle: `[I]t is unconstitutional for a legislature to remove from the jury the assessment of facts
that increase the prescribed range of penalties to whicha criminal defendant is exposed. It is equally clear that

such facts must be established by proof beyond a reason-able doubt.' Ante, at 490 (emphasis added) (quoting
Jones, supra, at 252-253 (Stevens, J., concurring)).Second, the Court endorses the rule as restated in

Justice Scalia's concurring opinion in Jones. See ante, at490. There,

Justice Scalia wrote: `[I]t is unconstitu-tional to remove from the jury the assessment of facts

that alter the congressionally prescribed range of penalties to which a criminal defendant is exposed.' Jones,supra, at 253 (emphasis added). Thus, the Court appears to hold that any fact that increases or alters the
range of penalties to which a defendant is exposed--which, by definition, must include increases or alterations to either the minimum or maximum penalties--must be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
In McMillan, however, we rejected such a rule to theextent it concerned those facts that increase or alter the
minimum penalty to which a defendant is exposed. Ac-cordingly, it is incumbent on the Court not only to admit
that it is overruling McMillan, but also to explain whysuch a course of action is appropriate under normal principles of stare decisis." Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 533(O'C

onnor, J., dissenting).

See also Jones, 526 U. S., at 268 (Kennedy, J., dissenting)("[B]y its terms,

Justice Scalia's view . . . would call intoquestion the validity of judge-administered mandatory minimum sentencing provisions, contrary to our holding in McMillan. Once the facts triggering application of the manda-tory minimum are found by the judge, the sentencing range

to which the defendant is exposed is altered"). There is noquestion but that

stare decisis may yield where a prior deci-sion's "underpinnings [have been] eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court." United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S.506, 521 (1995).

Further supporting the essential incompatibility of Ap-prendi and McMillan,

Justice Breyer concurs in the judg-ment but not the entire opinion of the Court, recognizing

that he "cannot easily distinguish Apprendi . . . from thiscase in terms of logic. For that reason, I cannot agree with
the plurality's opinion insofar as it finds such a distinction."

adherence to stare decisis in this case would require infidel-ity to our constitutional values. Because, like most Members of this Court, I cannot logically distinguish the issuehere from the principles underlying the Court's decision in

Syllabus

RING v. ARIZONA
certiorari to the supreme court of arizona

No. 01-488. Argued April 22, 2002--Decided June 24, 2002
At petitioner Ring's Arizona trial for murder and related offenses, the

jury deadlocked on premeditated murder, but found Ring guilty of felony murder occurring in the course of armed robbery. Under Arizona
law, Ring could not be sentenced to death, the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made by a
judge conducting a separate sentencing hearing. The judge at that
stage must determine the existence or nonexistence of statutorily enumerated "aggravating circumstances" and any "mitigating circumstances." The death sentence may be imposed only if the judge finds
at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances
sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. Following such a hearing,
Ring's trial judge sentenced him to death. Because the jury had convicted Ring of felony murder, not premeditated murder, Ring would be
eligible for the death penalty only if he was, inter alia, the victim's
actual killer. See Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782. Citing accomplice testimony at the sentencing hearing, the judge found that Ring
was the killer. The judge then found two aggravating factors, one of
them, that the offense was committed for pecuniary gain, as well as one
mitigating factor, Ring's minimal criminal record, and ruled that the
latter did not call for leniency.

On appeal, Ring argued that Arizona's capital sentencing scheme violates the Sixth Amendment's jury trial guarantee by entrusting to a
judge the finding of a fact raising the defendant's maximum penalty.
See Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227; Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U. S. 466. The State responded that this Court had upheld Arizona's
system in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 649, and had stated in Apprendi that Walton remained good law. The Arizona Supreme Court
observed that Apprendi and Jones cast doubt on Walton's continued
viability and found that the Apprendi majority's interpretation of Arizona law, 530 U. S., at 496-497, was wanting. Justice O'Connor's Apprendi dissent, id., at 538, the Arizona court noted, correctly described
how capital sentencing works in that State: A defendant cannot receive
a death sentence unless the judge makes the factual determination that
a statutory aggravating factor exists. Nevertheless, recognizing that
it was bound by the Supremacy Clause to apply Walton, a decision this
Court had not overruled, the Arizona court rejected Ring's constitu536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
tional attack. It then upheld the trial court's finding on the pecuniary
gain aggravating factor, reweighed that factor against Ring's lack of a
serious criminal record, and affirmed the death sentence.

Held: Walton and Apprendi are irreconcilable; this Court's Sixth Amendment jurisprudence cannot be home to both. Accordingly, Walton is
overruled to the extent that it allows a sentencing judge, sitting without
a jury, to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of
the death penalty. See 497 U. S., at 647-649. Because Arizona's enumerated aggravating factors operate as "the functional equivalent of an
element of a greater offense," Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 494, n. 19, the
Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury. Pp. 597-609.

(a) In upholding Arizona's capital sentencing scheme against a charge
that it violated the Sixth Amendment, the Walton Court ruled that
aggravating factors were not "elements of the offense"; they were "sentencing considerations" guiding the choice between life and death. 497
U. S., at 648. Walton drew support from Cabana v. Bullock, 474 U. S.
376, in which the Court held there was no constitutional bar to an appellate court's finding that a defendant killed, attempted to kill, or intended
to kill, as Enmund, supra, required for imposition of the death penalty
in felony-murder cases. If the Constitution does not require that the
Enmund finding be proved as an element of the capital murder offense
or that a jury make that finding, Walton stated, it could not be concluded that a State must denominate aggravating circumstances "elements" of the offense or commit to a jury only, and not to a judge,
determination of the existence of such circumstances. 497 U. S., at 649.
Subsequently, the Court suggested in Jones that any fact (other than
prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime must
be submitted to a jury, 526 U. S., at 243, n. 6, and distinguished Walton
as having characterized the finding of aggravating facts in the context
of capital sentencing as a choice between a greater and a lesser penalty,
not as a process of raising the sentencing range's ceiling, 526 U. S., at
251. Pp. 597-601.

(b) In Apprendi, the sentencing judge's finding that racial animus motivated the petitioner's weapons offense triggered application of a state
"hate crime enhancement" that doubled the maximum authorized sentence. This Court held that the sentence enhancement violated Apprendi's right to a jury determination whether he was guilty of every
element of the crime with which he was charged, beyond a reasonable
doubt. 530 U. S., at 477. That right attached not only to Apprendi's
weapons offense but also to the "hate crime" aggravating circumstance.
Id., at 476. The dispositive question, the Court said, is one not of form,
but of effect. Id., at 494. If a State makes an increase in a defendant's

Syllabus
authorized punishment contingent on the finding of a fact, that fact--no
matter how the State labels it--must be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See id., at 482-483. A defendant may not be exposed
to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone. Id., at 483.
Walton could be reconciled with Apprendi, the Court asserted: The key
distinction was that an Arizona first-degree murder conviction carried
a maximum sentence of death; once a jury has found the defendant
guilty of all the elements of an offense which carries death as its maximum penalty, it may be left to the judge to decide whether that maximum penalty, rather than a lesser one, ought to be imposed. 530 U. S.,
at 497. In dissent in Apprendi, Justice O'Connor described as "demonstrably untrue" the majority's assertion that the jury makes all the
findings necessary to expose the defendant to a death sentence. Such
a defendant, she emphasized, cannot receive a death sentence unless a
judge makes the critical factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor exists. Id., at 538. Walton, Justice O'Connor's dissent
insisted, if followed, would have required the Court to uphold Apprendi's sentence. 530 U. S., at 537. Pp. 601-603.

(c) Given the Arizona Supreme Court's finding that the Apprendi dissent's portrayal of Arizona's capital sentencing law was precisely right,
and recognizing that the Arizona court's construction of the State's own
law is authoritative, see Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691, this
Court is persuaded that Walton, in relevant part, cannot survive Apprendi's reasoning. In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi, Arizona
first restates the Apprendi majority's ruling that, because Arizona law
specifies death or life imprisonment as the only sentencing options for
the first-degree murder of which Ring was convicted, he was sentenced
within the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict. This
argument overlooks Apprendi's instruction that the relevant inquiry is
one of effect, not form. 530 U. S., at 494. In effect, the required finding of an aggravated circumstance exposed Ring to a greater punishment than that authorized by the guilty verdict. Ibid. The Arizona
first-degree murder statute authorizes a maximum penalty of death only
in a formal sense, id., at 541 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), for it explicitly
cross-references the statutory provision requiring the finding of an aggravating circumstance before imposition of the death penalty. If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument, Apprendi would be reduced to
a "meaningless and formalistic" rule of statutory drafting. See ibid.
Arizona's argument based on the Walton distinction between an offense's elements and sentencing factors is rendered untenable by Ap536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:12] PAGES PGT: OPIN

587Cite as: 536 U. S. 584 (2002)
Syllabus
prendi's repeated instruction that the characterization of a fact or circumstance as an element or a sentencing factor is not determinative of
the question "who decides," judge or jury. See, e. g., 530 U. S., at 492.
Arizona further urges that aggravating circumstances necessary to trigger a death sentence may nonetheless be reserved for judicial determination because death is different: States have constructed elaborate sentencing procedures in death cases because of constraints this Court has
said the Eighth Amendment places on capital sentencing, see, e. g., id.,
at 522-523 (Thomas, J., concurring). Apart from the Eighth Amendment provenance of aggravating factors, however, Arizona presents no
specific reason for excepting capital defendants from the constitutional
protections extended to defendants generally, and none is readily apparent. Id., at 539 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). In various settings, the
Court has interpreted the Constitution to require the addition of an
element or elements to the definition of a crime in order to narrow its
scope. See, e. g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 561-562. If a
legislature responded to such a decision by adding the element the
Court held constitutionally required, surely the Sixth Amendment guarantee would apply to that element. There is no reason to differentiate
capital crimes from all others in this regard. Arizona's suggestion that
judicial authority over the finding of aggravating factors may be a better way to guarantee against the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty is unpersuasive. The Sixth Amendment jury trial right does not
turn on the relative rationality, fairness, or efficiency of potential factfinders. Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 498 (Scalia, J., concurring). In any
event, the superiority of judicial factfinding in capital cases is far from
evident, given that the great majority of States responded to this
Court's Eighth Amendment decisions requiring the presence of aggravating circumstances in capital cases by entrusting those determinations to the jury. Although stare decisis is of fundamental importance
to the rule of law, this Court has overruled prior decisions where, as
here, the necessity and propriety of doing so has been established. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172. Pp. 603-609.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the Sixth Amendment right to a jury
trial in capital prosecutions. In Arizona, following a juryadjudication of a defendant's guilt of first-degree murder, the

trial judge, sitting alone, determines the presence or absenceof the aggravating factors required by Arizona law for imposition of the death penalty.In

Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), this Court held
that Arizona's sentencing scheme was compatible with theSixth Amendment because the additional facts found by the

judge qualified as sentencing considerations, not as "element[s] of the offense of capital murder." Id., at 649. Tenyears later, however, we decided

Apprendi v. New Jersey,
530 U. S. 466 (2000), which held that the Sixth Amendmentdoes not permit a defendant to be "expose[d] . . . to a penalty

exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished accord-ing to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone." Id., at

483. This prescription governs, Apprendi determined, evenif the State characterizes the additional findings made by the
judge as "sentencing factor[s]." Id., at 492.Apprendi's reasoning is irreconcilable with Walton's holding in this regard, and today we overrule Walton in relevantpart. Capital defendants, no less than noncapital defendants, we conclude, are entitled to a jury determination of anyfact on which the legislature conditions an increase in their
maximum punishment. I

At the trial of petitioner Timothy Ring for murder, armedrobbery, and related charges, the prosecutor presented evidence sufficient to permit the jury to find the facts here re-counted. On November 28, 1994, a Wells Fargo armored
van pulled up to the Dillard's department store at Arrow-head Mall in Glendale, Arizona. Tr. 57, 60-61 (Nov. 14,
1996). Courier Dave Moss left the van to pick up moneyinside the store.

Id., at 61, 73-74. When he returned, thevan, and its driver, John Magoch, were gone. Id., at 61-62.

Later that day, Maricopa County Sheriff 's Deputies foundthe van--its doors locked and its engine running--in the
parking lot of a church in Sun City, Arizona. Id., at 99-100(Nov. 13, 1996). Inside the vehicle they found Magoch, dead
from a single gunshot to the head. Id., at 101. According
to Wells Fargo records, more than $562,000 in cash and$271,000 in checks were missing from the van.

Id., at 10
(Nov. 18, 1996).Prompted by an informant's tip, Glendale police sought to

determine whether Ring and his friend James Greenhamwere involved in the robbery. The police investigation revealed that the two had made several expensive cash pur-chases in December 1994 and early 1995.

E. g., id., at 153-
156 (Nov. 14, 1996); id., at 90-94 (Nov. 21, 1996). Wiretaps

were then placed on the telephones of Ring, Greenham, anda third suspect, William Ferguson.

Id., at 19-21 (Nov. 18,
1996).In one recorded phone conversation, Ring told Ferguson

that Ring might "cu[t] off " Greenham because "[h]e's toomuch of a risk": Greenham had indiscreetly flaunted a new
truck in front of his ex-wife. State's Exh. 49A, pp. 11-12.
Ring said he could cut off his associate because he held "both[Greenham's] and mine."

Id., at 11. The police engineered
a local news broadcast about the robbery investigation; theyincluded in the account several intentional inaccuracies.

Tr. 3-5, 13-14 (Nov. 19, 1996). On hearing the broadcastreport, Ring left a message on Greenham's answering machine to "remind me to talk to you tomorrow and tell youabout what was on the news tonight. Very important, and
also fairly good." State's Exh. 55A, p. 2.After a detective left a note on Greenham's door asking
him to call, Tr. 115-118 (Nov. 18, 1996), Ring told Fergusonthat he was puzzled by the attention the police trained on
Greenham. "[H]is house is clean," Ring said; "[m]ine, on the
other hand, contains a very large bag." State's Exh. 70A,p. 7.

On February 14, 1995, police furnished a staged reenactment of the robbery to the local news, and again included
deliberate inaccuracies. Tr. 5 (Nov. 19, 1996). Ferguson
told Ring that he "laughed" when he saw the broadcast, and
Ring called it "humorous." State's Exh. 80A, p. 3. Ferguson said he was "not real worried at all now"; Ring, however,
said he was "slightly concern[ed]" about the possibility that
the police might eventually ask for hair samples. Id., at
3-4.

Two days later, the police executed a search warrant at
Ring's house, discovering a duffel bag in his garage containing more than $271,000 in cash. Tr. 107-108, 111, 125 (Nov.
20, 1996). They also found a note with the number "575,
995" on it, followed by the word "splits" and the letters "F,"
"Y," and "T." Id., at 127-130. The prosecution asserted

Opinion of the Court
that "F" was Ferguson, "Y" was "Yoda" (Greenham's nick-name), and "T" was Timothy Ring.

Id., at 42 (Dec. 5, 1996).
Testifying in his own defense, Ring said the money seizedat his house was startup capital for a construction company

he and Greenham were planning to form. Id., at 10-11 (Dec.3, 1996). Ring testified that he made his share of the money
as a confidential informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and as a bail bondsman and gunsmith. Id., at 162,166-167, 180 (Dec. 2, 1996). But an FBI agent testified that

Ring had been paid only $458, id., at 47 (Nov. 20, 1996), andother evidence showed that Ring had made no more than
$8,800 as a bail bondsman, id., at 48-51 (Nov. 21, 1996); id.,at 21 (Nov. 25, 1996).

The trial judge instructed the jury on alternative chargesof premeditated murder and felony murder. The jury deadlocked on premeditated murder, with 6 of 12 jurors voting toacquit, but convicted Ring of felony murder occurring in the
course of armed robbery. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $$ 13-1105(A) and (B) (West 2001) ("A person commits first degree
murder if . . . [a]cting either alone or with one or more other
persons the person commits or attempts to commit . . . [oneof several enumerated felonies] . . . and in the course of and

in furtherance of the offense or immediate flight from the
offense, the person or another person causes the death of any
person. . . . Homicide, as prescribed in [this provision] requires no specific mental state other than what is required
for the commission of any of the enumerated felonies.").

As later summed up by the Arizona Supreme Court, "the
evidence admitted at trial failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Ring] was a major participant in the armed
robbery or that he actually murdered Magoch." 200 Ariz.
267, 280, 25 P. 3d 1139, 1152 (2001). Although clear evidence
connected Ring to the robbery's proceeds, nothing submitted
at trial put him at the scene of the robbery. See ibid. Furthermore, "[f]or all we know from the trial evidence," the
Arizona court stated, "[Ring] did not participate in, plan, or
even expect the killing. This lack of evidence no doubt ex536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
plains why the jury found [Ring] guilty of felony, but notpremeditated, murder." Ibid.

Under Arizona law, Ring could not be sentenced to death,the statutory maximum penalty for first-degree murder, unless further findings were made. The State's first-degreemurder statute prescribes that the offense "is punishable by
death or life imprisonment as provided by $ 13-703." Ariz.Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-1105(C) (West 2001). The crossreferenced section, $ 13-703, directs the judge who presidedat trial to "conduct a separate sentencing hearing to determine the existence or nonexistence of [certain enumerated]
circumstances . . . for the purpose of determining the sen-tence to be imposed." $ 13-703(C) (West Supp. 2001). The

statute further instructs: "The hearing shall be conductedbefore the court alone. The court alone shall make all factual determinations required by this section or the constitu-tion of the United States or this state."

Ibid.
At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, the judge isto determine the presence or absence of the enumerated

"aggravating circumstances" 1 and any "mitigating circum1 The aggravating circumstances, enumerated in Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann.

$ 13-703(G) (West Supp. 2001), are:

"1. The defendant has been convicted of another offense in the United
States for which under Arizona law a sentence of life imprisonment or
death was imposable.

"2. The defendant was previously convicted of a serious offense,
whether preparatory or completed.

"3. In the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a
grave risk of death to another person or persons in addition to the person
murdered during the commission of the offense.

"4. The defendant procured the commission of the offense by payment,
or promise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value.

"5. The defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.

"6. The defendant committed the offense in an especially heinous, cruel
or depraved manner.

"7. The defendant committed the offense while in the custody of or on
authorized or unauthorized release from the state department of corrections, a law enforcement agency or a county or city jail.

Opinion of the Court
stances." 2 The State's law authorizes the judge to sentence
the defendant to death only if there is at least one aggravating circumstance and "there are no mitigating circumstances
sufficiently substantial to call for leniency." $ 13-703(F).

Between Ring's trial and sentencing hearing, Greenham
pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and armed robbery.
He stipulated to a 271/2-year sentence and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution in the cases against Ring and Ferguson. Tr. 35-37 (Oct. 9, 1997).

Called by the prosecution at Ring's sentencing hearing,
Greenham testified that he, Ring, and Ferguson had been
planning the robbery for several weeks before it occurred.
According to Greenham, Ring "had I guess taken the role as
leader because he laid out all the tactics." Id., at 39. On
the day of the robbery, Greenham said, the three watched the
armored van pull up to the mall. Id., at 45. When Magoch
opened the door to smoke a cigarette, Ring shot him with a
rifle equipped with a homemade silencer. Id., at 42, 44-45.
Greenham then pushed Magoch's body aside and drove the
van away. Id., at 45. At Ring's direction, Greenham drove
to the church parking lot, where he and Ring transferred
the money to Ring's truck. Id., at 46, 48. Later, Greenham
recalled, as the three robbers were dividing up the money,

"8. The defendant has been convicted of one or more other homicides,
as defined in $ 13-1101, which were committed during the commission of
the offense.

"9. The defendant was an adult at the time the offense was committed
or was tried as an adult and the murdered person was under fifteen years
of age or was seventy years of age or older.

"10. The murdered person was an on duty peace officer who was killed
in the course of performing his official duties and the defendant knew, or
should have known, that the murdered person was a peace officer."

2 The statute enumerates certain mitigating circumstances, but the

enumeration is not exclusive. "The court shall consider as mitigating circumstances any factors proffered by the defendant or the state which
are relevant in determining whether to impose a sentence less than
death . . . ." $ 13-703(H).

594 RING v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
Ring upbraided him and Ferguson for "forgetting to congrat-ulate [Ring] on [his] shot."

Id., at 60.
On cross-examination, Greenham acknowledged havingpreviously told Ring's counsel that Ring had nothing to do

with the planning or execution of the robbery. Id., at 85-87.Greenham explained that he had made that prior statement
only because Ring had threatened his life. Id., at 87.
Greenham also acknowledged that he was now testifyingagainst Ring as "pay back" for the threats and for Ring's

interference in Greenham's relationship with Greenham'sex-wife.

Id., at 90-92.
On October 29, 1997, the trial judge entered his "Special
Verdict" sentencing Ring to death. Because Ring was convicted of felony murder, not premeditated murder, the judge
recognized that Ring was eligible for the death penalty only
if he was Magoch's actual killer or if he was "a major participant in the armed robbery that led to the killing and exhibited a reckless disregard or indifference for human life."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a-47a; see Enmund v. Florida, 458
U. S. 782 (1982) (Eighth Amendment requires finding that
felony-murder defendant killed or attempted to kill); Tison
v. Arizona, 481 U. S. 137, 158 (1987) (qualifying Enmund,
and holding that Eighth Amendment permits execution of
felony-murder defendant, who did not kill or attempt to kill,
but who was a "major participa[nt] in the felony committed"
and who demonstrated "reckless indifference to human life").

Citing Greenham's testimony at the sentencing hearing,
the judge concluded that Ring "is the one who shot and killed
Mr. Magoch." App. to Pet. for Cert. 47a. The judge also
found that Ring was a major participant in the robbery and
that armed robbery "is unquestionably a crime which carries
with it a grave risk of death." Ibid.

The judge then turned to the determination of aggravating
and mitigating circumstances. See $ 13-703. He found two
aggravating factors. First, the judge determined that Ring
committed the offense in expectation of receiving something

536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

595Cite as: 536 U. S. 584 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
of "pecuniary value," as described in $ 13-703; "[t]akingthe cash from the armored car was the motive and reason

for Mr. Magoch's murder and not just the result." App. toPet. for Cert. 49a. Second, the judge found that the offense
was committed "in an especially heinous, cruel or depravedmanner."

Ibid. In support of this finding, he cited Ring's
comment, as reported by Greenham at the sentencing hearing, expressing pride in his marksmanship. Id., at 49a-50a.The judge found one nonstatutory mitigating factor: Ring's

"minimal" criminal record. Id., at 52a. In his judgment,that mitigating circumstance did not "call for leniency"; he
therefore sentenced Ring to death. Id., at 53a.

On appeal, Ring argued that Arizona's capital sentencing
scheme violates the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to
the U. S. Constitution because it entrusts to a judge the finding of a fact raising the defendant's maximum penalty. See
Jones v. United States, 526 U. S. 227 (1999); Apprendi v. New
Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). The State, in response, noted
that this Court had upheld Arizona's system in Walton v.
Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), and had stated in Apprendi
that Walton remained good law.

Reviewing the death sentence, the Arizona Supreme
Court made two preliminary observations. Apprendi and
Jones, the Arizona high court said, "raise some question
about the continued viability of Walton." 200 Ariz., at 278,
25 P. 3d, at 1150. The court then examined the Apprendi
majority's interpretation of Arizona law and found it wanting. Apprendi, the Arizona court noted, described Arizona's sentencing system as one that " `requir[es] judges, after
a jury verdict holding a defendant guilty of a capital crime,
to find specific aggravating factors before imposing a sentence of death,' and not as a system that `permits a judge to
determine the existence of a factor which makes a crime a
capital offense.' " 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting
Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 496-497). Justice O'Connor's Apprendi dissent, the Arizona court noted, squarely rejected

536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
596 RING v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
the Apprendi majority's characterization of the Arizona sen-tencing scheme: "A defendant convicted of first-degree murder in Arizona cannot receive a death sentence unless ajudge makes the factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor exists. Without that critical finding, themaximum sentence to which the defendant is exposed is life
imprisonment, and not the death penalty." 200 Ariz., at 279,
25 P. 3d, at 1151 (quoting Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 538).After reciting this Court's divergent constructions of Arizona law in Apprendi, the Arizona Supreme Court describedhow capital sentencing in fact works in the State. The Arizona high court concluded that "the present case is precisely
as described in Justice O'Connor's dissent [in Apprendi]--
Defendant's death sentence required the judge's factual findings." 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151. Although it
agreed with the Apprendi dissent's reading of Arizona law,
the Arizona court understood that it was bound by the Supremacy Clause to apply Walton, which this Court had not
overruled. It therefore rejected Ring's constitutional attack on the State's capital murder judicial sentencing system.
200 Ariz., at 280, 25 P. 3d, at 1152.

The court agreed with Ring that the evidence was insufficient to support the aggravating circumstance of depravity,
id., at 281-282, 25 P. 3d, at 1153-1154, but it upheld the trial
court's finding on the aggravating factor of pecuniary gain.
The Arizona Supreme Court then reweighed that remaining
factor against the sole mitigating circumstance (Ring's lack
of a serious criminal record), and affirmed the death sentence. Id., at 282-284, 25 P. 3d, at 1154-1156.

We granted Ring's petition for a writ of certiorari, 534
U. S. 1103 (2002), to allay uncertainty in the lower courts
caused by the manifest tension between Walton and the reasoning of Apprendi. See, e. g., United States v. Promise, 255
F. 3d 150, 159-160 (CA4 2001) (en banc) (calling the continued
authority of Walton in light of Apprendi "perplexing"); Hoffman v. Arave, 236 F. 3d 523, 542 (CA9 2001) ("Apprendi may

Opinion of the Court
raise some doubt about Walton."); People v. Kaczmarek, 318Ill. App. 3d 340, 351-352, 741 N. E. 2d 1131, 1142 (2000)

("[W]hile it appears Apprendi extends greater constitutionalprotections to noncapital, rather than capital, defendants, the
Court has endorsed this precise principle, and we are in noposition to secondguess that decision here."). We now reverse the judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court.

II
Based solely on the jury's verdict finding Ring guilty offirst-degree felony murder, the maximum punishment he

could have received was life imprisonment. See 200 Ariz.,at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing Ariz. Rev. Stat. $ 13-703).
This was so because, in Arizona, a "death sentence may notlegally be imposed . . . unless at least one aggravating factor
is found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt." 200 Ariz., at279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151 (citing $ 13-703). The question presented is whether that aggravating factor may be found bythe judge, as Arizona law specifies, or whether the Sixth
Amendment's jury trial guarantee,3 made applicable to theStates by the Fourteenth Amendment, requires that the aggravating factor determination be entrusted to the jury.4

3 "In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a . . .
trial, by an impartial jury . . . ."

4 Ring's claim is tightly delineated: He contends only that the Sixth

Amendment required jury findings on the aggravating circumstances asserted against him. No aggravating circumstance related to past convictions in his case; Ring therefore does not challenge Almendarez-Torres v.
United States, 523 U. S. 224 (1998), which held that the fact of prior conviction may be found by the judge even if it increases the statutory maximum
sentence. He makes no Sixth Amendment claim with respect to mitigating circumstances. See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466, 490-491,
n. 16 (2000) (noting "the distinction the Court has often recognized between facts in aggravation of punishment and facts in mitigation" (citation
omitted)). Nor does he argue that the Sixth Amendment required the
jury to make the ultimate determination whether to impose the death
penalty. See Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 252 (1976) (plurality opinion) ("[I]t has never [been] suggested that jury sentencing is constitution536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
598 RING v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
As earlier indicated, see supra, at 588, 595-596, this is notthe first time we have considered the constitutionality of Arizona's capital sentencing system. In Walton v. Arizona, 497U. S. 639 (1990), we upheld Arizona's scheme against a
charge that it violated the Sixth Amendment. The Courthad previously denied a Sixth Amendment challenge to Florida's capital sentencing system, in which the jury recommends a sentence but makes no explicit findings on aggravat-ing circumstances; we so ruled,

Walton noted, on the ground
that "the Sixth Amendment does not require that the specificfindings authorizing the imposition of the sentence of death

be made by the jury." Id., at 648 (quoting Hildwin v. Florida, 490 U. S. 638, 640-641 (1989) (per curiam)). Walton
found unavailing the attempts by the defendant-petitioner inthat case to distinguish Florida's capital sentencing system

from Arizona's. In neither State, according to Walton, werethe aggravating factors "elements of the offense"; in both
States, they ranked as "sentencing considerations" guiding
the choice between life and death. 497 U. S., at 648 (internal
quotation marks omitted).

Walton drew support from Cabana v. Bullock, 474 U. S.
376 (1986), in which the Court held there was no constitutional bar to an appellate court's finding that a defendant
killed, attempted to kill, or intended to kill, as Enmund v.
Florida, 458 U. S. 782 (1982), required for imposition of the
death penalty in felony-murder cases. The Enmund finding
could be made by a court, Walton maintained, because it
entailed no " `element of the crime of capital murder' "; it
"only place[d] `a substantive limitation on sentencing.' " 497

ally required."). He does not question the Arizona Supreme Court's authority to reweigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances after
that court struck one aggravator. See Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S.
738, 745 (1990). Finally, Ring does not contend that his indictment was
constitutionally defective. See Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 477, n. 3 (Fourteenth Amendment "has not . . . been construed to include the Fifth
Amendment right to `presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury' ").

Opinion of the Court
U. S., at 649 (quoting Cabana, 474 U. S., at 385-386). "If the
Constitution does not require that the Enmund finding be
proved as an element of the offense of capital murder, and
does not require a jury to make that finding," Walton stated,
"we cannot conclude that a State is required to denominate
aggravating circumstances `elements' of the offense or permit only a jury to determine the existence of such circumstances." 497 U. S., at 649.

In dissent in Walton, Justice Stevens urged that the
Sixth Amendment requires "a jury determination of facts
that must be established before the death penalty may be
imposed." Id., at 709. Aggravators "operate as statutory
`elements' of capital murder under Arizona law," he reasoned, "because in their absence, [the death] sentence is unavailable." Id., at 709, n. 1. "If th[e] question had been
posed in 1791, when the Sixth Amendment became law," Justice Stevens said, "the answer would have been clear," for
"[b]y that time,

"the English jury's role in determining critical facts in
homicide cases was entrenched. As fact-finder, the jury
had the power to determine not only whether the defendant was guilty of homicide but also the degree of
the offense. Moreover, the jury's role in finding facts
that would determine a homicide defendant's eligibility
for capital punishment was particularly well established. Throughout its history, the jury determined
which homicide defendants would be subject to capital
punishment by making factual determinations, many of
which related to difficult assessments of the defendant's
state of mind. By the time the Bill of Rights was
adopted, the jury's right to make these determinations
was unquestioned." Id., at 710-711 (quoting White,
Fact-Finding and the Death Penalty: The Scope of a
Capital Defendant's Right to Jury Trial, 65 Notre Dame
L. Rev. 1, 10-11 (1989)).

600 RING v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
Walton was revisited in Jones v. United States, 526 U. S.227 (1999). In that case, we construed the federal carjacking statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 2119 (1994 ed. and Supp. V), which,at the time of the criminal conduct at issue, provided that a
person possessing a firearm who "takes a motor vehicle . . .from the person or presence of another by force and violence
or by intimidation . . . shall--(1) be . . . imprisoned not more
than 15 years . . . , (2) if serious bodily injury . . . results,be . . . imprisoned not more than 25 years . . . , and (3) if

death results, be . . . imprisoned for any number of years upto life . . . ." The question presented in

Jones was whether
the statute "defined three distinct offenses or a single crime
with a choice of three maximum penalties, two of them dependent on sentencing factors exempt from the requirements
of charge and jury verdict." 526 U. S., at 229.

The carjacking statute, we recognized, was "susceptible
of [both] constructions"; we adopted the one that avoided
"grave and doubtful constitutional questions." Id., at 239
(quoting United States ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co., 213 U. S. 366, 408 (1909)). Section 2119,
we held, established three separate offenses. Therefore, the
facts--causation of serious bodily injury or death--necessary
to trigger the escalating maximum penalties fell within the
jury's province to decide. See Jones, 526 U. S., at 251-252.
Responding to the dissenting opinion, the Jones Court restated succinctly the principle animating its view that the
carjacking statute, if read to define a single crime, might
violate the Constitution: "[U]nder the Due Process Clause of
the Fifth Amendment and the notice and jury trial guarantees of the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty for a crime
must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and
proven beyond a reasonable doubt." Id., at 243, n. 6.

Jones endeavored to distinguish certain capital sentencing
decisions, including Walton. Advancing a "careful reading
of Walton's rationale," the Jones Court said: Walton "charac536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

601Cite as: 536 U. S. 584 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
terized the finding of aggravating facts falling within thetraditional scope of capital sentencing as a choice between a

greater and a lesser penalty, not as a process of raising theceiling of the sentencing range available." 526 U. S., at 251.

Dissenting in Jones, Justice Kennedy questioned theCourt's account of Walton. The aggravating factors at issue
in Walton, he suggested, were not merely circumstances forconsideration by the trial judge in exercising sentencing discretion within a statutory range of penalties. "Under therelevant Arizona statute,"

Justice Kennedy observed,"Walton could not have been sentenced to death unless the

trial judge found at least one of the enumerated aggravatingfactors. Absent such a finding, the maximum potential punishment provided by law was a term of imprisonment." 526U. S., at 272 (citation omitted). Jones,

Justice Kennedyconcluded, cast doubt--needlessly in his view--on the vitality of Walton:

"If it is constitutionally impermissible to allow a judge'sfinding to increase the maximum punishment for carjacking by 10 years, it is not clear why a judge's findingmay increase the maximum punishment for murder from
imprisonment to death. In fact, Walton would appearto have been a better candidate for the Court's new approach than is the instant case." 526 U. S., at 272.
One year after Jones, the Court decided Apprendi v. NewJersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). The defendant-petitioner in

that case was convicted of, inter alia, second-degree posses-sion of a firearm, an offense carrying a maximum penalty of
ten years under New Jersey law. See id., at 469-470. Onthe prosecutor's motion, the sentencing judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that Apprendi's crime had beenmotivated by racial animus. That finding triggered application of New Jersey's "hate crime enhancement," which dou-bled Apprendi's maximum authorized sentence. The judge
sentenced Apprendi to 12 years in prison, 2 years over themaximum that would have applied but for the enhancement.

602 RING v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
We held that Apprendi's sentence violated his right to
"a jury determination that [he] is guilty of every element of
the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable
doubt." Id., at 477 (quoting United States v. Gaudin, 515
U. S. 506, 510 (1995)). That right attached not only to Apprendi's weapons offense but also to the "hate crime" aggravating circumstance. New Jersey, the Court observed,
"threatened Apprendi with certain pains if he unlawfully
possessed a weapon and with additional pains if he selected
his victims with a purpose to intimidate them because of
their race." Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 476. "Merely using the
label `sentence enhancement' to describe the [second act]
surely does not provide a principled basis for treating [the
two acts] differently." Ibid.

The dispositive question, we said, "is one not of form, but
of effect." Id., at 494. If a State makes an increase in a
defendant's authorized punishment contingent on the finding
of a fact, that fact--no matter how the State labels it--must
be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. See id., at
482-483. A defendant may not be "expose[d] . . . to a penalty exceeding the maximum he would receive if punished
according to the facts reflected in the jury verdict alone."
Id., at 483; see also id., at 499 (Scalia, J., concurring) ("[A]ll
the facts which must exist in order to subject the defendant
to a legally prescribed punishment must be found by the
jury.").

Walton could be reconciled with Apprendi, the Court finally asserted. The key distinction, according to the Apprendi Court, was that a conviction of first-degree murder
in Arizona carried a maximum sentence of death. "[O]nce a
jury has found the defendant guilty of all the elements of an
offense which carries as its maximum penalty the sentence
of death, it may be left to the judge to decide whether that
maximum penalty, rather than a lesser one, ought to be
imposed." 530 U. S., at 497 (emphasis deleted) (quoting

Opinion of the Court
Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 257, n. 2(1998) (

Scalia, J., dissenting)).
The Apprendi dissenters called the Court's distinction of
Walton "baffling." 530 U. S., at 538 (opinion of O'Connor,
J.). The Court claimed that "the jury makes all of the find-ings necessary to expose the defendant to a death sentence."

Ibid. That, the dissent said, was "demonstrably untrue," for
a "defendant convicted of first-degree murder in Arizonacannot receive a death sentence unless a judge makes the

factual determination that a statutory aggravating factor ex-ists. Without that critical finding, the maximum sentence to
which the defendant is exposed is life imprisonment, and not
the death penalty." Ibid. Walton, the Apprendi dissenters
insisted, if properly followed, would have required the Court
to uphold Apprendi's sentence. "If a State can remove from
the jury a factual determination that makes the difference
between life and death, as Walton holds that it can, it is
inconceivable why a State cannot do the same with respect
to a factual determination that results in only a 10-year increase in the maximum sentence to which a defendant is exposed." 530 U. S., at 537 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).

The Arizona Supreme Court, as we earlier recounted, see
supra, at 595-596, found the Apprendi majority's portrayal
of Arizona's capital sentencing law incorrect, and the description in Justice O'Connor's dissent precisely right:
"Defendant's death sentence required the judge's factual
findings." 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d, at 1151. Recognizing
that the Arizona court's construction of the State's own law
is authoritative, see Mullaney v. Wilbur, 421 U. S. 684, 691
(1975), we are persuaded that Walton, in relevant part, cannot survive the reasoning of Apprendi.

In an effort to reconcile its capital sentencing system with
the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by Apprendi, Arizona
first restates the Apprendi majority's portrayal of Arizona's
system: Ring was convicted of first-degree murder, for which
Arizona law specifies "death or life imprisonment" as the

604 RING v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
only sentencing options, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 13-1105(C) (West 2001); Ring was therefore sentenced within

the range of punishment authorized by the jury verdict.See Brief for Respondent 9-19. This argument overlooks
Apprendi's instruction that "the relevant inquiry is one notof form, but of effect." 530 U. S., at 494. In effect, "the
required finding [of an aggravated circumstance] expose[d][Ring] to a greater punishment than that authorized by the
jury's guilty verdict." Ibid.; see 200 Ariz., at 279, 25 P. 3d,at 1151. The Arizona first-degree murder statute "authorizes a maximum penalty of death only in a formal sense,"
Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 541 (O'Connor, J., dissenting), for itexplicitly cross-references the statutory provision requiring

the finding of an aggravating circumstance before imposi-tion of the death penalty. See $ 13-1105(C) ("First degree
murder is a class 1 felony and is punishable by death or lifeimprisonment as provided by $ 13-703." (emphasis added)).
If Arizona prevailed on its opening argument, Apprendiwould be reduced to a "meaningless and formalistic" rule of
statutory drafting. See 530 U. S., at 541 (O'Connor, J.,dissenting).

Arizona also supports the distinction relied upon in Walton between elements of an offense and sentencing factors.See supra, at 598-599; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28-29. As to elevation of the maximum punishment, however, Apprendirenders the argument untenable;

5 Apprendi repeatedly in5 In Harris v. United States, ante, p. 545, a majority of the Court concludes that the distinction between elements and sentencing factors continues to be meaningful as to facts increasing the minimum sentence. See
ante, at 567 (plurality opinion) ("The factual finding in Apprendi extended
the power of the judge, allowing him or her to impose a punishment exceeding what was authorized by the jury. [A] finding [that triggers a
mandatory minimum sentence] restrain[s] the judge's power, limiting his
or her choices within the authorized range. It is quite consistent to maintain that the former type of fact must be submitted to the jury while the
latter need not be."); ante, at 569 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and

Opinion of the Court
structs in that context that the characterization of a fact orcircumstance as an "element" or a "sentencing factor" is not

determinative of the question "who decides," judge or jury.See, e. g., 530 U. S., at 492 (noting New Jersey's contention
that "[t]he required finding of biased purpose is not an `ele-ment' of a distinct hate crime offense, but rather the traditional `sentencing factor' of motive," and calling this argu-ment "nothing more than a disagreement with the rule we
apply today"); id., at 494, n. 19 ("[W]hen the term `sentenceenhancement' is used to describe an increase beyond the
maximum authorized statutory sentence, it is the functionalequivalent of an element of a greater offense than the one
covered by the jury's guilty verdict."); id., at 495 ("[M]erelybecause the state legislature placed its hate crime sentence
enhancer within the sentencing provisions of the criminalcode does not mean that the finding of a biased purpose to
intimidate is not an essential element of the offense." (inter-nal quotation marks omitted)); see also

id., at 501 (Thomas,J., concurring) ("[I]f the legislature defines some core crime

and then provides for increasing the punishment of thatcrime upon a finding of some aggravating fact[,] . . . the core
crime and the aggravating fact together constitute an aggra-vated crime, just as much as grand larceny is an aggravated
form of petit larceny. The aggravating fact is an element ofthe aggravated crime.").

Even if facts increasing punishment beyond the maximumauthorized by a guilty verdict standing alone ordinarily must
be found by a jury, Arizona further urges, aggravating cir-cumstances necessary to trigger a death sentence may nonetheless be reserved for judicial determination. As Arizona'scounsel maintained at oral argument, there is no doubt that

Opinion of the Court
"[d]eath is different." Tr. of Oral Arg. 43. States have constructed elaborate sentencing procedures in death cases, Arizona emphasizes, because of constraints we have said the
Eighth Amendment places on capital sentencing. Brief for
Respondent 21-25 (citing Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238
(1972) (per curiam)); see also Maynard v. Cartwright, 486
U. S. 356, 362 (1988) ("Since Furman, our cases have insisted
that the channeling and limiting of the sentencer's discretion
in imposing the death penalty is a fundamental constitutional
requirement for sufficiently minimizing the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action."); Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 522-
523 (Thomas, J., concurring) ("[I]n the area of capital punishment, unlike any other area, we have imposed special
constraints on a legislature's ability to determine what facts
shall lead to what punishment--we have restricted the legislature's ability to define crimes.").

Apart from the Eighth Amendment provenance of aggravating factors, Arizona presents "no specific reason for
excepting capital defendants from the constitutional protections . . . extend[ed] to defendants generally, and none is
readily apparent." Id., at 539 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).
The notion "that the Eighth Amendment's restriction on a
state legislature's ability to define capital crimes should be
compensated for by permitting States more leeway under
the Fifth and Sixth Amendments in proving an aggravating
fact necessary to a capital sentence . . . is without precedent
in our constitutional jurisprudence." Ibid.

In various settings, we have interpreted the Constitution
to require the addition of an element or elements to the
definition of a criminal offense in order to narrow its scope.
See, e. g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 561-562
(1995) (suggesting that addition to federal gun possession
statute of "express jurisdictional element" requiring connection between weapon and interstate commerce would render
statute constitutional under Commerce Clause); Branden536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

burg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969) (per curiam) (FirstAmendment prohibits States from "proscrib[ing] advocacy of

the use of force or of law violation except where such advo-cacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless
action and is likely to incite or produce such action"); Lambert v. California, 355 U. S. 225, 229 (1957) (Due Process
Clause of Fourteenth Amendment requires "actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability ofsuch knowledge" before ex-felon may be convicted of failing

to register presence in municipality). If a legislature re-sponded to one of these decisions by adding the element we
held constitutionally required, surely the Sixth Amendmentguarantee would apply to that element. We see no reason
to differentiate capital crimes from all others in this regard.Arizona suggests that judicial authority over the finding
of aggravating factors "may . . . be a better way to guaranteeagainst the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty."
Tr. of Oral Arg. 32. The Sixth Amendment jury trial right,however, does not turn on the relative rationality, fairness,
or efficiency of potential factfinders. Entrusting to a judge
the finding of facts necessary to support a death sentence
might be

"an admirably fair and efficient scheme of criminal justice designed for a society that is prepared to leave criminal justice to the State. . . . The founders of the American Republic were not prepared to leave it to the State,
which is why the jury-trial guarantee was one of the
least controversial provisions of the Bill of Rights. It
has never been efficient; but it has always been free."
Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 498 (Scalia, J., concurring).

In any event, the superiority of judicial factfinding in capital
cases is far from evident. Unlike Arizona, the great majority of States responded to this Court's Eighth Amendment

Opinion of the Court
For the reasons stated, we hold that Walton and Apprendiare irreconcilable; our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence cannot be home to both. Accordingly, we overrule Walton tothe extent that it allows a sentencing judge, sitting without
a jury, to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for im-position of the death penalty. See 497 U. S., at 647-649.
Because Arizona's enumerated aggravating factors operateas "the functional equivalent of an element of a greater offense," Apprendi, 530 U. S., at 494, n. 19, the Sixth Amend-ment requires that they be found by a jury.

* * *
"The guarantees of jury trial in the Federal and StateConstitutions reflect a profound judgment about the

way in which law should be enforced and justiceadministered. . . . If the defendant preferred the
common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutoredbut perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single
judge, he was to have it." Duncan v. Louisiana, 391U. S. 145, 155-156 (1968).

The right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amend-ment would be senselessly diminished if it encompassed the
factfinding necessary to increase a defendant's sentence bytwo years, but not the factfinding necessary to put him to
death. We hold that the Sixth Amendment applies to both.The judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court is therefore
reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

7 We do not reach the State's assertion that any error was harmless
because a pecuniary gain finding was implicit in the jury's guilty verdict.
See Neder v. United States, 527 U. S. 1, 25 (1999) (this Court ordinarily
leaves it to lower courts to pass on the harmlessness of error in the first
instance).

Scalia, J., concurring
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,concurring.

The question whether Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639(1990), survives our decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U. S. 466 (2000), confronts me with a difficult choice. Whatcompelled Arizona (and many other States) to specify particular "aggravating factors" that must be found before thedeath penalty can be imposed, see 1973 Ariz. Sess. Laws
ch. 138, $ 5 (originally codified as Ariz. Rev. Stat. $ 13-454),was the line of this Court's cases beginning with Furman v.
Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam). See Walton, 497U. S., at 659-660 (

Scalia, J., concurring in part and concur-ring in judgment). In my view, that line of decisions had no

proper foundation in the Constitution. Id., at 670 (" `[T]heprohibition of the Eighth Amendment relates to the character of the punishment, and not to the process by which it isimposed' " (quoting Gardner v. Florida, 430 U. S. 349, 371
(1977) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting))). I am therefore reluc-tant to magnify the burdens that our Furman jurisprudence
imposes on the States. Better for the Court to have in-vented an evidentiary requirement that a judge can find by
a preponderance of the evidence, than to invent one that a
unanimous jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt.On the other hand, as I wrote i n my dissent i n

Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 248(1998), and as I reaffirmed by joining the opinion for the
Court in Apprendi, I believe that the fundamental meaningof the jury-trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment is that
all facts essential to imposition of the level of punishmentthat the defendant receives--whether the statute calls them
elements of the offense, sentencing factors, or Mary Jane--must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

The quandary is apparent: Should I continue to apply thelast-stated principle when I know that the only reason the
fact is essential is that this Court has mistakenly said that
the Constitution requires state law to impose such "aggra536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

611Cite as: 536 U. S. 584 (2002)
Scalia, J., concurring
vating factors"? In Walton, to tell the truth, the SixthAmendment claim was not put with the clarity it obtained in

Almendarez-Torres and Apprendi. There what the appel-lant argued had to be found by the jury was not all facts
essential to imposition of the death penalty, but rather"

every finding of fact underlying the sentencing decision,"
including not only the aggravating factors without which the
penalty could not be imposed, but also the mitigating factorsthat might induce a sentencer to give a lesser punishment.

497 U. S., at 647 (emphasis added). But even if the pointhad been put with greater clarity in

Walton, I think I still
would have approved the Arizona scheme--I would have
favored the States' freedom to develop their own capital
sentencing procedures (already erroneously abridged by
Furman) over the logic of the Apprendi principle.

Since Walton, I have acquired new wisdom that consists
of two realizations--or, to put it more critically, have discarded old ignorance that consisted of the failure to realize
two things: First, that it is impossible to identify with certainty those aggravating factors whose adoption has been
wrongfully coerced by Furman, as opposed to those that the
State would have adopted in any event. Some States, for
example, already had aggravating-factor requirements for
capital murder (e. g., murder of a peace officer, see 1965 N. Y.
Laws p. 1022 (originally codified at N. Y. Penal Law $ 1045))
when Furman was decided. When such a State has added
aggravating factors, are the new ones the Apprendi-exempt
product of Furman, and the old ones not? And even as to
those States that did not previously have aggravating-factor
requirements, who is to say that their adoption of a new one
today--or, for that matter, even their retention of old ones
adopted immediately post-Furman--is still the product of
that case, and not of a changed social belief that murder simpliciter does not deserve death?

Second, and more important, my observing over the past
12 years the accelerating propensity of both state and federal

536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN
612 RING v. ARIZONA

Scalia, J., concurring
legislatures to adopt "sentencing factors" determined byjudges that increase punishment beyond what is authorized

by the jury's verdict, and my witnessing the belief of a nearmajority of my colleagues that this novel practice is perfectly
OK, see Apprendi, supra, at 523 (O'Connor, J., dissenting),cause me to believe that our people's traditional belief in the
right of trial by jury is in perilous decline. That decline is
bound to be confirmed, and indeed accelerated, by the re-peated spectacle of a man's going to his death because

a judge found that an aggravating factor existed. We can-not preserve our veneration for the protection of the jury in
criminal cases if we render ourselves callous to the need for
that protection by regularly imposing the death penalty
without it.

Accordingly, whether or not the States have been erroneously coerced into the adoption of "aggravating factors,"
wherever those factors exist they must be subject to the
usual requirements of the common law, and to the requirement enshrined in our Constitution, in criminal cases: they
must be found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

I add one further point, lest the holding of today's decision
be confused by the separate concurrence. Justice Breyer,
who refuses to accept Apprendi, see 530 U. S., at 555 (dissenting opinion); see also Harris v. United States, ante, at
569 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), nonetheless concurs in today's judgment because he
"believe[s] that jury sentencing in capital cases is mandated
by the Eighth Amendment." Post, at 614 (opinion concurring in judgment). While I am, as always, pleased to travel
in Justice Breyer's company, the unfortunate fact is that
today's judgment has nothing to do with jury sentencing.
What today's decision says is that the jury must find the
existence of the fact that an aggravating factor existed.
Those States that leave the ultimate life-or-death decision to
the judge may continue to do so--by requiring a prior jury
finding of aggravating factor in the sentencing phase or,

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
more simply, by placing the aggravating-factor determina-tion (where it logically belongs anyway) in the guilt phase.

There is really no way in which Justice Breyer can travelwith the happy band that reaches today's result unless he
says yes to Apprendi. Concisely put, Justice Breyer ison the wrong flight; he should either get off before the doors
close, or buy a ticket to Apprendi-land.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
Though it is still my view that Apprendi v. New Jersey,530 U. S. 466 (2000), was wrongly decided, Apprendi is now

the law, and its holding must be implemented in a principledway. As the Court suggests, no principled reading of Apprendi would allow Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990),to stand. It is beyond question that during the penalty
phase of a first-degree murder prosecution in Arizona, thefinding of an aggravating circumstance exposes "the defendant to a greater punishment than that authorized by thejury's guilty verdict." Apprendi, supra, at 494. When a
finding has this effect, Apprendi makes clear, it cannot bereserved for the judge.

This is not to say Apprendi should be extended withoutcaution, for the States' settled expectations deserve our respect. A sound understanding of the Sixth Amendment willallow States to respond to the needs and realities of criminal
justice administration, and Apprendi can be read as leavingin place many reforms designed to reduce unfairness in sentencing. I agree with the Court, however, that Apprendiand

Walton cannot stand together as the law.With these observations I join the opinion of the Court.

Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment.

ante, at 569 (opinion concurring in part and concurring injudgment), I cannot join the Court's opinion. I concur in the

judgment, however, because I believe that jury sentencingin capital cases is mandated by the Eighth Amendment.

II
This Court has held that the Eighth Amendment requiresStates to apply special procedural safeguards when they

seek the death penalty. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153(1976). Otherwise, the constitutional prohibition against
"cruel and unusual punishments" would forbid its use. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972) (per curiam). Justice
Stevens has written that those safeguards include a re-quirement that a

jury impose any sentence of death. Har-ris v. Alabama, 513 U. S. 504, 515-526 (1995) (dissenting

opinion); Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S. 447, 467-490 (1984)(

Stevens, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concur-ring in part and dissenting in part). Although I joined the

majority in Harris v. Alabama, I have come to agree withthe dissenting view, and with the related views of others
upon which it in part relies, see Gregg, supra, at 190 ( jointopinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.). Cf. Hensleev. Union Planters Nat. Bank & Trust Co., 335 U. S. 595, 600

(1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) ("Wisdom too often nevercomes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it
comes late"). I therefore conclude that the Eighth Amend-ment requires that a jury, not a judge, make the decision to
sentence a defendant to death.I am convinced by the reasons that

Justice Stevens hasgiven. These include (1) his belief that retribution provides

the main justification for capital punishment, and (2) his as-sessment of the jury's comparative advantage in determining, in a particular case, whether capital punishment willserve that end.

As to the first, I note the continued difficulty of justifyingcapital punishment in terms of its ability to deter crime, to

incapacitate offenders, or to rehabilitate criminals. Studiesof deterrence are, at most, inconclusive. See,

e. g., Sorensen,
Wrinkle, Brewer, & Marquart, Capital Punishment and De-terrence: Examining the Effect of Executions on Murder in

Texas, 45 Crime & Delinquency 481 (1999) (no evidence of adeterrent effect); Bonner & Fessenden, Absence of Executions: A special report, States With No Death Penalty Share
Lower Homicide Rates, N. Y. Times, Sept. 22, 2000, p. A1(during last 20 years, homicide rate in death penalty States

has been 48% to 101% higher than in non-death-penaltyStates); see also Radelet & Akers, Deterrence and the Death
Penalty: The Views of the Experts, 87 J. Crim. L. & C. 1, 8
(1996) (over 80% of criminologists believe existing research
fails to support deterrence justification).

As to incapacitation, few offenders sentenced to life without parole (as an alternative to death) commit further crimes.
See, e. g., Sorensen & Pilgrim, An Actuarial Risk Assessment
of Violence Posed by Capital Murder Defendants, 90 J. Crim.
L. & C. 1251, 1256 (2000) (studies find average repeat murder
rate of .002% among murderers whose death sentences were
commuted); Marquart & Sorensen, A National Study of the
Furman-Commuted Inmates: Assessing the Threat to Society from Capital Offenders, 23 Loyola (LA) L. Rev. 5, 26
(1989) (98% did not kill again either in prison or in free society). But see Roberts v. Louisiana, 428 U. S. 325, 354 (1976)
(White, J., dissenting) ("[D]eath finally forecloses the possibility that a prisoner will commit further crimes, whereas
life imprisonment does not"). And rehabilitation, obviously,
is beside the point.

In respect to retribution, jurors possess an important comparative advantage over judges. In principle, they are more
attuned to "the community's moral sensibility," Spaziano,
468 U. S., at 481 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), because they "reflect more accurately the composition and experiences of the community as a whole," id.,
at 486. Hence they are more likely to "express the con536US2 Unit: $U77 [12-23-03 07:24:13] PAGES PGT: OPIN

science of the community on the ultimate question of life ordeath,"

Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510, 519 (1968), and
better able to determine in the particular case the need forretribution, namely, "an expression of the community's belief

that certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront tohumanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death." Gregg, supra, at 184 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).Nor is the fact that some judges are democratically elected

likely to change the jury's comparative advantage in this re-spect. Even in jurisdictions where judges are selected directly by the people, the jury remains uniquely capable of
determining whether, given the community's views, capital
punishment is appropriate in the particular case at hand.
See Harris, 513 U. S., at 518-519 (Stevens, J., dissenting);
see also J. Liebman et al., A Broken System, Part II: Why
There Is So Much Error in Capital Cases, and What Can Be
Done About It 405-406 (Feb. 11, 2002) (hereinafter A Broken
System) (finding that judges who override jury verdicts for
life are especially likely to commit serious errors); cf.
Epstein & King, The Rules of Inference, 69 U. Chi. L. Rev.
1 (2002) (noting dangers in much scholarly research but generally approving of Liebman).

The importance of trying to translate a community's sense
of capital punishment's appropriateness in a particular case
is underscored by the continued division of opinion as to
whether capital punishment is in all circumstances, as currently administered, "cruel and unusual." Those who make
this claim point, among other things, to the fact that death
is not reversible, and to death sentences imposed upon those
whose convictions proved unreliable. See, e. g., Weinstein,

death penalty, adding that the race of the victim and socioeconomic factors seem to matter. See, e. g., U. S. GeneralAccounting Office, Report to Senate and House Committees

on the Judiciary: Death Penalty Sentencing 5 (Feb. 1990)(synthesis of 28 studies shows "pattern of evidence indicating
racial disparities in the charging, sentencing, and imposition

1999): A Legal and Empirical Analysis 95-100 (Oct. 10, 2001)
(death sentences almost five times more likely when victim
is of a high socio-economic status).

They argue that the delays that increasingly accompany
sentences of death make those sentences unconstitutional
because of "the suffering inherent in a prolonged wait for
execution." Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990, 994 (1999)
(Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (arguing
that the Court should consider the question); see, e. g.,
Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995) (Stevens, J., respecting denial of certiorari); Bureau of Justice Statistics, Capital

years, with 52 people waiting more than 20 years and some
more than 25).

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
They point to the inadequacy of representation in capitalcases, a fact that aggravates the other failings. See,

e. g.,
Bright, Counsel for the Poor: The Death Sentence Not forthe Worst Crime but for the Worst Lawyer, 103 Yale L. J.

1835 (1994) (describing many studies discussing deficient cap-ital representation).

And they note that other nations have increasingly abandoned capital punishment. See, e. g., San Martin, U. S.Taken to Task Over Death Penalty, Miami Herald, May 31,

2001, p. 1 (United States is only Western industrialized Na-tion that authorizes the death penalty); Amnesty International Website Against the Death Penalty, Facts and Figures
on the Death Penalty (2002), http://www.web.amnesty.org/
rmp/dplibrary.nsf (since Gregg, 111 countries have either
abandoned the penalty altogether, reserved it only for exceptional crimes like wartime crimes, or not carried out executions for at least the past 10 years); DeYoung, Group Criticizes U. S. on Detainee Policy; Amnesty Warns of Human
Rights Fallout, Washington Post, May 28, 2002, p. A4 (the
United States rates fourth in number of executions, after
China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia).

Many communities may have accepted some or all of these
claims, for they do not impose capital sentences. See A Broken System, App. B, Table 11A (more than two-thirds of
American counties have never imposed the death penalty
since Gregg (2,064 out of 3,066), and only 3% of the Nation's
counties account for 50% of the Nation's death sentences (92
out of 3,066)). Leaving questions of arbitrariness aside, this
diversity argues strongly for procedures that will help assure that, in a particular case, the community indeed believes
application of the death penalty is appropriate, not "cruel,"
"unusual," or otherwise unwarranted.

For these reasons, the danger of unwarranted imposition
of the penalty cannot be avoided unless "the decision to impose the death penalty is made by a jury rather than by
a single governmental official." Spaziano, 468 U. S., at 469

prohibits excessive or disproportionate punishment). And Iconclude that the Eighth Amendment requires individual
jurors to make, and to take responsibility for, a decisionto sentence a person to death.

Justice O'Connor, with whom The Chief Justicejoins, dissenting.
I understand why the Court holds that the reasoning of
Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000), is irreconcilablewith

Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). Yet in choos-ing which to overrule, I would choose Apprendi, not Walton.

I continue to believe, for the reasons I articulated in mydissent in Apprendi, that the decision in Apprendi was a
serious mistake. As I argued in that dissent, Apprendi'srule that any fact that increases the maximum penalty must
be treated as an element of the crime is not required by theConstitution, by history, or by our prior cases. See 530
U. S., at 524-552. Indeed, the rule directly contradicts sev-eral of our prior cases. See id., at 531-539 (explaining that
the rule conflicts with Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197
(1977), Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224(1998), and

Walton, supra). And it ignores the "significant
history in this country of . . . discretionary sentencing byjudges." 530 U. S., at 544 (O'C

onnor, J., dissenting). The
Court has failed, both in Apprendi and in the decision an-nounced today, to "offer any meaningful justification for deviating from years of cases both suggesting and holding thatapplication of the `increase in the maximum penalty' rule is
not required by the Constitution." Id., at 539.Not only was the decision in

Apprendi unjustified in my
view, but it has also had a severely destabilizing effect onour criminal justice system. I predicted in my dissent that

the decision would "unleash a flood of petitions by convicted
defendants seeking to invalidate their sentences in whole or

in part on the authority of [Apprendi]." Id., at 551. Asof May 31, 2002, less than two years after Apprendi was

announced, the United States Courts of Appeals had decidedapproximately 1,802 criminal appeals in which defendants
challenged their sentences, and in some cases even their con-victions, under Apprendi.

1 These federal appeals are likely

only the tip of the iceberg, as federal criminal prosecutionsrepresent a tiny fraction of the total number of criminal

prosecutions nationwide. See ibid. (O'Connor, J., dissent-ing) ("In 1998 . . . federal criminal prosecutions represented
only about 0.4% of the total number of criminal prosecutionsin federal and state courts"). The number of second or successive habeas corpus petitions filed in the federal courtsalso increased by 77% in 2001, a phenomenon the Administrative Office of the United States Courts attributes to prison-ers bringing

Apprendi claims. Administrative Office of theU. S. Courts, 2001 Judicial Business 17. This Court has

been similarly overwhelmed by the aftershocks of Apprendi.A survey of the petitions for certiorari we received in the
past year indicates that 18% raised Apprendi-relatedclaims.

2 It is simply beyond dispute that Apprendi threw

countless criminal sentences into doubt and thereby causedan enormous increase in the workload of an already overburdened judiciary.The decision today is only going to add to these already
serious effects. The Court effectively declares five States'capital sentencing schemes unconstitutional. See

ante, at608, n. 6 (identifying Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and Nebraska as having sentencing schemes like Arizona's). Thereare 168 prisoners on death row in these States, Criminal Justice Project of the NAACP Legal Defense and EducationalFund, Inc., Death Row U. S. A. (Spring 2002), each of whom

is now likely to challenge his or her death sentence.I believe many of these challenges will ultimately be unsuccessful, either because the prisoners will be unable to sat-isfy the standards of harmless error or plain error review,
or because, having completed their direct appeals, theywill be barred from taking advantage of today's holding on
federal collateral review. See 28 U. S. C. $$ 2244(b)(2)(A),2254(d)(1);

Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989). Nonethe-less, the need to evaluate these claims will greatly burden

the courts in these five States. In addition, I fear that theprisoners on death row in Alabama, Delaware, Florida, and
Indiana, which the Court identifies as having hybrid sentenc-ing schemes in which the jury renders an advisory verdict
but the judge makes the ultimate sentencing determination,see ante, at 608, n. 6, may also seize on today's decision to
challenge their sentences. There are 629 prisoners on deathrow in these States. Criminal Justice Project, supra.

By expanding on Apprendi, the Court today exacerbatesthe harm done in that case. Consistent with my dissent,
I would overrule Apprendi rather than Walton.

UNITED STATES v. RUIZ
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-595. Argued April 24, 2002--Decided June 24, 2002
After immigration agents found marijuana in respondent Ruiz's luggage,

federal prosecutors offered her a "fast track" plea bargain, whereby she
would waive indictment, trial, and an appeal in exchange for a reduced
sentence recommendation. Among other things, the prosecutors'
standard "fast track" plea agreement acknowledges the Government's
continuing duty to turn over information establishing the defendant's
factual innocence, but requires that she waive the right to receive impeachment information relating to any informants or other witnesses,
as well as information supporting any affirmative defense she raises
if the case goes to trial. Because Ruiz would not agree to the latter
waiver, the prosecutors withdrew their bargaining offer, and she was
indicted for unlawful drug possession. Despite the absence of a plea
agreement, Ruiz ultimately pleaded guilty. At sentencing, she asked
the judge to grant her the same reduced sentence that the Government
would have recommended had she accepted the plea bargain. The Government opposed her request, and the District Court denied it. In vacating the sentence, the Ninth Circuit took jurisdiction under 18 U. S. C.

$ 3742; noted that the Constitution requires prosecutors to make certain
impeachment information available to a defendant before trial; decided
that this obligation entitles defendants to the information before they
enter into a plea agreement; ruled that the Constitution prohibits defendants from waiving their right to the information; and held that the
"fast track" agreement was unlawful because it insisted upon such a
waiver.

Held:

1. Appellate jurisdiction was proper under $ 3742(a)(1), which permits
appellate review of a sentence "imposed in violation of law." Respondent's sentence would have been so imposed if her constitutional claim
were sound. Thus, if she had prevailed on the merits, her victory
would also have confirmed the Ninth Circuit's jurisdiction. Although
this Court ultimately concludes that respondent's sentence was not "imposed in violation of law" and therefore that $ 3742(a)(1) does not authorize an appeal in a case of this kind, it is familiar law that a federal court
always has jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction. See United
States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 291. In order to make that deter536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

623Cite as: 536 U. S. 622 (2002)
Syllabus
mination, it was necessary for the Ninth Circuit to address the merits.
Pp. 626-628.

2. The Constitution does not require the Government to disclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering a plea agreement with a
criminal defendant. Although the Fifth and Sixth Amendments provide, as part of the Constitution's "fair trial" guarantee, that defendants
have the right to receive exculpatory impeachment material from prosecutors, see, e. g., Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87, a defendant who
pleads guilty forgoes a fair trial as well as various other accompanying
constitutional guarantees, Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243. As
a result, the Constitution insists that the defendant enter a guilty plea
that is "voluntary" and make related waivers "knowing[ly], intelligent[ly], [and] with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances
and likely consequences." See, e. g., id., at 242. The Ninth Circuit in
effect held that a guilty plea is not "voluntary" (and that the defendant
could not, by pleading guilty, waive his right to a fair trial) unless the
prosecutors first made the same disclosure of material impeachment information that they would have had to make had the defendant insisted
upon a trial. Several considerations, taken together, demonstrate that
holding's error. First, impeachment information is special in relation
to a trial's fairness, not in respect to whether a plea is voluntary. It
is particularly difficult to characterize such information as critical, given
the random way in which it may, or may not, help a particular defendant.
The degree of help will depend upon the defendant's own independent
knowledge of the prosecution's potential case--a matter that the Constitution does not require prosecutors to disclose. Second, there is no
legal authority that provides significant support for the Ninth Circuit's
decision. To the contrary, this Court has found that the Constitution,
in respect to a defendant's awareness of relevant circumstances, does
not require complete knowledge, but permits a court to accept a guilty
plea, with its accompanying waiver of various constitutional rights, despite various forms of misapprehension under which a defendant might
labor. See, e. g., Brady v. United States, 397 U. S. 742, 757. Third, the
very due process considerations that have led the Court to find trialrelated rights to exculpatory and impeachment information--e. g., the
nature of the private interest at stake, the value of the additional safeguard, and the requirement's adverse impact on the Government's interests, Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 77--argue against the existence of
the "right" the Ninth Circuit found. Here, that right's added value to
the defendant is often limited, given that the Government will provide
information establishing factual innocence under the proposed plea
agreement, and that the defendant has other guilty-plea safeguards, see
Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11. Moreover, the Ninth Circuit's rule could se536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

riously interfere with the Government's interest in securing guilty pleas
by disrupting ongoing investigations and exposing prospective witnesses to serious intimidation and harm, thereby forcing the Government to modify its current practice, devote substantially more resources
to preplea trial preparation, or abandon its heavy reliance on plea bargaining. Due process cannot demand so radical a change in order to
achieve so comparatively small a constitutional benefit. Pp. 628-633.

3. Although the "fast track" plea agreement requires a defendant to
waive her right to affirmative defense information, the Court does not
believe, for most of the foregoing reasons, that the Constitution requires
provision of this information to the defendant prior to plea bargaining.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.
In this case we primarily consider whether the Fifth and
Sixth Amendments require federal prosecutors, before entering into a binding plea agreement with a criminal defendant, to disclose "impeachment information relating to
any informants or other witnesses." App. to Pet. for Cert.
46a. We hold that the Constitution does not require that
disclosure.

I

After immigration agents found 30 kilograms of marijuana
in Angela Ruiz's luggage, federal prosecutors offered her
what is known in the Southern District of California as a
"fast track" plea bargain. That bargain--standard in that
district--asks a defendant to waive indictment, trial, and an
appeal. In return, the Government agrees to recommend to
the sentencing judge a two-level departure downward from
the otherwise applicable United States Sentencing Guidelines sentence. In Ruiz's case, a two-level departure downward would have shortened the ordinary Guidelines-specified
18-to-24-month sentencing range by 6 months, to 12-to-18
months. 241 F. 3d 1157, 1161 (2001).

The prosecutors' proposed plea agreement contains a set of
detailed terms. Among other things, it specifies that "any
[known] information establishing the factual innocence of the
defendant" "has been turned over to the defendant," and it
acknowledges the Government's "continuing duty to provide
such information." App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a-46a. At the
same time it requires that the defendant "waiv[e] the right"
to receive "impeachment information relating to any informants or other witnesses" as well as the right to receive information supporting any affirmative defense the defendant
raises if the case goes to trial. Id., at 46a. Because Ruiz
would not agree to this last-mentioned waiver, the prosecutors withdrew their bargaining offer. The Government then
indicted Ruiz for unlawful drug possession. And despite

Opinion of the Court
the absence of any agreement, Ruiz ultimately pleadedguilty.

At sentencing, Ruiz asked the judge to grant her the sametwo-level downward departure that the Government would
have recommended had she accepted the "fast track" agree-ment. The Government opposed her request, and the District Court denied it, imposing a standard Guideline sentenceinstead. 241 F. 3d, at 1161.

Relying on 18 U. S. C. $ 3742, see infra, at 627, 628-629,Ruiz appealed her sentence to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit vacatedthe District Court's sentencing determination. The Ninth
Circuit pointed out that the Constitution requires prosecu-tors to make certain impeachment information available to a
defendant before trial. 241 F. 3d, at 1166. It decided thatthis obligation entitles defendants to receive that same information before they enter into a plea agreement. Id., at1164. The Ninth Circuit also decided that the Constitution
prohibits defendants from waiving their right to that infor-mation. Id., at 1165-1166. And it held that the prosecutors' standard "fast track" plea agreement was unlawful be-cause it insisted upon that waiver. Id., at 1167. The Ninth
Circuit remanded the case so that the District Court coulddecide any related factual disputes and determine an appropriate remedy. Id., at 1169.The Government sought certiorari. It stressed what it
considered serious adverse practical implications of theNinth Circuit's constitutional holding. And it added that
the holding is unique among courts of appeals. Pet. forCert. 8. We granted the Government's petition. 534 U. S.

At the outset, we note that a question of statutory juris-diction potentially blocks our consideration of the Ninth
Circuit's constitutional holding. The relevant statute saysthat a

Opinion of the Court
"defendant may file a notice of appeal . . . for review . . .if the sentence

"(1) was imposed in violation of law;"(2) was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines; or"(3) is greater than [the Guideline] specified [sentence] . . . ; or"(4) was imposed for an offense for which there is no
sentencing guideline and is plainly unreasonable." 18U. S. C. $ 3742(a).

Every Circuit has held that this statute does not authorize adefendant to appeal a sentence where the ground for appeal
consists of a claim that the district court abused its discretionin refusing to depart. See,

e. g., United States v. Conway,81 F. 3d 15, 16 (CA1 1996); United States v. Lawal, 17 F. 3d

560, 562 (CA2 1994); United States v. Powell, 269 F. 3d 175,179 (CA3 2001); United States v. Ivester, 75 F. 3d 182, 183
(CA4 1996); United States v. Cooper, 274 F. 3d 230, 248 (CA52001); United States v. Scott, 74 F. 3d 107, 112 (CA6 1996);
United States v. Byrd, 263 F. 3d 705, 707 (CA7 2001); UnitedStates v. Mora-Higuera, 269 F. 3d 905, 913 (CA8 2001);
United States v. Garcia-Garcia, 927 F. 2d 489, 490 (CA91991); United States v. Coddington, 118 F. 3d 1439, 1441
(CA10 1997); United States v. Calderon, 127 F. 3d 1314, 1342(CA11 1997);

In re Sealed Case No. 98-3116, 199 F. 3d 488,491-492 (CADC 1999).

The statute does, however, authorize an appeal from a sen-tence that "was imposed in violation of law." Two quite different theories might support appellate jurisdiction pursuantto that provision. First, as the Court of Appeals recognized,
if the District Court's sentencing decision rested on a mis-taken belief that it lacked the legal power to grant a departure, the quoted provision would apply. 241 F. 3d, at 1162,n. 2. Our reading of the record, however, convinces us that
the District Judge correctly understood that he had such dis-cretion but decided not to exercise it. We therefore reject

628 UNITED STATES v. RUIZ

Opinion of the Court
that basis for finding appellate jurisdiction. Second, if re-spondent's constitutional claim, discussed in Part III, infra,

were sound, her sentence would have been "imposed in viola-tion of law." Thus, if she had prevailed on the merits, her
victory would also have confirmed the jurisdiction of theCourt of Appeals.

Although we ultimately conclude that respondent's sen-tence was not "imposed in violation of law" and therefore
that $ 3742(a)(1) does not authorize an appeal in a case ofthis kind, it is familiar law that a federal court always has
jurisdiction to determine its own jurisdiction. See United
States v. Mine Workers, 330 U. S. 258, 291 (1947). In orderto make that determination, it was necessary for the Ninth

Circuit to address the merits. We therefore hold that appel-late jurisdiction was proper.

III
The constitutional question concerns a federal criminal de-fendant's waiver of the right to receive from prosecutors exculpatory impeachment material--a right that the Constitu-tion provides as part of its basic "fair trial" guarantee. See
U. S. Const., Amdts. 5, 6. See also Brady v. Maryland, 373U. S. 83, 87 (1963) (Due process requires prosecutors to
"avoi[d] . . . an unfair trial" by making available "upon re-quest" evidence "favorable to an accused . . . where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment"); United
States v. Agurs, 427 U. S. 97, 112-113 (1976) (defense requestunnecessary); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U. S. 419, 435 (1995) (exculpatory evidence is evidence the suppression of whichwould "undermine confidence in the verdict"); Giglio v.
United States, 405 U. S. 150, 154 (1972) (exculpatory evidenceincludes "evidence affecting" witness "credibility," where
the witness' "reliability" is likely "determinative of guilt orinnocence").

When a defendant pleads guilty he or she, of course, for-goes not only a fair trial, but also other accompanying consti536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

629Cite as: 536 U. S. 622 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
tutional guarantees. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U. S. 238, 243(1969) (pleading guilty implicates the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the Sixth Amendment rightto confront one's accusers, and the Sixth Amendment right
to trial by jury). Given the seriousness of the matter, theConstitution insists, among other things, that the defendant
enter a guilty plea that is "voluntary" and that the defendant
must make related waivers "knowing[ly], intelligent[ly],[and] with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances

and likely consequences." Brady v. United States, 397 U. S.742, 748 (1970); see also

Boykin, supra, at 242.
In this case, the Ninth Circuit in effect held that a guilty
plea is not "voluntary" (and that the defendant could not, by
pleading guilty, waive her right to a fair trial) unless the
prosecutors first made the same disclosure of material impeachment information that the prosecutors would have had
to make had the defendant insisted upon a trial. We must
decide whether the Constitution requires that preguilty plea
disclosure of impeachment information. We conclude that
it does not.

First, impeachment information is special in relation to the
fairness of a trial, not in respect to whether a plea is voluntary ("knowing," "intelligent," and "sufficient[ly] aware").
Of course, the more information the defendant has, the more
aware he is of the likely consequences of a plea, waiver, or
decision, and the wiser that decision will likely be. But the
Constitution does not require the prosecutor to share all useful information with the defendant. Weatherford v. Bursey,
429 U. S. 545, 559 (1977) ("There is no general constitutional
right to discovery in a criminal case"). And the law ordinarily considers a waiver knowing, intelligent, and sufficiently aware if the defendant fully understands the nature
of the right and how it would likely apply in general in the
circumstances--even though the defendant may not know
the specific detailed consequences of invoking it. A defendant, for example, may waive his right to remain silent, his

Opinion of the Court
right to a jury trial, or his right to counsel even if the defend-ant does not know the specific questions the authorities intend to ask, who will likely serve on the jury, or the particu-lar lawyer the State might otherwise provide. Cf.

Colorado
v. Spring, 479 U. S. 564, 573-575 (1987) (Fifth Amendmentprivilege against self-incrimination waived when defendant

received standard Miranda warnings regarding the nature
of the right but not told the specific interrogation questionsto be asked).

It is particularly difficult to characterize impeachment in-formation as critical information of which the defendant
must always be aware prior to pleading guilty given the random way in which such information may, or may not, help a
particular defendant. The degree of help that impeachment
information can provide will depend upon the defendant's
own independent knowledge of the prosecution's potential
case--a matter that the Constitution does not require prosecutors to disclose.

Second, we have found no legal authority embodied either
in this Court's past cases or in cases from other circuits that
provides significant support for the Ninth Circuit's decision.
To the contrary, this Court has found that the Constitution,
in respect to a defendant's awareness of relevant circumstances, does not require complete knowledge of the relevant
circumstances, but permits a court to accept a guilty plea,
with its accompanying waiver of various constitutional
rights, despite various forms of misapprehension under
which a defendant might labor. See Brady v. United States,
397 U. S., at 757 (defendant "misapprehended the quality of
the State's case"); ibid. (defendant misapprehended "the
likely penalties"); ibid. (defendant failed to "anticipate" a
change in the law regarding relevant "punishments"); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U. S. 759, 770 (1970) (counsel "misjudged the admissibility" of a "confession"); United States v.
Broce, 488 U. S. 563, 573 (1989) (counsel failed to point out a
potential defense); Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U. S. 258, 267

536US2 Unit: $U78 [12-17-03 16:33:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
(1973) (counsel failed to find a potential constitutional infir-mity in grand jury proceedings). It is difficult to distinguish, in terms of importance, (1) a defendant's ignorance ofgrounds for impeachment of potential witnesses at a possible
future trial from (2) the varying forms of ignorance at issuein these cases.

Third, due process considerations, the very considerations
that led this Court to find trial-related rights to exculpatoryand impeachment information in

Brady and Giglio, argue
against the existence of the "right" that the Ninth Circuitfound here. This Court has said that due process considerations include not only (1) the nature of the private interest
at stake, but also (2) the value of the additional safeguard,
and (3) the adverse impact of the requirement upon the
Government's interests. Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 77
(1985). Here, as we have just pointed out, the added value
of the Ninth Circuit's "right" to a defendant is often limited,
for it depends upon the defendant's independent awareness
of the details of the Government's case. And in any case,
as the proposed plea agreement at issue here specifies, the
Government will provide "any information establishing the
factual innocence of the defendant" regardless. That fact,
along with other guilty-plea safeguards, see Fed. Rule Crim.
Proc. 11, diminishes the force of Ruiz's concern that, in the
absence of impeachment information, innocent individuals,
accused of crimes, will plead guilty. Cf. McCarthy v. United
States, 394 U. S. 459, 465-467 (1969) (discussing Rule 11's role
in protecting a defendant's constitutional rights).

At the same time, a constitutional obligation to provide
impeachment information during plea bargaining, prior to
entry of a guilty plea, could seriously interfere with the Government's interest in securing those guilty pleas that are factually justified, desired by defendants, and help to secure the
efficient administration of justice. The Ninth Circuit's rule
risks premature disclosure of Government witness information, which, the Government tells us, could "disrupt ongoing

632 UNITED STATES v. RUIZ

Opinion of the Court
investigations" and expose prospective witnesses to serious
harm. Brief for United States 25. Cf. Amendments to
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure: Hearings before the
Subcommittee on Criminal Justice of the House Committee
on the Judiciary, 94th Cong., 1st Sess., 92 (1975) (statement
of John C. Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Div., Dept. of Justice) (opposing mandated witness disclosure three days before trial because of documented instances of witness intimidation). And the careful tailoring
that characterizes most legal Government witness disclosure
requirements suggests recognition by both Congress and the
Federal Rules Committees that such concerns are valid.
See, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 3432 (witness list disclosure required in
capital cases three days before trial with exceptions); $ 3500
(Government witness statements ordinarily subject to discovery only after testimony given); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.
16(a)(2) (embodies limitations of 18 U. S. C. $ 3500). Compare 156 F. R. D. 460, 461-462 (1994) (congressional proposal
to significantly broaden $ 3500) with 167 F. R. D. 221, 223,
n. ( judicial conference opposing congressional proposal).

Consequently, the Ninth Circuit's requirement could force
the Government to abandon its "general practice" of not "disclos[ing] to a defendant pleading guilty information that
would reveal the identities of cooperating informants, undercover investigators, or other prospective witnesses." Brief
for United States 25. It could require the Government to
devote substantially more resources to trial preparation
prior to plea bargaining, thereby depriving the pleabargaining process of its main resource-saving advantages.
Or it could lead the Government instead to abandon its heavy
reliance upon plea bargaining in a vast number--90% or
more--of federal criminal cases. We cannot say that the
Constitution's due process requirement demands so radical a
change in the criminal justice process in order to achieve so
comparatively small a constitutional benefit.

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
These considerations, taken together, lead us to concludethat the Constitution does not require the Government to

disclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering aplea agreement with a criminal defendant.

In addition, we note that the "fast track" plea agreement
requires a defendant to waive her right to receive information the Government has regarding any "affirmative defense"
she raises at trial. App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a. We do not
believe the Constitution here requires provision of this information to the defendant prior to plea bargaining--for most
(though not all) of the reasons previously stated. That is
to say, in the context of this agreement, the need for this
information is more closely related to the fairness of a trial
than to the voluntariness of the plea; the value in terms of
the defendant's added awareness of relevant circumstances
is ordinarily limited; yet the added burden imposed upon the
Government by requiring its provision well in advance of
trial (often before trial preparation begins) can be serious,
thereby significantly interfering with the administration of
the plea-bargaining process.

For these reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit is

Reversed.

Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the Court that the Constitution does not require the Government to disclose either affirmative defense
information or impeachment information relating to informants or other witnesses before entering into a binding plea
agreement with a criminal defendant. The Court, however,
suggests that the constitutional analysis turns in some part
on the "degree of help" such information would provide to
the defendant at the plea stage, see ante, at 630, 631, a distinction that is neither necessary nor accurate. To the extent that the Court is implicitly drawing a line based on a

634 UNITED STATES v. RUIZ

Thomas, J., concurring in judgment
flawed characterization about the usefulness of certain typesof information, I can only concur in the judgment. The principle supporting Brady was "avoidance of an unfair trial tothe accused." Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83, 87 (1963).
That concern is not implicated at the plea stage regardless.

KIRK v. LOUISIANA
on petition for writ of certiorari to the court ofappeal of louisiana, fourth circuit

No. 01-8419. Decided June 24, 2002
After observing what appeared to be several drug purchases made out of

petitioner's apartment and stopping one of the buyers on the street outside petitioner's residence, the police entered petitioner's home and arrested and searched him before obtaining an arrest or a search warrant.
Petitioner was charged in Louisiana state court with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The trial court denied his motion to
suppress the evidence obtained during the warrantless entry, arrest,
and search, and petitioner was convicted. In holding that the officers'
conduct did not violate the Fourth Amendment because they had probable cause to arrest petitioner, the State Court of Appeal declined to
decide whether exigent circumstances were present. The State Supreme Court denied review.

Held: The Court of Appeal erred in finding that exigent circumstances

were not required to justify the officers' conduct. Its reasoning plainly
violates the holding in Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 590, that the
firm line at the entrance to a house may not be crossed without a warrant, absent exigent circumstances. Here, police had neither an arrest
nor a search warrant. Although the officers testified at the suppression
hearing that they took action out of fear that evidence would be destroyed, the Louisiana Court of Appeal did not determine that such
exigent circumstances were present.

Certiorari granted; 773 So. 2d 259, reversed and remanded.

Per Curiam.
Police officers entered petitioner's home, where they ar-rested and searched him. The officers had neither an arrest

warrant nor a search warrant. Without deciding whetherexigent circumstances had been present, the Louisiana Court
of Appeal concluded that the warrantless entry, arrest, and
search did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the Federal
Constitution because there had been probable cause to arrestpetitioner. 00-0190 (La. App. 11/15/00), 773 So. 2d 259.

The court's reasoning plainly violates our holding in Payton

Per Curiam
v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 590 (1980), that "[a]bsent exigentcircumstances," the "firm line at the entrance to the

house . . . may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant."We thus grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse the Court of Appeal's conclusion that the officers' ac-tions were lawful, absent exigent circumstances.*

On an evening in March 1998, police officers observed peti-tioner's apartment based on an anonymous citizen complaint
that drug sales were occurring there. After witnessingwhat appeared to be several drug purchases and allowing
the buyers to leave the scene, the officers stopped one ofthe buyers on the street outside petitioner's residence. The
officers later testified that "[b]ecause the stop took placewithin a block of the apartment, [they] feared that evidence
would be destroyed and ordered that the apartment be en-tered." 00-0190, at 2, 773 So. 2d, at 261. Thus, "[t]hey immediately knocked on the door of the apartment, arrestedthe defendant, searched him thereto and discovered the cocaine and the money." Id., at 4, 773 So. 2d, at 263. Al-though the officers sought and obtained a search warrant
while they detained petitioner in his home, they only ob-tained this warrant after they had entered his home, arrested him, frisked him, found a drug vial in his underwear,and observed contraband in plain view in the apartment.

Based on these events, petitioner was charged in a Louisi-ana court with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.
He filed a pretrial motion to suppress evidence obtained bythe police as a result of their warrantless entry, arrest, and
search. After holding a suppression hearing, the trial courtdenied this motion. Petitioner was convicted and sentenced
to 15 years at hard labor.On direct review to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, petitioner challenged the trial court's suppression ruling. Heargued that the police were not justified in entering his home

without a warrant absent exigent circumstances. TheCourt of Appeal acknowledged petitioner's argument: "[Petitioner] makes a long argument that there were not exigentcircumstances for entering the apartment without a warrant." Id., at 2, 773 So. 2d, at 261. The court, however,declined to decide whether exigent circumstances had been
present, because "the evidence required to prove that the
defendant possessed cocaine with the intent to distribute,namely the cocaine and the money, was not found in the

apartment, but on his person." Ibid. The court concludedthat because "[t]he officers had probable cause to arrest and
properly searched the defendant incident thereto . . . [, t]hetrial court properly denied the motion to suppress."

Id., at
4, 773 So. 2d, at 263.The Louisiana Supreme Court denied review by a vote of 4

to 3. In a written dissent, Chief Justice Calogero explained:

"The Fourth Amendment to the United States constitution has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the home,and thus, the police need both probable cause to either

arrest or search and exigent circumstances to justify anonconsensual warrantless intrusion into private premises. . . . Here, the defendant was arrested inside anapartment, without a warrant, and the state has not
demonstrated that exigent circumstances were present.
Consequently, defendant's arrest was unconstitutional,and his motion to suppress should have been granted."

App. to Pet. for Cert. 1-2.
We agree with Chief Justice Calogero that the Court ofAppeal clearly erred by concluding that petitioner's arrest and the search "incident thereto," 00-0190, at 4, 773
So. 2d, at 263, were constitutionally permissible. In Payton,
we examined whether the Fourth Amendment was violated
by a state statute that authorized officers to "enter a private
residence without a warrant and with force, if necessary, to
make a routine felony arrest." 445 U. S., at 574. We deter536US2 Unit: $U79 [12-17-03 16:36:03] PAGES PGT: OPIN
638 KIRK v. LOUISIANA

mined that "the reasons for upholding warrantless arrests ina public place do not apply to warrantless invasions of the

privacy of the home." Id., at 576. We held that because"the Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house . . . [, a]bsent exigent circumstances, thatthreshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant."
Id., at 590. And we noted that an arrest warrant foundedon probable cause, as well as a search warrant, would suffice
for entry. Id., at 603.Here, the police had neither an arrest warrant for petitioner, nor a search warrant for petitioner's apartment, whenthey entered his home, arrested him, and searched him.
The officers testified at the suppression hearing that thereason for their actions was a fear that evidence would be
destroyed, but the Louisiana Court of Appeal did not de-termine that such exigent circumstances were present.
Rather, the court, in respondent's own words, determined"that the defendant's argument that there were no exigent
circumstances to justify the warrantless entry of the apart-ment was irrelevant" to the constitutionality of the officers'
actions. Brief in Opposition 2-3. As Payton makes plain,police officers need either a warrant or probable cause plus
exigent circumstances in order to make a lawful entry into ahome. The Court of Appeal's ruling to the contrary, and
consequent failure to assess whether exigent circumstanceswere present in this case, violated Payton.

Petitioner and respondent both dispute at length whetherexigent circumstances were, in fact, present. We express
no opinion on that question, nor on respondent's argumentthat any Fourth Amendment violation was cured because the
police had an "independent source" for the recovered evi-dence. Brief in Opposition 8. Rather, we reverse the
Court of Appeal's judgment that exigent circumstances werenot required to justify the officers' conduct, and remand for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

ZELMAN, SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLICINSTRUCTION OF OHIO,

et al. v.SIMMONS-HARRIS
et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 00-1751. Argued February 20, 2002--Decided June 27, 2002*
Ohio's Pilot Project Scholarship Program gives educational choices to families in any Ohio school district that is under state control pursuant to a
federal-court order. The program provides tuition aid for certain students in the Cleveland City School District, the only covered district, to
attend participating public or private schools of their parent's choosing
and tutorial aid for students who choose to remain enrolled in public
school. Both religious and nonreligious schools in the district may participate, as may public schools in adjacent school districts. Tuition aid
is distributed to parents according to financial need, and where the aid
is spent depends solely upon where parents choose to enroll their children. The number of tutorial assistance grants provided to students
remaining in public school must equal the number of tuition aid scholarships. In the 1999-2000 school year, 82% of the participating private
schools had a religious affiliation, none of the adjacent public schools
participated, and 96% of the students participating in the scholarship
program were enrolled in religiously affiliated schools. Sixty percent
of the students were from families at or below the poverty line. Cleveland schoolchildren also have the option of enrolling in community
schools, which are funded under state law but run by their own school
boards and receive twice the per-student funding as participating private schools, or magnet schools, which are public schools emphasizing a
particular subject area, teaching method, or service, and for which the
school district receives the same amount per student as it does for a
student enrolled at a traditional public school. Respondents, Ohio taxpayers, sought to enjoin the program on the ground that it violated
the Establishment Clause. The Federal District Court granted them
summary judgment, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

640 ZELMAN v. SIMMONS-HARRIS

Syllabus
(a) Because the program was enacted for the valid secular purpose of
providing educational assistance to poor children in a demonstrably failing public school system, the question is whether the program nonetheless has the forbidden effect of advancing or inhibiting religion. See
Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 222-223. This Court's jurisprudence
makes clear that a government aid program is not readily subject to
challenge under the Establishment Clause if it is neutral with respect
to religion and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens
who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools wholly as a
result of their own genuine and independent private choice. See, e. g.,
Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388. Under such a program, government
aid reaches religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices
of numerous individual recipients. The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious message, is
reasonably attributable to the individual aid recipients, not the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits. Pp. 648-653.

(b) The instant program is one of true private choice, consistent with
the Mueller line of cases, and thus constitutional. It is neutral in all
respects toward religion, and is part of Ohio's general and multifaceted
undertaking to provide educational opportunities to children in a failed
school district. It confers educational assistance directly to a broad
class of individuals defined without reference to religion and permits
participation of all district schools--religious or nonreligious--and adjacent public schools. The only preference in the program is for lowincome families, who receive greater assistance and have priority for
admission. Rather than creating financial incentives that skew it toward religious schools, the program creates financial disincentives: Private schools receive only half the government assistance given to community schools and one-third that given to magnet schools, and adjacent
public schools would receive two to three times that given to private
schools. Families too have a financial disincentive, for they have to
copay a portion of private school tuition, but pay nothing at a community, magnet, or traditional public school. No reasonable observer
would think that such a neutral private choice program carries with it
the imprimatur of government endorsement. Nor is there evidence
that the program fails to provide genuine opportunities for Cleveland
parents to select secular educational options: Their children may remain
in public school as before, remain in public school with funded tutoring
aid, obtain a scholarship and choose to attend a religious school, obtain
a scholarship and choose to attend a nonreligious private school, enroll
in a community school, or enroll in a magnet school. The Establishment

Syllabus
Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of which is to obtain a
scholarship and then choose a religious school. Cleveland's preponderance of religiously affiliated schools did not result from the program, but
is a phenomenon common to many American cities. Eighty-two percent
of Cleveland's private schools are religious, as are 81% of Ohio's private
schools. To attribute constitutional significance to the 82% figure
would lead to the absurd result that a neutral school-choice program
might be permissible in parts of Ohio where the percentage is lower,
but not in Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such programs most sorely
needed. Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional only in States with a lower percentage of religious private
schools. Respondents' additional argument that constitutional significance should be attached to the fact that 96% of the scholarship recipients have enrolled in religious schools was flatly rejected in Mueller.
The constitutionality of a neutral educational aid program simply does
not turn on whether and why, in a particular area, at a particular time,
most private schools are religious, or most recipients choose to use the
aid at a religious school. Finally, contrary to respondents' argument,
Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S.
756--a case that expressly reserved judgment on the sort of program
challenged here--does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that offer aid directly to a broad class of individuals defined without regard to religion. Pp. 653-663.

644 ZELMAN v. SIMMONS-HARRIS

Opinion of the Court
reside in the Cleveland City School District. The question
presented is whether this program offends the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. We hold
that it does not.

There are more than 75,000 children enrolled in the Cleveland City School District. The majority of these children
are from low-income and minority families. Few of these
families enjoy the means to send their children to any school
other than an inner-city public school. For more than a generation, however, Cleveland's public schools have been
among the worst performing public schools in the Nation.
In 1995, a Federal District Court declared a "crisis of magnitude" and placed the entire Cleveland school district under
state control. See Reed v. Rhodes, No. 1:73 CV 1300 (ND
Ohio, Mar. 3, 1995). Shortly thereafter, the state auditor
found that Cleveland's public schools were in the midst of a
"crisis that is perhaps unprecedented in the history of American education." Cleveland City School District Performance Audit 2-1 (Mar. 1996). The district had failed to meet
any of the 18 state standards for minimal acceptable performance. Only 1 in 10 ninth graders could pass a basic proficiency examination, and students at all levels performed at
a dismal rate compared with students in other Ohio public
schools. More than two-thirds of high school students either
dropped or failed out before graduation. Of those students
who managed to reach their senior year, one of every four
still failed to graduate. Of those students who did graduate,
few could read, write, or compute at levels comparable to
their counterparts in other cities.

It is against this backdrop that Ohio enacted, among other
initiatives, its Pilot Project Scholarship Program, Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. $$ 3313.974-3313.979 (Anderson 1999 and Supp.
2000) (program). The program provides financial assistance
to families in any Ohio school district that is or has been
"under federal court order requiring supervision and opera536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

tional management of the district by the state superintend-ent." $ 3313.975(A). Cleveland is the only Ohio school district to fall within that category.The program provides two basic kinds of assistance to parents of children in a covered district. First, the programprovides tuition aid for students in kindergarten through
third grade, expanding each year through eighth grade, to
attend a participating public or private school of their par-ent's choosing. $$ 3313.975(B) and (C)(1). Second, the program provides tutorial aid for students who choose to remainenrolled in public school. $ 3313.975(A).

The tuition aid portion of the program is designed to pro-vide educational choices to parents who reside in a covered
district. Any private school, whether religious or nonreli-gious, may participate in the program and accept program
students so long as the school is located within the bound-aries of a covered district and meets statewide educational
standards. $ 313.976(A)(3). Participating private schoolsmust agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, religion, or ethnic background, or to "advocate or foster unlawful behavior or teach hatred of any person or group onthe basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, or religion."

$ 3313.976(A)(6). Any public school located in a school dis-trict adjacent to the covered district may also participate
in the program. $ 3313.976(C). Adjacent public schools areeligible to receive a $2,250 tuition grant for each program
student accepted in addition to the full amount of per-pupil
state funding attributable to each additional student.

1 Although the parties dispute the precise amount of state funding received by suburban school districts adjacent to the Cleveland City School
District, there is no dispute that any suburban district agreeing to participate in the program would receive a $2,250 tuition grant plus the ordinary
allotment of per-pupil state funding for each program student enrolled in
a suburban public school. See Brief for Respondents Simmons-Harris

need. Families with incomes below 200% of the poverty lineare given priority and are eligible to receive 90% of private

may not charge a parental copayment greater than $250.$ 3313.976(A)(8). For all other families, the program pays
75% of tuition costs, up to $1,875, with no copayment cap.

$$ 3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A). These families receive tu-ition aid only if the number of available scholarships exceeds

the number of low-income children who choose to partici-pate.

2 Where tuition aid is spent depends solely upon where

parents who receive tuition aid choose to enroll their child.If parents choose a private school, checks are made payable to the parents who then endorse the checks over to the
chosen school. $ 3313.979.The tutorial aid portion of the program provides tutorial

assistance through grants to any student in a covered dis-trict who chooses to remain in public school. Parents arrange for registered tutors to provide assistance to theirchildren and then submit bills for those services to the State
for payment. $$ 3313.976(D), 3313.979(C). Students fromlow-income families receive 90% of the amount charged for
such assistance up to $360. All other students receive 75%of that amount. $ 3313.978(B).

dents enrolled at participating private or adjacent publicschools. $ 3313.975(A).

The program has been in operation within the ClevelandCity School District since the 1996-1997 school year. In the
1999-2000 school year, 56 private schools participated in theprogram, 46 (or 82%) of which had a religious affiliation.
None of the public schools in districts adjacent to Cleveland
have elected to participate. More than 3,700 students par-ticipated in the scholarship program, most of whom (96%)

enrolled in religiously affiliated schools. Sixty percent ofthese students were from families at or below the poverty
line. In the 1998-1999 school year, approximately 1,400
Cleveland public school students received tutorial aid. This
number was expected to double during the 1999-2000
school year.

The program is part of a broader undertaking by the State
to enhance the educational options of Cleveland's schoolchildren in response to the 1995 takeover. That undertaking includes programs governing community and magnet
schools. Community schools are funded under state law but
are run by their own school boards, not by local school districts. $$ 3314.01(B), 3314.04. These schools enjoy academic independence to hire their own teachers and to determine their own curriculum. They can have no religious
affiliation and are required to accept students by lottery.
During the 1999-2000 school year, there were 10 startup
community schools in the Cleveland City School District with
more than 1,900 students enrolled. For each child enrolled
in a community school, the school receives state funding of
$4,518, twice the funding a participating program school
may receive.

Magnet schools are public schools operated by a local
school board that emphasize a particular subject area, teaching method, or service to students. For each student enrolled in a magnet school, the school district receives $7,746,
including state funding of $4,167, the same amount received

Opinion of the Court
per student enrolled at a traditional public school. As of1999, parents in Cleveland were able to choose from among

23 magnet schools, which together enrolled more than 13,000students in kindergarten through eighth grade. These
schools provide specialized teaching methods, such as Mon-tessori, or a particularized curriculum focus, such as foreign
language, computers, or the arts.

In 1996, respondents, a group of Ohio taxpayers, chal-lenged the Ohio program in state court on state and federal

grounds. The Ohio Supreme Court rejected respondents'federal claims, but held that the enactment of the program
violated certain procedural requirements of the Ohio Constitution. Simmons-Harris v. Goff, 86 Ohio St. 3d 1, 8-9, 711
N. E. 2d 203, 211 (1999). The state legislature immediately
cured this defect, leaving the basic provisions discussed
above intact.

In July 1999, respondents filed this action in United States
District Court, seeking to enjoin the reenacted program on
the ground that it violated the Establishment Clause of the
United States Constitution. In August 1999, the District
Court issued a preliminary injunction barring further implementation of the program, 54 F. Supp. 2d 725 (ND Ohio),
which we stayed pending review by the Court of Appeals,
528 U. S. 983 (1999). In December 1999, the District Court
granted summary judgment for respondents. 72 F. Supp. 2d
834. In December 2000, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court, finding
that the program had the "primary effect" of advancing
religion in violation of the Establishment Clause. 234 F.
3d 945 (CA6). The Court of Appeals stayed its mandate
pending disposition in this Court. App. to Pet. for Cert.
in No. 00-1779, p. 151. We granted certiorari, 533 U. S. 976
(2001), and now reverse the Court of Appeals.

The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prevents a State from enacting laws that have the "purpose"

or "effect" of advancing or inhibiting religion. Agostini v.
Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 222-223 (1997) ("[W]e continue to ask
whether the government acted with the purpose of advanc-ing or inhibiting religion [and] whether the aid has the

`effect' of advancing or inhibiting religion" (citations omit-ted))

. There is no dispute that the program challenged here
was enacted for the valid secular purpose of providing educational assistance to poor children in a demonstrably fail-ing public school system. Thus, the question presented is

whether the Ohio program nonetheless has the forbidden "ef-fect" of advancing or inhibiting religion.

To answer that question, our decisions have drawn a consistent distinction between government programs that provide aid directly to religious schools, Mitchell v. Helms, 530
U. S. 793, 810-814 (2000) (plurality opinion); id., at 841-844
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); Agostini, supra, at
225-227; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.,
515 U. S. 819, 842 (1995) (collecting cases), and programs of
true private choice, in which government aid reaches religious schools only as a result of the genuine and independent
choices of private individuals, Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388
(1983); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474
U. S. 481 (1986); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,
509 U. S. 1 (1993). While our jurisprudence with respect to
the constitutionality of direct aid programs has "changed significantly" over the past two decades, Agostini, supra, at
236, our jurisprudence with respect to true private choice
programs has remained consistent and unbroken. Three
times we have confronted Establishment Clause challenges
to neutral government programs that provide aid directly
to a broad class of individuals, who, in turn, direct the aid
to religious schools or institutions of their own choosing.
Three times we have rejected such challenges.

In Mueller, we rejected an Establishment Clause challenge to a Minnesota program authorizing tax deductions for
various educational expenses, including private school tu536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG
650 ZELMAN v. SIMMONS-HARRIS

Opinion of the Court
ition costs, even though the great majority of the program'sbeneficiaries (96%) were parents of children in religious

schools. We began by focusing on the class of beneficiaries,finding that because the class included "

all parents," including parents with "children [who] attend nonsectarian privateschools or sectarian private schools," 463 U. S., at 397 (emphasis in original), the program was "not readily subject to
challenge under the Establishment Clause," id., at 399 (citing
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274 (1981) ("The provision
of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an importantindex of secular effect")). Then, viewing the program as a

whole, we emphasized the principle of private choice, notingthat public funds were made available to religious schools
"only as a result of numerous, private choices of individ-ual parents of school-age children." 463 U. S., at 399-400.
This, we said, ensured that "no `imprimatur of state ap-proval' can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally." Id., at 399 (quoting
Widmar, supra, at 274)). We thus found it irrelevant to the
constitutional inquiry that the vast majority of beneficiaries
were parents of children in religious schools, saying:

"We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the consti-tutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports

reciting the extent to which various classes of private
citizens claimed benefits under the law." 463 U. S.,at 401.

That the program was one of true private choice, with no
evidence that the State deliberately skewed incentives to-ward religious schools, was sufficient for the program to survive scrutiny under the Establishment Clause.

In Witters, we used identical reasoning to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a vocational scholarship program that provided tuition aid to a student studying at a
religious institution to become a pastor. Looking at the program as a whole, we observed that "[a]ny aid . . . that ulti536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

651Cite as: 536 U. S. 639 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
mately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result
of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients." 474 U. S., at 487. We further remarked that, as in
Mueller, "[the] program is made available generally without
regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited." 474 U. S., at 487 (internal
quotation marks omitted). In light of these factors, we held
that the program was not inconsistent with the Establishment Clause. Id., at 488-489.

Five Members of the Court, in separate opinions, emphasized the general rule from Mueller that the amount of government aid channeled to religious institutions by individual
aid recipients was not relevant to the constitutional inquiry.
474 U. S., at 490-491 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and
Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Mueller, supra, at 398-
399); 474 U. S., at 493 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
concurring in judgment); id., at 490 (White, J., concurring).
Our holding thus rested not on whether few or many recipients chose to expend government aid at a religious school
but, rather, on whether recipients generally were empowered to direct the aid to schools or institutions of their own
choosing.

Finally, in Zobrest, we applied Mueller and Witters to reject an Establishment Clause challenge to a federal program
that permitted sign-language interpreters to assist deaf children enrolled in religious schools. Reviewing our earlier
decisions, we stated that "government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined
without reference to religion are not readily subject to an
Establishment Clause challenge." 509 U. S., at 8. Looking
once again to the challenged program as a whole, we observed that the program "distributes benefits neutrally to
any child qualifying as `disabled.' " Id., at 10. Its "primary
beneficiaries," we said, were "disabled children, not sectarian
schools." Id., at 12.

536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG
652 ZELMAN v. SIMMONS-HARRIS

Opinion of the Court
We further observed that "[b]y according parents freedom
to select a school of their choice, the statute ensures that a
government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian
school only as a result of the private decision of individual
parents." Id., at 10. Our focus again was on neutrality and
the principle of private choice, not on the number of program
beneficiaries attending religious schools. Id., at 10-11.
See, e. g., Agostini, 521 U. S., at 229 ("Zobrest did not turn
on the fact that James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation,
been the only child using a publicly funded sign-language
interpreter to attend a parochial school"). Because the
program ensured that parents were the ones to select a religious school as the best learning environment for their
handicapped child, the circuit between government and religion was broken, and the Establishment Clause was not
implicated.

Mueller, Witters, and Zobrest thus make clear that where
a government aid program is neutral with respect to religion, and provides assistance directly to a broad class of citizens who, in turn, direct government aid to religious schools
wholly as a result of their own genuine and independent private choice, the program is not readily subject to challenge
under the Establishment Clause. A program that shares
these features permits government aid to reach religious institutions only by way of the deliberate choices of numerous
individual recipients. The incidental advancement of a religious mission, or the perceived endorsement of a religious
message, is reasonably attributable to the individual recipient, not to the government, whose role ends with the disbursement of benefits. As a plurality of this Court recently observed:

"[I]f numerous private choices, rather than the single
choice of a government, determine the distribution of
aid, pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special

Opinion of the Court
favors that might lead to a religious establishment."Mitchell, 530 U. S., at 810.

See also id., at 843 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)("[W]hen government aid supports a school's religious mission only because of independent decisions made by numer-ous individuals to guide their secular aid to that school, `no
reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts . . . aninference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief ' " (quoting Witters, 474 U. S., at 493 (O'Connor,J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment

))). Itis precisely for these reasons that we have never found a

program of true private choice to offend the EstablishmentClause.

We believe that the program challenged here is a programof true private choice, consistent with Mueller, Witters, and
Zobrest, and thus constitutional. As was true in those cases,the Ohio program is neutral in all respects toward religion.
It is part of a general and multifaceted undertaking by theState of Ohio to provide educational opportunities to the
children of a failed school district. It confers educationalassistance directly to a broad class of individuals defined
without reference to religion, i. e., any parent of a school-agechild who resides in the Cleveland City School District. The
program permits the participation of all schools within thedistrict, religious or nonreligious. Adjacent public schools
also may participate and have a financial incentive to do so.Program benefits are available to participating families on
neutral terms, with no reference to religion. The only pref-erence stated anywhere in the program is a preference for
low-income families, who receive greater assistance and aregiven priority for admission at participating schools.

There are no "financial incentive[s]" that "ske[w]" the pro-gram toward religious schools.

financial disincentives for religious schools, with privateschools receiving only half the government assistance given

to community schools and one-third the assistance given tomagnet schools. Adjacent public schools, should any choose
to accept program students, are also eligible to receive two
to three times the state funding of a private religious school.Families too have a financial disincentive to choose a private

religious school over other schools. Parents that choose toparticipate in the scholarship program and then to enroll
their children in a private school (religious or nonreligious)must copay a portion of the school's tuition. Families that
choose a community school, magnet school, or traditionalpublic school pay nothing. Although such features of the
program are not necessary to its constitutionality, theyclearly dispel the claim that the program "creates . . . financial incentive[s] for parents to choose a sectarian school."
Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10.3

Respondents suggest that even without a financial incentive for parents to choose a religious school, the program
creates a "public perception that the State is endorsing
religious practices and beliefs." Brief for Respondents
Simmons-Harris et al. 37-38. But we have repeatedly rec3 Justice Souter suggests the program is not "neutral" because program students cannot spend scholarship vouchers at traditional public
schools. Post, at 697-698 (dissenting opinion). This objection is mistaken: Public schools in Cleveland already receive $7,097 in public funding
per pupil--$4,167 of which is attributable to the State. App. 56a. Program students who receive tutoring aid and remain enrolled in traditional
public schools therefore direct almost twice as much state funding to their
chosen school as do program students who receive a scholarship and attend
a private school. Ibid. Justice Souter does not seriously claim that
the program differentiates based on the religious status of beneficiaries or
providers of services, the touchstone of neutrality under the Establishment Clause. Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U. S. 793, 809 (2000) (plurality opinion); id., at 838 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).

Opinion of the Court
ognized that no reasonable observer would think a neutralprogram of private choice, where state aid reaches religious

schools solely as a result of the numerous independent deci-sions of private individuals, carries with it the

imprimatur
of government endorsement. Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399;
Witters, supra, at 488-489; Zobrest, supra, at 10-11; e. g.,
Mitchell, supra, at 842-843 (O'Connor, J., concurring in
judgment) ("In terms of public perception, a governmentprogram of direct aid to religious schools . . . differs meaningfully from the government distributing aid directly to indi-vidual students who, in turn, decide to use the aid at the
same religious schools"). The argument is particularly misplaced here since "the reasonable observer in the endorsement inquiry must be deemed aware" of the "history and
context" underlying a challenged program. Good News
Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U. S. 98, 119 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also Capitol Square
Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 780 (1995)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Any objective observer familiar with the full history
and context of the Ohio program would reasonably view it as
one aspect of a broader undertaking to assist poor children in
failed schools, not as an endorsement of religious schooling
in general.

There also is no evidence that the program fails to provide
genuine opportunities for Cleveland parents to select secular
educational options for their school-age children. Cleveland
schoolchildren enjoy a range of educational choices: They
may remain in public school as before, remain in public school
with publicly funded tutoring aid, obtain a scholarship and
choose a religious school, obtain a scholarship and choose a
nonreligious private school, enroll in a community school, or
enroll in a magnet school. That 46 of the 56 private schools
now participating in the program are religious schools does
not condemn it as a violation of the Establishment Clause.
The Establishment Clause question is whether Ohio is coerc536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ing parents into sending their children to religious schools,
and that question must be answered by evaluating all options Ohio provides Cleveland schoolchildren, only one of
which is to obtain a program scholarship and then choose a
religious school.

Justice Souter speculates that because more private religious schools currently participate in the program, the program itself must somehow discourage the participation of
private nonreligious schools. Post, at 703-705 (dissenting
opinion).4 But Cleveland's preponderance of religiously af4 Justice Souter appears to base this claim on the unfounded assumption that capping the amount of tuition charged to low-income students (at
$2,500) favors participation by religious schools. Post, at 704-705 (dissenting opinion). But elsewhere he claims that the program spends too
much money on private schools and chides the state legislature for even
proposing to raise the scholarship amount for low-income recipients.
Post, at 697-698, 710-711, 714-715. His assumption also finds no support
in the record, which shows that nonreligious private schools operating in
Cleveland also seek and receive substantial third-party contributions.
App. 194a-195a; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 00-1777, p. 119a. Indeed,
the actual operation of the program refutes Justice Souter's argument
that few but religious schools can afford to participate: Ten secular private
schools operated within the Cleveland City School District when the program was adopted. Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 00-1777, p. 4 (citing
Ohio Educational Directory, 1999-2000 School Year, Alphabetic List of
Nonpublic Schools, Ohio Dept. of Ed.). All 10 chose to participate in the
program and have continued to participate to this day. App. 281a- 286a.
And while no religious schools have been created in response to the program, several nonreligious schools have been created, id., at 144a-148a,
224a-225a, in spite of the fact that a principal barrier to entry of new
private schools is the uncertainty caused by protracted litigation which
has plagued the program since its inception, post, at 672 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring) (citing App. 225a, 227a). See also 234 F. 3d 945, 970 (CA6
2000) (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("There is not a
scintilla of evidence in this case that any school, public or private, has been
discouraged from participating in the school voucher program because it
cannot `afford' to do so"). Similarly mistaken is Justice Souter's reliance on the low enrollment of scholarship students in nonreligious schools

filiated private schools certainly did not arise as a result ofthe program; it is a phenomenon common to many American cities. See U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for Edu-cation Statistics, Private School Universe Survey: 1999-2000,
pp. 2-4 (NCES 2001-330, 2001) (hereinafter Private SchoolUniverse Survey) (cited in Brief for United States as Amicus
Curiae 24). Indeed, by all accounts the program has cap-tured a remarkable cross-section of private schools, religious
and nonreligious. It is true that 82% of Cleveland's partici-pating private schools are religious schools, but it is also true
that 81% of private schools in Ohio are religious schools.See Brief for State of Florida et al. as

Amici Curiae 16 (cit-ing Private School Universe Survey). To attribute constitutional significance to this figure, moreover, would lead to theabsurd result that a neutral school-choice program might be
permissible in some parts of Ohio, such as Columbus, wherea lower percentage of private schools are religious schools,
see Ohio Educational Directory (Lodging of RespondentsGatton et al., available in Clerk of Court's case file), and
Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 00-1751, p. 12, n. 1, butnot in inner-city Cleveland, where Ohio has deemed such
programs most sorely needed, but where the preponderanceof religious schools happens to be greater. Cf. Brief for
State of Florida et al. as Amici Curiae 17 ("[T]he percent-ages of sectarian to nonsectarian private schools within Florida's 67 school districts . . . vary from zero to 100 percent").Likewise, an identical private choice program might be constitutional in some States, such as Maine or Utah, where less

the fact that the number of program students enrolled in nonreligious

not turn on annual tallies of private decisions made in any given year by

than 45% of private schools are religious schools, but not in
other States, such as Nebraska or Kansas, where over 90%
of private schools are religious schools. Id., at 15-16 (citing
Private School Universe Survey).

Respondents and Justice Souter claim that even if we
do not focus on the number of participating schools that are
religious schools, we should attach constitutional significance
to the fact that 96% of scholarship recipients have enrolled
in religious schools. They claim that this alone proves parents lack genuine choice, even if no parent has ever said so.
We need not consider this argument in detail, since it was
flatly rejected in Mueller, where we found it irrelevant that
96% of parents taking deductions for tuition expenses paid
tuition at religious schools. Indeed, we have recently found
it irrelevant even to the constitutionality of a direct aid program that a vast majority of program benefits went to religious schools. See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 229 ("Nor are we
willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students
who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid" (citing
Mueller, 463 U. S., at 401)); see also Mitchell, 530 U. S., at
812, n. 6 (plurality opinion) ("[Agostini] held that the proportion of aid benefiting students at religious schools pursuant
to a neutral program involving private choices was irrelevant
to the constitutional inquiry"); id., at 848 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (same) (quoting Agostini, supra, at
229). The constitutionality of a neutral educational aid program simply does not turn on whether and why, in a particular area, at a particular time, most private schools are run
by religious organizations, or most recipients choose to use
the aid at a religious school. As we said in Mueller, "[s]uch
an approach would scarcely provide the certainty that this
field stands in need of, nor can we perceive principled standards by which such statistical evidence might be evaluated."

Opinion of the Court
This point is aptly illustrated here. The 96% figure uponwhich respondents and

Justice Souter rely discounts en-tirely (1) the more than 1,900 Cleveland children enrolled

in alternative community schools, (2) the more than 13,000children enrolled in alternative magnet schools, and (3)
the more than 1,400 children enrolled in traditional publicschools with tutorial assistance. See

supra, at 647-648.Including some or all of these children in the denominator of

children enrolled in nontraditional schools during the 1999-2000 school year drops the percentage enrolled in religious
schools from 96% to under 20%. See also J. Greene, TheRacial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice
in Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reportingthat only 16.5% of nontraditional schoolchildren in Cleveland
choose religious schools). The 96% figure also represents
but a snapshot of one particular school year. In the 1997-1998 school year, by contrast, only 78% of scholarship recipients attended religious schools. See App. to Pet. for Cert.in No. 00-1751, p. 5a. The difference was attributable to
two private nonreligious schools that had accepted 15% of all
scholarship students electing instead to register as commu-nity schools, in light of larger per-pupil funding for community schools and the uncertain future of the scholarship pro-gram generated by this litigation. See App. 59a-62a, 209a,
223a-227a.5 Many of the students enrolled in these schools

5 The fluctuations seen in the Cleveland program are hardly atypical.
Experience in Milwaukee, which since 1991 has operated an educational
choice program similar to the Ohio program, demonstrates that the mix of
participating schools fluctuates significantly from year to year based on a
number of factors, one of which is the uncertainty caused by persistent
litigation. See App. 218a, 229a-236a; Brief for State of Wisconsin as Amicus Curiae 10-13 (hereinafter Brief for Wisconsin) (citing Wisconsin Dept.
of Public Instruction, Milwaukee Parental Choice Program Facts and Figures for 2001-2002). Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court declared
the Milwaukee program constitutional in 1998, Jackson v. Benson, 218
Wis. 2d 835, 578 N. W. 2d 602, several nonreligious private schools have
entered the Milwaukee market, and now represent 32% of all participating

as scholarship students remained enrolled as communityschool students, id., at 145a-146a, thus demonstrating the

arbitrariness of counting one type of school but not the otherto assess primary effect, e. g., Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 3314.11
(Anderson 1999) (establishing a single "office of school op-tions" to "provide services that facilitate the management of

Court at oral argument, respondents offered no convincingjustification for their approach, which relies entirely on such
arbitrary classifications. Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-60.6
schools. Brief for Wisconsin 11-12. Similarly, the number of program
students attending nonreligious private schools increased from 2,048 to
3,582; these students now represent 33% of all program students. Id., at
12-13. There are currently 34 nonreligious private schools participating
in the Milwaukee program, a nearly five-fold increase from the 7 nonreligious schools that participated when the program began in 1990. See
App. 218a; Brief for Wisconsin 12. And the total number of students enrolled in nonreligious schools has grown from 337 when the program began
to 3,582 in the most recent school year. See App. 218a, 234a-236a; Brief
for Wisconsin 12-13. These numbers further demonstrate the wisdom of
our refusal in Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S., at 401, to make the constitutionality of such a program depend on "annual reports reciting the extent to
which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law."

6 Justice Souter and Justice Stevens claim that community schools

and magnet schools are separate and distinct from program schools, simply
because the program itself does not include community and magnet school
options. Post, at 698-701 (Souter, J., dissenting); post, at 685 (Stevens,
J., dissenting). But none of the dissenting opinions explain how there
is any perceptible difference between scholarship schools, community
schools, or magnet schools from the perspective of Cleveland parents looking to choose the best educational option for their school-age children.
Parents who choose a program school in fact receive from the State precisely what parents who choose a community or magnet school receive--
the opportunity to send their children largely at state expense to schools
they prefer to their local public school. See, e. g., App. 147a, 168a-169a;
App. in Nos. 00-3055, etc. (CA6), pp. 1635-1645 and 1657-1673 (Cleveland
parents who enroll their children in schools other than local public schools
typically explore all state-funded options before choosing an alternative
school).

Opinion of the Court
Respondents finally claim that we should look to Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S.
756 (1973), to decide these cases. We disagree for two rea-sons. First, the program in

Nyquist was quite different
from the program challenged here. Nyquist involved a NewYork program that gave a package of benefits exclusively

to private schools and the parents of private school enrollees. Although the program was enacted for ostensibly secu-lar purposes,

id., at 773-774, we found that its "function"
was "unmistakably to provide desired financial support fornonpublic, sectarian institutions,"

id., at 783 (emphasis
added). Its genesis, we said, was that private religious
schools faced "increasingly grave fiscal problems." Id.,
at 795. The program thus provided direct money grants to
religious schools. Id., at 762-764. It provided tax benefits
"unrelated to the amount of money actually expended by any
parent on tuition," ensuring a windfall to parents of children
in religious schools. Id., at 790. It similarly provided tuition reimbursements designed explicitly to "offe[r] . . . an
incentive to parents to send their children to sectarian
schools." Id., at 786. Indeed, the program flatly prohibited
the participation of any public school, or parent of any public
school enrollee. Id., at 763-765. Ohio's program shares
none of these features.

Second, were there any doubt that the program challenged
in Nyquist is far removed from the program challenged here,
we expressly reserved judgment with respect to "a case involving some form of public assistance (e. g., scholarships)
made available generally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution
benefited." Id., at 782-783, n. 38. That, of course, is the
very question now before us, and it has since been answered,
first in Mueller, 463 U. S., at 398-399 ("[A] program . . . that
neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of
citizens is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment Clause" (citing Nyquist, supra, at 782-783, n. 38)),

536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Opinion of the Court
then in Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 ("Washington's program is
`made available generally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution
benefited' " (quoting Nyquist, supra, at 782-783, n. 38)), and
again in Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12-13 ("[T]he function of the
[program] is hardly `to provide desired financial support for
nonpublic, sectarian institutions' " (quoting Nyquist, supra,
at 782-783, n. 38)). To the extent the scope of Nyquist has
remained an open question in light of these later decisions,
we now hold that Nyquist does not govern neutral educational assistance programs that, like the program here, offer
aid directly to a broad class of individual recipients defined
without regard to religion.7

In sum, the Ohio program is entirely neutral with respect
to religion. It provides benefits directly to a wide spectrum
of individuals, defined only by financial need and residence
in a particular school district. It permits such individuals
to exercise genuine choice among options public and private,
secular and religious. The program is therefore a program
of true private choice. In keeping with an unbroken line of

7 Justice Breyer would raise the invisible specters of "divisiveness"
and "religious strife" to find the program unconstitutional. Post, at 719,
725-728 (dissenting opinion). It is unclear exactly what sort of principle
Justice Breyer has in mind, considering that the program has ignited no
"divisiveness" or "strife" other than this litigation. Nor is it clear where
Justice Breyer would locate this presumed authority to deprive Cleveland residents of a program that they have chosen but that we subjectively
find "divisive." We quite rightly have rejected the claim that some speculative potential for divisiveness bears on the constitutionality of educational aid programs. Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U. S., at 825 (plurality opinion) ("The dissent resurrects the concern for political divisiveness that
once occupied the Court but that post-Aguilar cases have rightly disregarded") (citing cases); id., at 825-826 (" `It is curious indeed to base our
interpretation of the Constitution on speculation as to the likelihood of a
phenomenon which the parties may create merely by prosecuting a lawsuit' " (quoting Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402, 429 (1985) (O'Connor,
J., dissenting))).

decisions rejecting challenges to similar programs, we holdthat the program does not offend the Establishment Clause.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice O'Connor, concurring.
The Court holds that Ohio's Pilot Project Scholarship Pro-gram, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $$ 3313.974-3313.979 (Anderson

1999 and Supp. 2000) (voucher program), survives respond-ents' Establishment Clause challenge. While I join the
Court's opinion, I write separately for two reasons. First,although the Court takes an important step, I do not believe
that today's decision, when considered in light of other long-standing government programs that impact religious organizations and our prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence,marks a dramatic break from the past. Second, given the
emphasis the Court places on verifying that parents ofvoucher students in religious schools have exercised "true
private choice," I think it is worth elaborating on the Court'sconclusion that this inquiry should consider all reasonable
educational alternatives to religious schools that are avail-able to parents. To do otherwise is to ignore how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions.

I
These cases are different from prior indirect aid cases inpart because a significant portion of the funds appropriated

for the voucher program reach religious schools without re-strictions on the use of these funds. The share of public
resources that reach religious schools is not, however, assignificant as respondents suggest. See, e. g., Brief for
Respondents Simmons-Harris et al. 1-2. Data from the1999-2000 school year indicate that 82 percent of schools
participating in the voucher program were religious and that96 percent of participating students enrolled in religious

schools, see App. in Nos. 00-3055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679 (46 of56 private schools in the program are religiously affiliated;

3,637 of 3,765 voucher students attend religious privateschools), but these data are incomplete. These statistics do
not take into account all of the reasonable educational choicesthat may be available to students in Cleveland public schools.
When one considers the option to attend community schools,
the percentage of students enrolled in religious schools fallsto 62.1 percent. If magnet schools are included in the mix,

this percentage falls to 16.5 percent. See J. Greene, The Ra-cial, Economic, and Religious Context of Parental Choice in
Cleveland 11, Table 4 (Oct. 8, 1999), App. 217a (reporting
2,087 students in community schools and 16,184 students in
magnet schools).

Even these numbers do not paint a complete picture. The
Cleveland program provides voucher applicants from lowincome families with up to $2,250 in tuition assistance and
provides the remaining applicants with up to $1,875 in tuition
assistance. $$ 3313.976(A)(8), 3313.978(A) and (C)(1). In
contrast, the State provides community schools $4,518 per
pupil and magnet schools, on average, $7,097 per pupil. Affidavit of Caroline M. Hoxby |||| 4b, 4c, App. 56a. Even if
one assumes that all voucher students came from low-income
families and that each voucher student used up the entire
$2,250 voucher, at most $8.2 million of public funds flowed to
religious schools under the voucher program in 1999-2000.
Although just over one-half as many students attended community schools as religious private schools on the state fisc,
the State spent over $1 million more--$9.4 million--on students in community schools than on students in religious private schools because per-pupil aid to community schools is
more than double the per-pupil aid to private schools under
the voucher program. Moreover, the amount spent on
religious private schools is minor compared to the $114.8
million the State spent on students in the Cleveland magnet schools.

Although $8.2 million is no small sum, it pales in compari-son to the amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide religious institutions. Religiousorganizations may qualify for exemptions from the federal
corporate income tax, see 26 U. S. C. $ 501(c)(3); the corporateincome tax in many States, see,

e. g., Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code
Ann. $ 23701d (West 1992); and property taxes in all 50
States, see Turner, Property Tax Exemptions for Nonprofits,12 Probate & Property 25 (Sept. /Oct. 1998); and clergy qualify for a federal tax break on income used for housingexpenses, 26 U. S. C. $ 1402(a)(8). In addition, the Federal
Government provides individuals, corporations, trusts, and
estates a tax deduction for charitable contributions to qualified religious groups. See $$ 170, 642(c). Finally, the Federal Government and certain state governments provide tax
credits for educational expenses, many of which are spent on
education at religious schools. See, e. g., $ 25A (Hope tax
credit); Minn. Stat. $ 290.0674 (Supp. 2001).

Most of these tax policies are well established, see, e. g.,
Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983) (upholding Minnesota tax deduction for educational expenses); Walz v. Tax
Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970) (upholding
an exemption for religious organizations from New York
property tax), yet confer a significant relative benefit on religious institutions. The state property tax exemptions for
religious institutions alone amount to very large sums annually. For example, available data suggest that Colorado's
exemption lowers that State's tax revenues by more than
$40 million annually, see Rabey, Exemptions a Matter of

Housing, Star Tribune (Minneapolis-St. Paul), Mar. 30, 2002,

through childcare programs such as the Child Care and Development Block Grant Program (CCDBG), 42 U. S. C. $ 9858
(1994 ed., Supp. V). Medicare and Medicaid provide federal
funds to pay for the healthcare of the elderly and the poor,
respectively, see 1 B. Furrow, T. Greaney, S. Johnson,
T. Jost, & R. Schwartz, Health Law 545-546 (2d ed. 2000); 2

higher education of low-income individuals and veterans, respectively, see Mulleneaux, The Failure to Provide Adequate

finances child care for low-income parents, see Pitegoff,
Child Care Policy and the Welfare Reform Act, 6 J. Affordable Housing & Community Dev. L. 113, 121-122 (1997).
These programs are well-established parts of our social welfare system, see, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious
Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782-783, n. 38 (1973), and
can be quite substantial, see Statistical Abstract 92 (Table

A significant portion of the funds appropriated for these
programs reach religiously affiliated institutions, typically
without restrictions on its subsequent use. For example, it
has been reported that religious hospitals, which account
for 18 percent of all hospital beds nationwide, rely on
Medicare funds for 36 percent of their revenue. MergerWatch, New Study Details Public Funding of Religious Hospitals (Jan. 2002), http://www.mergerwatch.org/inthenews/

Medicare and Medicaid, religious hospitals received nearly
$45 billion from the federal fisc in 1998. Ibid. Federal aid

to religious schools is also substantial. Although data for allStates are not available, data from Minnesota, for example,

suggest that a substantial share of Pell Grant and otherfederal funds for college tuition reach religious schools.
Roughly one-third or $27.1 million of the federal tuition dol-lars spent on students at schools in Minnesota were used at
private 4-year colleges. Minnesota Higher Education Serv-ices Office, Financial Aid Awarded, Fiscal Year 1999: Grants,
Loans, and Student Earning from Institution Jobs (Jan. 24,2001). The vast majority of these funds--$23.5 million--
flowed to religiously affiliated institutions. Ibid.Against this background, the support that the Cleveland
voucher program provides religious institutions is neithersubstantial nor atypical of existing government programs.
While this observation is not intended to justify the Cleve-land voucher program under the Establishment Clause, see
post, at 709-710, n. 19 (Souter, J., dissenting), it places inbroader perspective alarmist claims about implications of

the Cleveland program and the Court's decision in thesecases. See post, at 685-686 (S

Nor does today's decision signal a major departure fromthis Court's prior Establishment Clause jurisprudence. A

central tool in our analysis of cases in this area has been the
Lemon test. As originally formulated, a statute passed thistest only if it had "a secular legislative purpose," if its "principal or primary effect" was one that "neither advance[d] norinhibit[ed] religion," and if it did "not foster an excessive
government entanglement with religion." Lemon v. Kurtz-man, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613 (1971) (internal quotation marks
omitted). In Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 218, 232-233(1997), we folded the entanglement inquiry into the primary
effect inquiry. This made sense because both inquiries relyon the same evidence, see

ibid., and the degree of entangle536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

669Cite as: 536 U. S. 639 (2002)
O'Connor, J., concurring
ment has implications for whether a statute advances orinhibits religion, see

Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 688
(1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The test today is basi-cally the same as that set forth in

School Dist. of Abington
Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 222 (1963) (citing Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947); McGowan
v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 442 (1961)), over 40 years ago.

The Court's opinion in these cases focuses on a narrowquestion related to the

Lemon test: how to apply the primary
effects prong in indirect aid cases? Specifically, it clari-fies the basic inquiry when trying to determine whether a

program that distributes aid to beneficiaries, rather than
directly to service providers, has the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra,
at 613-614, or, as I have put it, of "endors[ing] or disapprov[ing] . . . religion," Lynch v. Donnelly, supra, at 691-692
(concurring opinion); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38,
69-70 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). See
also ante, at 652. Courts are instructed to consider two factors: first, whether the program administers aid in a neutral
fashion, without differentiation based on the religious status
of beneficiaries or providers of services; second, and more
importantly, whether beneficiaries of indirect aid have a genuine choice among religious and nonreligious organizations
when determining the organization to which they will direct
that aid. If the answer to either query is "no," the program
should be struck down under the Establishment Clause.
See ante, at 652-653.

Justice Souter portrays this inquiry as a departure from
Everson. See post, at 687-688 (dissenting opinion). A fair
reading of the holding in that case suggests quite the opposite. Justice Black's opinion for the Court held that the
"[First] Amendment requires the state to be a neutral in
its relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers; it does not require the state to be their adversary."
Everson, supra, at 18; see also Schempp, supra, at 218, 222.

O'Connor, J., concurring
How else could the Court have upheld a state program toprovide students transportation to public and religious

schools alike? What the Court clarifies in these cases is thatthe Establishment Clause also requires that state aid flowing
to religious organizations through the hands of beneficiariesmust do so only at the direction of those beneficiaries. Such
a refinement of the Lemon test surely does not betray
Everson. III

There is little question in my mind that the Clevelandvoucher program is neutral as between religious schools and
nonreligious schools. See ante, at 653-654. Justice Souter rejects the Court's notion of neutrality, proposing thatthe neutrality of a program should be gauged not by the

opportunities it presents but rather by its effects. In partic-ular, a "neutrality test . . . [should] focus on a category of aid
that may be directed to religious as well as secular schools,and ask whether the scheme favors a religious direction."
Post, at 697 (dissenting opinion). Justice Souter doubtsthat the Cleveland program is neutral under this view. He
surmises that the cap on tuition that voucher schools maycharge low-income students encourages these students to
attend religious rather than nonreligious private voucherschools. See

post, at 704-705. But Justice Souter's no-tion of neutrality is inconsistent with that in our case law.

As we put it in Agostini, government aid must be "madeavailable to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis." 521 U. S., at 231.I do not agree that the nonreligious schools have failed to
provide Cleveland parents reasonable alternatives to reli-gious schools in the voucher program. For nonreligious
schools to qualify as genuine options for parents, they neednot be superior to religious schools in every respect. They
need only be adequate substitutes for religious schools in theeyes of parents. The District Court record demonstrates
that nonreligious schools were able to compete effectively

O'Connor, J., concurring
with Catholic and other religious schools in the Cleveland
voucher program. See ante, at 656-657, n. 4. The best evidence of this is that many parents with vouchers selected
nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives and
an even larger number of parents send their children to community and magnet schools rather than seeking vouchers at
all. Supra, at 663-664. Moreover, there is no record evidence that any voucher-eligible student was turned away
from a nonreligious private school in the voucher program,
let alone a community or magnet school. See 234 F. 3d 945,
969 (CA6 2000) (Ryan, J., concurring in part and dissenting
in part); Affidavit of David L. Brennan || 8, App. 147a.

To support his hunch about the effect of the cap on tuition
under the voucher program, Justice Souter cites national
data to suggest that, on average, Catholic schools have a cost
advantage over other types of schools. See post, at 705-706,
n. 15 (dissenting opinion). Even if national statistics were
relevant for evaluating the Cleveland program, Justice Souter ignores evidence which suggests that, at a national level,
nonreligious private schools may target a market for a different, if not a higher, quality of education. For example, nonreligious private schools are smaller, see U. S. Dept. of Ed.,
National Center for Education Statistics, Private School Universe Survey, 1997-1998 (Oct. 1999) (Table 60) (87 and 269
students per private nonreligious and Catholic elementary
school, respectively); have smaller class sizes, see ibid. (9.4
and 18.8 students per teacher at private nonreligious and
Catholic elementary schools, respectively); have more highly
educated teachers, see U. S. Dept. of Ed., National Center for
Education Statistics, Private Schools in the United States: A
Statistical Profile, 1993-1994 (NCES 97-459, July 1997)
(Table 3.4) (37.9 percent of nonreligious private school teachers but only 29.9 percent of Catholic school teachers have
Master's degrees); and have principals with longer job tenure than Catholic schools, see ibid. (Table 3.7) (average ten536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

O'Connor, J., concurring
ure of principals at private nonreligious and Catholic schoolsis 8.2 and 4.7 years, respectively).

Additionally, Justice Souter's theory that the Clevelandvoucher program's cap on the tuition encourages low-income
students to attend religious schools ignores that these stu-dents receive nearly double the amount of tuition assistance
under the community schools program than under the
voucher program and that none of the community schools isreligious. See

ante, at 647.
In my view the more significant finding in these cases isthat Cleveland parents who use vouchers to send their children to religious private schools do so as a result of true
private choice. The Court rejects, correctly, the notion that
the high percentage of voucher recipients who enroll in religious private schools necessarily demonstrates that parents
do not actually have the option to send their children to nonreligious schools. Ante, at 656-660. Likewise, the mere
fact that some parents enrolled their children in religious
schools associated with a different faith than their own, see
post, at 704 (Souter, J., dissenting), says little about
whether these parents had reasonable nonreligious options.
Indeed, no voucher student has been known to be turned
away from a nonreligious private school participating in the
voucher program. Supra this page. This is impressive
given evidence in the record that the present litigation has
discouraged the entry of some nonreligious private schools
into the voucher program. Declaration of David P. Zanotti
|||| 5, 10, App. 225a, 227a. Finally, as demonstrated above,
the Cleveland program does not establish financial incentives
to undertake a religious education.

I find the Court's answer to the question whether parents
of students eligible for vouchers have a genuine choice between religious and nonreligious schools persuasive. In
looking at the voucher program, all the choices available to
potential beneficiaries of the government program should be
considered. In these cases, parents who were eligible to

apply for a voucher also had the option, at a minimum, tosend their children to community schools. Yet the Court of

Appeals chose not to look at community schools, let alonemagnet schools, when evaluating the Cleveland voucher program. See 234 F. 3d, at 958. That decision was incorrect.Focusing in these cases only on the program challenged by
respondents ignores how the educational system in Cleveland actually functions. The record indicates that, in 1999,two nonreligious private schools that had previously served

15 percent of the students in the voucher program wereprompted to convert to community schools because parents
were concerned about the litigation surrounding the program, and because a new community schools program provided more per-pupil financial aid. Many of the students
that enrolled in the two schools under the voucher program
transferred to the community schools program and continued
to attend these schools. See Affidavit of David L. Brennan
|||| 3, 10, App. 145a, 147a; Declaration of David P. Zanotti
|||| 4-10, id., at 225a-227a. This incident provides strong
evidence that both parents and nonreligious schools view
the voucher program and the community schools program as
reasonable alternatives.

Considering all the educational options available to parents whose children are eligible for vouchers, including community and magnet schools, the Court finds that parents in
the Cleveland schools have an array of nonreligious options.
Ante, at 655. Not surprisingly, respondents present no evidence that any students who were candidates for a voucher
were denied slots in a community school or a magnet school.
Indeed, the record suggests the opposite with respect to
community schools. See Affidavit of David L. Brennan || 8,
App. 147a.

Justice Souter nonetheless claims that, of the 10 community schools operating in Cleveland during the 1999-2000
school year, 4 were unavailable to students with vouchers
and 4 others reported poor test scores. See post, at 702-

O'Connor, J., concurring
703, n. 10 (dissenting opinion). But that analysis unrea-sonably limits the choices available to Cleveland parents. It

is undisputed that Cleveland's 24 magnet schools are rea-sonable alternatives to voucher schools. See

post, at 701-
702, n. 9 (Souter, J., dissenting); http://www.cmsdnet.net/administration/EducationalServices/magnet.htm (June 20,

2002). And of the four community schools Justice Souter
claims are unavailable to voucher students, he is correct onlyabout one (Life Skills Center of Cleveland). Affidavit of

Steven M. Puckett || 12, App. 162a. Justice Souter re-jects the three other community schools (Horizon Science
Academy, Cleveland Alternative Learning, and International
Preparatory School) because they did not offer primary
school classes, were targeted toward poor students or students with disciplinary or academic problems, or were not in
operation for a year. See post, at 702-703, n. 10. But a
community school need not offer primary school classes to be
an alternative to religious middle schools, and catering to
impoverished or otherwise challenged students may make a
school more attractive to certain inner-city parents. Moreover, the one community school that was closed in 1999-

2000 was merely looking for a new location and was operational in other years. See Affidavit of Steven M. Puckett
|| 12, App. 162a; Ohio Dept. of Ed., Office of School Options, Community Schools, Ohio's Community School Directory (June 22, 2002), http://www.ode.state.oh.us/community_
schools/community_school_directory/default.asp. Two more
community schools were scheduled to open after the 1999-
2000 school year. See Affidavit of Steven M. Puckett || 13,
App. 163a.

Of the six community schools that Justice Souter admits
as alternatives to the voucher program in 1999-2000, he
notes that four (the Broadway, Cathedral, Chapelside, and
Lincoln Park campuses of the Hope Academy) reported
lower test scores than public schools during the school year

spondents, according to report cards prepared by the OhioDepartment of Education. See

post, at 702-703, n. 10 (dissenting opinion). (One, Old Brooklyn Montessori School,performed better than public schools.

Ibid.; see also Ohio
Dept. of Ed., 2001 Community School Report Card, OldBrooklyn Montessori School 5 (community school scored

higher than public schools in four of five subjects in 1999-
2000).) These report cards underestimate the value of thefour Hope Academy schools. Before they entered the community school program, two of them participated in thevoucher program. Although they received far less state
funding in that capacity, they had among the highest rates
of parental satisfaction of all voucher schools, religious or
nonreligious. See P. Peterson, W. Howell, & J. Greene, An
Evaluation of the Cleveland Voucher Program after Two
Years 6, Table 4 (June 1999) (hereinafter Peterson). This is
particularly impressive given that a Harvard University
study found that the Hope Academy schools attracted the
"poorest and most educationally disadvantaged students."
J. Greene, W. Howell, P. Peterson, Lessons from the Cleveland Scholarship Program 22, 24 (Oct. 15, 1997). Moreover,
Justice Souter's evaluation of the Hope Academy schools
assumes that the only relevant measure of school quality is
academic performance. It is reasonable to suppose, however, that parents in the inner city also choose schools that
provide discipline and a safe environment for their children.
On these dimensions some of the schools that Justice Souter derides have performed quite ably. See Peterson,
Table 7.

Ultimately, Justice Souter relies on very narrow data to
draw rather broad conclusions. One year of poor test scores
at four community schools targeted at the most challenged
students from the inner city says little about the value of
those schools, let alone the quality of the 6 other community
schools and 24 magnet schools in Cleveland. Justice Souter's use of statistics confirms the Court's wisdom in refus536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ing to consider them when assessing the Cleveland program'sconstitutionality. See ante, at 658. What appears to motivate Justice Souter's analysis is a desire for a limitingprinciple to rule out certain nonreligious schools as alternatives to religious schools in the voucher program. See post,at 700, 701-702, n. 9 (dissenting opinion). But the goal of the
Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence is to determinewhether, after the Cleveland voucher program was enacted,
parents were free to direct state educational aid in eithera nonreligious or religious direction. See

ante, at 655-656.That inquiry requires an evaluation of all reasonable educational options Ohio provides the Cleveland school system,regardless of whether they are formally made available in
the same section of the Ohio Code as the voucher program.Based on the reasoning in the Court's opinion, which is
consistent with the realities of the Cleveland educational sys-tem, I am persuaded that the Cleveland voucher program
affords parents of eligible children genuine nonreligious op-tions and is consistent with the Establishment Clause.

example of such failures. Besieged by escalating financial
problems and declining academic achievement, the Cleveland
City School District was in the midst of an academic emergency when Ohio enacted its scholarship program.

The dissents and respondents wish to invoke the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, as incorporated
through the Fourteenth, to constrain a State's neutral efforts
to provide greater educational opportunity for underprivileged minority students. Today's decision properly upholds
the program as constitutional, and I join it in full.

I
This Court has often considered whether efforts to provide children with the best educational resources conflict
with constitutional limitations. Attempts to provide aid to
religious schools or to allow some degree of religious involvement in public schools have generated significant controversy and litigation as States try to navigate the line
between the secular and the religious in education. See
generally Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Ed. of School
Dist. No. 71, Champaign Cty., 333 U. S. 203, 237-238 (1948)
(Jackson, J., concurring) (noting that the Constitution does
not tell judges "where the secular ends and the sectarian
begins in education"). We have recently decided several
cases challenging federal aid programs that include religious
schools. See, e. g., Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U. S. 793 (2000);
Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997). To determine
whether a federal program survives scrutiny under the Establishment Clause, we have considered whether it has a
secular purpose and whether it has the primary effect of
advancing or inhibiting religion. See Mitchell, supra, at
807-808. I agree with the Court that Ohio's program easily
passes muster under our stringent test, but, as a matter of
first principles, I question whether this test should be applied to the States.

678 ZELMAN v. SIMMONS-HARRIS

Thomas, J., concurring
The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment statesthat "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." On its face, this provision places no limiton the States with regard to religion. The Establishment
Clause originally protected States, and by extension theircitizens, from the imposition of an established religion by the
Federal Government.2 Whether and how this Clause shouldconstrain state action under the Fourteenth Amendment is
a more difficult question.The Fourteenth Amendment fundamentally restructured
the relationship between individuals and the States andensured that States would not deprive citizens of liberty
without due process of law. It guarantees citizenship to allindividuals born or naturalized in the United States and
provides that "[n]o State shall make or enforce any law whichshall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life,liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to
any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws." As Justice Harlan noted, the Fourteenth Amendment "added greatly to the dignity and glory of Americancitizenship, and to the security of personal liberty."

Plessy
v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, 555 (1896) (dissenting opinion).When rights are incorporated against the States through the

Fourteenth Amendment they should advance, not constrain,individual liberty.

Consequently, in the context of the Establishment Clause,it may well be that state action should be evaluated on different terms than similar action by the Federal Government."States, while bound to observe strict neutrality, should be
freer to experiment with involvement [in religion]--on a neu2 See, e. g., School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S.

was primarily an attempt to insure that Congress not only would be powerless to establish a national church, but would also be unable to interfere
with existing state establishments"); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S.

tral basis--than the Federal Government." Walz v. TaxComm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 699 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring). Thus, while the Federal Governmentmay "make no law respecting an establishment of religion,"
the States may pass laws that include or touch on religiousmatters so long as these laws do not impede free exercise
rights or any other individual religious liberty interest. Byconsidering the particular religious liberty right alleged to
be invaded by a State, federal courts can strike a properbalance between the demands of the Fourteenth Amendment
on the one hand and the federalism prerogatives of States onthe other.

3

Whatever the textual and historical merits of incorporat-ing the Establishment Clause, I can accept that the Fourteenth Amendment protects religious liberty rights.4 But I

3 Several Justices have suggested that rights incorporated through the
Fourteenth Amendment apply in a different manner to the States than
they do to the Federal Government. For instance, Justice Jackson stated,
"[t]he inappropriateness of a single standard for restricting State and Nation is indicated by the disparity between their functions and duties in
relation to those freedoms." Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U. S. 250, 294
(1952) (dissenting opinion). Justice Harlan noted: "The Constitution
differentiates between those areas of human conduct subject to the regulation of the States and those subject to the powers of the Federal Government. The substantive powers of the two governments, in many
instances, are distinct. And in every case where we are called upon to
balance the interest in free expression against other interests, it seems to
me important that we should keep in the forefront the question of whether
those other interests are state or federal." Roth v. United States, 354
U. S. 476, 503-504 (1957) (dissenting opinion). See also Gitlow v. New
York, 268 U. S. 652, 672 (1925) (Holmes, J., dissenting).

4 In particular, these rights inhere in the Free Exercise Clause, which

unlike the Establishment Clause protects individual liberties of religious
worship. "That the central value embodied in the First Amendment--
and, more particularly, in the guarantee of `liberty' contained in the Fourteenth--is the safeguarding of an individual's right to free exercise of his

cannot accept its use to oppose neutral programs of schoolchoice through the incorporation of the Establishment

Clause. There would be a tragic irony in converting theFourteenth Amendment's guarantee of individual liberty
into a prohibition on the exercise of educational choice.

II
The wisdom of allowing States greater latitude in dealingwith matters of religion and education can be easily appreciated in this context. Respondents advocate using the Four-teenth Amendment to handcuff the State's ability to experiment with education. But without education one can hardlyexercise the civic, political, and personal freedoms conferred
by the Fourteenth Amendment. Faced with a severe educa-tional crisis, the State of Ohio enacted wide-ranging educational reform that allows voluntary participation of privateand religious schools in educating poor urban children otherwise condemned to failing public schools. The program doesnot force any individual to submit to religious indoctrination
or education. It simply gives parents a greater choice as towhere and in what manner to educate their children.

is a choice that those with greater means have routinelyexercised.

choose how and in what manner to educate their children. "The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments in this Union repose
excludes any general power of the State to standardize its children by
forcing them to accept instruction from public teachers only. The child is
not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his
destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations." Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268

Cleveland parents now have a variety of educati onalchoices. There are traditi onal public schools, magnet

schools, and privately run community schools, in addition tothe scholarship program. Currently, 46 of the 56 private
schools participating in the scholarship program are churchaffiliated (35 are Catholic), and 96 percent of students in the
program attend religious schools. See App. 281a-286a; 234F. 3d 945, 949 (CA6 2000). Thus, were the Court to disallow
the inclusion of religious schools, Cleveland children coulduse their scholarships at only 10 private schools.

In addition to expanding the reach of the scholarship pro-gram, the inclusion of religious schools makes sense given
Ohio's purpose of increasing educational performance andopportunities. Religious schools, like other private schools,
achieve far better educational results than their public coun-terparts. For example, the students at Cleveland's Catholic
schools score significantly higher on Ohio proficiency teststhan students at Cleveland public schools. Of Cleveland
eighth graders taking the 1999 Ohio proficiency test, 95 per-cent in Catholic schools passed the reading test, whereas
only 57 percent in public schools passed. And 75 percent ofCatholic school students passed the math proficiency test,
compared to only 22 percent of public school students. SeeBrief for Petitioners in No. 00-1777, p. 10. But the success
of religious and private schools is in the end beside the point,because the State has a constitutional right to experiment
with a variety of different programs to promote educationalopportunity. That Ohi o's program includes successful
schools simply indicates that such reform can in fact provideimproved education to underprivileged urban children.

Although one of the purposes of public schools was to pro-mote democracy and a more egalitarian culture,

of Reconstruction, blacks considered public education "amatter of personal liberation and a necessary function of a

free society." J. Anderson, Education of Blacks in the South,1860-1935, p. 18 (1988). Today, however, the promise of public school education has failed poor inner-city blacks. Whilein theory providing education to everyone, the quality of
public schools varies significantly across districts. Just asblacks supported public education during Reconstruction,
many blacks and other minorities now support school choiceprograms because they provide the greatest educational opportunities for their children in struggling communities.7Opponents of the program raise formalistic concerns about
the Establishment Clause but ignore the core purposes ofthe Fourteenth Amendment.

While the romanticized ideal of universal public educationresonates with the cognoscenti who oppose vouchers, poor
urban families just want the best education for their chil-dren, who will certainly need it to function in our high-tech
and advanced society. As Thomas Sowell noted 30 yearsago: "Most black people have faced too many grim, concrete
problems to be romantics. They want and need certain tan-gible results, which can be achieved only by developing certain specific abilities." Black Education: Myths and Trage-dies 228 (1972). The same is true today. An individual's
life prospects increase dramatically with each successfullycompleted phase of education. For instance, a black high

schools. "[T]he appeal of private schools is especially strong among parents who are low in income, minority, and live in low-performing districts:
precisely the parents who are the most disadvantaged under the current
system." T. Moe, Schools, Vouchers, and the American Public 164 (2001).
Nearly three-fourths of all public school parents with an annual income
less than $20,000 support vouchers, compared to 57 percent of public school
parents with an annual income of over $60,000. See id., at 214 (Table 7-3).
In addition, 75 percent of black public school parents support vouchers, as
do 71 percent of Hispanic public school parents. Ibid.

school dropout earns just over $13,500, but with a high schooldegree the average income is almost $21,000. Blacks with a

bachelor's degree have an average annual income of about$37,500, and $75,500 with a professional degree. See U. S.
Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstractof the United States 140 (2001) (Table 218). Staying in
school and earning a degree generates real and tangible fi-nancial benefits, whereas failure to obtain even a high school
degree essentially relegates students to a life of poverty and,all too often, of crime.

8 The failure to provide education to

poor urban children perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty,dependence, criminality, and alienation that continues for the

remainder of their lives. If society cannot end racial dis-crimination, at least it can arm minorities with the education
to defend themselves from some of discrimination's effects.

Ten States have enacted some form of publicly funded pri-vate school choice as one means of raising the quality of education provided to underprivileged urban children.9 Theseprograms address the root of the problem with failing urban

obstacle against education reform distorts our constitutionalvalues and disserves those in the greatest need.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Is a law that authorizes the use of public funds to pay for
the indoctrination of thousands of grammar school childrenin particular religious faiths a "law respecting an establishment of religion" within the meaning of the First Amend-ment? In answering that question, I think we should ignore three factual matters that are discussed at length bymy colleagues.

First, the severe educational crisis that confronted the
Cleveland City School District when Ohio enacted its
voucher program is not a matter that should affect our appraisal of its constitutionality. In the 1999-2000 school year,
that program provided relief to less than five percent of the
students enrolled in the district's schools. The solution to
the disastrous conditions that prevented over 90 percent of
the student body from meeting basic proficiency standards
obviously required massive improvements unrelated to the
voucher program.1 Of course, the emergency may have

least, to allow that reform effort and the district's experimentation with
alternative public schools to take effect before relying on Cleveland's educational crisis as a reason for state financed religious education.

given some families a powerful motivation to leave the publicschool system and accept religious indoctrination that they

would otherwise have avoided, but that is not a valid reasonfor upholding the program.

Second, the wide range of choices that have been madeavailable to students within the public school system has no
bearing on the question whether the State may pay the tu-ition for students who wish to reject public education entirely and attend private schools that will provide them witha sectarian education. The fact that the vast majority of
the voucher recipients who have entirely rejected public edu-cation receive religious indoctrination at state expense does,
however, support the claim that the law is one "respectingan establishment of religion." The State may choose to divide up its public schools into a dozen different options andlabel them magnet schools, community schools, or whatever
else it decides to call them, but the State is still required toprovide a public education and it is the State's decision to
fund private school education over and above its traditionalobligation that is at issue in these cases.

2

Third, the voluntary character of the private choice to pre-fer a parochial education over an education in the public

school system seems to me quite irrelevant to the questionwhether the government's choice to pay for religious indoctrination is constitutionally permissible. Today, however,the Court seems to have decided that the mere fact that a
family that cannot afford a private education wants its chil-dren educated in a parochial school is a sufficient justification
for this use of public funds.For the reasons stated by

Justice Souter and Justice
Breyer, I am convinced that the Court's decision is pro-foundly misguided. Admittedly, in reaching that conclusion

2 The Court suggests that an education at one of the district's community
or magnet schools is provided "largely at state expense." Ante, at 660,

at state expense--as the State is required to do.

I have been influenced by my understanding of the impact ofreligious strife on the decisions of our forbears to migrate to

this continent, and on the decisions of neighbors in the Bal-kans, Northern Ireland, and the Middle East to mistrust one
another. Whenever we remove a brick from the wall thatwas designed to separate religion and government, we increase the risk of religious strife and weaken the foundationof our democracy.

I respectfully dissent.
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court's majority holds that the Establishment Clauseis no bar to Ohio's payment of tuition at private religious

elementary and middle schools under a scheme that system-atically provides tax money to support the schools' religious
missions. The occasion for the legislation thus upheld is thecondition of public education in the city of Cleveland. The
record indicates that the schools are failing to serve theirobjective, and the vouchers in issue here are said to be
needed to provide adequate alternatives to them. If therewere an excuse for giving short shrift to the Establishment
Clause, it would probably apply here. But there is no ex-cuse. Constitutional limitations are placed on government
to preserve constitutional values in hard cases, like these."[C]onstitutional lines have to be drawn, and on one side of
every one of them is an otherwise sympathetic case that pro-vokes impatience with the Constitution and with the line.
But constitutional lines are the price of constitutional gov-ernment."

no dissent:

"No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied tosupport any religious activities or institutions, whatever

they may be called, or whatever form they may adoptto teach or practice religion."

The Court has never in so many words repudiated this statement, let alone, in so many words, overruled Everson.Today, however, the majority holds that the Establishment

Clause is not offended by Ohio's Pilot Project ScholarshipProgram, under which students may be eligible to receive as
much as $2,250 in the form of tuition vouchers transferableto religious schools. In the city of Cleveland the overwhelming proportion of large appropriations for vouchermoney must be spent on religious schools if it is to be spent
at all, and will be spent in amounts that cover almost allof tuition. The money will thus pay for eligible students'
instruction not only in secular subjects but in religion as
well, in schools that can fairly be characterized as foundedto teach religious doctrine and to imbue teaching in all subjects with a religious dimension.2 Public tax money will payat a systemic level for teaching the covenant with Israel and
Mosaic law in Jewish schools, the primacy of the ApostlePeter and the Papacy in Catholic schools, the truth of reformed Christianity in Protestant schools, and the revelationto the Prophet in Muslim schools, to speak only of major
religious groupings in the Republic.

Souter, J., dissenting
How can a Court consistently leave Everson on the booksand approve the Ohio vouchers? The answer is that it cannot. It is only by ignoring Everson that the majority canclaim to rest on traditional law in its invocation of neutral
aid provisions and private choice to sanction the Ohio law.It is, moreover, only by ignoring the meaning of neutrality
and private choice themselves that the majority can evenpretend to rest today's decision on those criteria.

I
The majority's statements of Establishment Clause doc-trine cannot be appreciated without some historical perspective on the Court's announced limitations on government aidto religious education, and its repeated repudiation of limits
previously set. My object here is not to give any nuancedexposition of the cases, which I tried to classify in some detail in an earlier opinion, see Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U. S.793, 873-899 (2000) (dissenting opinion), but to set out the
broad doctrinal stages covered in the modern era, and toshow that doctrinal bankruptcy has been reached today.

Viewed with the necessary generality, the cases can becategorized in three groups. In the period from 1947 to
1968, the basic principle of no aid to religion through schoolbenefits was unquestioned. Thereafter for some 15 years,
the Court termed its efforts as attempts to draw a lineagainst aid that would be divertible to support the religious,
as distinct from the secular, activity of an institutional bene-ficiary. Then, starting in 1983, concern with divertibility
was gradually lost in favor of approving aid in amounts un-likely to afford substantial benefits to religious schools, when
offered evenhandedly without regard to a recipient's reli-gious character, and when channeled to a religious institution only by the genuinely free choice of some private indi-vidual. Now, the three stages are succeeded by a fourth, in
which the substantial character of government aid is held tohave no constitutional significance, and the espoused criteria

of neutrality in offering aid, and private choice in directingit, are shown to be nothing but examples of verbal formalism.

A
Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing inaugurated the moderndevelopment of Establishment Clause doctrine at the behest

of a taxpayer challenging state provision of "tax-raised fundsto pay the bus fares of parochial school pupils" on regular
city buses as part of a general scheme to reimburse thepublic-transportation costs of children attending both public
and private nonprofit schools. 330 U. S., at 17. Althoughthe Court split, no Justice disagreed with the basic doctrinal
principle already quoted, that "[n]o tax in any amount . . .can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, . . . whatever form they may adopt to teach . . .religion."

Id., at 16. Nor did any Member of the Courtdeny the tension between the New Jersey program and the

aims of the Establishment Clause. The majority upheld thestate law on the strength of rights of religious-school students under the Free Exercise Clause, id., at 17-18, whichwas thought to entitle them to free public transportation
when offered as a "general government servic[e]" to allschoolchildren, id., at 17. Despite the indirect benefit to religious education, the transportation was simply treated like"ordinary police and fire protection, connections for sewage
disposal, public highways and sidewalks," id., at 17-18, and,most significantly, "state-paid policemen, detailed to protect
children going to and from church schools from the very realhazards of traffic,"

id., at 17. The dissenters, however,found the benefit to religion too pronounced to survive the

general principle of no establishment, no aid, and they de-scribed it as running counter to every objective served by
the establishment ban: New Jersey's use of tax-raised fundsforced a taxpayer to "contribut[e] to the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves in so far as . . . religions differ," id.,at 45 (internal quotation marks omitted); it exposed religious

principle of no aid was no less obvious some 20 years laterin Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392
U. S. 236 (1968), which upheld a New York law authorizinglocal school boards to lend textbooks in secular subjects to
children attending religious schools, a result not self-evidentfrom

Everson's "general government services" rationale.The Court relied instead on the theory that the in-kind aid

could only be used for secular educational purposes, 392U. S., at 243, and found it relevant that "no funds or books
are furnished [directly] to parochial schools, and the financialbenefit is to parents and children, not to schools," id., at 243-
244.4 Justice Black, who wrote Everson, led the dissenters.Textbooks, even when " `secular,' realistically will in some
way inevitably tend to propagate the religious views of the
favored sect," 392 U. S., at 252, he wrote, and Justice Douglasraised other objections underlying the establishment ban,

id., at 254-266. Religious schools would request thosebooks most in keeping with their faiths, and public boards
would have final approval power: "If the board of educationsupinely submits by approving and supplying the sectarian
or sectarian-oriented textbooks, the struggle to keep church

been struck down in six States, upheld in eight, and amicus curiae briefs
filed by "three religious sects, one labor union, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the states of Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan and New York").

4 The Court noted that "the record contains no evidence that any of the

private schools . . . previously provided textbooks for their students," and
"[t]here is some evidence that at least some of the schools did not." Allen,
392 U. S., at 244, n. 6. This was a significant distinction: if the parochial
schools provided secular textbooks to their students, then the State's provision of the same in their stead might have freed up church resources for
allocation to other uses, including, potentially, religious indoctrination.

drawn . . . ." Id., at 256 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Thescheme was sure to fuel strife among religions as well: "we
can rest assured that a contest will be on to provide thosebooks for religious schools which the dominant religious
group concludes best reflect the theocentric or other philoso-phy of the particular church."

Id., at 265.Transcending even the sharp disagreement, however, was

"the consistency in the way the Justices went about de-ciding the case . . . . Neither side rested on any facile
application of the `test' or any simplistic reliance on thegenerality or evenhandedness of the state law. Disagreement concentrated on the true intent inferrable be-hind the law, the feasibility of distinguishing in fact between religious and secular teaching in church schools,and the reality or sham of lending books to pupils instead of supplying books to schools. . . . [T]he stress wason the practical significance of the actual benefits received by the schools." Mitchell, 530 U. S., at 876 (Souter, J., dissenting).

B
Allen recognized the reality that "religious schools pursuetwo goals, religious instruction and secular education," 392

U. S., at 245; if state aid could be restricted to serve thesecond, it might be permissible under the Establishment
Clause. But in the retrenchment that followed, the Courtsaw that the two educational functions were so intertwined
in religious primary and secondary schools that aid to seculareducation could not readily be segregated, and the intrusive
monitoring required to enforce the line itself raised Estab-lishment Clause concerns about the entanglement of church
and state. See Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 620(1971) (striking down program supplementing salaries for
teachers of secular subjects in private schools). To avoid

Souter, J., dissenting
the entanglement, the Court's focus in the post-Allen caseswas on the principle of divertibility, on discerning when ostensibly secular government aid to religious schools was sus-ceptible to religious uses. The greater the risk of diversion
to religion (and the monitoring necessary to avoid it), theless legitimate the aid scheme was under the no-aid principle.
On the one hand, the Court tried to be practical, and when
the aid recipients were not so "pervasively sectarian" thattheir secular and religious functions were inextricably intertwined, the Court generally upheld aid earmarked for secu-lar use. See,

e. g., Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Md.,
426 U. S. 736 (1976); Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734 (1973);
Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971). But otherwise
the principle of nondivertibility was enforced strictly, with
its violation being presumed in most cases, even when state
aid seemed secular on its face. Compare, e. g., Levitt v.
Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472,
480 (1973) (striking down state program reimbursing private
schools' administrative costs for teacher-prepared tests in
compulsory secular subjects), with Wolman v. Walter, 433
U. S. 229, 255 (1977) (upholding similar program using standardized tests); and Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 369-372
(1975) (no public funding for staff and materials for "auxiliary
services" like guidance counseling and speech and hearing
services), with Wolman, supra, at 244 (permitting state aid
for diagnostic speech, hearing, and psychological testing).

The fact that the Court's suspicion of divertibility reflected
a concern with the substance of the no-aid principle is apparent in its rejection of stratagems invented to dodge it. In
Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,
413 U. S. 756 (1973), for example, the Court struck down a
New York program of tuition grants for poor parents and tax
deductions for more affluent ones who sent their children to
private schools. The Nyquist Court dismissed warranties of
a "statistical guarantee," that the scheme provided at most
15% of the total cost of an education at a religious school,

Souter, J., dissenting
id., at 787-788, which could presumably be matched to a secu-lar 15% of a child's education at the school. And it rejected

the idea that the path of state aid to religious schools mightbe dispositive: "far from providing a per se immunity from
examination of the substance of the State's program, the factthat aid is disbursed to parents rather than to the schools is
only one among many factors to be considered." Id., at 781.The point was that "the effect of the aid is unmistakably
to provide desired financial support for nonpublic, sectarianinstitutions."

Id., at 783.5 Nyquist thus held that aid toparents through tax deductions was no different from forbidden direct aid to religious schools for religious uses. Thefocus remained on what the public money bought when it
reached the end point of its disbursement.

C
Like all criteria requiring judicial assessment of risk, di-vertibility is an invitation to argument, but the object of the

arguments provoked has always been a realistic assessmentof facts aimed at respecting the principle of no aid. In
Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), however, that objectbegan to fade, for

Mueller started down the road from real-ism to formalism.

5 The Court similarly rejected a path argument in Wolman v. Walter,
433 U. S. 229 (1977), overruled by Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U. S. 793 (2000),
where the State sought to distinguish Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349
(1975), overruled by Mitchell, supra, based on the fact that, in Meek, the
State had lent educational materials to individuals rather than to schools.
"Despite the technical change in legal bailee," the Court explained, "the
program in substance is the same as before," and "it would exalt form
over substance if this distinction were found to justify a result different
from that in Meek." Wolman, supra, at 250. Conversely, the Court upheld a law reimbursing private schools for state-mandated testing, dismissing a proffered distinction based on the indirect path of aid in an

Nyquist, see 463 U. S., at 396-397, n. 6, and both were
substantively difficult to distinguish from aid directly to reli-gious schools,

id., at 399. But the Court upheld the Minnesota tax deductions in Mueller, emphasizing their neutralavailability for religious and secular educational expenses

and the role of private choice in taking them. Id., at 397-
398. The Court relied on the same two principles in Wittersv.

Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986),
approving one student's use of a vocational training subsidyfor the blind at a religious college, characterizing it as aid to

individuals from which religious schools could derive no
"large" benefit: "the full benefits of the program [are not]
limited, in large part or in whole, to students at sectarian
institutions." Id., at 488.

School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 395-
396, and n. 13 (1985), overruled in part by Agostini v. Felton,
521 U. S. 203 (1997), clarified that the notions of evenhandedness neutrality and private choice in Mueller did not apply
to cases involving direct aid to religious schools, which were
still subject to the divertibility test. But in Agostini, where
the substance of the aid was identical to that in Ball, public
employees teaching remedial secular classes in private
schools, the Court rejected the 30-year-old presumption of
divertibility, and instead found it sufficient that the aid "supplement[ed]" but did not "supplant" existing educational
services, 521 U. S., at 210, 230. The Court, contrary to Ball,
viewed the aid as aid "directly to the eligible students . . .
no matter where they choose to attend school." 521 U. S.,
at 229.

In the 12 years between Ball and Agostini, the Court decided not only Witters, but two other cases emphasizing the
form of neutrality and private choice over the substance of
aid to religious uses, but always in circumstances where any
aid to religion was isolated and insubstantial. Zobrest v.
Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), like Wit536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

ters, involved one student's choice to spend funds from a gen-eral public program at a religious school (to pay for a signlanguage interpreter). As in Witters, the Court reasonedthat "[d]isabled children, not sectarian schools, [were] the
primary beneficiaries . . . ; to the extent sectarian schoolsbenefit at all . . . , they are only incidental beneficiaries."
509 U. S., at 12. Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of
Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995), like Zobrest and Witters,involved an individual and insubstantial use of neutrally

available public funds for a religious purpose (to print anevangelical magazine).

To be sure, the aid in Agostini was systemic and arguablysubstantial, but, as I have said, the majority there chose to
view it as a bare "supplement." 521 U. S., at 229. And thiswas how the controlling opinion described the systemic aid
in our most recent case, Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U. S. 793(2000), as aid going merely to a "portion" of the religious
schools' budgets, id., at 860 (O'Connor, J., concurring injudgment). The plurality in that case did not feel so uncomfortable about jettisoning substance entirely in favor of form,finding it sufficient that the aid was neutral and that there
was virtual private choice, since any aid "first passes throughthe hands (literally or figuratively) of numerous private citizens who are free to direct the aid elsewhere." Id., at 816.But that was only the plurality view.

Hence it seems fair to say that it was not until today thatsubstantiality of aid has clearly been rejected as irrelevant
by a majority of this Court, just as it has not been untiltoday that a majority, not a plurality, has held purely formal
criteria to suffice for scrutinizing aid that ends up in thecoffers of religious schools. Today's cases are notable for
their stark illustration of the inadequacy of the majority'schosen formal analysis.

free choice, the facts show that, in the majority's hands,
even these criteria cannot convincingly legitimize the Ohio
scheme.

A

Consider first the criterion of neutrality. As recently as
two Terms ago, a majority of the Court recognized that neutrality conceived of as evenhandedness toward aid recipients
had never been treated as alone sufficient to satisfy the Establishment Clause, Mitchell, 530 U. S., at 838-839 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 884 (Souter, J.,
dissenting). But at least in its limited significance, formal
neutrality seemed to serve some purpose. Today, however,
the majority employs the neutrality criterion in a way that
renders it impossible to understand.

Neutrality in this sense refers, of course, to evenhandedness in setting eligibility as between potential religious and
secular recipients of public money. Id., at 809-810 (plurality opinion); id., at 878-884 (Souter, J., dissenting) (three
senses of "neutrality").6 Thus, for example, the aid scheme
in Witters provided an eligible recipient with a scholarship
to be used at any institution within a practically unlimited
universe of schools, 474 U. S., at 488; it did not tend to provide more or less aid depending on which one the scholarship
recipient chose, and there was no indication that the maximum scholarship amount would be insufficient at secular

6 Justice O'Connor apparently no longer distinguishes between this
notion of evenhandedness neutrality and the free-exercise neutrality in
Everson. Compare ante, at 669 (concurring opinion), with Mitchell, 530
U. S., at 839 (opinion concurring in judgment) ("Even if we at one time
used the term `neutrality' in a descriptive sense to refer to those aid programs characterized by the requisite equipoise between support of religion and antagonism to religion, Justice Souter's discussion convincingly demonstrates that the evolution in the meaning of the term in our
jurisprudence is cause to hesitate before equating the neutrality of recent
decisions with the neutrality of old").

schools. Neither did any condition of Zobrest's interpreter's
subsidy favor religious education. See 509 U. S., at 10.

In order to apply the neutrality test, then, it makes sense
to focus on a category of aid that may be directed to religious
as well as secular schools, and ask whether the scheme favors
a religious direction. Here, one would ask whether the
voucher provisions, allowing for as much as $2,250 toward
private school tuition (or a grant to a public school in an
adjacent district), were written in a way that skewed the
scheme toward benefiting religious schools.

This, however, is not what the majority asks. The majority looks not to the provisions for tuition vouchers, Ohio Rev.
Code Ann. $ 3313.976 (West Supp. 2002), but to every provision for educational opportunity: "The program permits the
participation of all schools within the district, [as well as
public schools in adjacent districts], religious or nonreligious." Ante, at 653 (emphasis in original). The majority
then finds confirmation that "participation of all schools" satisfies neutrality by noting that the better part of total state
educational expenditure goes to public schools, ante, at 654,
thus showing there is no favor of religion.

The illogic is patent. If regular, public schools (which can
get no voucher payments) "participate" in a voucher scheme
with schools that can, and public expenditure is still predominantly on public schools, then the majority's reasoning would
find neutrality in a scheme of vouchers available for private
tuition in districts with no secular private schools at all.
"Neutrality" as the majority employs the term is, literally,
verbal and nothing more. This, indeed, is the only way the
majority can gloss over the very nonneutral feature of the
total scheme covering "all schools": public tutors may receive from the State no more than $324 per child to support
extra tutoring (that is, the State's 90% of a total amount of
$360), App. 166a, whereas the tuition voucher schools (which

turn out to be mostly religious) can receive up to $2,250, id.,at 56a.

7

Why the majority does not simply accept the fact that thechallenge here is to the more generous voucher scheme and

judge its neutrality in relation to religious use of vouchermoney seems very odd. It seems odd, that is, until one recognizes that comparable schools for applying the criterion ofneutrality are also the comparable schools for applying the
other majority criterion, whether the immediate recipientsof voucher aid have a genuinely free choice of religious and
secular schools to receive the voucher money. And in apply-ing this second criterion, the consideration of "

all schools" isostensibly helpful to the majority position.

B
The majority addresses the issue of choice the same wayit addresses neutrality, by asking whether recipients or

potential recipients of voucher aid have a choice of publicschools among secular alternatives to religious schools.
Again, however, the majority asks the wrong question andmisapplies the criterion. The majority has confused choice
in spending scholarships with choice from the entire menu of

7 The majority's argument that public school students within the program "direct almost twice as much state funding to their chosen school as
do program students who receive a scholarship and attend a private
school," ante, at 654, n. 3, was decisively rejected in Committee for Public
Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782-783, n. 38 (1973):

"We do not agree with the suggestion . . . that tuition grants are an analogous endeavor to provide comparable benefits to all parents of schoolchildren whether enrolled in public or nonpublic schools. . . . The grants to
parents of private school children are given in addition to the right that
they have to send their children to public schools `totally at state expense.'
And in any event, the argument proves too much, for it would also provide
a basis for approving through tuition grants the complete subsidization
of all religious schools on the ground that such action is necessary if the
State is fully to equalize the position of parents who elect such schools--
a result wholly at variance with the Establishment Clause."

possible educational placements, most of them open to any-one willing to attend a public school. I say "confused" because the majority's new use of the choice criterion, which itframes negatively as "whether Ohio is coercing parents into
sending their children to religious schools," ante, at 655-656,ignores the reason for having a private choice enquiry in the
first place. Cases since Mueller have found private choicerelevant under a rule that aid to religious schools can be
permissible so long as it first passes through the hands ofstudents or parents.

8 The majority's view that all educational choices are comparable for purposes of choice thus ig-nores the whole point of the choice test: it is a criterion for

deciding whether indirect aid to a religious school is legiti-mate because it passes through private hands that can spend
or use the aid in a secular school. The question is whether
the private hand is genuinely free to send the money ineither a secular direction or a religious one. The majority

now has transformed this question about private choice in
channeling aid into a question about selecting from examplesof state spending (on education) including direct spending on

magnet and community public schools that goes through noprivate hands and could never reach a religious school under
any circumstance. When the choice test is transformedfrom where to spend the money to where to go to school, it
is cut loose from its very purpose.

8 In some earlier cases, "private choice" was sensibly understood to go
beyond the mere formalism of path, to ensure that aid was neither systemic nor predestined to go to religious uses. Witters, for example, had
a virtually unlimited choice among professional training schools, only a
few of which were religious; and Zobrest was simply one recipient who
chose to use a government-funded interpreter at a religious school over a
secular school, either of which was open to him. But recent decisions
seem to have stripped away any substantive bite, as "private choice" apparently means only that government aid follows individuals to religious
schools. See, e. g., Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 229 (1997) (state aid
for remedial instruction at a religious school goes "directly to the eligible
students . . . no matter where they choose to attend school").

700 ZELMAN v. SIMMONS-HARRIS

Souter, J., dissenting
Defining choice as choice in spending the money or chan-neling the aid is, moreover, necessary if the choice criterion

is to function as a limiting principle at all. If "choice" ispresent whenever there is any educational alternative to the
religious school to which vouchers can be endorsed, thenthere will always be a choice and the voucher can always be
constitutional, even in a system in which there is not a single
private secular school as an alternative to the religiousschool. See

supra, at 697 (noting the same result under the
majority's formulation of the neutrality criterion). And be-cause it is unlikely that any participating private religious

school will enroll more pupils than the generally available
public system, it will be easy to generate numbers suggesting that aid to religion is not the significant intent or effect
of the voucher scheme.

That is, in fact, just the kind of rhetorical argument that
the majority accepts in these cases. In addition to secular
private schools (129 students), the majority considers public
schools with tuition assistance (roughly 1,400 students), magnet schools (13,000 students), and community schools (1,900
students), and concludes that fewer than 20% of pupils receive state vouchers to attend religious schools. Ante, at
659. (In fact, the numbers would seem even more favorable to the majority's argument if enrollment in traditional
public schools without tutoring were considered, an alternative the majority thinks relevant to the private choice enquiry, ante, at 655.) Justice O'Connor focuses on how
much money is spent on each educational option and notes
that at most $8.2 million is spent on vouchers for students
attending religious schools, ante, at 664 (concurring opinion),
which is only 6% of the State's expenditure if one includes
separate funding for Cleveland's community ($9.4 million)
and magnet ($114.8 million) public schools. The variations
show how results may shift when a judge can pick and choose
the alternatives to use in the comparisons, and they also
show what dependably comfortable results the choice crite536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:02] PAGES PGT: OPLG

rion will yield if the identification of relevant choices is wideopen. If the choice of relevant alternatives is an open one,

proponents of voucher aid will always win, because they willalways be able to find a "choice" somewhere that will show
the bulk of public spending to be secular. The choice en-quiry will be diluted to the point that it can screen out nothing, and the result will always be determined by selectingthe alternatives to be treated as choices.

Confining the relevant choices to spending choices, on theother hand, is not vulnerable to comparable criticism. Although leaving the selection of alternatives for choice wideopen, as the majority would, virtually guarantees the availability of a "choice" that will satisfy the criterion, limitingthe choices to spending choices will not guarantee a negative
result in every case. There may, after all, be cases in whicha voucher recipient will have a real choice, with enough secular private school desks in relation to the number of religiousones, and a voucher amount high enough to meet secular private school tuition levels. See infra, at 704-707. But, evento the extent that choice-to-spend does tend to limit the number of religious funding options that pass muster, the choicecriterion has to be understood this way in order, as I have
said, for it to function as a limiting principle.9 Otherwise

9 The need for a limit is one answer to Justice O'Connor, who argues
at length that community schools should factor in the "private choice"
calculus. Ante, at 672-673 (concurring opinion). To be fair, community
schools do exhibit some features of private schools: they are autonomously
managed without any interference from the school district or State and
two have prior histories as private schools. It may be, then, that community schools might arguably count as choices because they are not like
other public schools run by the State or municipality, but in substance
merely private schools with state funding outside the voucher program.

But once any public school is deemed a relevant object of choice, there
is no stopping this progression. For example, both the majority and
Justice O'Connor characterize public magnet schools as an independent
category of genuine educational options, simply because they are "nontraditional" public schools. But they do not share the "private school" features of community schools, and the only thing that distinguishes them

there is surely no point in requiring the choice to be a trueor real or genuine one.

from "traditional" public schools is their thematic focus, which in some
cases appears to be nothing more than creative marketing. See, e. g.,
Cleveland Municipal School District, Magnet and Thematic Programs/
Schools (including, as magnet schools, "[f]undamental [e]ducation [c]enters," which employ "[t]raditional classrooms and teaching methods with
an emphasis on basic skills"; and "[a]ccelerated [l]earning" schools, which
rely on "[i]nstructional strategies [that] provide opportunities for students
to build on individual strengths, interests and talents").

10 And how should we decide which "choices" are "genuine" if the range

of relevant choices is theoretically wide open? The showcase educational
options that the majority and Justice O'Connor trumpet are Cleveland's
10 community schools, but they are hardly genuine choices. Two do not
even enroll students in kindergarten through third grade, App. 162a, and
thus parents contemplating participation in the voucher program cannot
select those schools. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 3313.975(C)(1) (West
Supp. 2002) ("[N]o new students may receive scholarships unless they are
enrolled in grade kindergarten, one, two, or three"). One school was not
"in operation" as of 1999, and in any event targeted students below the
federal poverty line, App. 162a, not all voucher-eligible students, see n. 21,
infra. Another school was a special population school for students with
"numerous suspensions, behavioral problems and who are a grade level
below their peers," App. 162a, which, as Justice O'Connor points out,
may be "more attractive to certain inner-city parents," ante, at 674, but
is probably not an attractive "choice" for most parents.

Of the six remaining schools, the most recent statistics on fourth-grade
student performance (unavailable for one school) indicate: three scored
well below the Cleveland average in each of five tested subjects on state
proficiency examinations, one scored above in one subject, and only one
community school, Old Brooklyn Montessori School, was even an arguable
competitor, scoring slightly better than traditional public schools in three
subjects, and somewhat below in two. See Ohio Dept. of Ed., 2002 Community School Report Card, Hope Academy, Lincoln Park, p. 5; id., Hope

at 5; id., Hope Academy, Broadway Campus, at 5; id., Old Brooklyn Montessori School, at 5; 2002 District Report Card, Cleveland Municipal School

It is not, of course, that I think even a genuine choice crite-rion is up to the task of the Establishment Clause when substantial state funds go to religious teaching; the discussionin Part III,

infra, shows that it is not. The point is simply
that if the majority wishes to claim that choice is a criterion,it must define choice in a way that can function as a criterion

with a practical capacity to screen something out.

If, contrary to the majority, we ask the right questionabout genuine choice to use the vouchers, the answer shows

that something is influencing choices in a way that aims themoney in a religious direction: of 56 private schools in the
district participating in the voucher program (only 53 ofwhich accepted voucher students in 1999-2000), 46 of them
are religious; 96.6% of all voucher recipients go to religiousschools, only 3.4% to nonreligious ones. See App. 281a-
286a. Unfortunately for the majority position, there is noexplanation for this that suggests the religious direction results simply from free choices by parents. One answer to
these statistics, for example, which would be consistent with
the genuine choice claimed to be operating, might be that
96.6% of families choosing to avail themselves of vouchers
choose to educate their children in schools of their own religion. This would not, in my view, render the scheme constitutional, but it would speak to the majority's choice criterion.

in the Cleveland City School District were proficient in math, as compared
with 3.3% in Hope Chapelside and 0% in Hope Cathedral).

I think that objective academic excellence should be the benchmark in
comparing schools under the majority's test; Justice O'Connor prefers
comparing educational options on the basis of subjective "parental satisfaction," ante, at 675, and I am sure there are other plausible ways to
evaluate "genuine choices." Until now, our cases have never talked about
the quality of educational options by whatever standard, but now that
every educational option is a relevant "choice," this is what the "genuine
and independent private choice" enquiry, ante, at 652 (opinion of the
Court), would seem to require if it is to have any meaning at all. But if
that is what genuine choice means, what does this enquiry have to do with
the Establishment Clause?

Evidence shows, however, that almost two out of three families using vouchers to send their children to religious schools
did not embrace the religion of those schools. App. to Pet.
for Cert. in No. 00-1777, p. 147a.11 The families made it
clear they had not chosen the schools because they wished
their children to be proselytized in a religion not their own,
or in any religion, but because of educational opportunity.12

Even so, the fact that some 2,270 students chose to apply
their vouchers to schools of other religions, App. 281a-286a,
might be consistent with true choice if the students "chose"
their religious schools over a wide array of private nonreligious options, or if it could be shown generally that Ohio's
program had no effect on educational choices and thus no
impermissible effect of advancing religious education. But
both possibilities are contrary to fact. First, even if all existing nonreligious private schools in Cleveland were willing
to accept large numbers of voucher students, only a few more
than the 129 currently enrolled in such schools would be able
to attend, as the total enrollment at all nonreligious private
schools in Cleveland for kindergarten through eighth grade
is only 510 children, see Brief for California Alliance for Public Schools as Amicus Curiae 15, and there is no indication
that these schools have many open seats.13 Second, the

11 For example, 40% of families who sent their children to private schools
for the first time under the voucher program were Baptist, App. 118a, but
only one school, enrolling 44 voucher students, is Baptist, id., at 284a.

12 When parents were surveyed as to their motives for enrolling their

children in the voucher program, 96.4% cited a better education than available in the public schools, and 95% said their children's safety. Id., at
69a-70a. When asked specifically in one study to identify the most important factor in selecting among participating private schools, 60% of parents
mentioned academic quality, teacher quality, or the substance of what is
taught (presumably secular); only 15% mentioned the religious affiliation
of the school as even a consideration. Id., at 119a.

13 Justice O'Connor points out that "there is no record evidence that

any voucher-eligible student was turned away from a nonreligious private
school in the voucher program." Ante, at 671. But there is equally no

$2,500 cap that the program places on tuition for participating low-income pupils has the effect of curtailing the participation of nonreligious schools: "nonreligious schools with
higher tuition (about $4,000) stated that they could afford to
accommodate just a few voucher students." 14 By comparison, the average tuition at participating Catholic schools in

cap.15

evidence to support her assertion that "many parents with vouchers selected nonreligious private schools over religious alternatives," ibid., and
in fact the evidence is to the contrary, as only 129 students used vouchers
at private nonreligious schools.

14 General Accounting Office Report No. 01-914, School Vouchers: Publicly Funded Programs in Cleveland and Milwaukee 25 (Aug. 2001) (GAO
Report). Of the 10 nonreligious private schools that "participate" in the
Cleveland voucher program, 3 currently enroll no voucher students. And
of the remaining seven schools, one enrolls over half of the 129 students
that attend these nonreligious schools, while only two others enroll more
than 8 voucher students. App. 281a-286a. Such schools can charge full
tuition to students whose families do not qualify as "low income," but
unless the number of vouchers are drastically increased, it is unlikely that
these students will constitute a large fraction of voucher recipients, as
the program gives preference in the allocation of vouchers to low-income
children. See Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 3313.978(A) (West Supp. 2002).

15 GAO Report 25. A 1993-1994 national study reported a similar average tuition for Catholic elementary schools ($1,572), but higher tuition for
other religious schools ($2,213), and nonreligious schools ($3,773). U. S.

figures are explained in part by the lower teaching expenses of the religious schools and general support by the parishes that run them. Catholic schools, for example, received 24.1% of their revenue from parish
subsidies in the 2000-2001 school year. National Catholic Educational

Of course, the obvious fix would be to increase the valueof vouchers so that existing nonreligious private and nonCatholic religious schools would be able to enroll morevoucher students, and to provide incentives for educators to
create new such schools given that few presently exist. Pri-vate choice, if as robust as that available to the seminarian
in Witters, would then be "true private choice" under themajority's criterion. But it is simply unrealistic to presume
that parents of elementary and middle school students inCleveland will have a range of secular and religious choices
even arguably comparable to the statewide program for vo-cational and higher education in

Witters. And to get to thathypothetical point would require that such massive financial

support be made available to religion as to disserve everyobjective of the Establishment Clause even more than the
present scheme does. See Part III-B, infra.16
and public school principals who reported an average salary of $72,587.
Ibid.

Justice O'Connor argues that nonreligious private schools can compete with Catholic and other religious schools below the $2,500 tuition cap.
See ante, at 670-671. The record does not support this assertion, as only
three secular private schools in Cleveland enroll more than eight voucher
students. See n. 14, supra. Nor is it true, as she suggests, that our
national statistics are spurious because secular schools cater to a different
market from Catholic or other religious schools: while there is a spectrum
of nonreligious private schools, there is likely a commensurate range of
low-end and high-end religious schools. My point is that at each level,
the religious schools have a comparative cost advantage due to church
subsidies, donations of the faithful, and the like. The majority says that
nonreligious private schools in Cleveland derive similar benefits from
"third-party contributions," ante, at 656, n. 4, but the one affidavit in the
record that backs up this assertion with data concerns a private school for
"emotionally disabled and developmentally delayed children" that received
11% of its budget from the United Way organization, App. 194a-195a, a
large proportion to be sure, but not even half of the 24.1% of budget that

There is, in any case, no way to interpret the 96.6% ofcurrent voucher money going to religious schools as reflecting a free and genuine choice by the families that apply forvouchers. The 96.6% reflects, instead, the fact that too few
nonreligious school desks are available and few but religiousschools can afford to accept more than a handful of voucher
students. And contrary to the majority's assertion, ante, at654, public schools in adjacent districts hardly have a financial incentive to participate in the Ohio voucher program,and none has.

17 For the overwhelming number of children

in the voucher scheme, the only alternative to the publicschools is religious. And it is entirely irrelevant that the

State did not deliberately design the network of privateschools for the sake of channeling money into religious institutions. The criterion is one of genuinely free choice on thepart of the private individuals who choose, and a Hobson's
choice is not a choice, whatever the reason for beingHobsonian.

III
I do not dissent merely because the majority has misap-plied its own law, for even if I assumed arguendo that the

well. Ante, at 656-657, n. 4. The majority is dead right about this, and
there is no inconsistency here: any voucher program that satisfied the
majority's requirement of "true private choice" would be even more egregiously unconstitutional than the current scheme due to the substantial
amount of aid to religious teaching that would be required.

17 As the Court points out, ante, at 645-646, n. 1, an out-of-district public

school that participates will receive a $2,250 voucher for each Cleveland student on top of its normal state funding. The basic state funding, though, is
a drop in the bucket as compared to the cost of educating that student, as
much of the cost (at least in relatively affluent areas with presumptively
better academic standards) is paid by local income and property taxes.
See Brief for Ohio School Boards Association et al. as Amici Curiae 19-21.
The only adjacent district in which the voucher amount is close enough to
cover the local contribution is East Cleveland City (local contribution,
$2,019, see Ohio Dept. of Ed., 2002 Community School Report Card, East
Cleveland City School District, p. 2), but its public-school system hardly
provides an attractive alternative for Cleveland parents, as it too has been
classified by Ohio as an "academic emergency" district. See ibid.

majority's formal criteria were satisfied on the facts, today'sconclusion would be profoundly at odds with the Constitution. Proof of this is clear on two levels. The first is cir-cumstantial, in the now discarded symptom of violation, the
substantial dimension of the aid. The second is direct, inthe defiance of every objective supposed to be served by the
bar against establishment. A

The scale of the aid to religious schools approved todayis unprecedented, both in the number of dollars and in the
proportion of systemic school expenditure supported. Eachmeasure has received attention in previous cases. On one
hand, the sheer quantity of aid, when delivered to a class ofreligious primary and secondary schools, was suspect on the
theory that the greater the aid, the greater its proportion toa religious school's existing expenditures, and the greater
the likelihood that public money was supporting religious aswell as secular instruction. As we said in

Meek, "it wouldsimply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role" as theobject of aid that comes in "substantial amounts." 421 U. S.,
at 365. Cf. Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 787-788 (rejecting argu-ment that tuition assistance covered only 15% of education
costs, presumably secular, at religious schools). Conversely,the more "attenuated [the] financial benefit . . . that eventually flows to parochial schools," the more the Court has beenwilling to find a form of state aid permissible.

Mueller, 463U. S., at 400.

18 The majority relies on Mueller, Agostini, and Mitchell to dispute the
relevance of the large number of students that use vouchers to attend
religious schools, ante, at 658, but the reliance is inapt because each of
those cases involved insubstantial benefits to the religious schools, regardless of the number of students that benefited. See, e. g., Mueller, 463
U. S., at 391 ($112 in tax benefit to the highest bracket taxpayer, see Brief
for Respondents Becker et al. in Mueller v. Allen, O. T. 1982, No. 82-195,

supplant' "); Mitchell, 530 U. S., at 866 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) ("de minimis"). See also supra, at 694-695.

On the other hand, the Court has found the gross amountunhelpful for Establishment Clause analysis when the aid afforded a benefit solely to one individual, however substantialas to him, but only an incidental benefit to the religious
school at which the individual chose to spend the State'smoney. See Witters, 474 U. S., at 488; cf. Zobrest, 509 U. S.,
at 12. When neither the design nor the implementation ofan aid scheme channels a series of individual students' subsidies toward religious recipients, the relevant benefici-aries for establishment purposes, the Establishment Clause
is unlikely to be implicated. The majority's reliance on theobservations of five Members of the Court in

Witters as tothe irrelevance of substantiality of aid in that case, see ante,

at 651, is therefore beside the point in the matter beforeus, which involves considerable sums of public funds systematically distributed through thousands of students at-tending religious elementary and middle schools in the city
of Cleveland.19

19 No less irrelevant, and lacking even arguable support in our cases, is
Justice O'Connor's argument that the $8.2 million in tax-raised funds
distributed under the Ohio program to religious schools is permissible
under the Establishment Clause because it "pales in comparison to the
amount of funds that federal, state, and local governments already provide
religious institutions," ante, at 665. Our cases have consistently held that
state benefits at some level can go to religious institutions when the recipients are not pervasively sectarian, see, e. g., Tilton v. Richardson, 403
U. S. 672 (1971) (aid to church-related colleges and universities); Bradfield
v. Roberts, 175 U. S. 291 (1899) (religious hospitals); when the benefit
comes in the form of tax exemption or deduction, see, e. g., Walz v. Tax
Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970) (property-tax exemptions); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983) (tax deductions for educational expenses); or when the aid can plausibly be said to go to individual
university students, see, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for
Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986) (state scholarship programs for higher education, and by extension federal programs such as the G. I. Bill). The fact
that those cases often allow for large amounts of aid says nothing about
direct aid to pervasively sectarian schools for religious teaching. This
"greater justifies the lesser" argument not only ignores the aforementioned cases, it would completely swallow up our aid-to-school cases from
Everson onward: if $8.2 million in vouchers is acceptable, for example,

The Cleveland voucher program has cost Ohio taxpayers
$33 million since its implementation in 1996 ($28 million in
voucher payments, $5 million in administrative costs), and
its cost was expected to exceed $8 million in the 2001-2002
school year. People for the American Way Foundation, Five
Years and Counting: A Closer Look at the Cleveland Voucher
Program 1-2 (Sept. 25, 2001) (hereinafter Cleveland Voucher
Program) (cited in Brief for National School Boards Association et al. as Amici Curiae 9). These tax-raised funds are
on top of the textbooks, reading and math tutors, laboratory
equipment, and the like that Ohio provides to private
schools, worth roughly $600 per child. Cleveland Voucher
Program 2.20

The gross amounts of public money contributed are symptomatic of the scope of what the taxpayers' money buys for
a broad class of religious-school students. In paying for
practically the full amount of tuition for thousands of qualifying students,21 cf. Nyquist, supra, at 781-783 (state
aid amounting to 50% of tuition was unconstitutional), the
scholarships purchase everything that tuition purchases, be
it instruction in math or indoctrination in faith. The consewhy is there any requirement against greater than de minimis diversion
to religious uses? See Mitchell, supra, at 866 (O'Connor, J., concurring
in judgment).

20 The amount of federal aid that may go to religious education after

today's decision is startling: according to one estimate, the cost of a national voucher program would be $73 billion, 25% more than the current
national public-education budget. People for the American Way Foundation, Community Voice or Captive of the Right? 10 (Dec. 2001).

21 Most, if not all, participating students come from families with incomes below 200% of the poverty line (at least 60% are below the poverty
line, App. in Nos. 00-3055, etc. (CA6), p. 1679), and are therefore eligible
for vouchers covering 90% of tuition, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 3313.978(A)
(West Supp. 2002); they may make up the 10% shortfall by "in-kind contributions or services," which the recipient school "shall permit,"

vouchers paying 75% of tuition costs. $ 3313.978(A).

quences of "substantial" aid hypothesized in Meek are real-ized here: the majority makes no pretense that substantial

amounts of tax money are not systematically underwritingreligious practice and indoctrination.

B
It is virtually superfluous to point out that every objectiveunderlying the prohibition of religious establishment is betrayed by this scheme, but something has to be said aboutthe enormity of the violation. I anticipated these objectives
earlier, supra, at 689-690, in discussing Everson, which cata-loged them, the first being respect for freedom of conscience.
Jefferson described it as the idea that no one "shall be com-pelled to . . . support any religious worship, place, or ministry
whatsoever," A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, in5 The Founders' Constitution 84 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner
eds. 1987), even a "teacher of his own religious persuasion,"
ibid., and Madison thought it violated by any " `authoritywhich can force a citizen to contribute three pence . . . of his

property for the support of any . . . establishment.' " Memo-rial and Remonstrance || 3, reprinted in Everson, 330 U. S.,
at 65-66. "Any tax to establish religion is antithetical tothe command that the minds of men always be wholly free,"
Mitchell, 530 U. S., at 871 (Souter, J., dissenting) (internalquotation marks and citations omitted).

22 Madison's objection to three pence has simply been lost in the majority'sformalism.

As for the second objective, to save religion from its owncorruption, Madison wrote of the " `experience . . . that eccle22 As a historical matter, the protection of liberty of conscience may well
have been the central objective served by the Establishment Clause. See

and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation.' "
Memorial and Remonstrance || 7, reprinted in Everson, 330
U. S., at 67. In Madison's time, the manifestations were
"pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility
in the laity[,] in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution,"
ibid.; in the 21st century, the risk is one of "corrosive secularism" to religious schools, Ball, 473 U. S., at 385, and the specific threat is to the primacy of the schools' mission to educate the children of the faithful according to the unaltered
precepts of their faith. Even "[t]he favored religion may be
compromised as political figures reshape the religion's beliefs
for their own purposes; it may be reformed as government
largesse brings government regulation." Lee v. Weisman,
505 U. S. 577, 608 (1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring).

The risk is already being realized. In Ohio, for example,
a condition of receiving government money under the program is that participating religious schools may not "discriminate on the basis of . . . religion," Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 3313.976(A)(4) (West Supp. 2002), which means the school
may not give admission preferences to children who are
members of the patron faith; children of a parish are generally consigned to the same admission lotteries as nonbelievers, $$ 3313.977(A)(1)(c)-(d). This indeed was the
exact object of a 1999 amendment repealing the portion of a
predecessor statute that had allowed an admission preference for "[c]hildren . . . whose parents are affiliated with any
organization that provides financial support to the school,
at the discretion of the school." $ 3313.977(A)(1)(d) (West
1999). Nor is the State's religious antidiscrimination restriction limited to student admission policies: by its terms,
a participating religious school may well be forbidden to
choose a member of its own clergy to serve as teacher or
principal over a layperson of a different religion claiming

equal qualification for the job.23 Cf. National Catholic Educational Association, Balance Sheet for Catholic Elementary
Schools: 2001 Income and Expenses 25 (2001) ("31% of [reporting Catholic elementary and middle] schools had at least
one full-time teacher who was a religious sister"). Indeed,
a separate condition that "[t]he school . . . not . . . teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of . . . religion,"

$ 3313.976(A)(6) (West Supp. 2002), could be understood (or
subsequently broadened) to prohibit religions from teaching
traditionally legitimate articles of faith as to the error, sinfulness, or ignorance of others,24 if they want government
money for their schools.

23 And the courts will, of course, be drawn into disputes about whether
a religious school's employment practices violated the Ohio statute. In
part precisely to avoid this sort of involvement, some Courts of Appeals
have held that religious groups enjoy a First Amendment exemption for
clergy from state and federal laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis
of race or ethnic origin. See, e. g., Rayburn v. General Conference of
Seventh-Day Adventists, 772 F. 2d 1164, 1170 (CA4 1985) ("The application
of Title VII to employment decisions of this nature would result in an
intolerably close relationship between church and state both on a substantive and procedural level"); EEOC v. Catholic Univ. of America, 83 F. 3d
455, 470 (CADC 1996); Young v. Northern Ill. Conference of United
Methodist Church, 21 F. 3d 184, 187 (CA7 1994). This approach would
seem to be blocked in Ohio by the same antidiscrimination provision,
which also covers "race . . . or ethnic background." Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

For perspective on this foot-in-the-door of religious regu-lation, it is well to remember that the money has barely

begun to flow. Prior examples of aid, whether grantsthrough individuals or in-kind assistance, were never significant enough to alter the basic fiscal structure of religiousschools; state aid was welcome, but not indispensable. See,
e. g., Mitchell, 530 U. S., at 802 (federal funds could only sup-plement funds from nonfederal sources);

Agostini, 521 U. S.,at 210 (federally funded services could " `supplement, and in

no case supplant, the level of services' " already provided).But given the figures already involved here, there is no question that religious schools in Ohio are on the way to becom-ing bigger businesses with budgets enhanced to fit their new
stream of tax-raised income. See, e. g., People for the Amer-ican Way Foundation, A Painful Price 5, 9, 11 (Feb. 14, 2002)
(of 91 schools participating in the Milwaukee program, 75received voucher payments in excess of tuition, 61 of those
were religious and averaged $185,000 worth of overpaymentper school, justified in part to "raise low salaries"). The administrators of those same schools are also no doubt follow-ing the politics of a move in the Ohio State Senate to raise
the current maximum value of a school voucher from $2,250to the base amount of current state spending on each public
school student ($4,814 for the 2001 fiscal year). See Bloedel,Bill Analysis of S. B. No. 89, 124th Ohio Gen. Assembly, regular session 2001-2002 (Ohio Legislative Service Commission).Ohio, in fact, is merely replicating the experience in Wisconsin, where a similar increase in the value of educationalvouchers in Milwaukee has induced the creation of some 23

pegged their financial prospects to the government from thestart, and the odds are that increases in government aid will

bring the threshold voucher amount closer to the tuition ateven more expensive religious schools.

When government aid goes up, so does reliance on it; theonly thing likely to go down is independence. If Justice
Douglas in Allen was concerned with state agencies, influenced by powerful religious groups, choosing the text-books that parochial schools would use, 392 U. S., at 265

(dissenting opinion), how much more is there reason to won-der when dependence will become great enough to give the
State of Ohio an effective veto over basic decisions on the
content of curriculums? A day will come when religious
schools will learn what political leverage can do, just as
Ohio's politicians are now getting a lesson in the leverage
exercised by religion.

Increased voucher spending is not, however, the sole portent of growing regulation of religious practice in the school,
for state mandates to moderate religious teaching may well
be the most obvious response to the third concern behind
the ban on establishment, its inextricable link with social
conflict. See Mitchell, supra, at 872 (Souter, J., dissenting); Everson, 330 U. S., at 8-11. As appropriations for religious subsidy rise, competition for the money will tap sectarian religion's capacity for discord. "Public money devoted
to payment of religious costs, educational or other, brings
the quest for more. It brings too the struggle of sect
against sect for the larger share or for any. Here one by
numbers alone will benefit most, there another." Id., at 53.
(Rutledge, J., dissenting).

Justice Breyer has addressed this issue in his own dissenting opinion, which I join, and here it is enough to say
that the intensity of the expectable friction can be gauged
by realizing that the scramble for money will energize not
only contending sectarians, but taxpayers who take their liberty of conscience seriously. Religious teaching at taxpayer

expense simply cannot be cordoned from taxpayer politics,and every major religion currently espouses social positions

that provoke intense opposition. Not all taxpaying Protes-tant citizens, for example, will be content to underwrite the
teaching of the Roman Catholic Church condemning thedeath penalty.

25 Nor will all of America's Muslims acquiesce

in paying for the endorsement of the religious Zionismtaught in many religious Jewish schools, which combines

"a nationalistic sentiment" in support of Israel with a"deeply religious" element.

26 Nor will every secular taxpayer be content to support Muslim views on differentialtreatment of the sexes,

27 or, for that matter, to fund the

espousal of a wife's obligation of obedience to her husband,presumably taught in any schools adopting the articles of

faith of the Southern Baptist Convention.28 Views likethese, and innumerable others, have been safe in the sectarian pulpits and classrooms of this Nation not only becausethe Free Exercise Clause protects them directly, but because
the ban on supporting religious establishment has protectedfree exercise, by keeping it relatively private. With the arrival of vouchers in religious schools, that privacy will go,and along with it will go confidence that religious disagreement will stay moderate.

of the political branches at the state and national levels.Legislatures not driven to desperation by the problems of

public education may be able to see the threat in vouchersnegotiable in sectarian schools. Perhaps even cities with
problems like Cleveland's will perceive the danger, now thatthey know a federal court will not save them from it.

My own course as a judge on the Court cannot, however,simply be to hope that the political branches will save us
from the consequences of the majority's decision. Everson'sstatement is still the touchstone of sound law, even though
the reality is that in the matter of educational aid the Estab-lishment Clause has largely been read away. True, the majority has not approved vouchers for religious schools alone,or aid earmarked for religious instruction. But no scheme
so clumsy will ever get before us, and in the cases that wemay see, like these, the Establishment Clause is largely silenced. I do not have the option to leave it silent, and Ihope that a future Court will reconsider today's dramatic
departure from basic Establishment Clause principle.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Souter join, dissenting.

I join Justice Souter's opinion, and I agree substantiallywith

Justice Stevens. I write separately, however, to em-phasize the risk that publicly financed voucher programs

pose in terms of religiously based social conflict. I do sobecause I believe that the Establishment Clause concern for
protecting the Nation's social fabric from religious conflictposes an overriding obstacle to the implementation of this
well-intentioned school voucher program. And by explain-ing the nature of the concern, I hope to demonstrate why, in
my view, "parental choice" cannot significantly alleviate theconstitutional problem. See Part IV, infra.

religion," and a guarantee, that the government shall notprohibit "the free exercise thereof." These Clauses embody

an understanding, reached in the 17th century after decadesof religious war, that liberty and social stability demand a
religious tolerance that respects the religious views of allcitizens, permits those citizens to "worship God in their own
way," and allows all families to "teach their children and toform their characters" as they wish. C. Radcliffe, The
Law & Its Compass 71 (1960). The Clauses reflect theFramers' vision of an American Nation free of the religious
strife that had long plagued the nations of Europe. See,
e. g., Freund, Public Aid to Parochial Schools, 82 Harv.L. Rev. 1680, 1692 (1969) (religious strife was "one of the

principal evils that the first amendment sought to forestall");B. Kosmin & S. Lachman, One Nation Under God: Religion
in Contemporary American Society 24 (1993) (First Amend-ment designed in "part to prevent the religious wars of Europe from entering the United States"). Whatever theFramers might have thought about particular 18th-century
school funding practices, they undeniably intended an inter-pretation of the Religion Clauses that would implement this
basic First Amendment objective.In part for this reason, the Court's 20th-century Establishment Clause cases--both those limiting the practice of reli-gion in public schools and those limiting the public funding
of private religious education--focused directly upon socialconflict, potentially created when government becomes involved in religious education. In Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S.421 (1962), the Court held that the Establishment Clause forbids prayer in public elementary and secondary schools. Itdid so in part because it recognized the "anguish, hardship
and bitter strife that could come when zealous religiousgroups struggl[e] with one another to obtain the Government's stamp of approval . . . ." Id., at 429. And it added:

Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 794 (1973), the Court struck down astate statute that, much like voucher programs, provided aid

for parents whose children attended religious schools, ex-plaining that the "assistance of the sort here involved carries
grave potential for . . . continuing political strife over aidto religion."

When it decided these 20th-century Establishment Clausecases, the Court did not deny that an earlier American soci536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG

Breyer, J., dissenting
ety might have found a less clear-cut church/state separation
compatible with social tranquility. Indeed, historians point
out that during the early years of the Republic, American
schools--including the first public schools--were Protestant
in character. Their students recited Protestant prayers,
read the King James version of the Bible, and learned Protestant religious ideals. See, e. g., D. Tyack, Onward Christian Soldiers: Religion in the American Common School, in
History and Education 217-226 (P. Nash ed. 1970). Those
practices may have wrongly discriminated against members
of minority religions, but given the small number of such
individuals, the teaching of Protestant religions in schools
did not threaten serious social conflict. See Kosmin & Lachman, supra, at 45 (Catholics constituted less than 2% of
American church-affiliated population at time of founding).

The 20th-century Court was fully aware, however, that immigration and growth had changed American society dramatically since its early years. By 1850, 1.6 million Catholics lived in America, and by 1900 that number rose to 12
million. Jeffries & Ryan, A Political History of the Establishment Clause, 100 Mich. L. Rev. 279, 299-300 (Nov. 2001).
There were similar percentage increases in the Jewish population. Kosmin & Lachman, supra, at 45-46. Not surprisingly, with this increase in numbers, members of nonProtestant religions, particularly Catholics, began to resist
the Protestant domination of the public schools. Scholars
report that by the mid-19th century religious conflict over
matters such as Bible reading "grew intense," as Catholics
resisted and Protestants fought back to preserve their domination. Jeffries & Ryan, supra, at 300. "Dreading Catholic domination," native Protestants "terrorized Catholics."
P. Hamburger, Separation of Church and State 219 (2002).
In some States "Catholic students suffered beatings or expulsions for refusing to read from the Protestant Bible, and
crowds . . . rioted over whether Catholic children could be

Breyer, J., dissenting
released from the classroom during Bible reading." Jeff-ries & Ryan, 100 Mich. L. Rev., at 300.

The 20th-century Court was also aware that political ef-forts to right the wrong of discrimination against religious
minorities in primary education had failed; in fact they hadexacerbated religious conflict. Catholics sought equal government support for the education of their children in the
form of aid for private Catholic schools. But the "Protes-tant position" on this matter, scholars report, "was that

public schools must be `nonsectarian' (which was usually un-derstood to allow Bible reading and other Protestant observances) and public money must not support `sectarian'
schools (which in practical terms meant Catholic)." Id., at
301. And this sentiment played a significant role in creating
a movement that sought to amend several state constitutions
(often successfully), and to amend the United States Constitution (unsuccessfully) to make certain that government
would not help pay for "sectarian" (i. e., Catholic) schooling
for children. Id., at 301-305. See also Hamburger, supra,
at 287.

These historical circumstances suggest that the Court,
applying the Establishment Clause through the Fourteenth
Amendment to 20th-century American society, faced an interpretive dilemma that was in part practical. The Court
appreciated the religious diversity of contemporary American society. See Schempp, supra, at 240 (Brennan, J., concurring). It realized that the status quo favored some religions at the expense of others. And it understood the
Establishment Clause to prohibit (among other things) any
such favoritism. Yet how did the Clause achieve that objective? Did it simply require the government to give each
religion an equal chance to introduce religion into the primary schools--a kind of "equal opportunity" approach to the
interpretation of the Establishment Clause? Or, did that
Clause avoid government favoritism of some religions by
insisting upon "separation"--that the government achieve

Breyer, J., dissenting
equal treatment by removing itself from the business of pro-viding religious education for children? This interpretive

choice arose in respect both to religious activities in publicschools and government aid to private education.

In both areas the Court concluded that the EstablishmentClause required "separation," in part because an "equal opportunity" approach was not workable. With respect to religious activities in the public schools, how could the Clauserequire public primary and secondary school teachers, when

reading prayers or the Bible, only to treat all religions alike?In many places there were too many religions, too diverse a
set of religious practices, too many whose spiritual beliefsdenied the virtue of formal religious training. This diversity made it difficult, if not impossible, to devise meaningfulforms of "equal treatment" by providing an "equal opportunity" for all to introduce their own religious practices intothe public schools.

With respect to government aid to private education, didnot history show that efforts to obtain equivalent funding for
the private education of children whose parents did not hold
popular religious beliefs only exacerbated religious strife?As Justice Rutledge recognized:

"Public money devoted to payment of religious costs, educational or other, brings the quest for more. It brings
too the struggle of sect against sect for the larger shareor for any. Here one [religious sect] by numbers [of

adherents] alone will benefit most, there another. Thisis precisely the history of societies which have had an
established religion and dissident groups." Everson v.
Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 53-54 (1947) (dissenting opinion).

The upshot is the development of constitutional doctrine
that reads the Establishment Clause as avoiding religious
strife, not by providing every religion with an equal opportunity (say, to secure state funding or to pray in the public

schools), but by drawing fairly clear lines of separation be-tween church and state--at least where the heartland of religious belief, such as primary religious education, is at issue.

II
The principle underlying these cases--avoiding religiouslybased social conflict--remains of great concern. As religiously diverse as America had become when the Court de-cided its major 20th-century Establishment Clause cases, we
are exponentially more diverse today. America boasts morethan 55 different religious groups and subgroups with a significant number of members. Graduate Center of the CityUniversity of New York, B. Kosmin, E. Mayer, & A. Keysar,
American Religious Identification Survey 12-13 (2001).Major religions include, among others, Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, and Sikhs. Ibid.And several of these major religions contain different subsidiary sects with different religious beliefs. See Lester, Oh,Gods!, The Atlantic Monthly 37 (Feb. 2002). Newer Christian immigrant groups are "expressing their Christianity inlanguages, customs, and independent churches that are
barely recognizable, and often controversial, for European-ancestry Catholics and Protestants." H. Ebaugh & J.
Chafetz, Religion and the New Immigrants: Continuities andAdaptations in Immigrant Congregations 4 (abridged student ed. 2002).Under these modern-day circumstances, how is the "equal
opportunity" principle to work--without risking the "strug-gle of sect against sect" against which Justice Rutledge
warned? School voucher programs finance the religious ed-ucation of the young. And, if widely adopted, they may well
provide billions of dollars that will do so. Why will differentreligions not become concerned about, and seek to influence,
the criteria used to channel this money to religious schools?Why will they not want to examine the implementation of
the programs that provide this money--to determine, for ex536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG
724 ZELMAN v. SIMMONS-HARRIS

Breyer, J., dissenting
ample, whether implementation has biased a program towardor against particular sects, or whether recipient religious

schools are adequately fulfilling a program's criteria? If so,just how is the State to resolve the resulting controversies
without provoking legitimate fears of the kinds of religiousfavoritism that, in so religiously diverse a Nation, threaten
social dissension?

Consider the voucher program here at issue. That pro-gram insists that the religious school accept students of all

religions. Does that criterion treat fairly groups whose reli-gion forbids them to do so? The program also insists that
no participating school "advocate or foster unlawful behavior
or teach hatred of any person or group on the basis of race,
ethnicity, national origin, or religion." Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 3313.976(A)(6) (West Supp. 2002). And it requires the
State to "revoke the registration of any school if, after a
hearing, the superintendent determines that the school is in
violation" of the program's rules. $ 3313.976(B). As one
amicus argues, "it is difficult to imagine a more divisive activity" than the appointment of state officials as referees to
determine whether a particular religious doctrine "teaches
hatred or advocates lawlessness." Brief for National Committee for Public Education and Religious Liberty as Amicus Curiae 23.

How are state officials to adjudicate claims that one religion or another is advocating, for example, civil disobedience
in response to unjust laws, the use of illegal drugs in a religious ceremony, or resort to force to call attention to what
it views as an immoral social practice? What kind of public
hearing will there be in response to claims that one religion
or another is continuing to teach a view of history that casts
members of other religions in the worst possible light? How
will the public react to government funding for schools that
take controversial religious positions on topics that are of
current popular interest--say, the conflict in the Middle East
or the war on terrorism? Yet any major funding program

725Cite as: 536 U. S. 639 (2002)
Breyer, J., dissenting
for primary religious education will require criteria. And
the selection of those criteria, as well as their application,
inevitably pose problems that are divisive. Efforts to respond to these problems not only will seriously entangle
church and state, see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 622, but also will
promote division among religious groups, as one group or
another fears (often legitimately) that it will receive unfair
treatment at the hands of the government.

I recognize that other nations, for example Great Britain
and France, have in the past reconciled religious school funding and religious freedom without creating serious strife.
Yet British and French societies are religiously more homogeneous--and it bears noting that recent waves of immigration have begun to create problems of social division there
as well. See, e. g., The Muslims of France, 75 Foreign Affairs 78 (1996) (describing increased religious strife in
France, as exemplified by expulsion of teenage girls from
school for wearing traditional Muslim scarves); Ahmed, Extreme Prejudice; Muslims in Britain, The Times of London,
May 2, 1992, p. 10 (describing religious strife in connection
with increased Muslim immigration in Great Britain).

In a society as religiously diverse as ours, the Court has
recognized that we must rely on the Religion Clauses of the
First Amendment to protect against religious strife, particularly when what is at issue is an area as central to religious
belief as the shaping, through primary education, of the next
generation's minds and spirits. See, e. g., Webster, On the
Education of Youth in America (1790), in Essays on Education in the Early Republic 43, 53, 59 (F. Rudolph ed. 1965)
("[E]ducation of youth" is "of more consequence than making
laws and preaching the gospel, because it lays the foundation
on which both law and gospel rest for success"); Pope Paul
VI, Declaration on Christian Education (1965) ("[T]he Catholic school can be such an aid to the fulfillment of the mission
of the People of God and to the fostering of dialogue between

the Church and mankind, to the benefit of both, it retainseven in our present circumstances the utmost importance").

III
I concede that the Establishment Clause currently permitsStates to channel various forms of assistance to religious

schools, for example, transportation costs for students, com-puters, and secular texts. See Everson v. Board of Ed. of
Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947); Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U. S. 793(2000). States now certify the nonsectarian educational content of religious school education. See, e. g., New Life Baptist Church Academy v. East Longmeadow, 885 F. 2d 940(CA1 1989). Yet the consequence has not been great turmoil. But see, e. g., May, Charter School's Religious Tone;Operation of South Bay Academy Raises Church-State Questions, San Francisco Chronicle, Dec. 17, 2001, p. A1 (describ-ing increased government supervision of charter schools
after complaints that students were "studying Islam in classand praying with their teachers," and Muslim educators complaining of " `post-Sept. 11 anti-Muslim sentiment' ").School voucher programs differ, however, in both kind and
degree from aid programs upheld in the past. They differ inkind because they direct financing to a core function of the
church: the teaching of religious truths to young children.For that reason the constitutional demand for "separation"
is of particular constitutional concern. See, e. g., Weisman,505 U. S., at 592 ("heightened concerns" in context of primary education); Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578, 583-584 (1987) ("Court has been particularly vigilant in monitoring compliance with the Establishment Clause in elementaryand secondary schools").

Private schools that participate in Ohio's program, for ex-ample, recognize the importance of primary religious education, for they pronounce that their goals are to "communicatethe gospel," "provide opportunities to . . . experience a faith
community," "provide . . . for growth in prayer," and "pro536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG

727Cite as: 536 U. S. 639 (2002)
Breyer, J., dissenting
vide instruction in religious truths and values." App. 408a,
487a. History suggests, not that such private school teaching of religion is undesirable, but that government funding
of this kind of religious endeavor is far more contentious
than providing funding for secular textbooks, computers, vocational training, or even funding for adults who wish to obtain a college education at a religious university. See supra,
at 720-722. Contrary to Justice O'Connor's opinion, ante,
at 665-666 (concurring opinion), history also shows that government involvement in religious primary education is far
more divisive than state property tax exemptions for religious institutions or tax deductions for charitable contributions, both of which come far closer to exemplifying the
neutrality that distinguishes, for example, fire protection
on the one hand from direct monetary assistance on the
other. Federal aid to religiously based hospitals, ante, at
666 (O'Connor, J., concurring), is even further removed from
education, which lies at the heartland of religious belief.

Vouchers also differ in degree. The aid programs recently
upheld by the Court involved limited amounts of aid to religion. But the majority's analysis here appears to permit a
considerable shift of taxpayer dollars from public secular
schools to private religious schools. That fact, combined
with the use to which these dollars will be put, exacerbates
the conflict problem. State aid that takes the form of peripheral secular items, with prohibitions against diversion of
funds to religious teaching, holds significantly less potential
for social division. In this respect as well, the secular aid
upheld in Mitchell differs dramatically from the present case.
Although it was conceivable that minor amounts of money
could have, contrary to the statute, found their way to the
religious activities of the recipients, see 530 U. S., at 864
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), that case is at worst
the camel's nose, while the litigation before us is the camel
itself.

IV
I do not believe that the "parental choice" aspect of thevoucher program sufficiently offsets the concerns I have

mentioned. Parental choice cannot help the taxpayer whodoes not want to finance the religious education of children.
It will not always help the parent who may see little realchoice between inadequate nonsectarian public education and
adequate education at a school whose religious teachings arecontrary to his own. It will not satisfy religious minorities
unable to participate because they are too few in number tosupport the creation of their own private schools. It will
not satisfy groups whose religious beliefs preclude themfrom participating in a government-sponsored program, and
who may well feel ignored as government funds primarilysupport the education of children in the doctrines of the dominant religions. And it does little to ameliorate the entan-glement problems or the related problems of social division
that Part II, supra, describes. Consequently, the fact thatthe parent may choose which school can cash the government's voucher check does not alleviate the EstablishmentClause concerns associated with voucher programs.

V
The Court, in effect, turns the clock back. It adopts,under the name of "neutrality," an interpretation of the Establishment Clause that this Court rejected more than halfa century ago. In its view, the parental choice that offers
each religious group a kind of equal opportunity to securegovernment funding overcomes the Establishment Clause
concern for social concord. An earlier Court found that"equal opportunity" principle insufficient; it read the Clause
as insisting upon greater separation of church and state, atleast in respect to primary education. See

Nyquist, 413U. S., at 783. In a society composed of many different religious creeds, I fear that this present departure from theCourt's earlier understanding risks creating a form of reli536US2 Unit: $U80 [01-14-04 18:46:03] PAGES PGT: OPLG

HOPE v. PELZER et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 01-309. Argued April 17, 2002--Decided June 27, 2002
In 1995, petitioner Hope, then an Alabama prison inmate, was twice handcuffed to a hitching post for disruptive conduct. During a 2-hour period
in May, he was offered drinking water and a bathroom break every 15
minutes, and his responses were recorded on an activity log. He was
handcuffed above shoulder height, and when he tried moving his arms
to improve circulation, the handcuffs cut into his wrists, causing pain
and discomfort. After an altercation with a guard at his chain gang's
worksite in June, Hope was subdued, handcuffed, placed in leg irons,
and transported back to the prison, where he was ordered to take off
his shirt, thus exposing himself to the sun, and spent seven hours on
the hitching post. While there, he was given one or two water breaks
but no bathroom breaks, and a guard taunted him about his thirst.
Hope filed a 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suit against three guards. Without deciding whether placing Hope on the hitching post as punishment violated
the Eighth Amendment, the Magistrate Judge found that the guards
were entitled to qualified immunity. The District Court entered summary judgment for respondents, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.
The latter court answered the constitutional question, finding that the
hitching post's use for punitive purposes violated the Eighth Amendment. In finding the guards nevertheless entitled to qualified immunity, it concluded that Hope could not show, as required by Circuit precedent, that the federal law by which the guards' conduct should be
evaluated was established by cases that were "materially similar" to the
facts in his own case.

Held: The defense of qualified immunity was precluded at the summary

judgment phase. Pp. 736-748.

(a) Hope's allegations, if true, establish an Eighth Amendment violation. Among the " `unnecessary and wanton' inflictions of pain [constituting cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the Amendment] are
those that are `totally without penological justification.' " Rhodes v.
Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 346. This determination is made in the context of prison conditions by ascertaining whether an official acted with
"deliberate indifference" to the inmates' health or safety, Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8, a state of mind that can be inferred from the
fact that the risk of harm is obvious, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825.

Syllabus
The Eighth Amendment violation here is obvious on the facts alleged.
Any safety concerns had long since abated by the time Hope was handcuffed to the hitching post, because he had already been subdued, handcuffed, placed in leg irons, and transported back to prison. He was
separated from his work squad and not given the opportunity to return.
Despite the clear lack of emergency, respondents knowingly subjected
him to a substantial risk of physical harm, unnecessary pain, unnecessary exposure to the sun, prolonged thirst and taunting, and a deprivation of bathroom breaks that created a risk of particular discomfort and
humiliation. Pp. 736-738.

(b) Respondents may nevertheless be shielded from liability for their
constitutionally impermissible conduct if their actions did not violate
"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800,
818. In its assessment, the Eleventh Circuit erred in requiring that the
facts of previous cases and Hope's case be "materially similar." Qualified immunity operates to ensure that before they are subjected to suit,
officers are on notice that their conduct is unlawful. Officers sued in a

$ 1983 civil action have the same fair notice right as do defendants
charged under 18 U. S. C. $ 242, which makes it a crime for a state official
to act willfully and under color of law to deprive a person of constitutional rights. This Court's opinion in United States v. Lanier, 520 U. S.
259, a $ 242 case, makes clear that officials can be on notice that their
conduct violates established law even in novel factual situations. Indeed, the Court expressly rejected a requirement that previous cases
be "fundamentally similar." Accordingly, the salient question that the
Eleventh Circuit should have asked is whether the state of the law in
1995 gave respondents fair warning that Hope's alleged treatment was
unconstitutional. Pp. 739-741.

(c) A reasonable officer would have known that using a hitching post
as Hope alleged was unlawful. The obvious cruelty inherent in the
practice should have provided respondents with some notice that their
conduct was unconstitutional. In addition, binding Circuit precedent
should have given them notice. Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291, found
several forms of corporal punishment impermissible, including handcuffing inmates to fences or cells for long periods, and Ort v. White, 813
F. 2d 318, 324, warned that "physical abuse directed at [a] prisoner after
he terminate[s] his resistance to authority would constitute an actionable eighth amendment violation." Relevant to the question whether
Ort provided fair notice is a subsequent Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) regulation specifying procedures for using a hitching post,
which included allowing an inmate to rejoin his squad when he tells an
officer that he is ready to work. If regularly observed, that provision

would have made Hope's case less like the kind of punishment Ort described as impermissible. But conduct showing that the provision was
a sham, or that respondents could ignore it with impunity, provides
equally strong support for the conclusion that they were fully aware of
their wrongful conduct. The conclusion here is also buttressed by the
fact that the Justice Department specifically advised the ADOC of the
constitutional infirmity of its practices before the incidents in this case
took place. Pp. 741-746.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit concludedthat petitioner Larry Hope, a former prison inmate at the

Limestone Prison in Alabama, was subjected to cruel andunusual punishment when prison guards twice handcuffed
him to a hitching post to sanction him for disruptive conduct.Because that conclusion was not supported by earlier cases
with "materially similar" facts, the court held that the re-spondents were entitled to qualified immunity, and therefore
affirmed summary judgment in their favor. We granted cer-tiorari to determine whether the Court of Appeals' qualified
immunity holding comports with our decision in UnitedStates v. Lanier, 520 U. S. 259 (1997).

In 1995, Alabama was the only State that followed thepractice of chaining inmates to one another in work squads.

F. 3d 975, 977 (CA11 2001) (case below). We do the same. Saucier v.

post on two occasions. On May 11, 1995, while Hope was
working in a chain gang near an interstate highway, he got
into an argument with another inmate. Both men were
taken back to the Limestone prison and handcuffed to a
hitching post. Hope was released two hours later, after the
guard captain determined that the altercation had been
caused by the other inmate. During his two hours on the
post, Hope was offered drinking water and a bathroom break
every 15 minutes, and his responses to these offers were recorded on an activity log. Because he was only slightly
taller than the hitching post, his arms were above shoulder
height and grew tired from being handcuffed so high.
Whenever he tried moving his arms to improve his circulation, the handcuffs cut into his wrists, causing pain and
discomfort.

On June 7, 1995, Hope was punished more severely. He
took a nap during the morning bus ride to the chain gang's
worksite, and when it arrived he was less than prompt in
responding to an order to get off the bus. An exchange of
vulgar remarks led to a wrestling match with a guard. Four
other guards intervened, subdued Hope, handcuffed him,
placed him in leg irons and transported him back to the
prison where he was put on the hitching post. The guards
made him take off his shirt, and he remained shirtless all

findings are part of the record in this case. See, e. g., Plaintiff's Preliminary Response to Defendants' Special Report, Record 30; Defendants' Response to Court Order, App. 61. Accordingly, for purposes of our review
of the grant of summary judgment, the Austin findings may also be assumed true, and we reference them when appropriate.

As Austin explained, the hitching post is a horizontal bar " `made of

hour period, he was given water only once or twice and wasgiven no bathroom breaks.

3 At one point, a guard taunted

Hope about his thirst. According to Hope's affidavit: "[The
guard] first gave water to some dogs, then brought the water
cooler closer to me, removed its lid, and kicked the cooler
over, spilling the water onto the ground." App. 11.

Hope filed suit under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,
in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Alabama against three guards involved in the May incident, one of whom also handcuffed him to the hitching post
in June. The case was referred to a Magistrate Judge who
treated the responsive affidavits filed by the defendants as a
motion for summary judgment. Without deciding whether
"the very act of placing him on a restraining bar for a period
of hours as a form of punishment" had violated the Eighth
Amendment, the Magistrate concluded that the guards were
entitled to qualified immunity.4 Supplemental App. to Pet.

strain it produced on inmates' muscles by forcing them to remain in a
standing position with their arms raised in a stationary position for a long
period of time. In addition to their exposure to sunburn, dehydration,
and muscle aches, the inmates are also placed in substantial pain when the
sun heats the handcuffs that shackle them to the hitching post, or heats
the hitching post itself. Several of the inmates described the way in
which the handcuffs burned and chafed their skin during their placement
on the post." Id., at 1248.

activity log for this incident, despite the policy that required that such a
log be maintained. 240 F. 3d, at 977, n. 1.

Opinion of the Court
qualified immunity issue, however, it answered the constitu-tional question that the District Court had bypassed. The

court found that the use of the hitching post for punitivepurposes violated the Eighth Amendment. Nevertheless,
applying Circuit precedent concerning qualified immunity,the court stated that " `the federal law by which the government official's conduct should be evaluated must be pre-existing, obvious and mandatory,' " and established, not by
" `abstractions,' " but by cases that are " `materially similar' "to the facts in the case in front of us."

Id., at 981. Thecourt then concluded that the facts in the two precedents on

which Hope primarily relied--Ort v. White, 813 F. 2d 318(CA11 1987), and Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291 (CA5
1974)--"[t]hough analogous," were not " `materially similar'to Hope's situation.' " 240 F. 3d, at 981. We granted certiorari to review the Eleventh Circuit's qualified immunityholding. 534 U. S. 1073 (2002).

The threshold inquiry a court must undertake in a quali-fied immunity analysis is whether plaintiff 's allegations, if

true, establish a constitutional violation. Saucier v. Katz,533 U. S. 194, 201 (2001). The Court of Appeals held that
"the policy and practice of cuffing an inmate to a hitchingpost or similar stationary object for a period of time that
surpasses that necessary to quell a threat or restore order isa violation of the Eighth Amendment." 240 F. 3d, at 980-
981. The court rejected respondents' submission that Hopecould have ended his shackling by offering to return to work,
finding instead that the purpose of the practice was puni-tive,

5 and that the circumstances of his confinement created

5 In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals stated: "While the
DOC claims that Hope would have been released from the hitching post
had he asked to return to work, the evidence suggests this is not the case.
First, Hope never refused to work. During the May incident, he was the
victim in an altercation on the work site, but he never refused to do his

Opinion of the Court
a substantial risk of harm of which the officers were aware.Moreover, the court relied on Circuit precedent condemning

similar practices6 and the results of a United States Depart-ment of Justice (DOJ) report that found Alabama's systematic use of the hitching post to be improper corporal pun-ishment.

7 We agree with the Court of Appeals that the

attachment of Hope to the hitching post under the circum-stances alleged in this case violated the Eighth Amendment.

" `[T]he unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain . . . con-stitutes cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the
Eighth Amendment.' " Whitley v. Albers, 475 U. S. 312, 319(1986) (some internal quotation marks omitted). We have
said that "[a]mong `unnecessary and wanton' inflictions ofpain are those that are `totally without penological justification.' " Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U. S. 337, 346 (1981). Inmaking this determination in the context of prison condijob. During the June incident, Hope was involved in an altercation with
prison guards. There is nothing in the record, however, claiming that he
refused to work or encouraged other inmates to refuse to work. Therefore, it is not clear that the solution to his hitching post problem was to
ask to return to work. Second, Hope was placed in a car and driven back
to Limestone to be cuffed to the hitching post on both occasions. Given
the facts, it is improbable that had Hope said, `I want to go back to work,'
a prison guard would have left his post at Limestone to drive Hope back
to the work site. It is more likely that the guards left Hope on the post
until his work detail returned to teach the other inmates a lesson." 240
F. 3d, at 980.

6 "Since abolishing the pillory over a century ago, our system of justice

has consistently moved away from forms of punishment similar to hitching
posts in prisons. In Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974), in
regard to `handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods of
time' and other such punishments, we stated that `[w]e have no difficulty
in reaching the conclusion that these forms of corporal punishment run
afoul of the Eighth Amendment, offend contemporary concepts of decency,
human dignity, and precepts of civilization which we profess to possess.'
Gates, 501 F. 2d at 1306." Id., at 979.

7 The DOJ report apparently was not before the District Court in this

case, but the Court of Appeals took judicial notice of the report and referenced it throughout the decision below. Id., at 979, n. 8.

Opinion of the Court
tions, we must ascertain whether the officials involved acted
with "deliberate indifference" to the inmates' health or
safety. Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U. S. 1, 8 (1992). We
may infer the existence of this subjective state of mind from
the fact that the risk of harm is obvious. Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 842 (1994).

As the facts are alleged by Hope, the Eighth Amendment
violation is obvious. Any safety concerns had long since
abated by the time petitioner was handcuffed to the hitching
post because Hope had already been subdued, handcuffed,
placed in leg irons, and transported back to the prison. He
was separated from his work squad and not given the opportunity to return to work. Despite the clear lack of an emergency situation, the respondents knowingly subjected him to
a substantial risk of physical harm, to unnecessary pain
caused by the handcuffs and the restricted position of confinement for a 7-hour period, to unnecessary exposure to the
heat of the sun, to prolonged thirst and taunting, and to a
deprivation of bathroom breaks that created a risk of particular discomfort and humiliation.8 The use of the hitching
post under these circumstances violated the "basic concept
underlying the Eighth Amendment[, which] is nothing less
than the dignity of man." Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100
(1958). This punitive treatment amounts to gratuitous infliction of "wanton and unnecessary" pain that our precedent
clearly prohibits.

8 The awareness of the risk of harm attributable to any individual respondent may be evaluated in part by considering the pattern of treatment
that inmates generally received when attached to the hitching post. In
Austin v. Hopper, the District Court cited examples of humiliating incidents resulting from the denial of bathroom breaks. One inmate "was not
permitted to use the restroom or to change his clothing for four and onehalf hours after he had defecated on himself." 15 F. Supp. 2d, at 1246.
"Moreover, certain corrections officers not only ignored or denied inmates'
requests for water or access to toilet facilities, but taunted them while
they were clearly suffering from dehydration . . . ." Id., at 1247.

Despite their participation in this constitutionally imper-missible conduct, respondents may nevertheless be shielded

from liability for civil damages if their actions did not violate"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of
which a reasonable person would have known." Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982). In assessing whetherthe Eighth Amendment violation here met the Harlow test,

the Court of Appeals required that the facts of previouscases be " `materially similar' to Hope's situation." 240
F. 3d, at 981. This rigid gloss on the qualified immunitystandard, though supported by Circuit precedent,

9 is not consistent with our cases.As we have explained, qualified immunity operates "to ensure that before they are subjected to suit, officers are onnotice their conduct is unlawful."

Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S.,at 206. For a constitutional right to be clearly established,

its contours "must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable of-ficial would understand that what he is doing violates that
right. This is not to say that an official action is protectedby qualified immunity unless the very action in question has
previously been held unlawful, see Mitchell [v. Forsyth, 472U. S. 511,] 535, n. 12; but it is to say that in the light of
pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent." Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987).Officers sued in a civil action for damages under 42 U. S. C.

Section 242 makes it a crime for a state official to act "will-fully" and under color of law to deprive a person of rights
protected by the Constitution. In United States v. Lanier,520 U. S. 259 (1997), we held that the defendant was entitled

Opinion of the Court
to "fair warning" that his conduct deprived his victim of aconstitutional right, and that the standard for determining

the adequacy of that warning was the same as the standardfor determining whether a constitutional right was "clearly
established" in civil litigation under $ 1983.10In

Lanier, the Court of Appeals had held that the indictment did not charge an offense under $ 242 because the constitutional right allegedly violated had not been identified inany earlier case involving a factual situation " `fundamentally

similar' " to the one in issue. Id., at 263 (citing United
States v. Lanier, 73 F. 3d 1380, 1393 (CA6 1996)). The Court
of Appeals had assumed that the defendant in a criminal case
was entitled to a degree of notice " `substantially higher than
the "clearly established" standard used to judge qualified immunity' " in civil cases under $ 1983. 520 U. S., at 263. We
reversed, explaining that the "fair warning" requirement is
identical under $ 242 and the qualified immunity standard.
We pointed out that we had "upheld convictions under $ 241
or $ 242 despite notable factual distinctions between the
precedents relied on and the cases then before the Court, so
long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the
conduct then at issue violated constitutional rights." Id., at
269. We explained:

"This is not to say, of course, that the single warning
standard points to a single level of specificity sufficient
in every instance. In some circumstances, as when an

10 "[T]he object of the `clearly established' immunity standard is not different from that of `fair warning' as it relates to law `made specific' for
the purpose of validly applying $ 242. The fact that one has a civil and
the other a criminal law role is of no significance; both serve the same
objective, and in effect the qualified immunity test is simply the adaptation
of the fair warning standard to give officials (and, ultimately, governments) the same protection from civil liability and its consequences that
individuals have traditionally possessed in the face of vague criminal statutes. To require something clearer than `clearly established' would, then,
call for something beyond `fair warning.' " 520 U. S., at 270-271.

Opinion of the Court
earlier case expressly leaves open whether a generalrule applies to the particular type of conduct at issue, a

very high degree of prior factual particularity may benecessary. But general statements of the law are not
inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,and in other instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional law may apply with
obvious clarity to the specific conduct in question, eventhough `the very action in question has [not] previously

been held unlawful,' Anderson, supra, at 640." Id., at270-271 (citation omitted).

Our opinion in Lanier thus makes clear that officials can
still be on notice that their conduct violates established laweven in novel factual circumstances. Indeed, in

Lanier, we
expressly rejected a requirement that previous cases be
"fundamentally similar." Although earlier cases involving"fundamentally similar" facts can provide especially strong

support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established,they are not necessary to such a finding. The same is true
of cases with "materially similar" facts. Accordingly, pursu-ant to

Lanier, the salient question that the Court of Appeals
ought to have asked is whether the state of the law in 1995gave respondents fair warning that their alleged treatment

of Hope was unconstitutional. It is to this question that wenow turn.

IV
The use of the hitching post as alleged by Hope "unnecessar[ily] and wanton[ly] inflicted pain," Whitley, 475 U. S., at319 (internal quotation marks omitted), and thus was a clear

violation of the Eighth Amendment. See Part II, supra.
Arguably, the violation was so obvious that our own Eighth
Amendment cases gave respondents fair warning that their
conduct violated the Constitution. Regardless, in light of

binding Eleventh Circuit precedent, an Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) regulation, and a DOJ report

Opinion of the Court
informing the ADOC of the constitutional infirmity in its useof the hitching post, we readily conclude that the respondents' conduct violated "clearly established statutory or con-stitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have
known." Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818.Cases decided by the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit before 1981 are binding precedent in the Eleventh Circuit today. See Bonner v. Prichard, 661 F. 2d 1206 (CA111981). In one of those cases, decided in 1974, the Court of

Appeals reviewed a District Court decision finding a numberof constitutional violations in the administration of Mississippi's prisons. Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291. That opinion
squarely held that several of those "forms of corporal punishment run afoul of the Eighth Amendment [and] offend contemporary concepts of decency, human dignity, and precepts
of civilization which we profess to possess." Id., at 1306.
Among those forms of punishment were "handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods of time, . . .
and forcing inmates to stand, sit or lie on crates, stumps, or
otherwise maintain awkward positions for prolonged periods." Ibid. The fact that Gates found several forms of
punishment impermissible does not, as respondents suggest,
lessen the force of its holding with respect to handcuffing
inmates to cells or fences for long periods of time. Nor, for
the purpose of providing fair notice to reasonable officers
administering punishment for past misconduct, is there any
reason to draw a constitutional distinction between a practice of handcuffing an inmate to a fence for prolonged periods
and handcuffing him to a hitching post for seven hours. The
Court of Appeals' conclusion to the contrary exposes the danger of a rigid, overreliance on factual similarity. As the
Government submits in its brief amicus curiae: "No reasonable officer could have concluded that the constitutional holding of Gates turned on the fact that inmates were handcuffed
to fences or the bars of cells, rather than a specially designed
metal bar designated for shackling. If anything, the use of

Opinion of the Court
a designated hitching post highlights the constitutional prob-lem." Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 22. In
light of Gates, the unlawfulness of the alleged conduct shouldhave been apparent to respondents.

The reasoning, though not the holding, in a case decidedby the Eleventh Circuit in 1987 sent the same message to
reasonable officers in that Circuit. In Ort v. White, 813 F. 2d
318, the Court of Appeals held that an officer's temporarydenials of drinking water to an inmate who repeatedly refused to do his share of the work assigned to a farm squad"should not be viewed as punishment in the strict sense, but
instead as necessary coercive measures undertaken to obtain
compliance with a reasonable prison rule, i. e., the requirement that all inmates perform their assigned farm squad duties." Id., at 325. "The officer's clear motive was to encourage Ort to comply with the rules and to do the work
required of him, after which he would receive the water like
everyone else." Ibid. The court cautioned, however, that
a constitutional violation might have been present "if later,
once back at the prison, officials had decided to deny [Ort]
water as punishment for his refusal to work." Id., at 326.
So too would a violation have occurred if the method of coercion reached a point of severity such that the recalcitrant
prisoner's health was at risk. Ibid. Although the facts of
the case are not identical, Ort's premise is that "physical
abuse directed at [a] prisoner after he terminate[s] his resistance to authority would constitute an actionable eighth
amendment violation." Id., at 324. This premise has clear
applicability in this case. Hope was not restrained at the
worksite until he was willing to return to work. Rather, he
was removed back to the prison and placed under conditions
that threatened his health. Ort therefore gave fair warning
to respondents that their conduct crossed the line of what is
constitutionally permissible.

Relevant to the question whether Ort provided fair warning to respondents that their conduct violated the Constitu536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN
744 HOPE v. PELZER

Opinion of the Court
tion is a regulation promulgated by ADOC in 1993.11 Theregulation authorizes the use of the hitching post when an

inmate refuses to work or is otherwise disruptive to a worksquad. It provides that an activity log should be completed
for each such inmate, detailing his responses to offers ofwater and bathroom breaks every 15 minutes. Such a log
was completed and maintained for petitioner's shackling inMay, but the record contains no such log for the 7-hour
shackling in June and the record indicates that the periodicoffers contemplated by the regulation were not made. App.
43-48. The regulation also states that an inmate "will beallowed to join his assigned squad" whenever he tells an officer "that he is ready to go to work." Id., at 103. Thefindings in

Austin v. Hopper, 15 F. Supp. 2d 1210, 1244-1246(MD Ala. 1998), as well as the record in this case, indicate

that this important provision of the regulation was fre-quently ignored by corrections officers. If regularly observed, a requirement that would effectively give the inmatethe keys to the handcuffs that attached him to the hitching
post would have made this case more analogous to the prac-tice upheld in

Ort, rather than the kind of punishment Ortdescribed as impermissible. A course of conduct that tends

to prove that the requirement was merely a sham, or thatrespondents could ignore it with impunity, provides equally
strong support for the conclusion that they were fully awareof the wrongful character of their conduct.

Respondents violated clearly established law. Our con-clusion that "a reasonable person would have known," Harlow, 457 U. S., at 818, of the violation is buttressed by thefact that the DOJ specifically advised the ADOC of the unconstitutionality of its practices before the incidents in thiscase took place. The DOJ had conducted a study in 1994
of Alabama's use of the hitching post. 240 F. 3d, at 979.

11 The regulation was not provided to the District Court, but it was
added to the record at the request of the Court of Appeals. See App.
100-106.

Opinion of the Court
Among other findings, the DOJ report noted that ADOC'sofficers consistently failed to comply with the policy of

immediately releasing any inmate from the hitching postwho agrees to return to work. The DOJ concluded that
the systematic use of the restraining bar in Alabama consti-tuted improper corporal punishment.

Ibid. Accordingly,
the DOJ advised the ADOC to cease use of the hitching post
in order to meet constitutional standards. The ADOC re-plied that it thought the post could permissibly be used

" `to preserve prison security and discipline.' " Ibid. In re-sponse, the DOJ informed the ADOC that, " `[a]lthough an
emergency situation may warrant drastic action by corrections staff, our experts found that the "rail" is being used
systematically as an improper punishment for relatively trivial offenses. Therefore, we have concluded that the use
of the "rail" is without penological justification.' " Ibid.
Although there is nothing in the record indicating that the
DOJ's views were communicated to respondents, this exchange lends support to the view that reasonable officials
in the ADOC should have realized that the use of the hitching post under the circumstances alleged by Hope violated
the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

The obvious cruelty inherent in this practice should have
provided respondents with some notice that their alleged
conduct violated Hope's constitutional protection against
cruel and unusual punishment. Hope was treated in a way
antithetical to human dignity--he was hitched to a post for
an extended period of time in a position that was painful,
and under circumstances that were both degrading and dangerous. This wanton treatment was not done of necessity,
but as punishment for prior conduct. Even if there might
once have been a question regarding the constitutionality of
this practice, the Eleventh Circuit precedent of Gates and
Ort, as well as the DOJ report condemning the practice, put
a reasonable officer on notice that the use of the hitching

746 HOPE v. PELZER

Opinion of the Court
post under the circumstances alleged by Hope was unlawful.The "fair and clear warning," Lanier, 520 U. S., at 271, that

these cases provided was sufficient to preclude the defenseof qualified immunity at the summary judgment stage.

V
In response to Justice Thomas' thoughtful dissent, wemake the following three observations. The first is that in

granting certiorari to review the summary judgment enteredin favor of the officers, we did not take any question about
the sufficiency of pleadings and affidavits to raise a genuinepossibility that the three named officers were responsible for
the punitive acts of shackling alleged. All questions raisedby petitioner (the plaintiff against whom summary judgment
was entered) go to the application of the standard that noimmunity is available for official acts when "it would be clear
to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in thesituation he confronted."

Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S., at 202.The officers' brief in opposition to certiorari likewise addressed only the legal standard of what is clearly established.The resulting focus in the case was the Eleventh Circuit's
position that a violation is not clearly established unless it isthe subject of a prior case of liability on facts " `materially
similar' " to those charged. 240 F. 3d, at 981. We did nottake, and do not pass upon, the questions whether or to what
extent the three named officers may be held responsible forthe acts charged, if proved. Nothing in our decision forecloses any defense other than qualified immunity on theground relied upon by the Court of Appeals.

Second, we may address the immunity question on the as-sumption that the act of field discipline charged on each occasion was handcuffing Hope to a hitching post for an extendedperiod apparently to inflict gratuitous pain or discomfort,
with no justification in threatened harm or a continuingrefusal to work.

Id., at 980 (on neither occasion did Hope"refus[e] to work or encourag[e] other inmates to refuse to

536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
work"). The Court of Appeals clearly held the act of cuffing
petitioner to the hitching post itself to suffice as an unconstitutional act: "We find that cuffing an inmate to a hitching
post for a period of time extending past that required to
address an immediate danger or threat is a violation of the
Eighth Amendment." Ibid. Although the court continued
that "[t]his violation is exacerbated by the lack of proper
clothing, water, or bathroom breaks," ibid., this embellishment was not the basis of its decision, and our own decision
adequately rests on the same assumption that sufficed for
the Court of Appeals.

Third, in applying the objective immunity test of what a
reasonable officer would understand, the significance of federal judicial precedent is a function in part of the Judiciary's
structure. The unreported District Court opinions cited by
the officers are distinguishable on their own terms.12 But
regardless, they would be no match for the Circuit precedents13 in Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d, at 1306, which held that
"handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods of time" was unconstitutional, and Ort v. White, 813
F. 2d, at 326, which suggested that it would be unconstitutional to inflict gratuitous pain on an inmate (by refusing
him water) when punishment was unnecessary to enforce

12 In three of the decisions, the inmates were given the choice between
working or being restrained. See Whitson v. Gillikin, No. CV-93-H-
1517-NE (ND Ala., Jan. 24, 1994), p. 4, App. 84; Dale v. Murphy,
No. CV-85-1091-H-S (SD Ala., Feb. 4, 1986), p. 2; Ashby v. Dees,
No. CV-94-U-0605-NE (ND Ala., Dec. 27, 1994), p. 6. In others, the
inmates were offered regular water and bathroom breaks. See Lane v.
Findley, No. CV-93-C-1741-S (ND Ala., Aug. 4, 1994), p. 9; Williamson
v. Anderson, No. CV-92-H-675-N (MD Ala., Aug. 18, 1993), p. 2; Hollis
v. Folsom, No. CV-94-T-0052-N (MD Ala., Nov. 4, 1994), p. 9. Finally,
in Vinson v. Thompson, No. CV-94-A-268-N (MD Ala., Dec. 9, 1994), the
inmate was restrained for approximately 45 minutes. Id., at 2.

13 There are apparently no decisions on similar facts from other Circuits,

presumably because Alabama is the only State to authorize the use of the
hitching post in its prison system.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and
Justice Scalia join, dissenting.

The Court today subjects three prison guards to suit basedon facts not alleged, law not clearly established, and its own

subjective views on appropriate methods of prison discipline.Qualified immunity jurisprudence has been turned on its
head. I

Petitioner Larry Hope did not file this action against theState of Alabama. Nor did he sue all of the Alabama prison
guards responsible for looking after him in the two instancesthat he was handcuffed to the restraining bar.

1 He chose

instead to maintain this lawsuit against only three prisonguards: Officer Gene McClaran, Sergeant Mark Pelzer, and

Lieutenant Jim Gates. See 240 F. 3d 975, 977, n. 2 (CA112001).

2 It is therefore strange that in the course of deciding

that none of the three respondents is entitled to qualified

Ala. Dept. of Corrections Admin. Reg. No. 429, p. 1 (Oct. 26, 1993), reprinted in App. 102.

2 While petitioner also sued five other guards in connection with the

fight that occurred before he was affixed to the restraining bar on June
7, 1995, he later withdrew his claims against them and asked that they
be dismissed from the case. See 240 F. 3d, at 977, n. 2; Plaintiff's Special
Report and Brief in Response to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ND Ala.), pp. 1-2, 5-6, Record, Doc. No. 33.

immunity the Court does not even bother to mention the
nature of petitioner's specific allegations against McClaran,
Pelzer, and Gates. The omission is both glaring and telling.
When one examines the alleged conduct of the prison guards
who are parties to this action, as opposed to the alleged conduct of other guards, who are not parties to this action, petitioner's case becomes far less compelling.

The Court's imprecise account of the facts requires that
the specific nature of petitioner's allegations against the
three respondents be recounted. Petitioner claims that:
(1) on May 11, 1995, Officer McClaran ordered that petitioner
be affixed to the restraining bar; 3 (2) Sergeant Pelzer, on
that same date, affixed him to the restraining bar; 4 and
(3) Lieutenant Gates, on May 11 and June 7, 1995, affixed
petitioner to the bar.5 That is the sum and substance of
petitioner's allegations against respondents.6

With respect to McClaran and Pelzer, petitioner has never
alleged that they participated in the June 7 incident that so

6 There is some confusion as to who actually affixed petitioner to the

restraining bar on May 11. While petitioner "believe[s]" that Sergeant
Pelzer did so, id., at 3, the "Institutional Incident Report" produced by
respondents and written by Officer McClaran indicates that Officers Keith
Gates and Mark Dempsey placed petitioner on the bar, see id., Exh. 2.
Petitioner acknowledged that fact and attached the report to his second
affidavit. See id., at 3. Consequently, interpreting petitioner's pleadings
in the light most favorable to him, I will assume that petitioner has alleged
that Pelzer, Gates, and Dempsey cuffed him to the bar on May 11. Additionally, I will assume that the "Officer Keith Gates" mentioned in Officer
McClaran's report is the same person as the Lieutenant Jim Gates who is
a respondent in this case. It is worth noting, however, that respondents
vigorously dispute petitioner's assertion that Lieutenant Jim Gates and
Officer Keith Gates are one and the same, see Brief for Respondents i,
and petitioner has yet to produce any evidence to support this somewhat
incredible claim.

appalls the Court.7 And with respect to Lieutenant Gates,
petitioner has never alleged that Gates either participated in
or was responsible for any of the June 7 events recounted by
the Court other than attaching petitioner to the bar. Petitioner has never contended that Gates looked after or otherwise supervised him while he was on the bar. See Second
Affidavit of Larry Hope (ND Ala.), Record, Doc. No. 32.
Nor has petitioner ever claimed that Gates was responsible
for keeping him on the bar for seven hours, removing his
shirt,8 denying him water, taunting him about his thirst, or
giving water to dogs in petitioner's plain view. See ibid.
The relevance of these facts, repeatedly referenced by the
Court during the course of its legal analysis, see, e. g., ante,
at 738, 744, therefore escapes me.

Then there are the events referenced in the Court's opinion that cannot even arguably be gleaned from the record.
For instance, while the Court claims that on June 7 petitioner "was given no bathroom breaks," ante, at 735, during
his time on the bar, petitioner has never alleged that Gates
or any other prison guard refused him bathroom breaks on
that date. See Second Affidavit of Larry Hope, Record,
Doc. No. 32. As a matter of fact, the District Court expressly found below that petitioner "was not denied restroom

7 See, e. g., Plaintiff's Special Report and Brief in Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment 1-2, Record, Doc. No. 33 ("[T]he only
remaining claims are those against Defendants McClaran, Pelzer, and
Gates in connection with the May 11, 1997 hitching post incident, and
Defendant Gates in connection with the June 7 hitching post incident");
Second Affidavit of Larry Hope, Record, Doc. No. 32.

8 It is important to note that petitioner has never maintained that Gates

placed him on the bar without a shirt. Rather, petitioner's first affidavit,
see Affidavit of Larry Hope 2, Record, Doc. No. 1, as well as photographs
appended as exhibits to petitioner's second affidavit, see Second Affidavit
of Larry Hope, Exhs. 3-5, Record, Doc. No. 32, which were verified by
petitioner as "taken while [he] was on the hitching post on June 7," id., at
5, indicate that petitioner's shirt was removed, if at all, after he was
attached to the bar.

breaks." Supplemental App. to Pet. for Cert. 2. In addi-tion, photographs taken of petitioner attached to the restraining bar on June 7 show him wearing a t-shirt, revealingat a minimum that petitioner was not shirtless "all day."
See Second Affidavit of Larry Hope, Exhs. 3-5, Record, Doc.No. 32; id., at 5 (verifying that the photographs were "taken
while [he] was on the hitching post on June 7").Once one understands petitioner's specific allegations
against respondents, the Eighth Amendment violation in thiscase is far from "obvious."

Ante, at 738. What is "ob-vious," however, is that the Court's explanation of how

respondents violated the Eighth Amendment is woefullyincomplete. The Court merely recounts petitioner's allegations regarding the events of June 7 and concludes that "[t]heuse of the hitching post under these circumstances violated
the `basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment[,][which] is nothing less than the dignity of man.' " Ibid.
(quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958)). TheCourt, however, fails to explain how respondents McClaran
and Pelzer violated the Eighth Amendment, given that theyhad no involvement whatsoever in affixing petitioner to the
restraining bar on June 7. The Court's reasoning as appliedto respondent Gates is similarly inadequate since petitioner
has never alleged that Gates bore any responsibility for mostof the conduct on June 7 that supposedly renders the Eighth
Amendment violation "obvious." 9

9 In an effort to rehabilitate the Court's opinion, Justice Stevens argues that the specific nature of respondents' connection to the events of
May 11 and June 7 falls outside the scope of the questions presented. See
ante, at 746. In conducting qualified immunity analysis, however, courts
do not merely ask whether, taking the plaintiff's allegations as true, the
plaintiff's clearly established rights were violated. Rather, courts must
consider as well whether each defendant's alleged conduct violated the
plaintiff's clearly established rights. For instance, an allegation that Defendant A violated a plaintiff's clearly established rights does nothing to
overcome Defendant B's assertion of qualified immunity, absent some allegation that Defendant B was responsible for Defendant A's conduct. Sim536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting

II
Once petitioner's allegations regarding respondents' con-duct are separated from his other grievances and the mistreatment invented by the Court, this case presents one sim-ple question: Was it clearly established in 1995 that the mere
act of cuffing petitioner to the restraining bar (or, in the caseof Officer McClaran, ordering petitioner's attachment to the
restraining bar) violated the Eighth Amendment? The an-swer to this question is also simple: Obviously not.

A
The Court correctly states that respondents are entitledto qualified immunity unless their conduct violated " `clearly

established statutory or constitutional rights of which a rea-sonable person would have known.' "

Ante, at 739 (quoting
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982)). But theCourt then fails either to discuss or to apply the following

important principles. Qualified immunity protects "all butthe plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the
law." Malley v. Briggs, 475 U. S. 335, 341 (1986). If "itwould be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was
unlawful in the situation he confronted," then qualified im-munity does not apply. Saucier v. Katz, 533 U. S. 194, 202
(2001). But if, on the other hand, "officers of reasonablecompetence could disagree on th[e] issue, immunity should
be recognized." Malley, supra, at 341.In evaluating whether it was clearly established in 1995
that respondents' conduct violated the Eighth Amendment,the Court of Appeals properly noted that "[i]t is important
to analyze the facts in [the prior cases relied upon by peti-tioner where courts found Eighth Amendment violations],

ilarly here, in the absence of any allegation by petitioner that respondents
were in any way responsible for the behavior of other prison guards on
May 11 and June 7, the conduct of those other guards should not be considered in analyzing whether respondents are entitled to qualified immunity.

and determine if they are materially similar to the facts in
the case in front of us." 240 F. 3d, at 981 (internal quotation
marks omitted). The right not to suffer from "cruel and unusual punishments," U. S. Const., Amdt. 8, is an extremely
abstract and general right. In the vast majority of cases,
the text of the Eighth Amendment does not, in and of itself,
give a government official sufficient notice of the clearly established Eighth Amendment law applicable to a particular situation.10 Rather, one must look to case law to see
whether "the right the official is alleged to have violated
[has] been `clearly established' in a more particularized, and
hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right must
be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right." Anderson
v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635, 640 (1987).

In conducting this inquiry, it is crucial to look at precedent
applying the relevant legal rule in similar factual circumstances. Such cases give government officials the best indication of what conduct is unlawful in a given situation. If,
for instance, "various courts have agreed that certain conduct [constitutes an Eighth Amendment violation] under
facts not distinguishable in a fair way from the facts presented in the case at hand," Saucier, supra, at 202, then a
plaintiff would have a compelling argument that a defendant
is not entitled to qualified immunity.

That is not to say, of course, that conduct can be "clearly
established" as unlawful only if a court has already passed
on the legality of that behavior under materially similar circumstances. Certain actions so obviously run afoul of the
law that an assertion of qualified immunity may be overcome
even though court decisions have yet to address "materially
similar" conduct. Or, as the Court puts it, "officials can still

general the principle that a police officer's use of force violates the Fourth
Amendment if it is excessive under objective standards of reasonableness).

be on notice that their conduct violates established law evenin novel factual circumstances."

Ante, at 741.
Although the Court argues that the Court of Appeals hasimproperly imposed a "rigid gloss on the qualified immunity

standard," ante, at 739, and n. 9, requiring that the facts ofa previous case be materially similar to a plaintiff 's circumstances for qualified immunity to be overcome, this suggestion is plainly wrong. Rather, this Court of Appeals has re-peatedly made clear that it imposes no such requirement on

plaintiffs seeking to defeat an assertion of qualified immu-nity. See,

e. g., Priester v. Riviera Beach, 208 F. 3d 919, 926
(CA11 2000) (stating that qualified immunity does not apply
if an official's conduct "was so far beyond the hazy border
between excessive and acceptable force that [the official] had
to know he was violating the Constitution even without caselaw on point" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Smith
v. Mattox, 127 F. 3d 1416, 1419 (CA11 1997) (noting that a

plaintiff can overcome an assertion of qualified immunity
by demonstrating "that the official's conduct lies so obviously
at the very core of what the [Constitution] prohibits that
the unlawfulness of the conduct was readily apparent to
the official, notwithstanding the lack of caselaw"); Lassiter
v. Alabama A&M Univ., 28 F. 3d 1146, 1150, n. 4 (CA11
1994) ("[O]ccasionally the words of a federal statute or federal constitutional provision will be specific enough to establish the law applicable to particular circumstances clearly
and to overcome qualified immunity even in the absence of
case law").

Similarly, it is unfair to read the Court of Appeals' decision
as adopting such a "rigid gloss" here. Nowhere did the
Court of Appeals state that petitioner, in order to overcome
respondents' assertion of qualified immunity, was required
to produce precedent addressing "materially similar" facts.
Rather, the Court of Appeals merely (and sensibly) evaluated the cases relied upon by petitioner to determine
whether they involved facts "materially similar" to those

present in this case. See 240 F. 3d, at 981 ("It is importantto analyze the facts in these cases, and determine if they are

`materially similar' to the facts in the case in front ofus").

To be sure, the Court of Appeals did not also ask whetherrespondents' conduct so obviously violated the Eighth
Amendment that respondents' assertion of qualified immu-nity could be overcome in the absence of case law involving
"materially similar" facts. The majority must believe thatthe Court of Appeals, therefore, has implicitly abandoned its
prior qualified immunity jurisprudence. I, on the otherhand, believe it is far more likely that the Court of Appeals
omitted such a discussion from its opinion for a much simplerreason: Given petitioner's allegations, it thought that the argument was so weak, and the alleged actions of respondentsso far removed from " `the hazy border between excessive
and acceptable force,' " Priester, supra, at 926 (quoting
Smith, supra, at 1419), that it was not worth mentioning.

B
Turning to the merits of respondents' assertion that theyare entitled to qualified immunity, the relevant question is

whether it should have been clear to McClaran, Pelzer, andGates in 1995 that attaching petitioner to a restraining bar
violated the Eighth Amendment. As the Court notes, atthat time Alabama was the only State that used this particular disciplinary method when prisoners refused to work ordisrupted work squads. See ante, at 733. Previous litigation over Alabama's use of the restraining bar, however, didnothing to warn reasonable Alabama prison guards that attaching a prisoner to a restraining bar was unlawful, letalone that the illegality of such conduct was clearly established. In fact, the outcome of those cases effectively fore-closes petitioner's claim that it should have been clear to respondents in 1995 that handcuffing petitioner to a restrainingbar violated the Eighth Amendment.

756 HOPE v. PELZER

Thomas, J., dissenting
For example, a year before the conduct at issue in this casetook place, the United States District Court for the Northern

District of Alabama rejected the Eighth Amendment claimof an Alabama prisoner who was attached to a restraining
bar for five hours after he refused to work and scuffled withguards. See

Lane v. Findley, No. CV-93-C-1741-S (Aug.
4, 1994). The District Court reasoned that attaching the
prisoner to a restraining bar "was a measured response to apotentially volatile situation and a clear warning to other

inmates that refusal to work would result in immediate disci-pline subjecting the offending inmate to similar conditions
experienced by work detail inmates rather than a return to
inside the institution." Id., at 9. The District Court therefore concluded that there was a "substantial penological justification" for attaching the plaintiff to the restraining bar.
Ibid.

Both the Court and petitioner attempt to distinguish this
case from Lane on the grounds that the prisoner in Lane
was "offered regular water and bathroom breaks" while on
the restraining bar. See ante, at 747, n. 12; Reply Brief for
Petitioner 16, n. 5. But this argument fails for two reasons:
(1) Respondents McClaran and Pelzer were involved only in
the May 11 incident, and it is undisputed that petitioner was
offered water and a bathroom break every 15 minutes during
his 2 hours on the bar that day; and (2) petitioner, as previously mentioned, has never alleged that respondent Gates
was responsible for denying him water or bathroom breaks
on June 7.

The same year that it decided Lane, the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Alabama dismissed another complaint filed by an Alabama prisoner who
was handcuffed to a restraining bar. In that case, the prisoner, after refusing to leave prison grounds with his work
squad, was handcuffed to a restraining bar for eight hours.
Temperatures allegedly reached 95 degrees while the prisoner was attached to the bar, and he was allegedly denied

food, water, and any opportunities to use bathroom facilities.See Whitson v. Gillikin, No. CV-93-H-1517-NE (Jan. 24,

1994), p. 7, App. 81. As a result of being handcuffed to thebar, the prisoner "suffered lacerations, pain, and swelling in
his arms." Id., at 85. The District Court, without decidingwhether the defendants' conduct violated the Eighth Amendment, held that "there was no clearly established law identi-fying [their behavior] as unconstitutional."

Id., at 88.Federal District Courts in five other Alabama cases decided before 1995 similarly rejected claims that handcuffinga prisoner to a restraining bar or other stationary object
violated the Eighth Amendment. See, e. g., Ashby v. Dees,No. CV-94-U-0605-NE (ND Ala., Dec. 27, 1994) (fence);
Vinson v. Thompson, No. CV-94-A-268-N (MD Ala., Dec.9, 1994) (restraining bar); Hollis v. Folsom, No. CV-94-
T-0052-N (MD Ala., Nov. 4, 1994) (fence); Williamson v.Anderson, No. CV-92-H-675-N (MD Ala., Aug. 18, 1993)
(fence); Dale v. Murphy, No. CV-85-1091-H-S (SD Ala.,Feb. 4, 1986) (light pole).

11 By contrast, petitioner is unable

to point to any Alabama decision issued before respondents

11 The Court's attempt to distinguish away all of these decisions only
serves to undermine further its qualified immunity analysis. The Court
appears to suggest that affixing a prisoner to a restraining bar is not
clearly unlawful so long as (1) guards provide the prisoner with water and
regular bathroom breaks, or (2) the prisoner is placed on the restraining
bar as a result of his refusal to work. See ante, at 747, n. 12. But as
previously explained, see supra, at 756, petitioner was offered water and
bathroom breaks every 15 minutes during his May 11 stay on the bar, and
there has never been any allegation either that respondents McClaran and
Pelzer were involved at all in the June 7 incident or that respondent Gates
was responsible for denying petitioner water or bathroom breaks on that
date. As a result, even under the Court's own view of the law, respondents are entitled to qualified immunity. Moreover, the Court nowhere
explains how respondents were supposed to figure out in 1995 that it was
permissible to affix prisoners to a restraining bar if they refused to work
but it was unlawful to do so if they were disruptive while on work duty.
The claim that such a distinction was clearly established in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence at that time is nothing short of incredible.

affixed him to the restraining bar holding that a prison guardengaging in such conduct violated the Eighth Amendment.

In the face of these decisions, and the absence of contraryauthority, I find it impossible to conclude that respondents
either were "plainly incompetent" or "knowingly violat[ing]the law" when they affixed petitioner to the restraining bar.
Malley, 475 U. S., at 341. A reasonably competent prisonguard attempting to obey the law is not only entitled to look
at how courts have recently evaluated his colleagues' priorconduct, such judicial decisions are often the only place that
a guard can look for guidance, especially in a situation wherea State stands alone in adopting a particular policy.

C
In concluding that respondents are not entitled to qualifiedimmunity, the Court is understandably unwilling to hold that

our Eighth Amendment jurisprudence clearly established in1995 that attaching petitioner to a restraining bar violated
the Eighth Amendment.12 Ante, at 742. It is far from "obvi-ous,"

ante, at 738, 741, that respondents, by attaching peti-tioner to a restraining bar, acted with "deliberate indifference" to his health and safety. Hudson v. McMillian, 503U. S. 1, 8 (1992). Petitioner's allegations do not come close to
suggesting that respondents knew that the mere act of at12 I continue to believe that "[c]onditions of confinement are not punishment in any recognized sense of the term, unless imposed as part of a
sentence." Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 859 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment). As a result, I do not think, as an original matter,
that attaching petitioner to the restraining bar constituted "punishment"
under the Eighth Amendment. See ibid. Nevertheless, I recognize that
this Court has embraced the opposite view--that the Eighth Amendment
does regulate prison conditions not imposed as part of a sentence, see, e. g.,
Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97 (1976)--so I will apply that jurisprudence in
evaluating whether respondents' conduct violated clearly established law.
I note, however, that I remain open to overruling our dubious expansion
of the Eighth Amendment in an appropriate case. See Farmer, supra, at
861-862 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).

Thomas, J., dissenting
taching petitioner to the restraining bar imposed "a substan-tial risk of serious harm" upon him. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825, 847 (1994). If, for instance, attachingpetitioner to a restraining bar amounted to the "gratuitous
infliction of `wanton and unnecessary' pain," ante, at 738, itis curious that petitioner, while handcuffed to the bar on May
11, chose to decline most of the bathroom breaks offered tohim. Respondents also affixed petitioner to the restraining
bar for a legitimate penological purpose: encouraging hiscompliance with prison rules while out on work duty.

Moreover, if the application of this Court's general EighthAmendment jurisprudence to the use of a restraining bar
was as "obvious" as the Court claims, ante, at 738, 741, onewonders how Federal District Courts in Alabama could have
repeatedly arrived at the opposite conclusion, and how re-spondents, in turn, were to realize that these courts had
failed to grasp the "obvious."

D
Unable to base its holding that respondents' conduct vio-lated " `clearly established . . . rights of which a reasonable

person would have known,' " ante, at 742 (quoting Harlow,457 U. S., at 818), on this Court's precedents, the Court instead relies upon "binding Eleventh Circuit precedent, anAlabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) regulation, and
a [Department of Justice] report informing the ADOC of theconstitutional infirmity in its use of the hitching post,"

ante,at 741-742. I will address these sources in reverse order.

The Department of Justice report referenced by the Courtdoes nothing to demonstrate that it should have been clear
to respondents that attaching petitioner to a restrainingbar violated his Eighth Amendment rights. To begin with,
the Court concedes that there is no indication the JusticeDepartment's recommendation that the ADOC stop using

the restraining bar was ever communicated to respondents,prison guards in the small town of Capshaw, Alabama. See

Thomas, J., dissenting
ante, at 745. In any event, an extraordinarily well-informedprison guard in 1995, who had read both the Justice Department's report and Federal District Court decisions address-ing the use of the restraining bar, could have concluded only
that there was a dispute as to whether handcuffing a prisonerto a restraining bar constituted an Eighth Amendment violation, not that such a practice was clearly unconstitutional.

The ADOC regulation relied upon by the Court not onlyfails to provide support for its holding today; the regulation

weighs in respondents' favor because it expressly authorizedprison guards to affix prisoners to a restraining bar when
they were "disruptive to the work squad." App. 102. Alabama prison guards were entitled to rely on the validity of a
duly promulgated state regulation instructing them to attach
prisoners to a restraining bar under specified circumstances.
See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U. S. 603, 617 (1999) (crediting officer's reliance on Marshals Service policy as "important" to
the conclusion that qualified immunity was warranted in an
area where the state of the law "was at best undeveloped").
And, as the Court recounts, petitioner was placed on the restraining bar after entering into an argument with another
inmate while on work duty (May 11) and a wrestling match
with a guard when arriving at his work site (June 7).
Ante, at 734.

The Court argues that respondents must have been
"aware of the wrongful character of their conduct" because
they did not precisely abide by the policy set forth in the
ADOC regulation. Ante, at 744. Even taking petitioner's
allegations as true, however, I am at a loss to understand
how respondents failed to comply with the regulation. With
respect to respondents McClaran and Pelzer, who were involved only in the May 11 incident, the Court concedes that
the required activity log was filled out on that date, and petitioner was offered water and bathroom breaks every 15 minutes. Ante, at 734, 744. With respect to respondent Gates,
the Court complains that no such log exists for petitioner's

536US2 Unit: $U81 [01-14-04 18:47:47] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Thomas, J., dissenting
June 7 stay on the bar and the record suggests that the peri-odic water and bathroom-break offers contemplated by the

regulation were not made. Petitioner, however, has neveralleged that Gates was responsible for supervising or looking
after him once he was handcuffed to the post. He has onlyalleged that Gates placed him there.

While the Court also observes that the regulation provides
that an inmate " `will be allowed to join his assigned squad' "whenever he tells an officer " `that he is ready to go to

work,' " ante, at 744 (quoting App. 103), the Court again doesnot explain how any of the respondents in this case failed to
observe this requirement. Petitioner has never alleged that
he informed respondents or any other prison guard while he
was on the bar that he was ready to go to work.

Finally, the "binding Eleventh Circuit precedent" relied
upon by the Court, ante, at 741-743, was plainly insufficient
to give respondents fair warning that their alleged conduct
ran afoul of petitioner's Eighth Amendment rights. The
Court of Appeals held in Ort v. White, 813 F. 2d 318 (CA11
1987), that a prison guard did not violate an inmate's Eighth
Amendment rights by denying him water when he refused
to work, and the Court admits that this holding provides no
support for petitioner. Instead, it claims that the "reasoning" in Ort "gave fair warning to respondents that their
conduct crossed the line of what is constitutionally permissible." Ante, at 743. But Ort provides at least as much
support to respondents as it does to petitioner. For instance, Ort makes it abundantly clear that prison guards
"have the authority to use that amount of force or those coercive measures reasonably necessary to enforce an inmate's
compliance with valid prison rules" so long as such measures
are not undertaken "maliciously or sadistically." 813 F. 2d,
at 325.

To be sure, the Court correctly notes that the Court of
Appeals in Ort suggested that it "might have reached a different decision" had the prison officer denied the inmate

water after he had returned to the prison instead of whilehe was out with the work squad.

Id., at 326. But the suggestion in dicta that a guard might have violated a prisoner'sEighth Amendment rights by denying him water once he

returned from work duty does not come close to clearly es-tablishing the unconstitutionality of attaching a disruptive
inmate to a restraining bar after he is removed from his
work squad and back within prison walls.Admittedly, the other case upon which the Court relies,

Gates v. Collier, 501 F. 2d 1291 (CA5 1974), is more on point.Nevertheless,

Gates is also inadequate to establish clearly
the unlawfulness of respondents' alleged conduct. In Gates,
the Court of Appeals listed "handcuffing inmates to [a] fence
and to cells for long periods of time" as one of many unacceptable forms of "physical brutality and abuse" present at
a Mississippi prison. Id., at 1306. Others included administering milk of magnesia as a form of punishment, depriving
inmates of mattresses, hygienic materials, and adequate
food, and shooting at and around inmates to keep them
standing or moving. See ibid. The Court of Appeals had
"no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that these forms
of corporal punishment run afoul of the Eighth Amendment." Ibid.

It is not reasonable, however, to read Gates as establishing
a bright-line rule forbidding the attachment of prisoners to
a restraining bar. For example, in referring to the fact that
prisoners were handcuffed to a fence and cells "for long periods of time," the Court of Appeals did not indicate whether
it considered a "long period of time" to be 1 hour, 5 hours,
or 25 hours. The Court of Appeals also provided no explanation of the circumstances surrounding these incidents.
The opinion does not indicate whether the handcuffed prisoners were given water and suitable restroom breaks or
whether they were handcuffed in a bid to induce them to
comply with prison rules. In the intervening 21 years between Gates and the time respondents affixed petitioner to

763Cite as: 536 U. S. 730 (2002)
Thomas, J., dissenting
the restraining bar, there were no further decisions clarify-ing the contours of the law in this area. Therefore, as another court interpreting Gates has noted: "There is no blan-ket prohibition against the use of punishment such as the
hitching post in Gates which would signal to the Commis-sioner of Corrections [let alone ordinary corrections officers]
that the mere use of the hitching post would be a constitu-tional violation."

Fountain v. Talley, 104 F. Supp. 2d 1345,1354 (MD Ala. 2000).

Moreover, Eighth Amendment law has not stood still sinceGates was decided. In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U. S. 825
(1994), this Court elucidated the proper test for measuringwhether a prison official's state of mind is one of "deliberate
indifference," holding that "a prison official cannot be foundliable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate
humane conditions of confinement unless the official knowsof and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or
safety; the official must both be aware of facts from whichthe inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference." Id.,at 837. Because the Court of Appeals in

Gates did not con-sider this subjective element, Gates alone could not have

clearly established that affixing prisoners to a restrainingbar was clearly unconstitutional in 1995. Also, in the face of
recent Federal District Court decisions specifically rejectingprisoners' claims that Alabama prison guards violated their
Eighth Amendment rights by attaching them to a restrain-ing bar as well as a state regulation authorizing such conduct, it seems contrary to the purpose of qualified immunityto hold that one vague sentence plucked out of a 21-year-old
Court of Appeals opinion provided clear notice to respond-ents in 1995 that their conduct was unlawful.

* * *
It is most unfortunate that the Court holds that OfficerMcClaran, Sergeant Pelzer, and Lieutenant Gates are not

entitled to qualified immunity. It was not at all clear in 1995that respondents' conduct violated the Eighth Amendment,

and they certainly could not have anticipated that this Courtor any other would rule against them on the basis of nonexistent allegations or allegations involving the behaviorof other prison guards. For the foregoing reasons, I would
affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. I respect-fully dissent.

765OCTOBER TERM, 2001
Syllabus

REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINNESOTA et al. v.WHITE, CHAIRPERSON, MINNESOTA BOARD

OF JUDICIAL STANDARDS, et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 01-521. Argued March 26, 2002--Decided June 27, 2002
The Minnesota Supreme Court has adopted a canon of judicial conduct

that prohibits a "candidate for a judicial office" from "announc[ing] his
or her views on disputed legal or political issues" (hereinafter announce
clause). While running for associate justice of that court, petitioner
Gregory Wersal (and others) filed this suit seeking a declaration that
the announce clause violates the First Amendment and an injunction
against its enforcement. The District Court granted respondent officials summary judgment, and the Eighth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The announce clause violates the First Amendment. Pp. 770-788.

(a) The record demonstrates that the announce clause prohibits a judicial candidate from stating his views on any specific nonfanciful legal
question within the province of the court for which he is running, except
in the context of discussing past decisions--and in the latter context

as well, if he expresses the view that he is not bound by stare decisis.
Pp. 770-774.

(b) The announce clause both prohibits speech based on its content
and burdens a category of speech that is at the core of First Amendment
freedoms--speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office.
The Eighth Circuit concluded, and the parties do not dispute, that the
proper test to be applied to determine the constitutionality of such a
restriction is strict scrutiny, under which respondents have the burden
to prove that the clause is (1) narrowly tailored, to serve (2) a compelling
state interest. E. g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central
Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 222. That court found that respondents had established two interests as sufficiently compelling to justify the announce
clause: preserving the state judiciary's impartiality and preserving the
appearance of that impartiality. Pp. 774-775.

(c) Under any definition of "impartiality," the announce clause fails
strict scrutiny. First, it is plain that the clause is not narrowly tailored
to serve impartiality (or its appearance) in the traditional sense of the
word, i. e., as a lack of bias for or against either party to the proceeding.
Indeed, the clause is barely tailored to serve that interest at all, inasmuch as it does not restrict speech for or against particular parties,

536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN
766 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINN. v. WHITE

Syllabus
but rather speech for or against particular issues. Second, although
"impartiality" in the sense of a lack of preconception in favor of or
against a particular legal view may well be an interest served by the
announce clause, pursuing this objective is not a compelling state interest, since it is virtually impossible, and hardly desirable, to find a judge
who does not have preconceptions about the law, see Laird v. Tatum,
409 U. S. 824, 835. Third, the Court need not decide whether achieving
"impartiality" (or its appearance) in the sense of openmindedness is a
compelling state interest because, as a means of pursuing this interest,
the announce clause is so woefully underinclusive that the Court does
not believe it was adopted for that purpose. See, e. g., City of Ladue v.
Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43, 52-53. Respondents have not carried the burden
imposed by strict scrutiny of establishing that statements made during
an election campaign are uniquely destructive of openmindedness. See,
e. g., Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 841.
Pp. 775-784.

(d) A universal and long-established tradition of prohibiting certain
conduct creates a strong presumption that the prohibition is constitutional, see McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334, 375-377.
However, the practice of prohibiting speech by judicial candidates is
neither ancient nor universal. The Court knows of no such prohibitions
throughout the 19th and the first quarter of the 20th century, and they
are still not universally adopted. This does not compare well with the
traditions deemed worthy of attention in, e. g., Burson v. Freeman, 504
U. S. 191, 205-206. Pp. 785-787.

(e) There is an obvious tension between Minnesota's Constitution,
which requires judicial elections, and the announce clause, which places
most subjects of interest to the voters off limits. The First Amendment does not permit Minnesota to leave the principle of elections in
place while preventing candidates from discussing what the elections
are about. See, e. g., Renne v. Geary, 501 U. S. 312, 349. Pp. 787-788.

768 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINN. v. WHITE

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented in this case is whether the FirstAmendment permits the Minnesota Supreme Court to prohibit candidates for judicial election in that State from an-nouncing their views on disputed legal and political issues.

I
Since Minnesota's admission to the Union in 1858, theState's Constitution has provided for the selection of all state

judges by popular election. Minn. Const., Art. VI, $ 7.Since 1912, those elections have been nonpartisan. Act of
June 19, ch. 2, 1912 Minn. Laws Special Sess., pp. 4-6. Since1974, they have been subject to a legal restriction which
states that a "candidate for a judicial office, including anincumbent judge," shall not "announce his or her views on
disputed legal or political issues." Minn. Code of JudicialConduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i) (2000). This prohibition, promulgated by the Minnesota Supreme Court and based onCanon 7(B) of the 1972 American Bar Association (ABA)
Model Code of Judicial Conduct, is known as the "announceclause." Incumbent judges who violate it are subject to
discipline, including removal, censure, civil penalties, andsuspension without pay. Minn. Rules of Board on Judicial
Standards 4(a)(6), 11(d) (2002). Lawyers who run for judi-cial office also must comply with the announce clause. Minn.
Rule of Professional Conduct 8.2(b) (2002) ("A lawyer who isa candidate for judicial office shall comply with the applicable
provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct"). Those who vi-olate it are subject to,

inter alia, disbarment, suspension,and probation. Rule 8.4(a); Minn. Rules on Lawyers Professional Responsibility 8-14, 15(a) (2002).In 1996, one of the petitioners, Gregory Wersal, ran for
associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court. In thecourse of the campaign, he distributed literature criticizing
several Minnesota Supreme Court decisions on issues suchas crime, welfare, and abortion. A complaint against Wersal

Opinion of the Court
challenging, among other things, the propriety of this litera-ture was filed with the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility, the agency which, under the direction of theMinnesota Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board,

1 investigates and prosecutes ethical violations of lawyer candi-dates for judicial office. The Lawyers Board dismissed the

complaint; with regard to the charges that his campaignmaterials violated the announce clause, it expressed doubt
whether the clause could constitutionally be enforced.Nonetheless, fearing that further ethical complaints would
jeopardize his ability to practice law, Wersal withdrew fromthe election. In 1998, Wersal ran again for the same office.
Early in that race, he sought an advisory opinion from theLawyers Board with regard to whether it planned to enforce
the announce clause. The Lawyers Board responded equiv-ocally, stating that, although it had significant doubts about
the constitutionality of the provision, it was unable to answerhis question because he had not submitted a list of the announcements he wished to make.2Shortly thereafter, Wersal filed this lawsuit in Federal
District Court against respondents,3 seeking, inter alia, a

1 The Eighth Circuit did not parse out the separate functions of these
two entities in the case at hand, referring to the two of them collectively
as the "Lawyers Board." We take the same approach.

2 Nor did Wersal have any success receiving answers from the Lawyers

Board when he included "concrete examples," post, at 799, n. 2 (Stevens,
J., dissenting), in his request for an advisory opinion on other subjects a
month later:

"As you are well aware, there is pending litigation over the constitutionality of certain portions of Canon 5. You are a plaintiff in this action and
you have sued, among others, me as Director of the Office of Lawyers
Professional Responsibility and Charles Lundberg as the Chair of the
Board of Lawyers Professional Responsibility. Due to this pending litigation, I will not be answering your request for an advisory opinion at this
time." App. 153.

3 Respondents are officers of the Lawyers Board and of the Minnesota

Board on Judicial Standards (Judicial Board), which enforces the ethical
rules applicable to judges.

declaration that the announce clause violates the FirstAmendment and an injunction against its enforcement.

Wersal alleged that he was forced to refrain from announcinghis views on disputed issues during the 1998 campaign, to
the point where he declined response to questions put to himby the press and public, out of concern that he might run
afoul of the announce clause. Other plaintiffs in the suit,including the Minnesota Republican Party, alleged that, because the clause kept Wersal from announcing his views,they were unable to learn those views and support or oppose
his candidacy accordingly. The parties filed cross-motionsfor summary judgment, and the District Court found in favor
of respondents, holding that the announce clause did not vio-late the First Amendment. 63 F. Supp. 2d 967 (Minn. 1999).
Over a dissent by Judge Beam, the United States Court ofAppeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.

Republican Partyof Minn. v. Kelly, 247 F. 3d 854 (2001). We granted certiorari. 534 U. S. 1054 (2001).

II
Before considering the constitutionality of the announceclause, we must be clear about its meaning. Its text says

that a candidate for judicial office shall not "announce his orher views on disputed legal or political issues." Minn. Code
of Judicial Conduct, Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i) (2002).We know that "announc[ing] . . . views" on an issue covers
much more than promising to decide an issue a particularway. The prohibition extends to the candidate's mere statement of his current position, even if he does not bind himselfto maintain that position after election. All the parties
agree this is the case, because the Minnesota Code containsa so-called "pledges or promises" clause, which separately
prohibits judicial candidates from making "pledges or prom-ises of conduct in office other than the faithful and impartial
performance of the duties of the office," ibid.--a prohibitionthat is not challenged here and on which we express no view.

771Cite as: 536 U. S. 765 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
There are, however, some limitations that the MinnesotaSupreme Court has placed upon the scope of the announce

clause that are not (to put it politely) immediately apparentfrom its text. The statements that formed the basis of the
complaint against Wersal in 1996 included criticism of pastdecisions of the Minnesota Supreme Court. One piece of
campaign literature stated that "[t]he Minnesota Supreme
Court has issued decisions which are marked by their disre-gard for the Legislature and a lack of common sense." App.

37. It went on to criticize a decision excluding from evi-dence confessions by criminal defendants that were not
tape-recorded, asking "[s]hould we conclude that because the
Supreme Court does not trust police, it allows confessed
criminals to go free?" Ibid. It criticized a decision striking
down a state law restricting welfare benefits, asserting

that "[i]t's the Legislature which should set our spending policies." Ibid. And it criticized a decision requiring

public financing of abortions for poor women as "unprecedented" and a "pro-abortion stance." Id., at 38. Although
one would think that all of these statements touched on disputed legal or political issues, they did not (or at least do
not now) fall within the scope of the announce clause. The
Judicial Board issued an opinion stating that judicial candidates may criticize past decisions, and the Lawyers Board
refused to discipline Wersal for the foregoing statements because, in part, it thought they did not violate the announce
clause. The Eighth Circuit relied on the Judicial Board's
opinion in upholding the announce clause, 247 F. 3d, at 882,
and the Minnesota Supreme Court recently embraced the
Eighth Circuit's interpretation, In re Code of Judicial Conduct, 639 N. W. 2d 55 (2002).

There are yet further limitations upon the apparent plain
meaning of the announce clause: In light of the constitutional
concerns, the District Court construed the clause to reach
only disputed issues that are likely to come before the candidate if he is elected judge. 63 F. Supp. 2d, at 986. The

536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN
772 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINN. v. WHITE

Opinion of the Court
Eighth Circuit accepted this limiting interpretation by theDistrict Court, and in addition construed the clause to allow

general discussions of case law and judicial philosophy. 247F. 3d, at 881-882. The Supreme Court of Minnesota adopted
these interpretations as well when it ordered enforcement ofthe announce clause in accordance with the Eighth Circuit's
opinion. In re Code of Judicial Conduct, supra.It seems to us, however, that--like the text of the announce clause itself--these limitations upon the text of theannounce clause are not all that they appear to be. First,
respondents acknowledged at oral argument that statements
critical of past judicial decisions are not permissible if thecandidate also states that he is against

stare decisis. Tr. of
Oral Arg. 33-34.4 Thus, candidates must choose betweenstating their views critical of past decisions and stating their

views in opposition to stare decisis. Or, to look at it moreconcretely, they may state their view that prior decisions
were erroneous only if they do not assert that they, if
elected, have any power to eliminate erroneous decisions.Second, limiting the scope of the clause to issues likely to

come before a court is not much of a limitation at all. Onewould hardly expect the "disputed legal or political issues"
raised in the course of a state judicial election to include suchmatters as whether the Federal Government should end the
embargo of Cuba. Quite obviously, they will be those legalor political disputes that are the proper (or by past decisions
have been made the improper) business of the state courts.And within that relevant category, "[t]here is almost no legal
or political issue that is unlikely to come before a judge ofan American court, state or federal, of general jurisdiction."

4 Justice Ginsburg argues that we should ignore this concession at
oral argument because it is inconsistent with the Eighth Circuit's interpretation of the announce clause. Post, at 810 (dissenting opinion). As she
appears to acknowledge, however, the Eighth Circuit was merely silent on
this particular question. Ibid. Silence is hardly inconsistent with what
respondents conceded at oral argument.

Opinion of the Court
Buckley v. Illinois Judicial Inquiry Bd., 997 F. 2d 224, 229(CA7 1993). Third, construing the clause to allow "general"

discussions of case law and judicial philosophy turns out tobe of little help in an election campaign. At oral argument,
respondents gave, as an example of this exception, that acandidate is free to assert that he is a " `strict constructionist.' " Tr. of Oral Arg. 29. But that, like most other philo-sophical generalities, has little meaningful content for the
electorate unless it is exemplified by application to a particu-lar issue of construction likely to come before a court--for
example, whether a particular statute runs afoul of any pro-vision of the Constitution. Respondents conceded that the
announce clause would prohibit the candidate from exempli-fying his philosophy in this fashion.

Id., at 43. Withoutsuch application to real-life issues, all candidates can claim

to be "strict constructionists" with equal (and unhelpful)plausibility.

In any event, it is clear that the announce clause prohibitsa judicial candidate from stating his views on any specific
nonfanciful legal question within the province of the courtfor which he is running, except in the context of discussing
past decisions--and in the latter context as well, if he ex-presses the view that he is not bound by

stare decisis.5

5 In 1990, in response to concerns that its 1972 Model Canon--which was
the basis for Minnesota's announce clause--violated the First Amendment,
see L. Milord, The Development of the ABA Judicial Code 50 (1992), the
ABA replaced that canon with a provision that prohibits a judicial candidate from making "statements that commit or appear to commit the
candidate with respect to cases, controversies or issues that are likely to
come before the court." ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon
5(A)(3)(d)(ii) (2000). At oral argument, respondents argued that the limiting constructions placed upon Minnesota's announce clause by the Eighth
Circuit, and adopted by the Minnesota Supreme Court, render the scope
of the clause no broader than the ABA's 1990 canon. Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.
This argument is somewhat curious because, based on the same constitutional concerns that had motivated the ABA, the Minnesota Supreme
Court was urged to replace the announce clause with the new ABA language, but, unlike other jurisdictions, declined. Final Report of the Advi536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN
774 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINN. v. WHITE

Opinion of the Court
Respondents contend that this still leaves plenty of topicsfor discussion on the campaign trail. These include a candidate's "character," "education," "work habits," and "how [he]would handle administrative duties if elected." Brief for
Respondents 35-36. Indeed, the Judicial Board has printeda list of preapproved questions which judicial candidates are
allowed to answer. These include how the candidate feelsabout cameras in the courtroom, how he would go about reducing the caseload, how the costs of judicial administrationcan be reduced, and how he proposes to ensure that minorities and women are treated more fairly by the court system.Minnesota State Bar Association Judicial Elections Task
Force Report & Recommendations, App. C (June 19, 1997),reprinted at App. 97-103. Whether this list of preapproved
subjects, and other topics not prohibited by the announceclause, adequately fulfill the First Amendment's guarantee
of freedom of speech is the question to which we now turn.

III
As the Court of Appeals recognized, the announce clauseboth prohibits speech on the basis of its content and burdens

a category of speech that is "at the core of our First Amend-ment freedoms"--speech about the qualifications of candidates for public office. 247 F. 3d, at 861, 863. The Courtof Appeals concluded that the proper test to be applied to
determine the constitutionality of such a restriction is whatour cases have called strict scrutiny,

id., at 864; the partiesdo not dispute that this is correct. Under the strict-scrutiny

test, respondents have the burden to prove that the ansory Committee to Review the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct and
the Rules of the Minnesota Board on Judicial Standards 5-6 (June 29,
1994), reprinted at App. 367-368. The ABA, however, agrees with respondents' position, Brief for ABA as Amicus Curiae 5. We do not know
whether the announce clause (as interpreted by state authorities) and the
1990 ABA canon are one and the same. No aspect of our constitutional
analysis turns on this question.

Opinion of the Court
nounce clause is (1) narrowly tailored, to serve (2) a compel-ling state interest. E. g., Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 222 (1989). In orderfor respondents to show that the announce clause is narrowly
tailored, they must demonstrate that it does not "unneces-sarily circumscrib[e] protected expression." Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 54 (1982).The Court of Appeals concluded that respondents had established two interests as sufficiently compelling to justifythe announce clause: preserving the impartiality of the state
judiciary and preserving the appearance of the impartialityof the state judiciary. 247 F. 3d, at 867. Respondents reassert these two interests before us, arguing that the first iscompelling because it protects the due process rights of litigants, and that the second is compelling because it preservespublic confidence in the judiciary.

6 Respondents are rather

vague, however, about what they mean by "impartiality."Indeed, although the term is used throughout the Eighth

Circuit's opinion, the briefs, the Minnesota Code of JudicialConduct, and the ABA Codes of Judicial Conduct, none of
these sources bothers to define it. Clarity on this point isessential before we can decide whether impartiality is indeed
a compelling state interest, and, if so, whether the announceclause is narrowly tailored to achieve it.

A
One meaning of "impartiality" in the judicial context--andof course its root meaning--is the lack of bias for or against

either party to the proceeding. Impartiality in this sense

6 Although the Eighth Circuit also referred to the compelling interest in
an "independent" judiciary, 247 F. 3d, at 864-868, both it and respondents appear to use that term, as applied to the issues involved in this case,
as interchangeable with "impartial." See id., at 864 (describing a
judge's independence as his "ability to apply the law neutrally"); Brief

Opinion of the Court
assures equal application of the law. That is, it guarantees
a party that the judge who hears his case will apply the law
to him in the same way he applies it to any other party.
This is the traditional sense in which the term is used. See
Webster's New International Dictionary 1247 (2d ed. 1950)
(defining "impartial" as "[n]ot partial; esp., not favoring one
more than another; treating all alike; unbiased; equitable;
fair; just"). It is also the sense in which it is used in the
cases cited by respondents and amici for the proposition that
an impartial judge is essential to due process. Tumey v.
Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 523, 531-534 (1927) ( judge violated due
process by sitting in a case in which it would be in his financial interest to find against one of the parties); Aetna Life
Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U. S. 813, 822-825 (1986) (same); Ward
v. Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57, 58-62 (1972) (same); Johnson v.
Mississippi, 403 U. S. 212, 215-216 (1971) (per curiam)
( judge violated due process by sitting in a case in which one
of the parties was a previously successful litigant against
him); Bracy v. Gramley, 520 U. S. 899, 905 (1997) (would violate due process if a judge was disposed to rule against defendants who did not bribe him in order to cover up the fact
that he regularly ruled in favor of defendants who did bribe
him); In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 137-139 (1955) ( judge
violated due process by sitting in the criminal trial of defendant whom he had indicted).

We think it plain that the announce clause is not narrowly
tailored to serve impartiality (or the appearance of impartiality) in this sense. Indeed, the clause is barely tailored to
serve that interest at all, inasmuch as it does not restrict
speech for or against particular parties, but rather speech
for or against particular issues. To be sure, when a case
arises that turns on a legal issue on which the judge (as a
candidate) had taken a particular stand, the party taking the
opposite stand is likely to lose. But not because of any bias
against that party, or favoritism toward the other party.

Any party taking that position is just as likely to lose. Thejudge is applying the law (as he sees it) evenhandedly.

B
It is perhaps possible to use the term "impartiality" in thejudicial context (though this is certainly not a common usage)

to mean lack of preconception in favor of or against a particu-lar legal view. This sort of impartiality would be concerned,
not with guaranteeing litigants equal application of the law,but rather with guaranteeing them an equal chance to persuade the court on the legal points in their case. Impartial-ity in this sense may well be an interest served by the announce clause, but it is not a compelling state interest, asstrict scrutiny requires. A judge's lack of predisposition regarding the relevant legal issues in a case has never beenthought a necessary component of equal justice, and with
good reason. For one thing, it is virtually impossible to finda judge who does not have preconceptions about the law. As
then-Justice Rehnquist observed of our own Court: "Sincemost Justices come to this bench no earlier than their middle
years, it would be unusual if they had not by that time for-mulated at least some tentative notions that would influence
them in their interpretation of the sweeping clauses of theConstitution and their interaction with one another. It
would be not merely unusual, but extraordinary, if they had

7 Justice Stevens asserts that the announce clause "serves the State's
interest in maintaining both the appearance of this form of impartiality
and its actuality." Post, at 801. We do not disagree. Some of the
speech prohibited by the announce clause may well exhibit a bias against
parties--including Justice Stevens's example of an election speech
stressing the candidate's unbroken record of affirming convictions for rape,
ante, at 800-801. That is why we are careful to say that the announce
clause is "barely tailored to serve that interest," supra, at 776 (emphasis
added). The question under our strict scrutiny test, however, is not
whether the announce clause serves this interest at all, but whether it is
narrowly tailored to serve this interest. It is not.

not at least given opinions as to constitutional issues in theirprevious legal careers." Laird v. Tatum, 409 U. S. 824, 835

(1972) (memorandum opinion). Indeed, even if it were possi-ble to select judges who did not have preconceived views on
legal issues, it would hardly be desirable to do so. "Proofthat a Justice's mind at the time he joined the Court was a
complete tabula rasa in the area of constitutional adjudica-tion would be evidence of lack of qualification, not lack of
bias." Ibid. The Minnesota Constitution positively forbidsthe selection to courts of general jurisdiction of judges who
are impartial in the sense of having no views on the law.Minn. Const., Art. VI, $ 5 ("Judges of the supreme court, the
court of appeals and the district court shall be learned in thelaw"). And since avoiding judicial preconceptions on legal
issues is neither possible nor desirable, pretending otherwiseby attempting to preserve the "appearance" of that type of
impartiality can hardly be a compelling state interest either.

C
A third possible meaning of "impartiality" (again not acommon one) might be described as openmindedness. This

quality in a judge demands, not that he have no preconcep-tions on legal issues, but that he be willing to consider views
that oppose his preconceptions, and remain open to persua-sion, when the issues arise in a pending case. This sort of
impartiality seeks to guarantee each litigant, not an equalchance to win the legal points in the case, but at least

somechance of doing so. It may well be that impartiality in this

sense, and the appearance of it, are desirable in the judiciary,but we need not pursue that inquiry, since we do not believe
the Minnesota Supreme Court adopted the announce clausefor that purpose.

Respondents argue that the announce clause serves theinterest in openmindedness, or at least in the appearance of
openmindedness, because it relieves a judge from pressureto rule a certain way in order to maintain consistency with

Opinion of the Court
statements the judge has previously made. The problem is,however, that statements in election campaigns are such an

infinitesimal portion of the public commitments to legal posi-tions that judges (or judges-to-be) undertake, that this object
of the prohibition is implausible. Before they arrive on thebench (whether by election or otherwise) judges have often
committed themselves on legal issues that they must later
rule upon. See, e. g., Laird, supra, at 831-833 (describingJustice Black's participation in several cases construing and

deciding the constitutionality of the Fair Labor StandardsAct, even though as a Senator he had been one of its principal
authors; and Chief Justice Hughes's authorship of the opinion
overruling Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S.
525 (1923), a case he had criticized in a book written before
his appointment to the Court). More common still is a
judge's confronting a legal issue on which he has expressed
an opinion while on the bench. Most frequently, of course,
that prior expression will have occurred in ruling on an earlier case. But judges often state their views on disputed
legal issues outside the context of adjudication--in classes
that they conduct, and in books and speeches. Like the
ABA Codes of Judicial Conduct, the Minnesota Code not only
permits but encourages this. See Minn. Code of Judicial
Conduct, Canon 4(B) (2002) ("A judge may write, lecture,
teach, speak and participate in other extra-judicial activities
concerning the law . . ."); Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct,
Canon 4(B), Comment. (2002) ("To the extent that time permits, a judge is encouraged to do so . . ."). That is quite
incompatible with the notion that the need for openmindedness (or for the appearance of openmindedness) lies behind
the prohibition at issue here.

The short of the matter is this: In Minnesota, a candidate
for judicial office may not say "I think it is constitutional for
the legislature to prohibit same-sex marriages." He may
say the very same thing, however, up until the very day before he declares himself a candidate, and may say it repeat536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:52] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
edly (until litigation is pending) after he is elected. As ameans of pursuing the objective of openmindedness that respondents now articulate, the announce clause is so woefullyunderinclusive as to render belief in that purpose a challenge
to the credulous. See City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U. S. 43,52-53 (1994) (noting that underinclusiveness "diminish[es]
the credibility of the government's rationale for restricting
speech"); Florida Star v. B. J. F., 491 U. S. 524, 541-542(1989) (

Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("[A] law cannot
be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order,and thus as justifying a restriction upon truthful speech,

when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital
interest unprohibited" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).

Justice Stevens asserts that statements made in an election campaign pose a special threat to openmindedness because the candidate, when elected judge, will have a particular reluctance to contradict them. Post, at 801. That
might be plausible, perhaps, with regard to campaign promises. A candidate who says "If elected, I will vote to uphold
the legislature's power to prohibit same-sex marriages" will
positively be breaking his word if he does not do so (although
one would be naive not to recognize that campaign promises
are--by long democratic tradition--the least binding form of
human commitment). But, as noted earlier, the Minnesota
Supreme Court has adopted a separate prohibition on campaign "pledges or promises," which is not challenged here.
The proposition that judges feel significantly greater compulsion, or appear to feel significantly greater compulsion, to
maintain consistency with nonpromissory statements made
during a judicial campaign than with such statements made
before or after the campaign is not self-evidently true. It
seems to us quite likely, in fact, that in many cases the opposite is true. We doubt, for example, that a mere statement
of position enunciated during the pendency of an election will
be regarded by a judge as more binding--or as more likely

Opinion of the Court
to subject him to popular disfavor if reconsidered--than acarefully considered holding that the judge set forth in

an earlier opinion denying some individual's claim to jus-tice. In any event, it suffices to say that respondents
have not carried the burden imposed by our strict-scrutinytest to establish this proposition (that campaign statements
are uniquely destructive of openmindedness) on which the
validity of the announce clause rests. See, e. g., Landmark

Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U. S. 829, 841 (1978)
(rejecting speech restriction subject to strict scrutiny wherethe State "offered little more than assertion and conjecture

to support its claim that without criminal sanctions the ob-jectives of the statutory scheme would be seriously undermined"); United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group,
Inc., 529 U. S. 803, 816-825 (2000) (same).8

Moreover, the notion that the special context of election-eering justifies an

abridgment of the right to speak out on
disputed issues sets our First Amendment jurisprudence on
its head. "[D]ebate on the qualifications of candidates" is
"at the core of our electoral process and of the First Amendment freedoms," not at the edges. Eu, 489 U. S., at 222-223
(internal quotation marks omitted). "The role that elected
officials play in our society makes it all the more imperative
that they be allowed freely to express themselves on matters

8 We do not agree with Justice Stevens's broad assertion that "to the
extent that [statements on legal issues] seek to enhance the popularity of
the candidate by indicating how he would rule in specific cases if elected,
they evidence a lack of fitness for office." Post, at 798 (emphasis added).
Of course all statements on real-world legal issues "indicate" how the
speaker would rule "in specific cases." And if making such statements
(of honestly held views) with the hope of enhancing one's chances with
the electorate displayed a lack of fitness for office, so would similarly motivated honest statements of judicial candidates made with the hope of enhancing their chances of confirmation by the Senate, or indeed of appointment by the President. Since such statements are made, we think, in
every confirmation hearing, Justice Stevens must contemplate a federal
bench filled with the unfit.

of current public importance." Wood v. Georgia, 370 U. S.

to select which issues are worth discussing or debating in
the course of a political campaign." Brown, 456 U. S., at 60
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We have
never allowed the government to prohibit candidates from
communicating relevant information to voters during an
election.

Justice Ginsburg would do so--and much of her dissent
confirms rather than refutes our conclusion that the purpose
behind the announce clause is not openmindedness in the judiciary, but the undermining of judicial elections. She contends that the announce clause must be constitutional because due process would be denied if an elected judge sat in
a case involving an issue on which he had previously announced his view. Post, at 816, 819. She reaches this
conclusion because, she says, such a judge would have a "direct, personal, substantial, and pecuniary interest" in ruling
consistently with his previously announced view, in order to
reduce the risk that he will be "voted off the bench and
thereby lose [his] salary and emoluments," post, at 816 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). But elected
judges--regardless of whether they have announced any
views beforehand--always face the pressure of an electorate
who might disagree with their rulings and therefore vote
them off the bench. Surely the judge who frees Timothy
McVeigh places his job much more at risk than the judge
who (horror of horrors!) reconsiders his previously announced view on a disputed legal issue. So if, as Justice
Ginsburg claims, it violates due process for a judge to sit
in a case in which ruling one way rather than another increases his prospects for reelection, then--quite simply--the
practice of electing judges is itself a violation of due process.
It is not difficult to understand how one with these views
would approve the election-nullifying effect of the announce

clause.9 They are not, however, the views reflected in theDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which

has coexisted with the election of judges ever since it wasadopted, see infra, at 785-786.

Justice Ginsburg devotes the rest of her dissent to at-tacking arguments we do not make. For example, despite
the number of pages she dedicates to disproving this proposi-tion,

post, at 805-809, we neither assert nor imply that theFirst Amendment requires campaigns for judicial office to

sound the same as those for legislative office.10 What we doassert, and what

Justice Ginsburg ignores, is that, even ifthe First Amendment allows greater regulation of judicial

election campaigns than legislative election campaigns, theannounce clause still fails strict scrutiny because it is woefully underinclusive, prohibiting announcements by judges(and would-be judges) only at certain times and in certain
forms. We rely on the cases involving speech during elec-tions,

supra, at 781-782, only to make the obvious point thatthis underinclusiveness cannot be explained by resort to the

notion that the First Amendment provides less protectionduring an election campaign than at other times.

9 Justice Ginsburg argues that the announce clause is not election nullifying because Wersal criticized past decisions of the Minnesota Supreme
Court in his campaign literature and the Lawyers Board decided not to
discipline him for doing so. Post, at 811-812. As we have explained,
however, had Wersal additionally stated during his campaign that he did
not feel bound to follow those erroneous decisions, he would not have been
so lucky. Supra, at 772-773. This predicament hardly reflects "the robust communication of ideas and views from judicial candidate to voter."
Post, at 812.

10 Justice Stevens devotes most of his dissent to this same argument

that we do not make.

11 Nor do we assert that candidates for judicial office should be compelled to announce their views on disputed legal issues. Thus, Justice
Ginsburg's repeated invocation of instances in which nominees to this
Court declined to announce such views during Senate confirmation hearings is pointless. Post, at 807-808, n. 1, 818-819, n. 4. That the practice

Opinion of the Court
But in any case, Justice Ginsburg greatly exaggeratesthe difference between judicial and legislative elections.

She asserts that "the rationale underlying unconstrainedspeech in elections for political office--that representative
government depends on the public's ability to choose agentswho will act at its behest--does not carry over to campaigns
for the bench." Post, at 806. This complete separation ofthe judiciary from the enterprise of "representative government" might have some truth in those countries wherejudges neither make law themselves nor set aside the laws
enacted by the legislature. It is not a true picture of theAmerican system. Not only do state-court judges possess
the power to "make" common law, but they have the im-mense power to shape the States' constitutions as well. See,
e. g., Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 744 A. 2d 864 (1999). Whichis precisely why the electi on of state judges became
popular.12
of voluntarily demurring does not establish the legitimacy of legal compulsion to demur is amply demonstrated by the unredacted text of the
sentence she quotes in part, post, at 819, from Laird v. Tatum, 409 U. S.
824, 836, n. 5 (1972): "In terms of propriety, rather than disqualification,
I would distinguish quite sharply between a public statement made prior
to nomination for the bench, on the one hand, and a public statement made
by a nominee to the bench." (Emphasis added.)

12 Although Justice Stevens at times appears to agree with Justice

Ginsburg's premise that the judiciary is completely separated from the
enterprise of representative government, post, at 798 ("[E]very good
judge is fully aware of the distinction between the law and a personal
point of view"), he eventually appears to concede that the separation does
not hold true for many judges who sit on courts of last resort, ante, at 799
("If he is not a judge on the highest court in the State, he has an obligation
to follow the precedent of that court, not his personal views or public
opinion polls"); post, at 799, n. 2. Even if the policymaking capacity of
judges were limited to courts of last resort, that would only prove that
the announce clause fails strict scrutiny. "[I]f announcing one's views in
the context of a campaign for the State Supreme Court might be" protected speech, ibid., then--even if announcing one's views in the context
of a campaign for a lower court were not protected speech, ibid.--the

To sustain the announce clause, the Eighth Circuit reliedheavily on the fact that a pervasive practice of prohibiting

judicial candidates from discussing disputed legal and politi-cal issues developed during the last half of the 20th century.
247 F. 3d, at 879-880. It is true that a "universal and long-established" tradition of prohibiting certain conduct creates
"a strong presumption" that the prohibition is constitutional:"Principles of liberty fundamental enough to have been embodied within constitutional guarantees are not readilyerased from the Nation's consciousness."

McIntyre v. Ohio
Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334, 375-377 (1995) (Scalia, J.,dissenting). The practice of prohibiting speech by judicial

candidates on disputed issues, however, is neither long noruniversal.

At the time of the founding, only Vermont (before it be-came a State) selected any of its judges by election. Starting with Georgia in 1812, States began to provide for judicialelection, a development rapidly accelerated by Jacksonian
democracy. By the time of the Civil War, the great majorityof States elected their judges. E. Haynes, Selection and
Tenure of Judges 99-135 (1944); Berkson, Judicial Selectionin the United States: A Special Report, 64 Judicature 176
(1980). We know of no restrictions upon statements thatcould be made by judicial candidates (including judges)
throughout the 19th and the first quarter of the 20th century.Indeed, judicial elections were generally partisan during
this period, the movement toward nonpartisan judicial elec-tions not even beginning until the 1870's.

and low-court candidates alike. In fact, however, the judges of inferior
courts often "make law," since the precedent of the highest court does not
cover every situation, and not every case is reviewed. Justice Stevens
has repeatedly expressed the view that a settled course of lower court
opinions binds the highest court. See, e. g., Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494
U. S. 56, 74 (1990) (concurring opinion); McNally v. United States, 483 U. S.

M. Comisky & P. Patterson, The Judiciary--Selection, Com-pensation, Ethics, and Discipline 4, 7 (1987). Thus, not only

were judicial candidates (including judges) discussing dis-puted legal and political issues on the campaign trail, but
they were touting party affiliations and angling for partynominations all the while.

The first code regulating judicial conduct was adopted bythe ABA in 1924. 48 ABA Reports 74 (1923) (report of
Chief Justice Taft); P. McFadden, Electing Justice: The Lawand Ethics of Judicial Election Campaigns 86 (1990). It contained a provision akin to the announce clause: "A candidatefor judicial position . . . should not announce in advance his
conclusions of law on disputed issues to secure classsupport . . . ." ABA Canon of Judicial Ethics 30 (1924).
The States were slow to adopt the canons, however. "Bythe end of World War II, the canons . . . were binding by the
bar associations or supreme courts of only eleven states."J. MacKenzie, The Appearance of Justice 191 (1974). Even
today, although a majority of States have adopted either theannounce clause or its 1990 ABA successor, adoption is not
unanimous. Of the 31 States that select some or all of theirappellate and general-jurisdiction judges by election, see
American Judicature Society, Judicial Selection in the States:Appellate and General Jurisdiction Courts (Apr. 2002), 4
have adopted no candidate-speech restriction comparable tothe announce clause,

13 and 1 prohibits only the discussion of

"pending litigation." 14 This practice, relatively new to judi-cial elections and still not universally adopted, does not compare well with the traditions deemed worthy of our attentionin prior cases.

There is an obvious tension between the article of Minne-sota's popularly approved Constitution which provides that

judges shall be elected, and the Minnesota Supreme Court'sannounce clause which places most subjects of interest to the
voters off limits. (The candidate-speech restrictions of allthe other States that have them are also the product of judicial fiat.15) The disparity is perhaps unsurprising, since theABA, which originated the announce clause, has long been
an opponent of judicial elections. See ABA Model Code ofJudicial Conduct, Canon 5(C)(2), Comment (2000) ("[M]erit

The Minnesota Supreme Court's canon of judicial conduct
prohibiting candidates for judicial election from announcing

judicial candidates may say while campaigning, the very
practice of electing judges undermines this interest.

We of course want judges to be impartial, in the sense of
being free from any personal stake in the outcome of the
cases to which they are assigned. But if judges are subject
to regular elections they are likely to feel that they have at

least some personal stake in the outcome of every publicizedcase. Elected judges cannot help being aware that if the

public is not satisfied with the outcome of a particular case,it could hurt their reelection prospects. See Eule, Crocodiles in the Bathtub: State Courts, Voter Initiatives and theThreat of Electoral Reprisal, 65 U. Colo. L. Rev. 733, 739

suppress their awareness of the potential electoral consequences of their decisions and refrain from acting on it, the
public's confidence in the judiciary could be undermined simply by the possibility that judges would be unable to do so.

Moreover, contested elections generally entail campaigning. And campaigning for a judicial post today can require
substantial funds. See Schotland, Financing Judicial Elections, 2000: Change and Challenge, 2001 L. Rev. Mich. State
U. Detroit College of Law 849, 866 (reporting that in 2000,
the 13 candidates in a partisan election for 5 seats on the

their campaigns); American Bar Association, Report and

Court). Unless the pool of judicial candidates is limited to
those wealthy enough to independently fund their campaigns, a limitation unrelated to judicial skill, the cost of

campaigning requires judicial candidates to engage in fund-raising. Yet relying on campaign donations may leave

judges feeling indebted to certain parties or interest groups.See Thomas, National L. J., Mar. 16, 1998, p. A8, col. 1
(reporting that a study by the public interest group Texansfor Public Justice found that 40 percent of the $9,200,000
in contributions of $100 or more raised by seven of Texas'
nine Supreme Court justices for their 1994 and 1996 elec-tions "came from parties and lawyers with cases before

the court or contributors closely linked to these parties").Even if judges were able to refrain from favoring donors,
the mere possibility that judges' decisions may be motivated
by the desire to repay campaign contributors is likely to
undermine the public's confidence in the judiciary. See
Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, Inc., and American
Viewpoint, National Public Opinion Survey Frequency Questionnaire 4 (2001) (available at http://www.justiceatstake.

results indicating that 76 percent of registered voters believe
that campaign contributions influence judicial decisions);

Despite these significant problems, 39 States currently employ some form of judicial elections for their appellate courts,
general jurisdiction trial courts, or both. American Judicature Society, Judicial Selection in the States: Appellate and
General Jurisdiction Courts (Apr. 2002). Judicial elections
were not always so prevalent. The first 29 States of the
Union adopted methods for selecting judges that did not involve popular elections. See Croley, The Majoritarian Dif536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ficulty: Elective Judiciaries and the Rule of Law, 62 U. Chi.L. Rev. 689, 716 (1995). As the Court explains, however,

beginning with Georgia in 1812, States began adopting sys-tems for judicial elections. See

ante, at 785. From the
1830's until the 1850's, as part of the Jacksonian movementtoward greater popular control of public office, this trend accelerated, see Goldschmidt, Merit Selection: Current Status,
Procedures, and Issues, 49 U. Miami L. Rev. 1, 5 (1994), andby the Civil War, 22 of the 34 States elected their judges,

ibid. By the beginning of the 20th century, however,elected judiciaries increasingly came to be viewed as incompetent and corrupt, and criticism of partisan judicial elections mounted. Croley, supra, at 723. In 1906, Roscoe
Pound gave a speech to the American Bar Association in
which he claimed that "compelling judges to become politicians, in many jurisdictions has almost destroyed the traditional respect for the bench." The Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice, 8 Baylor L.
Rev. 1, 23 (1956) (reprinting Pound's speech).

In response to such concerns, some States adopted a modified system of judicial selection that became known as the
Missouri Plan (because Missouri was the first State to adopt
it for most of its judicial posts). See Croley, 62 U. Chi.
L. Rev., at 724. Under the Missouri Plan, judges are appointed by a high elected official, generally from a list of
nominees put together by a nonpartisan nominating commission, and then subsequently stand for unopposed retention
elections in which voters are asked whether the judges
should be recalled. Ibid. If a judge is recalled, the vacancy
is filled through a new nomination and appointment. Ibid.
This system obviously reduces threats to judicial impartiality, even if it does not eliminate all popular pressure on
judges. See Grodin, Developing a Consensus of Constraint:
A Judge's Perspective on Judicial Retention Elections, 61
S. Cal. L. Rev. 1969, 1980 (1988) (admitting that he cannot

in "critical cases" during 1986 were not influenced subcon-sciously by his awareness that the outcomes could affect his

chances in the retention elections being conducted that year).The Missouri Plan is currently used to fill at least some judicial offices in 15 States. Croley, supra, at 725-726; Ameri-can Judicature Society, supra.

Thirty-one States, however, still use popular elections toselect some or all of their appellate and/or general jurisdiction trial court judges, who thereafter run for reelectionperiodically.

Ibid. Of these, slightly more than half usenonpartisan elections, and the rest use partisan elections.

Ibid. Most of the States that do not have any form of judi-cial elections choose judges through executive nomination
and legislative confirmation. See Croley, supra, at 725.Minnesota has chosen to select its judges through contested popular elections instead of through an appointmentsystem or a combined appointment and retention election
system along the lines of the Missouri Plan. In doing sothe State has voluntarily taken on the risks to judicial bias
described above. As a result, the State's claim that it needsto significantly restrict judges' speech in order to protect
judicial impartiality is particularly troubling. If the State
has a problem with judicial impartiality, it is largely one theState brought upon itself by continuing the practice of popularly electing judges.

Justice Kennedy, concurring.
I agree with the Court that Minnesota's prohibition on
judicial candidates' announcing their legal views is an un-constitutional abridgment of the freedom of speech. There

is authority for the Court to apply strict scrutiny analysisto resolve some First Amendment cases, see,

e. g., Simon &
Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.,502 U. S. 105 (1991), and the Court explains in clear and

forceful terms why the Minnesota regulatory scheme fails
that test. So I join its opinion.

Kennedy, J., concurring
I adhere to my view, however, that content-based speechrestrictions that do not fall within any traditional exception

should be invalidated without inquiry into narrow tailoringor compelling government interests. The speech at issue
here does not come within any of the exceptions to the FirstAmendment recognized by the Court. "Here, a law is directed to speech alone where the speech in question is not
obscene, not defamatory, not words tantamount to an act oth-erwise criminal, not an impairment of some other constitutional right, not an incitement to lawless action, and not cal-culated or likely to bring about imminent harm the State
has the substantive power to prevent. No further inquiry
is necessary to reject the State's argument that the statute
should be upheld." Id., at 124 (Kennedy, J., concurring in
judgment). The political speech of candidates is at the heart
of the First Amendment, and direct restrictions on the content of candidate speech are simply beyond the power of government to impose.

Here, Minnesota has sought to justify its speech restriction as one necessary to maintain the integrity of its judiciary. Nothing in the Court's opinion should be read to cast
doubt on the vital importance of this state interest. Courts,
in our system, elaborate principles of law in the course of
resolving disputes. The power and the prerogative of a
court to perform this function rest, in the end, upon the respect accorded to its judgments. The citizen's respect for
judgments depends in turn upon the issuing court's absolute
probity. Judicial integrity is, in consequence, a state interest of the highest order.

Articulated standards of judicial conduct may advance this
interest. See Shepard, Campaign Speech: Restraint and
Liberty in Judicial Ethics, 9 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 1059 (1996).
To comprehend, then to codify, the essence of judicial integrity is a hard task, however. "The work of deciding cases
goes on every day in hundreds of courts throughout the land.
Any judge, one might suppose, would find it easy to describe

the process which he had followed a thousand times andmore. Nothing could be farther from the truth." B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 9 (1921). Much thesame can be said of explicit standards to ensure judicial integrity. To strive for judicial integrity is the work of a life-time. That should not dissuade the profession. The difficulty of the undertaking does not mean we should refrain
from the attempt. Explicit standards of judicial conductprovide essential guidance for judges in the proper discharge

of their duties and the honorable conduct of their office. Thelegislative bodies, judicial committees, and professional associations that promulgate those standards perform a vital
public service. See, e. g., Administrative Office of U. S.
Courts, Code of Judicial Conduct for United States Judges
(1999). Yet these standards may not be used by the State to
abridge the speech of aspiring judges in a judicial campaign.

Minnesota may choose to have an elected judiciary. It
may strive to define those characteristics that exemplify
judicial excellence. It may enshrine its definitions in a code
of judicial conduct. It may adopt recusal standards more
rigorous than due process requires, and censure judges who
violate these standards. What Minnesota may not do, however, is censor what the people hear as they undertake to
decide for themselves which candidate is most likely to be
an exemplary judicial officer. Deciding the relevance of candidate speech is the right of the voters, not the State. See
Brown v. Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 60 (1982). The law in question here contradicts the principle that unabridged speech is
the foundation of political freedom.

The State of Minnesota no doubt was concerned, as many
citizens and thoughtful commentators are concerned, that judicial campaigns in an age of frenetic fundraising and mass
media may foster disrespect for the legal system. Indeed,
from the beginning there have been those who believed that
the rough-and-tumble of politics would bring our governmental institutions into ill repute. And some have sought to

536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Kennedy, J., concurring
cure this tendency with governmental restrictions on politi-cal speech. See Sedition Act of 1798, ch. 74, 1 Stat. 596.

Cooler heads have always recognized, however, that thesemeasures abridge the freedom of speech--not because the
state interest is insufficiently compelling, but simply becausecontent-based restrictions on political speech are " `expressly
and positively forbidden by' " the First Amendment. See
New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 274 (1964)(quoting the Virginia Resolutions of 1798). The State cannot opt for an elected judiciary and then assert that its de-mocracy, in order to work as desired, compels the abridgment of speech.

If Minnesota believes that certain sorts of candidate
speech disclose flaws in the candidate's credentials, democracy and free speech are their own correctives. The legal
profession, the legal academy, the press, voluntary groups,
political and civic leaders, and all interested citizens can use
their own First Amendment freedoms to protest statements
inconsistent with standards of judicial neutrality and judicial
excellence. Indeed, if democracy is to fulfill its promise,
they must do so. They must reach voters who are uninterested or uninformed or blinded by partisanship, and they
must urge upon the voters a higher and better understanding of the judicial function and a stronger commitment to
preserving its finest traditions. Free elections and free
speech are a powerful combination: Together they may advance our understanding of the rule of law and further a
commitment to its precepts.

There is general consensus that the design of the Federal
Constitution, including lifetime tenure and appointment by
nomination and confirmation, has preserved the independence of the Federal Judiciary. In resolving this case, however, we should refrain from criticism of the State's choice to
use open elections to select those persons most likely to
achieve judicial excellence. States are free to choose this
mechanism rather than, say, appointment and confirmation.

By condemning judicial elections across the board, we implicitly condemn countless elected state judges and without
warrant. Many of them, despite the difficulties imposed by
the election system, have discovered in the law the enlightenment, instruction, and inspiration that make them
independent-minded and faithful jurists of real integrity.
We should not, even by inadvertence, "impute to judges a
lack of firmness, wisdom, or honor." Bridges v. California,
314 U. S. 252, 273 (1941).

These considerations serve but to reinforce the conclusion
that Minnesota's regulatory scheme is flawed. By abridging
speech based on its content, Minnesota impeaches its own
system of free and open elections. The State may not regulate the content of candidate speech merely because the
speakers are candidates. This case does not present the
question whether a State may restrict the speech of judges
because they are judges--for example, as part of a code of
judicial conduct; the law at issue here regulates judges only
when and because they are candidates. Whether the rationale of Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School
Dist. 205, Will Cty., 391 U. S. 563, 568 (1968), and Connick v.
Myers, 461 U. S. 138 (1983), could be extended to allow a
general speech restriction on sitting judges--regardless of
whether they are campaigning--in order to promote the
efficient administration of justice, is not an issue raised
here.

Petitioner Gregory Wersal was not a sitting judge but a
challenger; he had not voluntarily entered into an employment relationship with the State or surrendered any
First Amendment rights. His speech may not be controlled
or abridged in this manner. Even the undoubted interest
of the State in the excellence of its judiciary does not

allow it to restrain candidate speech by reason of its content. Minnesota's attempt to regulate campaign speech is
impermissible.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ginsburg has cogentlyexplained why the Court's holding is unsound. I therefore

join her opinion without reservation. I add these commentsto emphasize the force of her arguments and to explain why
I find the Court's reasoning even more troubling than itsholding. The limits of the Court's holding are evident: Even
if the Minnesota Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board(Board) may not sanction a judicial candidate for announcing
his views on issues likely to come before him, it may surely
advise the electorate that such announcements demonstratethe speaker's unfitness for judicial office. If the solution to

harmful speech must be more speech, so be it. The Court'sreasoning, however, will unfortunately endure beyond the
next election cycle. By obscuring the fundamental distinc-tion between campaigns for the judiciary and the political
branches, and by failing to recognize the difference betweenstatements made in articles or opinions and those made on
the campaign trail, the Court defies any sensible notion ofthe judicial office and the importance of impartiality in that
context.The Court's disposition rests on two seriously flawed
premises--an inaccurate appraisal of the importance of judicial independence and impartiality, and an assumption thatjudicial candidates should have the same freedom " `to express themselves on matters of current public importance' "as do all other elected officials.

Ante, at 781-782. Elected
judges, no less than appointed judges, occupy an office oftrust that is fundamentally different from that occupied by

policymaking officials. Although the fact that they muststand for election makes their job more difficult than that of
the tenured judge, that fact does not lessen their duty torespect essential attributes of the judicial office that have
been embedded in Anglo-American law for centuries.

Stevens, J., dissenting
There is a critical difference between the work of thejudge and the work of other public officials. In a democracy,

issues of policy are properly decided by majority vote; it isthe business of legislators and executives to be popular.
But in litigation, issues of law or fact should not be deter-mined by popular vote; it is the business of judges to be
indifferent to unpopularity. Sir Matthew Hale pointedly de-scribed this essential attribute of the judicial office in words
which have retained their integrity for centuries:

" `11. That popular or court applause or distaste haveno influence in anything I do, in point of distribution

of justice.
" `12. Not to be solicitous what men will say or think,so long as I keep myself exactly according to the rule

of justice.' " 1
Consistent with that fundamental attribute of the office,countless judges in countless cases routinely make rulings

that are unpopular and surely disliked by at least 50 percentof the litigants who appear before them. It is equally common for them to enforce rules that they think unwise, orthat are contrary to their personal predilections. For this
reason, opinions that a lawyer may have expressed beforebecoming a judge, or a judicial candidate, do not disqualify
anyone for judicial service because every good judge is fullyaware of the distinction between the law and a personal point
of view. It is equally clear, however, that such expressionsafter a lawyer has been nominated to judicial office shed little, if any, light on his capacity for judicial service. Indeed,to the extent that such statements seek to enhance the popularity of the candidate by indicating how he would rule inspecific cases if elected, they evidence a lack of fitness for
the office.

Of course, any judge who faces reelection may believe thathe retains his office only so long as his decisions are popular.

Nevertheless, the elected judge, like the lifetime appointee,does not serve a constituency while holding that office. He
has a duty to uphold the law and to follow the dictates of theConstitution. If he is not a judge on the highest court in
the State, he has an obligation to follow the precedent of thatcourt, not his personal views or public opinion polls.

may make common law, but judged on the merits of individ-ual cases, not as a mandate from the voters.

By recognizing a conflict between the demands of electoralpolitics and the distinct characteristics of the judiciary, we

2 The Court largely ignores the fact that judicial elections are not limited to races for the highest court in the State. Even if announcing one's
views in the context of a campaign for the State Supreme Court might be
permissible, the same statements are surely less appropriate when one is
running for an intermediate or trial court judgeship. Such statements
not only display a misunderstanding of the judicial role, but also mislead
the voters by giving them the false impression that a candidate for the
trial court will be able to and should decide cases based on his personal
views rather than precedent.

Indeed, the Court's entire analysis has a hypothetical quality to it that
stems, in part, from the fact that no candidate has yet been sanctioned for
violating the announce clause. The one complaint filed against petitioner
Gregory Wersal for campaign materials during his 1996 election run was
dismissed by the Board. App. 16-21. Moreover, when Wersal sought an
advisory opinion during his 1998 campaign, the Board could not evaluate
his request because he had "not specified what statement [he] would make
that may or may not be a view on a disputed, legal or political issue." Id.,
at 32. Since Wersal failed to provide examples of statements he wished
to make, and because the Board had its own doubts about the constitutionality of the announce clause, it advised Wersal that "unless the speech at
issue violates other prohibitions listed in Canon 5 or other portions of the
Code of Judicial Conduct, it is our belief that this section is not, as written,
constitutionally enforceable." Ibid. Consequently, the Court is left to
decide a question of great constitutional importance in a case in which
either the petitioner's statements were not subject to the prohibition in
question, or he neglected to supply any concrete examples of statements
he wished to make, and the Board refused to enforce the prohibition because of its own constitutional concerns.

do not have to put States to an all or nothing choice of aban-doning judicial elections or having elections in which anything goes. As a practical matter, we cannot know for surewhether an elected judge's decisions are based on his interpretation of the law or political expediency. In the absenceof reliable evidence one way or the other, a State may reasonably presume that elected judges are motivated by the
highest aspirations of their office. But we do know that ajudicial candidate, who announces his views in the context of

a campaign, is effectively telling the electorate: "Vote for mebecause I believe X, and I will judge cases accordingly."
Once elected, he may feel free to disregard his campaign
statements, ante, at 780-781, but that does not change the
fact that the judge announced his position on an issue likely
to come before him as a reason to vote for him. Minnesota
has a compelling interest in sanctioning such statements.

A candidate for judicial office who goes beyond the expression of "general observation about the law . . . in order to
obtain favorable consideration" of his candidacy, Laird v.
Tatum, 409 U. S. 824, 836, n. 5 (1972) (memorandum of Rehnquist, J., on motion for recusal), demonstrates either a lack
of impartiality or a lack of understanding of the importance
of maintaining public confidence in the impartiality of the
judiciary. It is only by failing to recognize the distinction,
clearly stated by then-Justice Rehnquist, between statements made during a campaign or confirmation hearing and
those made before announcing one's candidacy, that the
Court is able to conclude: "[S]ince avoiding judicial preconceptions on legal issues is neither possible nor desirable, pretending otherwise by attempting to preserve the `appearance' of that type of impartiality can hardly be a compelling
state interest either," ante, at 778.

Even when "impartiality" is defined in its narrowest sense
to embrace only "the lack of bias for or against either party
to the proceeding," ante, at 775, the announce clause serves
that interest. Expressions that stress a candidate's unbro536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ken record of affirming convictions for rape,3 for example,imply a bias in favor of a particular litigant (the prosecutor)

and against a class of litigants (defendants in rape cases).Contrary to the Court's reasoning in its first attempt to define impartiality, ante, at 775-776, an interpretation of theannounce clause that prohibits such statements serves the
State's interest in maintaining both the appearance of thisform of impartiality and its actuality.

When the Court evaluates the importance of impartialityin its broadest sense, which it describes as "the interest in
openmindedness, or at least in the appearance of openmind-edness,"

ante, at 778, it concludes that the announce clauseis "so woefully underinclusive as to render belief in that

purpose a challenge to the credulous," ante, at 780. It isunderinclusive, in the Court's view, because campaign statements are an infinitesimal portion of the public commitmentsto legal positions that candidates make during their professional careers. It is not, however, the number of legal viewsthat a candidate may have formed or discussed in his prior
career that is significant. Rather, it is the ability bothto reevaluate them in the light of an adversarial presentation, and to apply the governing rule of law even wheninconsistent with those views, that characterize judicial
openmindedness.The Court boldly asserts that respondents have failed to
carry their burden of demonstrating "that campaign state-ments are uniquely destructive of openmindedness,"

ante,at 781. But the very purpose of most statements prohibited

by the announce clause is to convey the message that thecandidate's mind is not open on a particular issue. The lawyer who writes an article advocating harsher penalties forpolluters surely does not commit to that position to the
same degree as the candidate who says "vote for me becauseI believe all polluters deserve harsher penalties." At the

very least, such statements obscure the appearance of open-mindedness. More importantly, like the reasoning in the

Court's opinion, they create the false impression that thestandards for the election of political candidates apply
equally to candidates for judicial office.4The Court seems to have forgotten its prior evaluation of
the importance of maintaining public confidence in the "disinterestedness" of the judiciary. Commenting on the dangerthat participation by judges in a political assignment might

erode that public confidence, we wrote: "While the problemof individual bias is usually cured through recusal, no such
mechanism can overcome the appearance of institutional
partiality that may arise from judiciary involvement in the
making of policy. The legitimacy of the Judicial Branch
ultimately depends on its reputation for impartiality and
nonpartisanship. That reputation may not be borrowed by
the political Branches to cloak their work in the neutral
colors of judicial action." Mistretta v. United States, 488
U. S. 361, 407 (1989).

Conversely, the judicial reputation for impartiality and
openmindedness is compromised by electioneering that emphasizes the candidate's personal predilections rather than
his qualifications for judicial office. As an elected judge recently noted:

"Informed criticism of court rulings, or of the professional or personal conduct of judges, should play an

could say "vote for me because I promise to never reverse a rape conviction," and the Board could do nothing to formally sanction that candidate.
The unwisdom of this proposal illustrates why the same standards should
not apply to speech in campaigns for judicial and legislative office.

A judiciary capable of performing this function, owingfidelity to no person or party, is a "longstanding AngloAmerican tradition," United States v. Will, 449 U. S. 200, 217
(1980), an essential bulwark of constitutional government, a
constant guardian of the rule of law. The guarantee of an
independent, impartial judiciary enables society to "withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and
officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts." West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette,
319 U. S. 624, 638 (1943). "Without this, all the reservations
of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing."
The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).

The ability of the judiciary to discharge its unique role
rests to a large degree on the manner in which judges are
selected. The Framers of the Federal Constitution sought
to advance the judicial function through the structural protections of Article III, which provide for the selection of
judges by the President on the advice and consent of the
Senate, generally for lifetime terms. Through its own Constitution, Minnesota, in common with most other States, has
decided to allow its citizens to choose judges directly in periodic elections. But Minnesota has not thereby opted to install a corps of political actors on the bench; rather, it has
endeavored to preserve the integrity of its judiciary by other
means. Recognizing that the influence of political parties is
incompatible with the judge's role, for example, Minnesota

has designated all judicial elections nonpartisan. See Pe-terson v. Stafford, 490 N. W. 2d 418, 425 (Minn. 1992). And

it has adopted a provision, here called the Announce Clause,designed to prevent candidates for judicial office from "publicly making known how they would decide issues likely tocome before them as judges." Republican Party of Minn.
v. Kelly, 247 F. 3d 854, 881-882 (CA8 2001).The question this case presents is whether the First
Amendment stops Minnesota from furthering its interestin judicial integrity through this precisely targeted speech
restriction. I

The speech restriction must fail, in the Court's view, be-cause an electoral process is at stake; if Minnesota opts to
elect its judges, the Court asserts, the State may not rein inwhat candidates may say. See

ante, at 781 (notion that"right to speak out on disputed issues" may be abridged in

an election context "sets our First Amendment jurispru-dence on its head"); ante, at 787-788 (power to dispense with
elections does not include power to curtail candidate speechif State leaves election process in place); 247 F. 3d, at 897
(Beam, J., dissenting) ("[W]hen a state opts to hold an elec-tion, it must commit itself to a complete election, replete with
free speech and association."); id., at 903 (same).I do not agree with this unilocular, "an election is an election," approach. Instead, I would differentiate elections forpolitical offices, in which the First Amendment holds full
sway, from elections designed to select those whose office itis to administer justice without respect to persons. Minnesota's choice to elect its judges, I am persuaded, does notpreclude the State from installing an election process geared
to the judicial office.Legislative and executive officials serve in representative
capacities. They are agents of the people; their primaryfunction is to advance the interests of their constituencies.
Candidates for political offices, in keeping with their repre536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
806 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINN. v. WHITE

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
sentative role, must be left free to inform the electorate oftheir positions on specific issues. Armed with such information, the individual voter will be equipped to cast her ballotintelligently, to vote for the candidate committed to positions
the voter approves. Campaign statements committing thecandidate to take sides on contentious issues are therefore
not only appropriate in political elections; they are "at the
core of our electoral process," Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S.23, 32 (1968), for they "enhance the accountability of government officials to the people whom they represent," Brown v.
Hartlage, 456 U. S. 45, 55 (1982).

Judges, however, are not political actors. They do not sit
as representatives of particular persons, communities, or
parties; they serve no faction or constituency. "[I]t is the
business of judges to be indifferent to popularity." Chisom,
501 U. S., at 401, n. 29 (internal quotation marks omitted).
They must strive to do what is legally right, all the more
so when the result is not the one "the home crowd" wants.
Rehnquist, Dedicatory Address: Act Well Your Part: Therein
All Honor Lies, 7 Pepperdine L. Rev. 227, 229-300 (1980).
Even when they develop common law or give concrete meaning to constitutional text, judges act only in the context of
individual cases, the outcome of which cannot depend on the
will of the public. See Barnette, 319 U. S., at 638 ("One's
right to life, liberty, and property, to free speech, a free
press, freedom of worship and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be submitted to vote; they depend on
the outcome of no elections.").

Thus, the rationale underlying unconstrained speech in
elections for political office--that representative government
depends on the public's ability to choose agents who will act
at its behest--does not carry over to campaigns for the
bench. As to persons aiming to occupy the seat of judgment, the Court's unrelenting reliance on decisions involving
contests for legislative and executive posts is manifestly out
of place. E. g., ante, at 781-782 (quoting Wood v. Georgia,

370 U. S. 375, 395 (1962) ("The role that elected officials playin our society makes it all the more imperative that they be

allowed freely to express themselves on matters of currentpublic importance." (Emphasis added.))). See O'Neil, The
Canons in the Courts: Recent First Amendment Rulings, 35Ind. L. Rev. 701, 717 (2002) (reliance on cases involving nonjudicial campaigns, particularly Brown v. Hartlage, is "griev-ously misplaced"; "[h]ow any thoughtful judge could derive
from that ruling any possible guidance for cases that involvejudicial campaign speech seems baffling"). In view of the
magisterial role judges must fill in a system of justice, a rolethat removes them from the partisan fray, States may limit
judicial campaign speech by measures impermissible in elec-tions for political office. See

Buckley v. Illinois JudicialInquiry Bd., 997 F. 2d 224, 228 (CA7 1993) ("Mode of appointment is only one factor that enables distinctions to be madeamong different kinds of public official. Judges remain different from legislators and executive officials, even when allare elected, in ways that bear on the strength of the state's
interest in restricting their freedom of speech.").The Court sees in this conclusion, and in the Announce
Clause that embraces it, "an obvious tension," ante, at 787:The Minnesota electorate is permitted to select its judges by
popular vote, but is not provided information on "subjects ofinterest to the voters,"

ibid.--in particular, the voters arenot told how the candidate would decide controversial cases

or issues if elected. This supposed tension, however, restson the false premise that by departing from the federal
model with respect to who chooses judges, Minnesota neces-sarily departed from the federal position on the criteria relevant to the exercise of that choice.1

1 In the context of the federal system, how a prospective nominee for
the bench would resolve particular contentious issues would certainly be
"of interest" to the President and the Senate in the exercise of their respective nomination and confirmation powers, just as information of that
type would "interest" a Minnesota voter. But in accord with a longstand536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
808 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINN. v. WHITE

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
The Minnesota Supreme Court thought otherwise:

"The methods by which the federal system and otherstates initially select and then elect or retain judges are

varied, yet the explicit or implicit goal of the constitu-tional provisions and enabling legislation is the same: to
create and maintain an independent judiciary as freefrom political, economic and social pressure as possible
so judges can decide cases without those influences."
Peterson, 490 N. W. 2d, at 420.

Nothing in the Court's opinion convincingly explains whyMinnesota may not pursue that goal in the manner it did.

Minnesota did not choose a judicial selection system withall the trappings of legislative and executive races. While
providing for public participation, it tailored judicial selec-tion to fit the character of third branch office holding. See
id., at 425 (Minnesota's system "keep[s] the ultimate choicewith the voters while, at the same time, recognizing the
unique independent nature of the judicial function."). Thebalance the State sought to achieve--allowing the people to
elect judges, but safeguarding the process so that the integ-rity of the judiciary would not be compromised--should ening norm, every Member of this Court declined to furnish such information
to the Senate, and presumably to the President as well. See Brief for
Respondents 17-42 (collecting statements at Senate confirmation hearings). Surely the Court perceives no tension here; the line each of us
drew in response to preconfirmation questioning, the Court would no
doubt agree, is crucial to the health of the Federal Judiciary. But by the
Court's reasoning, the reticence of prospective and current federal judicial
nominees dishonors Article II, for it deprives the President and the Senate
of information that might aid or advance the decision to nominate or confirm. The point is not, of course, that this "practice of voluntarily demurring" by itself "establish[es] the legitimacy of legal compulsion to demur,"
ante, at 783-784, n. 11 (emphasis deleted). The federal norm simply illustrates that, contrary to the Court's suggestion, there is nothing inherently
incongruous in depriving those charged with choosing judges of certain
information they might desire during the selection process.

counter no First Amendment shoal. See generally O'Neil,
supra, at 715-723.

II

Proper resolution of this case requires correction of the
Court's distorted construction of the provision before us for
review. According to the Court, the Announce Clause "prohibits a judicial candidate from stating his views on any specific nonfanciful legal question within the province of the
court for which he is running, except in the context of discussing past decisions--and in the latter context as well, if
he expresses the view that he is not bound by stare decisis."
Ante, at 773. In two key respects, that construction misrepresents the meaning of the Announce Clause as interpreted
by the Eighth Circuit and embraced by the Minnesota Supreme Court, In re Code of Judicial Conduct, 639 N. W. 2d
55 (2002), which has the final word on this matter, see Hortonville Joint School Dist. No. 1 v. Hortonville Ed. Assn.,
426 U. S. 482, 488 (1976) ("We are, of course, bound to accept
the interpretation of [the State's] law by the highest court of
the State.").

First and most important, the Court ignores a crucial limiting construction placed on the Announce Clause by the
courts below. The provision does not bar a candidate from
generally "stating [her] views" on legal questions, ante, at
773; it prevents her from "publicly making known how [she]
would decide" disputed issues, 247 F. 3d, at 881-882 (emphasis added). That limitation places beyond the scope of the
Announce Clause a wide range of comments that may be
highly informative to voters. Consistent with the Eighth
Circuit's construction, such comments may include, for example, statements of historical fact ("As a prosecutor, I obtained 15 drunk driving convictions"); qualified statements
("Judges should use sparingly their discretion to grant lenient sentences to drunk drivers"); and statements framed

536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN
810 REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MINN. v. WHITE

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
at a sufficient level of generality ("Drunk drivers are a threatto the safety of every driver"). What remains within the

Announce Clause is the category of statements that essen-tially commit the candidate to a position on a specific issue,
such as "I think all drunk drivers should receive the maxi-mum sentence permitted by law." See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45
(candidate may not say " `I'm going to decide this particular
issue this way in the future' ").Second, the Court misportrays the scope of the Clause as

applied to a candidate's discussion of past decisions. Citingan apparent concession by respondents at argument,

id., at
33-34, the Court concludes that "statements critical of past
judicial decisions are not permissible if the candidate also
states that he is against stare decisis," ante, at 772 (emphasis
deleted). That conclusion, however, draws no force from the
meaning attributed to the Announce Clause by the Eighth
Circuit. In line with the Minnesota Board on Judicial
Standards, the Court of Appeals stated without qualification
that the Clause "does not prohibit candidates from discussing
appellate court decisions." 247 F. 3d, at 882 (citing Minn.
Bd. on Judicial Standards, Informal Opinion, Oct. 10, 1990,
App. 55 ("In all election contests, a candidate for judicial office may discuss decisions and opinions of the Appellate
courts.")). The Eighth Circuit's controlling construction
should not be modified by respondents' on the spot answers
to fast-paced hypothetical questions at oral argument.
Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 170 (1972) ("We
are loath to attach conclusive weight to the relatively spontaneous responses of counsel to equally spontaneous questioning from the Court during oral argument.").

The Announce Clause is thus more tightly bounded, and
campaigns conducted under that provision more robust, than
the Court acknowledges. Judicial candidates in Minnesota
may not only convey general information about themselves,
see ante, at 774, they may also describe their conception of
the role of a judge and their views on a wide range of sub536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

jects of interest to the voters. See App. 97-103; Brief forMinnesota State Bar Association as

Amicus Curiae 22-23
(e. g., the criteria for deciding whether to depart from sen-tencing guidelines, the remedies for racial and gender bias,

and the balance between "free speech rights [and] the needto control [hate crimes]" (internal quotation marks omitted)).
Further, they may discuss, criticize, or defend past decisions
of interest to voters. What candidates may not do--simplyor with sophistication--is remove themselves from the constraints characteristic of the judicial office and declare howthey would decide an issue, without regard to the particular
context in which it is presented, sans briefs, oral argument,
and, as to an appellate bench, the benefit of one's colleagues'
analyses. Properly construed, the Announce Clause prohibits only a discrete subcategory of the statements the Court's
misinterpretation encompasses.

The Court's characterization of the Announce Clause as
"election-nullifying," ante, at 782, "plac[ing] most subjects
of interest to the voters off limits," ante, at 787, is further
belied by the facts of this case. In his 1996 bid for office,
petitioner Gregory Wersal distributed literature sharply
criticizing three Minnesota Supreme Court decisions. Of
the court's holding in the first case--that certain unrecorded
confessions must be suppressed--Wersal asked, "Should we
conclude that because the Supreme Court does not trust police, it allows confessed criminals to go free?" App. 37. Of
the second case, invalidating a state welfare law, Wersal
stated: "The Court should have deferred to the Legislature.
It's the Legislature which should set our spending policies."
Ibid. And of the third case, a decision involving abortion
rights, Wersal charged that the court's holding was "directly
contrary to the opinion of the U. S. Supreme Court," "unprecedented," and a "pro-abortion stance." Id., at 38.

When a complaint was filed against Wersal on the basis
of those statements, id., at 12-15, the Lawyers Professional
Responsibility Board concluded that no discipline was war536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
ranted, in part because it thought the disputed campaign ma-terials did not violate the Announce Clause, id., at 20-21.

And when, at the outset of his 1998 campaign, Wersal soughtto avoid the possibility of sanction for future statements, he
pursued the option, available to all Minnesota judicial can-didates, Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13, of requesting an advisory
opinion concerning the application of the Announce Clause.App. 24-26. In response to that request, the Board indicated that it did not anticipate any adverse action againsthim.

Id., at 31-33.2 Wersal has thus never been sanc-tioned under the Announce Clause for any campaign statement he made. On the facts before us, in sum, the AnnounceClause has hardly stifled the robust communication of ideas
and views from judicial candidate to voter.

III
Even as it exaggerates the reach of the Announce Clause,the Court ignores the significance of that provision to the

integrated system of judicial campaign regulation Minnesotahas developed. Coupled with the Announce Clause in Minnesota's Code of Judicial Conduct is a provision that prohib-its candidates from "mak[ing] pledges or promises of conduct
in office other than the faithful and impartial performance ofthe duties of the office." Minn. Code of Judicial Conduct,
Canon 5(A)(3)(d)(i) (2002). Although the Court is correctthat this "pledges or promises" provision is not directly at
issue in this case, see ante, at 770, the Court errs in overlook-ing the interdependence of that prohibition and the one before us. In my view, the constitutionality of the Announce

2 In deciding not to sanction Wersal for his campaign statements, and
again in responding to his inquiry about the application of the Announce
Clause, the Board expressed "doubts about the constitutionality of the
current Minnesota Canon." App. 20; id., at 32. Those doubts, however,
concerned the meaning of the Announce Clause before the Eighth Circuit
applied, and the Minnesota Supreme Court adopted, the limiting constructions that now define that provision's scope.

Clause cannot be resolved without an examination of thatinteraction in light of the interests the pledges or promises

provision serves. A

All parties to this case agree that, whatever the validity ofthe Announce Clause, the State may constitutionally prohibit
judicial candidates from pledging or promising certain re-sults. See Brief for Petitioners Republican Party of Minnesota et al. 36-37; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-16 (petitioners' acknowl-edgment that candidates may be barred from making a
"pledge or promise of an outcome"); Brief for Respondents11; see also Brief for Brennan Center for Justice et al. as
Amici Curiae 23 ("All of the parties and amici in this caseagree that judges should not make explicit promises or commitments to decide particular cases in a particular manner.").The reasons for this agreement are apparent. Pledges or
promises of conduct in office, however commonplace in racesfor the political branches, are inconsistent "with the judge's
obligation to decide cases in accordance with his or her role."Tr. of Oral Arg. 16; see Brief for Petitioners Republican
Party of Minnesota et al. 36 ("[B]ecause [ judges] have a dutyto decide a case on the basis of the law and facts before them,
they can be prohibited, as candidates, from making suchpromises."). This judicial obligation to avoid prejudgment
corresponds to the litigant's right, protected by the DueProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to "an impartial and disinterested tribunal in both civil and criminalcases," Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., 446 U. S. 238, 242 (1980).
The proscription against pledges or promises thus representsan accommodation of "constitutionally protected interests
[that] lie on both sides of the legal equation." Nixon v.Shrink Missouri Government PAC, 528 U. S. 377, 400 (2000)
(Breyer, J., concurring). Balanced against the candidate'sinterest in free expression is the litigant's "powerful and independent constitutional interest in fair adjudicative proce-dure."

Marshall, 446 U. S., at 243; see Buckley, 997 F. 2d,

at 227 ("Two principles are in conflict and must, to the extentpossible, be reconciled. . . . The roots of both principles lie

deep in our constitutional heritage.").The impartiality guaranteed to litigants through the Due
Process Clause adheres to a core principle: "[N]o man is per-mitted to try cases where he has an interest in the outcome."
In re Murchison, 349 U. S. 133, 136 (1955). Our cases have
"jealously guarded" that basic concept, for it "ensur[es] thatno person will be deprived of his interests in the absence of

a proceeding in which he may present his case with assur-ance that the arbiter is not predisposed to find against him."
Marshall, 446 U. S., at 242.

Applying this principle in Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510
(1927), we held that due process was violated where a judge
received a portion of the fines collected from defendants
whom he found guilty. Such an arrangement, we said, gave
the judge a "direct, personal, substantial[, and] pecuniary interest" in reaching a particular outcome and thereby denied
the defendant his right to an impartial arbiter. Id., at 523.
Ward v. Monroeville, 409 U. S. 57 (1972), extended Tumey's
reasoning, holding that due process was similarly violated
where fines collected from guilty defendants constituted a
large part of a village's finances, for which the judge, who
also served as the village mayor, was responsible. Even
though the mayor did not personally share in those fines, we
concluded, he "perforce occupie[d] two practically and seriously inconsistent positions, one partisan and the other judicial." 409 U. S., at 60 (internal quotation marks omitted).

We applied the principle of Tumey and Ward most recently
in Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U. S. 813 (1986). That
decision invalidated a ruling of the Alabama Supreme Court
written by a justice who had a personal interest in the resolution of a dispositive issue. The Alabama Supreme Court's
ruling was issued while the justice was pursuing a separate
lawsuit in an Alabama lower court, and its outcome "had the
clear and immediate effect of enhancing both the legal status

and the settlement value" of that separate suit. Id., at 824.As in Ward and Tumey, we held, the justice therefore had

an interest in the outcome of the decision that unsuited himto participate in the judgment. 475 U. S., at 824. It mattered not whether the justice was actually influenced by thisinterest; "[t]he Due Process Clause," we observed, "may
sometimes bar trial by judges who have no actual bias andwho would do their very best to weigh the scales of justice
equally between contending parties." Id., at 825 (internalquotation marks omitted).

These cases establish three propositions important to thisdispute. First, a litigant is deprived of due process where
the judge who hears his case has a "direct, personal, substan-tial, and pecuniary" interest in ruling against him.

Id., at824 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Second, this interest need not be as direct as it was in Tumey,where the judge was essentially compensated for each conviction he obtained; the interest may stem, as in Ward, fromthe judge's knowledge that his success and tenure in office
depend on certain outcomes. "[T]he test," we have said, "iswhether the . . . situation is one `which would offer a possible
temptation to the average man as a judge [that] might leadhim not to hold the balance nice, clear and true.' "

Ward,409 U. S., at 60 (quoting Tumey, 273 U. S., at 532). And

third, due process does not require a showing that the judgeis actually biased as a result of his self-interest. Rather, our
cases have "always endeavored to prevent even the proba-bility of unfairness." In re Murchison, 349 U. S., at 136.
"[T]he requirement of due process of law in judicial proce-dure is not satisfied by the argument that men of the highest
honor and the greatest self-sacrifice could carry it on withoutdanger of injustice."

Tumey, 273 U. S., at 532.3

3 To avoid the import of our due process decisions, the Court dissects
the concept of judicial "impartiality," ante, at 775-779, concluding that
only one variant of that concept--lack of prejudice against a party--is
secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, ante, at 775-777. Our Due Proc536US2 Unit: $U82 [12-17-03 18:46:53] PAGES PGT: OPIN

The justification for the pledges or promises prohibitionfollows from these principles. When a judicial candidate

promises to rule a certain way on an issue that may laterreach the courts, the potential for due process violations is
grave and manifest. If successful in her bid for office, thejudicial candidate will become a judge, and in that capacity
she will be under pressure to resist the pleas of litigants whoadvance positions contrary to her pledges on the campaign
trail. If the judge fails to honor her campaign promises, shewill not only face abandonment by supporters of her professed views; she will also "ris[k] being assailed as a dissem-bler," 247 F. 3d, at 878, willing to say one thing to win an
election and to do the opposite once in office.A judge in this position therefore may be thought to have
a "direct, personal, substantial, [and] pecuniary interest" inruling against certain litigants,

Tumey, 273 U. S., at 523, forshe may be voted off the bench and thereby lose her salary

and emoluments unless she honors the pledge that securedher election. See Shepard, Campaign Speech: Restraint and
Liberty in Judicial Ethics, 9 Geo. J. Legal Ethics 1059, 1083-1092 (1996); see

id., at 1088 ("[A] campaign promise [may becharacterized as] a bribe offered to voters, paid with rulings

consistent with that promise, in return for continued employess Clause cases do not focus solely on bias against a particular party, but
rather inquire more broadly into whether the surrounding circumstances
and incentives compromise the judge's ability faithfully to discharge her
assigned duties. See supra, at 815. To be sure, due process violations
may arise where a judge has been so personally "enmeshed in matters"
concerning one party that he is biased against him. See Johnson v. Mississippi, 403 U. S. 212, 215 (1971) (per curiam) (judge had been
"a defendant in one of petitioner's civil rights suits and a losing party at
that"). They may also arise, however, not because of any predisposition
toward a party, but rather because of the judge's personal interest in resolving an issue a certain way. See Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Lavoie, 475
U. S. 813 (1986). Due process will not countenance the latter situation,
even though the self-interested judge "will apply the law to [the losing
party] in the same way he [would apply] it to any other party" advancing
the same position, ante, at 776.

ment as a judge."); see also The Federalist No. 79, p. 472(C. Rossiter ed. 1961) ("In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a powerover his will." (emphasis deleted)).

Given this grave danger to litigants from judicial campaignpromises, States are justified in barring expression of such
commitments, for they typify the "situatio[n] . . . in which
experience teaches that the probability of actual bias on thepart of the judge . . . is too high to be constitutionally tolerable." Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 47 (1975). By re-moving this source of "possible temptation" for a judge to
rule on the basis of self-interest, Tumey, 273 U. S., at 532,
the pledges or promises prohibition furthers the State's
"compellin[g] interest in maintaining a judiciary fully capable
of performing" its appointed task, Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501
U. S. 452, 472 (1991): "judging [each] particular controversy
fairly on the basis of its own circumstances," United States
v. Morgan, 313 U. S. 409, 421 (1941). See O'Neil, 35 Ind. L.
Rev., at 723 ("What is at stake here is no less than the promise of fairness, impartiality, and ultimately of due process for
those whose lives and fortunes depend upon judges being
selected by means that are not fully subject to the vagaries
of American politics.").

In addition to protecting litigants' due process rights, the

clause advances another compelling state interest: preserving the public's confidence in the integrity and impartiality

Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 407 (1989) ("Thelegitimacy of the Judicial Branch ultimately depends on its
reputation for impartiality and nonpartisanship."). As theMinnesota Supreme Court has recognized, all legal systems--regardless of their method of judicial selection--"canfunction only so long as the public, having confidence in the
integrity of its judges, accepts and abides by judicial deci-sions."

Complaint Concerning Winton, 350 N. W. 2d 337,340 (1984).

Prohibiting a judicial candidate from pledging or promis-ing certain results if elected directly promotes the State's
interest in preserving public faith in the bench. When acandidate makes such a promise during a campaign, the public will no doubt perceive that she is doing so in the hope ofgarnering votes. And the public will in turn likely conclude
that when the candidate decides an issue in accord with thatpromise, she does so at least in part to discharge her undertaking to the voters in the previous election and to preventvoter abandonment in the next. The perception of that unseemly quid pro quo--a judicial candidate's promises onissues in return for the electorate's votes at the polls--inevitably diminishes the public's faith in the ability of judgesto administer the law without regard to personal or political self-interest.4 Then-Justice Rehnquist's observations

4 The author of the Court's opinion declined on precisely these grounds
to tell the Senate whether he would overrule a particular case:
"Let us assume that I have people arguing before me to do it or not to do
it. I think it is quite a thing to be arguing to somebody who you know
has made a representation in the course of his confirmation hearings, and
that is, by way of condition to his being confirmed, that he will do this or
do that. I think I would be in a very bad position to adjudicate the case
without being accused of having a less than impartial view of the matter."

about the federal system apply with equal if not greaterforce in the context of Minnesota's elective judiciary: Regarding the appearance of judicial integrity,

"[one must] distinguish quite sharply between a publicstatement made prior to nomination for the bench, on

the one hand, and a public statement made by a nomineeto the bench. For the latter to express any but the
most general observation about the law would suggestthat, in order to obtain favorable consideration of his
nomination, he deliberately was announcing in advance,without benefit of judicial oath, briefs, or argument, how
he would decide a particular question that might comebefore him as a judge." Laird v. Tatum, 409 U. S. 824,
836, n. 5 (1972) (memorandum opinion).

B
The constitutionality of the pledges or promises clause isthus amply supported; the provision not only advances due

process of law for litigants in Minnesota courts, it also re-inforces the authority of the Minnesota judiciary by promoting public confidence in the State's judges. The AnnounceClause, however, is equally vital to achieving these compelling ends, for without it, the pledges or promises provisionwould be feeble, an arid form, a matter of no real importance.

Uncoupled from the Announce Clause, the ban on pledgesor promises is easily circumvented. By prefacing a campaign commitment with the caveat, "although I cannot prom-ise anything," or by simply avoiding the language of promises or pledges altogether, a candidate could declare withimpunity how she would decide specific issues. Semantic
sanitizing of the candidate's commitment would not, however,diminish its pernicious effects on actual and perceived judicial impartiality. To use the Court's example, a candidate

who campaigns by saying, "If elected, I will vote to upholdthe legislature's power to prohibit same-sex marriages,"

ante, at 780, will feel scarcely more pressure to honor thatstatement than the candidate who stands behind a podium
and tells a throng of cheering supporters: "I think it is con-stitutional for the legislature to prohibit same-sex marriages," ante, at 779. Made during a campaign, both state-ments contemplate a

quid pro quo between candidate andvoter. Both effectively "bind [the candidate] to maintain

that position after election." Ante, at 770. And both con-vey the impression of a candidate prejudging an issue to win
votes. Contrary to the Court's assertion, the "nonpromis-sory" statement averts none of the dangers posed by the
"promissory" one. See ante, at 780-781 (emphasis deleted).By targeting statements that do not technically constitute
pledges or promises but nevertheless "publicly mak[e] knownhow [the candidate] would decide" legal issues, 247 F. 3d, at
881-882, the Announce Clause prevents this end run aroundthe letter and spirit of its companion provision.

5 No less

than the pledges or promises clause itself, the Announce

5 In the absence of the Announce Clause, other components of the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct designed to maintain the nonpartisan character of the State's judicial elections would similarly unravel. A candidate would have no need to "attend political gatherings" or "make
speeches on behalf of a political organization," Minn. Code of Judical Conduct, Canon 5(A)(1)(c), (d) (2002), for she could simply state her views
elsewhere, counting on her supporters to carry those views to the party
faithful. And although candidates would remain barred from "seek[ing],
accept[ing,] or us[ing] endorsements from a political organization," Canon
5(A)(1)(d), parties might well provide such endorsements unsolicited upon
hearing candidates' views on specific issues. Cf. ante, at 770 (Minnesota
Republican Party sought to learn Wersal's views so party could support
or oppose his candidacy). Those unsolicited endorsements, in turn, would
render ineffective the prohibition against candidates "identify[ing] themselves as members of a political organization," Canon 5(A)(1)(a). "Indeed,
it is not too much to say that the entire fabric of Minnesota's non[p]artisan
elections hangs by the Announce clause thread." Brief for Minnesota

Clause is an indispensable part of Minnesota's effort to main-tain the health of its judiciary, and is therefore constitutional

for the same reasons. * * *

This Court has recognized in the past, as Justice O'Connor does today, see ante, at 788-790 (concurring opinion), a"fundamental tension between the ideal character of the judicial office and the real world of electoral politics," Chisom,501 U. S., at 400. We have no warrant to resolve that tension, however, by forcing States to choose one pole or theother. Judges are not politicians, and the First Amendment
does not require that they be treated as politicians simplybecause they are chosen by popular vote. Nor does the
First Amendment command States that wish to promote theintegrity of their judges in fact and appearance to abandon
systems of judicial selection that the people, in the exerciseof their sovereign prerogatives, have devised.

For more than three-quarters of a century, States like Min-nesota have endeavored, through experiment tested by experience, to balance the constitutional interests in judicial in-tegrity and free expression within the unique setting of an
elected judiciary. P. McFadden, Electing Justice: The Lawand Ethics of Judicial Election Campaigns 86 (1990); Brief

BOARD OF EDUCATION OF INDEPENDENT SCHOOLDISTRICT NO. 92 OF POTTAWATOMIE

COUNTY et al. v. EARLS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 01-332. Argued March 19, 2002--Decided June 27, 2002
The Student Activities Drug Testing Policy (Policy) adopted by the Tecumseh, Oklahoma, School District (School District) requires all middle
and high school students to consent to urinalysis testing for drugs in
order to participate in any extracurricular activity. In practice, the
Policy has been applied only to competitive extracurricular activities
sanctioned by the Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activities Association
(OSSAA). Respondent high school students and their parents brought
this 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 action for equitable relief, alleging that the Policy
violates the Fourth Amendment. Applying Vernonia School Dist. 47J
v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, in which this Court upheld the suspicionless
drug testing of school athletes, the District Court granted the School
District summary judgment. The Tenth Circuit reversed, holding that
the Policy violated the Fourth Amendment. It concluded that before
imposing a suspicionless drug testing program a school must demonstrate some identifiable drug abuse problem among a sufficient number
of those tested, such that testing that group will actually redress its
drug problem. The court then held that the School District had failed
to demonstrate such a problem among Tecumseh students participating
in competitive extracurricular activities.

Held: Tecumseh's Policy is a reasonable means of furthering the School

District's important interest in preventing and deterring drug use
among its schoolchildren and does not violate the Fourth Amendment.
Pp. 828-838.

(a) Because searches by public school officials implicate Fourth
Amendment interests, see, e. g., Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 652, the Court
must review the Policy for "reasonableness," the touchstone of constitutionality. In contrast to the criminal context, a probable-cause finding
is unnecessary in the public school context because it would unduly interfere with maintenance of the swift and informal disciplinary procedures that are needed. In the public school context, a search may be
reasonable when supported by "special needs" beyond the normal need
for law enforcement. Because the "reasonableness" inquiry cannot dis536US2 Unit: $U83 [01-14-04 18:49:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
regard the schools' custodial and tutelary responsibility for children, id.,
at 656, a finding of individualized suspicion may not be necessary. In
upholding the suspicionless drug testing of athletes, the Vernonia Court
conducted a fact-specific balancing of the intrusion on the children's
Fourth Amendment rights against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests. Applying Vernonia's principles to the somewhat different facts of this case demonstrates that Tecumseh's Policy is also
constitutional. Pp. 828-830.

(b) Considering first the nature of the privacy interest allegedly compromised by the drug testing, see Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 654, the Court
concludes that the students affected by this Policy have a limited expectation of privacy. Respondents argue that because children participating in nonathletic extracurricular activities are not subject to regular
physicals and communal undress they have a stronger expectation of
privacy than the Vernonia athletes. This distinction, however, was not
essential in Vernonia, which depended primarily upon the school's custodial responsibility and authority. See, e. g., id., at 665. In any event,
students who participate in competitive extracurricular activities voluntarily subject themselves to many of the same intrusions on their privacy as do athletes. Some of these clubs and activities require occasional off-campus travel and communal undress, and all of them have
their own rules and requirements that do not apply to the student body
as a whole. Each of them must abide by OSSAA rules, and a faculty
sponsor monitors students for compliance with the various rules dictated by the clubs and activities. Such regulation further diminishes
the schoolchildren's expectation of privacy. Pp. 830-832.

(c) Considering next the character of the intrusion imposed by the
Policy, see Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 658, the Court concludes that the
invasion of students' privacy is not significant, given the minimally
intrusive nature of the sample collection and the limited uses to which
the test results are put. The degree of intrusion caused by collecting
a urine sample depends upon the manner in which production of the
sample is monitored. Under the Policy, a faculty monitor waits outside
the closed restroom stall for the student to produce a sample and must
listen for the normal sounds of urination to guard against tampered
specimens and ensure an accurate chain of custody. This procedure is
virtually identical to the "negligible" intrusion approved in Vernonia,
ibid. The Policy clearly requires that test results be kept in confidential files separate from a student's other records and released to school
personnel only on a "need to know" basis. Moreover, the test results
are not turned over to any law enforcement authority. Nor do the test

results lead to the imposition of discipline or have any academic consequences. Rather, the only consequence of a failed drug test is to limit
the student's privilege of participating in extracurricular activities.
Pp. 832-834.

(d) Finally, considering the nature and immediacy of the government's concerns and the efficacy of the Policy in meeting them, see Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 660, the Court concludes that the Policy effectively
serves the School District's interest in protecting its students' safety
and health. Preventing drug use by schoolchildren is an important governmental concern. See id., at 661-662. The health and safety risks
identified in Vernonia apply with equal force to Tecumseh's children.
The School District has also presented specific evidence of drug use
at Tecumseh schools. Teachers testified that they saw students who
appeared to be under the influence of drugs and heard students speaking
openly about using drugs. A drug dog found marijuana near the school
parking lot. Police found drugs or drug paraphernalia in a car driven
by an extracurricular club member. And the school board president
reported that people in the community were calling the board to discuss
the "drug situation." Respondents consider the proffered evidence insufficient and argue that there is no real and immediate interest to justify a policy of drug testing nonathletes. But a demonstrated drug
abuse problem is not always necessary to the validity of a testing regime, even though some showing of a problem does shore up an assertion of a special need for a suspicionless general search program.
Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305, 319. The School District has provided sufficient evidence to shore up its program. Furthermore, this
Court has not required a particularized or pervasive drug problem before allowing the government to conduct suspicionless drug testing.
See, e. g., Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 673-674.
The need to prevent and deter the substantial harm of childhood drug
use provides the necessary immediacy for a school testing policy. Given
the nationwide epidemic of drug use, and the evidence of increased drug
use in Tecumseh schools, it was entirely reasonable for the School District to enact this particular drug testing policy. Pp. 834-838.

Opinion of the Court

I
The city of Tecumseh, Oklahoma, is a rural community lo-cated approximately 40 miles southeast of Oklahoma City.

The School District administers all Tecumseh public schools.In the fall of 1998, the School District adopted the Student
Activities Drug Testing Policy (Policy), which requires allmiddle and high school students to consent to drug testing
in order to participate in any extracurricular activity. In
practice, the Policy has been applied only to competitive ex-tracurricular activities sanctioned by the Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activities Association, such as the AcademicTeam, Future Farmers of America, Future Homemakers of
America, band, choir, pom pon, cheerleading, and athletics.
Under the Policy, students are required to take a drug testbefore participating in an extracurricular activity, must submit to random drug testing while participating in that activ-ity, and must agree to be tested at any time upon reasonable
suspicion. The urinalysis tests are designed to detect onlythe use of illegal drugs, including amphetamines, marijuana,
cocaine, opiates, and barbituates, not medical conditions orthe presence of authorized prescription medications.

At the time of their suit, both respondents attendedTecumseh High School. Respondent Lindsay Earls was a
member of the show choir, the marching band, the Academic
Team, and the National Honor Society. Respondent DanielJames sought to participate in the Academic Team.

1 Together with their parents, Earls and James brought a Rev.

1 The District Court noted that the School District's allegations concerning Daniel James called his standing to sue into question because his failing grades made him ineligible to participate in any interscholastic competition. See 115 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1282, n. 1 (WD Okla. 2000). The court
noted, however, that the dispute need not be resolved because Lindsay
Earls had standing, and therefore the court was required to address the
constitutionality of the drug testing policy. See ibid. Because we are
likewise satisfied that Earls has standing, we need not address whether
James also has standing.

to their participation in extracurricular activities.2 They al-leged that the Policy violates the Fourth Amendment as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment and requested in-junctive and declarative relief. They also argued that the
School District failed to identify a special need for testingstudents who participate in extracurricular activities, and
that the "Drug Testing Policy neither addresses a provenproblem nor promises to bring any benefit to students or the
school." App. 9.Applying the principles articulated in

Vernonia SchoolDist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646 (1995), in which we upheld

the suspicionless drug testing of school athletes, the UnitedStates District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma
rejected respondents' claim that the Policy was unconstitu-tional and granted summary judgment to the School District.
The court noted that "special needs" exist in the publicschool context and that, although the School District did "not
show a drug problem of epidemic proportions," there was ahistory of drug abuse starting in 1970 that presented "legitimate cause for concern." 115 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1287 (2000).The District Court also held that the Policy was effective
because "[i]t can scarcely be disputed that the drug problemamong the student body is effectively addressed by making
sure that the large number of students participating in com-petitive, extracurricular activities do not use drugs."

Id.,at 1295.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuitreversed, holding that the Policy violated the Fourth Amendment. The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Courtthat the Policy must be evaluated in the "unique environment of the school setting," but reached a different conclu2 The respondents did not challenge the Policy either as it applies to
athletes or as it provides for drug testing upon reasonable, individualized
suspicion. See App. 28.

sion as to the Policy's constitutionality. 242 F. 3d 1264, 1270(2001). Before imposing a suspicionless drug testing program, the Court of Appeals concluded that a school "mustdemonstrate that there is some identifiable drug abuse problem among a sufficient number of those subject to the testing,such that testing that group of students will actually redress
its drug problem." Id., at 1278. The Court of Appeals thenheld that because the School District failed to demonstrate
such a problem existed among Tecumseh students partici-pating in competitive extracurricular activities, the Policy
was unconstitutional. We granted certiorari, 534 U. S. 1015(2001), and now reverse.

II
The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitutionprotects "[t]he right of the people to be secure in their

persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonablesearches and seizures." Searches by public school officials,
such as the collection of urine samples, implicate FourthAmendment interests. See Vernonia, supra, at 652; cf. New
Jersey v. T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 334 (1985). We must there-fore review the School District's Policy for "reasonableness,"
which is the touchstone of the constitutionality of a govern-mental search.

In the criminal context, reasonableness usually requires ashowing of probable cause. See,

e. g., Skinner v. RailwayLabor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 619 (1989). The

probable-cause standard, however, "is peculiarly related tocriminal investigations" and may be unsuited to determining
the reasonableness of administrative searches where the"Government seeks to prevent the development of hazardous
conditions." Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S.656, 667-668 (1989) (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted) (collecting cases). The Court has also held that awarrant and finding of probable cause are unnecessary in
the public school context because such requirements " `wouldunduly interfere with the maintenance of the swift and infor536US2 Unit: $U83 [01-14-04 18:49:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
mal disciplinary procedures [that are] needed.' " Vernonia,
supra, at 653 (quoting T. L. O., supra, at 340-341).

Given that the School District's Policy is not in any wayrelated to the conduct of criminal investigati ons, see

Part II-B, infra, respondents do not contend that the SchoolDistrict requires probable cause before testing students for
drug use. Respondents instead argue that drug testing
must be based at least on some level of individualized suspi-cion. See Brief for Respondents 12-14. It is true that we

generally determine the reasonableness of a search by bal-ancing the nature of the intrusion on the individual's privacy
against the promotion of legitimate governmental interests.
See Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 654 (1979). But we
have long held that "the Fourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of [individualized] suspicion." United
States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543, 561 (1976). "[I]n
certain limited circumstances, the Government's need to discover such latent or hidden conditions, or to prevent their
development, is sufficiently compelling to justify the intrusion on privacy entailed by conducting such searches without
any measure of individualized suspicion." Von Raab, supra,
at 668; see also Skinner, supra, at 624. Therefore, in the
context of safety and administrative regulations, a search unsupported by probable cause may be reasonable "when `special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement,
make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable.' " Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U. S. 868, 873 (1987)
(quoting T. L. O., supra, at 351 (Blackmun, J., concurring
in judgment)); see also Vernonia, supra, at 653; Skinner,
supra, at 619.

Significantly, this Court has previously held that "special
needs" inhere in the public school context. See Vernonia,
supra, at 653; T. L. O., supra, at 339-340. While schoolchildren do not shed their constitutional rights when they enter
the schoolhouse, see Tinker v. Des Moines Independent
Community School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 506 (1969), "Fourth

Opinion of the Court

Amendment rights . . . are different in public schools than
elsewhere; the `reasonableness' inquiry cannot disregard the
schools' custodial and tutelary responsibility for children."
Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 656. In particular, a finding of individualized suspicion may not be necessary when a school conducts drug testing.

In Vernonia, this Court held that the suspicionless drug
testing of athletes was constitutional. The Court, however,
did not simply authorize all school drug testing, but rather
conducted a fact-specific balancing of the intrusion on the
children's Fourth Amendment rights against the promotion
of legitimate governmental interests. See id., at 652-653.
Applying the principles of Vernonia to the somewhat different facts of this case, we conclude that Tecumseh's Policy is
also constitutional.

A

We first consider the nature of the privacy interest allegedly compromised by the drug testing. See id., at 654. As
in Vernonia, the context of the public school environment
serves as the backdrop for the analysis of the privacy interest at stake and the reasonableness of the drug testing policy
in general. See ibid. ("Central . . . is the fact that the subjects of the Policy are (1) children, who (2) have been committed to the temporary custody of the State as schoolmaster"); see also id., at 665 ("The most significant element in
this case is the first we discussed: that the Policy was undertaken in furtherance of the government's responsibilities,
under a public school system, as guardian and tutor of children entrusted to its care"); ibid. ("[W]hen the government
acts as guardian and tutor the relevant question is whether
the search is one that a reasonable guardian and tutor
might undertake").

A student's privacy interest is limited in a public school
environment where the State is responsible for maintaining
discipline, health, and safety. Schoolchildren are routinely
required to submit to physical examinations and vaccinations

Opinion of the Court
against disease. See id., at 656. Securing order in theschool environment sometimes requires that students be subjected to greater controls than those appropriate for adults.See T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 350 (Powell, J., concurring) ("Without first establishing discipline and maintaining order, teach-ers cannot begin to educate their students. And apart from
education, the school has the obligation to protect pupilsfrom mistreatment by other children, and also to protect
teachers themselves from violence by the few studentswhose conduct in recent years has prompted national
concern").Respondents argue that because children participating in
nonathletic extracurricular activities are not subject to regu-lar physicals and communal undress, they have a stronger
expectation of privacy than the athletes tested in Vernonia.See Brief for Respondents 18-20. This distinction, however, was not essential to our decision in Vernonia, whichdepended primarily upon the school's custodial responsibility
and authority.3In any event, students who participate in competitive
extracurricular activities voluntarily subject themselves tomany of the same intrusions on their privacy as do athletes.

3 Justice Ginsburg argues that Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,
515 U. S. 646 (1995), depended on the fact that the drug testing program
applied only to student athletes. But even the passage cited by the dissent manifests the supplemental nature of this factor, as the Court in
Vernonia stated that "[l]egitimate privacy expectations are even less with
regard to student athletes." See post, at 847 (quoting Vernonia, 515
U. S., at 657) (emphasis added). In upholding the drug testing program
in Vernonia, we considered the school context "[c]entral" and "[t]he most
significant element." Id., at 654, 665. This hefty weight on the side of
the school's balance applies with similar force in this case even though we
undertake a separate balancing with regard to this particular program.

4 Justice Ginsburg's observations with regard to extracurricular activities apply with equal force to athletics. See post, at 845 ("Participation in such [extracurricular] activities is a key component of school life,
essential in reality for students applying to college, and, for all participants, a significant contributor to the breadth and quality of the educational experience").

NO. 92 OF POTTAWATOMIE CTY. v. EARLS

Opinion of the Court

Some of these clubs and activities require occasional off-campus travel and communal undress. All of them have

their own rules and requirements for participating studentsthat do not apply to the student body as a whole. 115
F. Supp. 2d, at 1289-1290. For example, each of the compet-itive extracurricular activities governed by the Policy must
abide by the rules of the Oklahoma Secondary Schools Activ-ities Association, and a faculty sponsor monitors the students
for compliance with the various rules dictated by the clubsand activities. See

id., at 1290. This regulation of extra-curricular activities further diminishes the expectation of

privacy among schoolchildren. Cf. Vernonia, supra, at 657("Somewhat like adults who choose to participate in a closely
regulated industry, students who voluntarily participate inschool athletics have reason to expect intrusions upon normal rights and privileges, including privacy" (internal quota-tion marks omitted)). We therefore conclude that the students affected by this Policy have a limited expectation ofprivacy.

B
Next, we consider the character of the intrusion imposedby the Policy. See

Vernonia, supra, at 658. Urination is"an excretory function traditionally shielded by great privacy." Skinner, 489 U. S., at 626. But the "degree of intru-sion" on one's privacy caused by collecting a urine sample
"depends upon the manner in which production of the urinesample is monitored."

Vernonia, supra, at 658.Under the Policy, a faculty monitor waits outside the

closed restroom stall for the student to produce a sample andmust "listen for the normal sounds of urination in order to
guard against tampered specimens and to insure an accuratechain of custody." App. 199. The monitor then pours the
sample into two bottles that are sealed and placed into amailing pouch along with a consent form signed by the student. This procedure is virtually identical to that reviewedin

Vernonia, except that it additionally protects privacy by

536US2 Unit: $U83 [01-14-04 18:49:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

833Cite as: 536 U. S. 822 (2002)
Opinion of the Court
allowing male students to produce their samples behind aclosed stall. Given that we considered the method of collection in Vernonia a "negligible" intrusion, 515 U. S., at 658,the method here is even less problematic.

In addition, the Policy clearly requires that the test resultsbe kept in confidential files separate from a student's other
educational records and released to school personnel only on
a "need to know" basis. Respondents nonetheless contendthat the intrusion on students' privacy is significant because

the Policy fails to protect effectively against the disclosureof confidential information and, specifically, that the school
"has been careless in protecting that information: for example, the Choir teacher looked at students' prescription drug
lists and left them where other students could see them."
Brief for Respondents 24. But the choir teacher is someone
with a "need to know," because during off-campus trips she
needs to know what medications are taken by her students.
Even before the Policy was enacted the choir teacher had
access to this information. See App. 132. In any event,
there is no allegation that any other student did see such
information. This one example of alleged carelessness
hardly increases the character of the intrusion.

Moreover, the test results are not turned over to any law
enforcement authority. Nor do the test results here lead to
the imposition of discipline or have any academic consequences. Cf. Vernonia, supra, at 658, and n. 2. Rather, the
only consequence of a failed drug test is to limit the student's
privilege of participating in extracurricular activities. Indeed, a student may test positive for drugs twice and still be
allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. After
the first positive test, the school contacts the student's parent or guardian for a meeting. The student may continue to
participate in the activity if within five days of the meeting
the student shows proof of receiving drug counseling and
submits to a second drug test in two weeks. For the second
positive test, the student is suspended from participation in

Opinion of the Court

all extracurricular activities for 14 days, must complete fourhours of substance abuse counseling, and must submit to

monthly drug tests. Only after a third positive test will thestudent be suspended from participating in any extracurricular activity for the remainder of the school year, or 88 schooldays, whichever is longer. See App. 201-202.

Given the minimally intrusive nature of the sample collec-tion and the limited uses to which the test results are put,
we conclude that the invasion of students' privacy is notsignificant.

C
Finally, this Court must consider the nature and immedi-acy of the government's concerns and the efficacy of the Policy in meeting them. See Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 660. ThisCourt has already articulated in detail the importance of the
governmental concern in preventing drug use by schoolchil-dren. See id., at 661-662. The drug abuse problem among
our Nation's youth has hardly abated since Vernonia wasdecided in 1995. In fact, evidence suggests that it has only
grown worse.5 As in Vernonia, "the necessity for the Stateto act is magnified by the fact that this evil is being visited
not just upon individuals at large, but upon children forwhom it has undertaken a special responsibility of care and
direction." Id., at 662. The health and safety risks identi-fied in

Vernonia apply with equal force to Tecumseh's chil-dren. Indeed, the nationwide drug epidemic makes the war

against drugs a pressing concern in every school.Additionally, the School District in this case has presented
specific evidence of drug use at Tecumseh schools. Teacherstestified that they had seen students who appeared to be

5 For instance, the number of 12th graders using any illicit drug increased from 48.4 percent in 1995 to 53.9 percent in 2001. The number of
12th graders reporting they had used marijuana jumped from 41.7 percent
to 49.0 percent during that same period. See Department of Health and
Human Services, Monitoring the Future: National Results on Adolescent
Drug Use, Overview of Key Findings (2001) (Table 1).

under the influence of drugs and that they had heard stu-dents speaking openly about using drugs. See,

e. g., App. 72
(deposition of Dean Rogers); id., at 115 (deposition of SheilaEvans). A drug dog found marijuana cigarettes near the

school parking lot. Police officers once found drugs or drugparaphernalia in a car driven by a Future Farmers of
America member. And the school board president reported
that people in the community were calling the board to dis-cuss the "drug situation." See 115 F. Supp. 2d, at 1285-

1286. We decline to second-guess the finding of the DistrictCourt that "[v]iewing the evidence as a whole, it cannot be
reasonably disputed that the [School District] was faced with
a `drug problem' when it adopted the Policy." Id., at 1287.

Respondents consider the proffered evidence insufficient
and argue that there is no "real and immediate interest" to
justify a policy of drug testing nonathletes. Brief for Respondents 32. We have recognized, however, that "[a] demonstrated problem of drug abuse . . . [is] not in all cases
necessary to the validity of a testing regime," but that some
showing does "shore up an assertion of special need for a
suspicionless general search program." Chandler v. Miller,
520 U. S. 305, 319 (1997). The School District has provided
sufficient evidence to shore up the need for its drug testing
program.

Furthermore, this Court has not required a particularized
or pervasive drug problem before allowing the government
to conduct suspicionless drug testing. For instance, in Von
Raab the Court upheld the drug testing of customs officials
on a purely preventive basis, without any documented history of drug use by such officials. See 489 U. S., at 673. In
response to the lack of evidence relating to drug use, the
Court noted generally that "drug abuse is one of the most
serious problems confronting our society today," and that
programs to prevent and detect drug use among customs
officials could not be deemed unreasonable. Id., at 674;
cf. Skinner, 489 U. S., at 607, and n. 1 (noting nationwide

Opinion of the Court

studies that identified on-the-job alcohol and drug use byrailroad employees). Likewise, the need to prevent and

deter the substantial harm of childhood drug use providesthe necessary immediacy for a school testing policy. Indeed,
it would make little sense to require a school district to waitfor a substantial portion of its students to begin using drugs
before it was allowed to institute a drug testing program
designed to deter drug use.Given the nationwide epidemic of drug use, and the evidence of increased drug use in Tecumseh schools, it was en-tirely reasonable for the School District to enact this particular drug testing policy. We reject the Court of Appeals'
novel test that "any district seeking to impose a random suspicionless drug testing policy as a condition to participation
in a school activity must demonstrate that there is some
identifiable drug abuse problem among a sufficient number
of those subject to the testing, such that testing that group
of students will actually redress its drug problem." 242
F. 3d, at 1278. Among other problems, it would be difficult
to administer such a test. As we cannot articulate a threshold level of drug use that would suffice to justify a drug testing program for schoolchildren, we refuse to fashion what
would in effect be a constitutional quantum of drug use necessary to show a "drug problem."

Respondents also argue that the testing of nonathletes
does not implicate any safety concerns, and that safety is
a "crucial factor" in applying the special needs framework.
Brief for Respondents 25-27. They contend that there must
be "surpassing safety interests," Skinner, supra, at 634, or
"extraordinary safety and national security hazards," Von
Raab, supra, at 674, in order to override the usual protections of the Fourth Amendment. See Brief for Respondents
25-26. Respondents are correct that safety factors into the
special needs analysis, but the safety interest furthered by
drug testing is undoubtedly substantial for all children, athletes and nonathletes alike. We know all too well that drug

Opinion of the Court
use carries a variety of health risks for children, includingdeath from overdose.

We also reject respondents' argument that drug testingmust presumptively be based upon an individualized reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing because such a testing regimewould be less intrusive. See

id., at 12-16. In this context,
the Fourth Amendment does not require a finding of individualized suspicion, see supra, at 829, and we decline to imposesuch a requirement on schools attempting to prevent and detect drug use by students. Moreover, we question whethertesting based on individualized suspicion in fact would be
less intrusive. Such a regime would place an additional burden on public school teachers who are already tasked with
the difficult job of maintaining order and discipline. A program of individualized suspicion might unfairly target members of unpopular groups. The fear of lawsuits resulting
from such targeted searches may chill enforcement of the
program, rendering it ineffective in combating drug use.
See Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 663-664 (offering similar reasons
for why "testing based on `suspicion' of drug use would not
be better, but worse"). In any case, this Court has repeatedly stated that reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment does not require employing the least intrusive means,
because " [t]he log ic of such elaborate less-restrictivealternative arguments could raise insuperable barriers to
the exercise of virtually all search-and-seizure powers."
Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S., at 556-557, n. 12; see also Skinner, supra, at 624 ("[A] showing of individualized suspicion
is not a constitutional floor, below which a search must be
presumed unreasonable").

Finally, we find that testing students who participate in
extracurricular activities is a reasonably effective means of
addressing the School District's legitimate concerns in preventing, deterring, and detecting drug use. While in Vernonia there might have been a closer fit between the testing
of athletes and the trial court's finding that the drug problem

was "fueled by the `role model' effect of athletes' drug use,"such a finding was not essential to the holding. 515 U. S., at
663; cf. id., at 684-685 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (question-ing the extent of the drug problem, especially as applied to
athletes). Vernonia did not require the school to test thegroup of students most likely to use drugs, but rather considered the constitutionality of the program in the context ofthe public school's custodial responsibilities. Evaluating the
Policy in this context, we conclude that the drug testing ofTecumseh students who participate in extracurricular activities effectively serves the School District's interest in pro-tecting the safety and health of its students.

III
Within the limits of the Fourth Amendment, local schoolboards must assess the desirability of drug testing schoolchildren. In upholding the constitutionality of the Policy,we express no opinion as to its wisdom. Rather, we hold
only that Tecumseh's Policy is a reasonable means of further-ing the School District's important interest in preventing and
deterring drug use among its schoolchildren. Accordingly,we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

It is so ordered.
Justice Breyer, concurring.
I agree with the Court that Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.Acton, 515 U. S. 646 (1995), governs this case and requires

reversal of the Tenth Circuit's decision. The school's drugtesting program addresses a serious national problem by focusing upon demand, avoiding the use of criminal or discipli-nary sanctions, and relying upon professional counseling and
treatment. See App. 201-202. In my view, this programdoes not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of "unreasonable searches and seizures." I reach this conclusionprimarily for the reasons given by the Court, but I would

Breyer, J., concurring
emphasize several underlying considerations, which I under-stand to be consistent with the Court's opinion.

I
In respect to the school's need for the drug testing pro-gram, I would emphasize the following: First, the drug problem in our Nation's schools is serious in terms of size, thekinds of drugs being used, and the consequences of that use
both for our children and the rest of us. See, e. g., WhiteHouse Nat. Drug Control Strategy 25 (Feb. 2002) (drug
abuse leads annually to about 20,000 deaths, $160 billion ineconomic costs); Department of Health and Human Services,
L. Johnston et al., Monitoring the Future: National Resultson Adolescent Drug Use, Overview of Key Findings 5 (2001)
(Monitoring the Future) (more than one-third of all studentshave used illegal drugs before completing the eighth grade;
more than half before completing high school); ibid. (about30% of all students use drugs

other than marijuana prior tocompleting high school (emphasis added)); National Center

on Addiction and Substance Abuse, Malignant Neglect: Sub-stance Abuse and America's Schools 15 (Sept. 2001) (Malignant Neglect) (early use leads to later drug dependence);Nat. Drug Control Strategy, supra, at 1 (same).

Second, the government's emphasis upon supply side inter-diction apparently has not reduced teenage use in recent
years. Compare R. Perl, CRS Issue Brief for Congress,Drug Control: International Policy and Options CRS-1 (Dec.
12, 2001) (supply side programs account for 66% of the fed-eral drug control budget), with Partnership for a Drug-Free
America, 2001 Partnership Attitude Tracking Study: KeyFindings 1 (showing increase in teenage drug use in early
1990's, peak in 1997, holding steady thereafter); 2000-2001PRIDE National Summary: Alcohol, Tobacco, Illicit Drugs,

Breyer, J., concurring
2000-2001); Monitoring the Future, Table 1 (lifetime preva-lence of drug use increasing over last 10 years).

Third, public school systems must find effective ways todeal with this problem. Today's public expects its schools
not simply to teach the fundamentals, but "to shoulder theburden of feeding students breakfast and lunch, offering before and after school child care services, and providing medical and psychological services," all in a school environmentthat is safe and encourages learning. Brief for National

School Boards Association et al. as Amici Curiae 3-4. Seealso

Bethel School Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U. S. 675, 681
(1986) (Schools " `prepare pupils for citizenship in the Republic [and] inculcate the habits and manners of civility as values
in themselves conductive to happiness and as indispensable
to the practice of self-government in the community and the
nation' ") (quoting C. Beard & M. Beard, New Basic History
of the United States 228 (1968)). The law itself recognizes
these responsibilities with the phrase in loco parentis--a
phrase that draws its legal force primarily from the needs of
younger students (who here are necessarily grouped together with older high school students) and which reflects,
not that a child or adolescent lacks an interest in privacy, but
that a child's or adolescent's school-related privacy interest,
when compared to the privacy interests of an adult, has different dimensions. Cf. Vernonia, supra, at 654-655. A
public school system that fails adequately to carry out its
responsibilities may well see parents send their children to
private or parochial school instead--with help from the
State. See Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, ante, p. 639.

Fourth, the program at issue here seeks to discourage demand for drugs by changing the school's environment in
order to combat the single most important factor leading
schoolchildren to take drugs, namely, peer pressure. Malignant Neglect 4 (students "whose friends use illicit drugs are
more than 10 times likelier to use illicit drugs than those
whose friends do not"). It offers the adolescent a nonthreat536US2 Unit: $U83 [01-14-04 18:49:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., concurring
ening reason to decline his friend's drug-use invitations,namely, that he intends to play baseball, participate in debate, join the band, or engage in any one of half a dozenuseful, interesting, and important activities.

II
In respect to the privacy-related burden that the drugtesting program imposes upon students, I would emphasize

the following: First, not everyone would agree with thisCourt's characterization of the privacy-related significance
of urine sampling as " `negligible.' " Ante, at 833 (quoting
Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 658). Some find the procedure nomore intrusive than a routine medical examination, but others are seriously embarrassed by the need to provide a urinesample with someone listening "outside the closed restroom
stall," ante, at 832. When trying to resolve this kind ofclose question involving the interpretation of constitutional
values, I believe it important that the school board providedan opportunity for the airing of these differences at public
meetings designed to give the entire community "the oppor-tunity to be able to participate" in developing the drug policy. App. 87. The board used this democratic, participa-tory process to uncover and to resolve differences, giving
weight to the fact that the process, in this instance, revealedlittle, if any, objection to the proposed testing program.

Second, the testing program avoids subjecting the entireschool to testing. And it preserves an option for a conscientious objector. He can refuse testing while paying a price(nonparticipation) that is serious, but less severe than expulsion from the school.Third, a contrary reading of the Constitution, as requiring
"individualized suspicion" in this public school context, couldwell lead schools to push the boundaries of "individualized
suspicion" to its outer limits, using subjective criteria thatmay "unfairly target members of unpopular groups,"

ante,at 837, or leave those whose behavior is slightly abnormal

stigmatized in the minds of others. See Belsky, Random vs.Suspicion-Based Drug Testing in the Public Schools--A Surprising Civil Liberties Dilemma, 27 Okla. City U. L. Rev.1, 20-21 (forthcoming 2002) (listing court-approved factors
justifying suspicion-based drug testing, including tiredness,overactivity, quietness, boisterousness, sloppiness, excessive
meticulousness, and tardiness). If so, direct application ofthe Fourth Amendment's prohibition against "unreasonable
searches and seizures" will further that Amendment'sliberty-protecting objectives at least to the same extent as
application of the mediating "individualized suspicion" test,where, as here, the testing program is neither criminal nor
disciplinary in nature.

* * *
I cannot know whether the school's drug testing programwill work. But, in my view, the Constitution does not

prohibit the effort. Emphasizing the considerations I havementioned, along with others to which the Court refers,
I conclude that the school's drug testing program, constitu-tionally speaking, is not "unreasonable." And I join the
Court's opinion.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Souter joins,dissenting.

I dissented in Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515U. S. 646 (1995), and continue to believe that case was
wrongly decided. Because Vernonia is now this Court'sprecedent, and because I agree that petitioners' program
fails even under the balancing approach adopted in that case,I join

Justice Ginsburg's dissent.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Souter join, dissenting.

Seven years ago, in Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,515 U. S. 646 (1995), this Court determined that a school

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
district's policy of randomly testing the urine of its studentathletes for illicit drugs did not violate the Fourth Amendment. In so ruling, the Court emphasized that drug use"increase[d] the risk of sports-related injury" and that Vernonia's athletes were the "leaders" of an aggressive local"drug culture" that had reached " `epidemic proportions.' "
Id., at 649. Today, the Court relies upon Vernonia to permita school district with a drug problem its superintendent
repeatedly described as "not . . . major," see App. 180, 186,191, to test the urine of an academic team member solely
by reason of her participation in a nonathletic, competitiveextracurricular activity--participation associated with neither special dangers from, nor particular predilections for,drug use.

"[T]he legality of a search of a student," this Court hasinstructed, "should depend simply on the reasonableness,
under all the circumstances, of the search." New Jersey v.
T. L. O., 469 U. S. 325, 341 (1985). Although " `special needs'inhere in the public school context," see

ante, at 829 (quotingVernonia, 515 U. S., at 653), those needs are not so expansive

or malleable as to render reasonable any program of studentdrug testing a school district elects to install. The particular testing program upheld today is not reasonable; it iscapricious, even perverse: Petitioners' policy targets for testing a student population least likely to be at risk from illicitdrugs and their damaging effects. I therefore dissent.

text." 515 U. S., at 653 (quoting Griffin, 483 U. S., at 873).The Court observed:

"[W]hile children assuredly do not `shed their constitu-tional rights . . . at the schoolhouse gate,'

Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U. S.503, 506 (1969), the nature of those rights is what is appropriate for children in school. . . . Fourth Amendmentrights, no less than First and Fourteenth Amendment
rights, are different in public schools than elsewhere; the`reasonableness' inquiry cannot disregard the schools'
custodial and tutelary responsibility for children." 515U. S., at 655-656 (other citations omitted).

The Vernonia Court concluded that a public school districtfacing a disruptive and explosive drug abuse problem
sparked by members of its athletic teams had "special needs"that justified suspicionless testing of district athletes as a
condition of their athletic participation.This case presents circumstances dispositively different
from those of Vernonia. True, as the Court stresses, Te-cumseh students participating in competitive extracurricular
activities other than athletics share two relevant characteristics with the athletes of Vernonia. First, both groupsattend public schools. "[O]ur decision in

Vernonia," the
Court states, "depended primarily upon the school's custodialresponsibility and authority."

Ante, at 831; see also ante,
at 840 (Breyer, J., concurring) (school districts act in loco
parentis). Concern for student health and safety is basic to
the school's caretaking, and it is undeniable that "drug usecarries a variety of health risks for children, including death

from overdose." Ante, at 836-837 (majority opinion).

Those risks, however, are present for all schoolchildren.
Vernonia cannot be read to endorse invasive and suspicionless drug testing of all students upon any evidence of drug
use, solely because drugs jeopardize the life and health of
those who use them. Many children, like many adults, en536US2 Unit: $U83 [01-14-04 18:49:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

845Cite as: 536 U. S. 822 (2002)
Ginsburg, J., dissenting
gage in dangerous activities on their own time; that the chil-dren are enrolled in school scarcely allows government to

monitor all such activities. If a student has a reasonablesubjective expectation of privacy in the personal items she
brings to school, see T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 338-339, surelyshe has a similar expectation regarding the chemical composition of her urine. Had the Vernonia Court agreed that
public school attendance, in and of itself, permitted the Stateto test each student's blood or urine for drugs, the opinion

in Vernonia could have saved many words. See, e. g., 515U. S., at 662 ("[I]t must not be lost sight of that [the Vernonia
School District] program is directed . . . to drug use by school
athletes, where the risk of immediate physical harm to the
drug user or those with whom he is playing his sport is particularly high.").

The second commonality to which the Court points is the
voluntary character of both interscholastic athletics and
other competitive extracurricular activities. "By choosing
to `go out for the team,' [school athletes] voluntarily subject
themselves to a degree of regulation even higher than that
imposed on students generally." Id., at 657. Comparably,
the Court today observes, "students who participate in competitive extracurricular activities voluntarily subject themselves to" additional rules not applicable to other students.
Ante, at 831.

The comparison is enlightening. While extracurricular
activities are "voluntary" in the sense that they are not required for graduation, they are part of the school's educational program; for that reason, the petitioner (hereinafter
School District) is justified in expending public resources to

"volunteer" for extracurricular pursuits in the same waythey might volunteer for honors classes: They subject themselves to additional requirements, but they do so in order totake full advantage of the education offered them. Cf.

Lee
v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 595 (1992) ("Attendance may notbe required by official decree, yet it is apparent that a student is not free to absent herself from the graduation exercise in any real sense of the term `voluntary,' for absencewould require forfeiture of those intangible benefits which

have motivated the student through youth and all her highschool years.").

Voluntary participation in athletics has a distinctly different dimension: Schools regulate student athletes discretely
because competitive school sports by their nature require
communal undress and, more important, expose students to
physical risks that schools have a duty to mitigate. For the
very reason that schools cannot offer a program of competitive athletics without intimately affecting the privacy of students, Vernonia reasonably analogized school athletes to
"adults who choose to participate in a closely regulated industry." 515 U. S., at 657 (internal quotation marks omitted). Industries fall within the closely regulated category
when the nature of their activities requires substantial government oversight. See, e. g., United States v. Biswell, 406
U. S. 311, 315-316 (1972). Interscholastic athletics similarly
require close safety and health regulation; a school's choir,
band, and academic team do not.

In short, Vernonia applied, it did not repudiate, the principle that "the legality of a search of a student should depend
simply on the reasonableness, under all the circumstances,
of the search." T. L. O., 469 U. S., at 341 (emphasis added).
Enrollment in a public school, and election to participate in
school activities beyond the bare minimum that the curriculum requires, are indeed factors relevant to reasonableness,
but they do not on their own justify intrusive, suspicionless
searches. Vernonia, accordingly, did not rest upon these

factors; instead, the Court performed what today's majorityaptly describes as a "fact-specific balancing," ante, at 830.

Balancing of that order, applied to the facts now before theCourt, should yield a result other than the one the Court
announces today. B

Vernonia initially considered "the nature of the privacyinterest upon which the search [there] at issue intrude[d]."
515 U. S., at 654. The Court emphasized that studentathletes' expectations of privacy are necessarily attenuated:

"Legitimate privacy expectations are even less with re-gard to student athletes. School sports are not for the
bashful. They require `suiting up' before each practiceor event, and showering and changing afterwards.
Public school locker rooms, the usual sites for theseactivities, are not notable for the privacy they afford.
The locker rooms in Vernonia are typical: No individualdressing rooms are provided; shower heads are lined up
along a wall, unseparated by any sort of partition orcurtain; not even all the toilet stalls have doors. . . .
[T]here is an element of communal undress inherent inathletic participation."

Id., at 657 (internal quotationmarks omitted).

Competitive extracurricular activities other than athletics,however, serve students of all manner: the modest and shy
along with the bold and uninhibited. Activities of the kindplaintiff-respondent Lindsay Earls pursued--choir, show
choir, marching band, and academic team--afford opportuni-ties to gain self-assurance, to "come to know faculty members in a less formal setting than the typical classroom," andto acquire "positive social supports and networks [that] play
a critical role in periods of heightened stress." Brief forAmerican Academy of Pediatrics et al. as Amici Curiae 13.

communal bathrooms." 242 F. 3d 1264, 1275 (CA10 2001).But those situations are hardly equivalent to the routine

communal undress associated with athletics; the School Dis-trict itself admits that when such trips occur, "public-like
restroom facilities," which presumably include enclosedstalls, are ordinarily available for changing, and that "more
modest students" find other ways to maintain their privacy.Brief for Petitioners 34.

After describing school athletes' reduced expectation ofprivacy, the

Vernonia Court turned to "the character of theintrusion . . . complained of." 515 U. S., at 658. Observing

that students produce urine samples in a bathroom stall witha coach or teacher outside,

Vernonia typed the privacy interests compromised by the process of obtaining samples "negli-gible."

Ibid. As to the required pretest disclosure of prescription medications taken, the Court assumed that "theSchool District would have permitted [a student] to provide

the requested information in a confidential manner--for example, in a sealed envelope delivered to the testing lab."
Id., at 660. On that assumption, the Court concluded that
Vernonia's athletes faced no significant invasion of privacy.In this case, however, Lindsay Earls and her parents allege that the School District handled personal informationcollected under the policy carelessly, with little regard for
its confidentiality. Information about students' prescriptiondrug use, they assert, was routinely viewed by Lindsay's
choir teacher, who left files containing the information un-locked and unsealed, where others, including students, could
see them; and test results were given out to all activity spon-sors whether or not they had a clear "need to know." See

1 According to Tecumseh's choir teacher, choir participants who chose
not to wear their choir uniforms to school on the days of competitions
could change either in "a rest room in a building" or on the bus, where
"[m]any of them have figured out how to [change] without having
[anyone] . . . see anything." 2 Appellants' App. in No. 00-6128 (CA10),

Brief for Respondents 6, 24; App. 105-106, 131. But see id.,at 199 (policy requires that "[t]he medication list shall be

submitted to the lab in a sealed and confidential envelopeand shall not be viewed by district employees").

In granting summary judgment to the School District, theDistrict Court observed that the District's "[p]olicy expressly provides for confidentiality of test results, and the
Court must assume that the confidentiality provisions willbe honored." 115 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1293 (WD Okla. 2000).

The assumption is unwarranted. Unlike Vernonia, wherethe District Court held a bench trial before ruling in the
School District's favor, this case was decided by the District
Court on summary judgment. At that stage, doubtful matters should not have been resolved in favor of the judgment
seeker. See United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U. S. 654,
655 (1962) (per curiam) ("On summary judgment the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts contained in
[affidavits, attached exhibits, and depositions] must be
viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the
motion."); see also 10A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2716, pp. 274-277 (3d ed. 1998).

Finally, the "nature and immediacy of the governmental
concern," Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 660, faced by the Vernonia
School District dwarfed that confronting Tecumseh administrators. Vernonia initiated its drug testing policy in response to an alarming situation: "[A] large segment of the
student body, particularly those involved in interscholastic
athletics, was in a state of rebellion . . . fueled by alcohol and
drug abuse as well as the student[s'] misperceptions about
the drug culture." Id., at 649 (internal quotation marks
omitted). Tecumseh, by contrast, repeatedly reported to
the Federal Government during the period leading up to the
adoption of the policy that "types of drugs [other than alcohol and tobacco] including controlled dangerous substances,
are present [in the schools] but have not identified themselves as major problems at this time." 1998-1999 Tecum536US2 Unit: $U83 [01-14-04 18:49:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Tenth Circuit observed, "without a demonstrated drug abuseproblem among the group being tested, the efficacy of the

The School District cites Treasury Employees v. Von
Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 673-674 (1989), in which this Court per-mitted random drug testing of customs agents absent "any

perceived drug problem among Customs employees," giventhat "drug abuse is one of the most serious problems confronting our society today." See also Skinner v. RailwayLabor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602, 607, and n. 1 (1989)

with such risks of injury to others that even a momentarylapse of attention can have disastrous consequences"); see

2 The Court finds it sufficient that there be evidence of some drug use
in Tecumseh's schools: "As we cannot articulate a threshold level of drug
use that would suffice to justify a drug testing program for schoolchildren,
we refuse to fashion what would in effect be a constitutional quantum of
drug use necessary to show a `drug problem.' " Ante, at 836. One need
not establish a bright-line "constitutional quantum of drug use" to recognize the relevance of the superintendent's reports characterizing drug use
among Tecumseh's students as "not . . . [a] major proble[m]," App. 180,

also Chandler v. Miller, 520 U. S. 305, 321 (1997) ("Von Raabmust be read in its unique context").

Not only did the Vernonia and Tecumseh districts confrontdrug problems of distinctly different magnitudes, they also
chose different solutions: Vernonia limited its policy to ath-letes; Tecumseh indiscriminately subjected to testing all participants in competitive extracurricular activities. Urging
that "the safety interest furthered by drug testing is un-doubtedly substantial for all children, athletes and nonathletes alike," ante, at 836, the Court cuts out an element es-sential to the

Vernonia judgment. Citing medical literature
on the effects of combining illicit drug use with physical exertion, the Vernonia Court emphasized that "the particular
drugs screened by [Vernonia's] Policy have been demonstrated to pose substantial physical risks to athletes." 515
U. S., at 662; see also id., at 666 (Ginsburg, J., concurring)
(Vernonia limited to "those seeking to engage with others
in team sports"). We have since confirmed that these special risks were necessary to our decision in Vernonia. See
Chandler, 520 U. S., at 317 (Vernonia "emphasized the importance of deterring drug use by schoolchildren and the risk
of injury a drug-using student athlete cast on himself and
those engaged with him on the playing field"); see also Ferguson v. Charleston, 532 U. S. 67, 87 (2001) (Kennedy, J.,
concurring) (Vernonia's policy had goal of " `[d]eterring drug
use by our Nation's schoolchildren,' and particularly by
student-athletes, because `the risk of immediate physical
harm to the drug user or those with whom he is playing
his sport is particularly high' ") (quoting Vernonia, 515 U. S.,
at 661-662).

At the margins, of course, no policy of random drug testing is perfectly tailored to the harms it seeks to address.
The School District cites the dangers faced by members of
the band, who must "perform extremely precise routines
with heavy equipment and instruments in close proximity to
other students," and by Future Farmers of America, who

"are required to individually control and restrain animals aslarge as 1500 pounds." Brief for Petitioners 43. For its

part, the United States acknowledges that "the linebackerfaces a greater risk of serious injury if he takes the field
under the influence of drugs than the drummer in the half-time band," but parries that "the risk of injury to a student
who is under the influence of drugs while playing golf, crosscountry, or volleyball (sports covered by the policy in

Ver-nonia) is scarcely any greater than the risk of injury to a

student . . . handling a 1500-pound steer (as [Future Farmersof America] members do) or working with cutlery or other
sharp instruments (as [Future Homemakers of America]members do)." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
18. One can demur to the Government's view of the risksdrug use poses to golfers, cf. PGA TOUR, Inc. v. Martin,
532 U. S. 661, 687 (2001) ("golf is a low intensity activity"),for golfers were surely as marginal among the linebackers,
sprinters, and basketball players targeted for testing in Ver-nonia as steer-handlers are among the choristers, musicians,
and academic-team members subject to urinalysis in Tecum-seh.

3 Notwithstanding nightmarish images of out-of-control

flatware, livestock run amok, and colliding tubas disturbingthe peace and quiet of Tecumseh, the great majority of students the School District seeks to test in truth are engagedin activities that are not safety sensitive to an unusual degree. There is a difference between imperfect tailoring andno tailoring at all.

The Vernonia district, in sum, had two good reasons fortesting athletes: Sports team members faced special health
risks and they "were the leaders of the drug culture." Ver-nonia, 515 U. S., at 649. No similar reason, and no other
tenable justification, explains Tecumseh's decision to target

substantial physical exertion. See Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton,
515 U. S. 646, 663 (1995) (describing special dangers of combining drug use
with athletics generally).

for testing all participants in every competitive extracurricu-lar activity. See

Chandler, 520 U. S., at 319 (drug testing
candidates for office held incompatible with Fourth Amend-ment because program was "not well designed to identify

candidates who violate antidrug laws").Nationwide, students who participate in extracurricular
activities are significantly less likely to develop substance
abuse problems than are their less-involved peers. See, e. g.,N. Zill, C. Nord, & L. Loomis, Adolescent Time Use, Risky

Behavior, and Outcomes 52 (1995) (tenth graders "whoreported spending no time in school-sponsored activities
were . . . 49 percent more likely to have used drugs" thanthose who spent 1-4 hours per week in such activities).
Even if students might be deterred from drug use in orderto preserve their extracurricular eligibility, it is at least as
likely that other students might forgo their extracurricularinvolvement in order to avoid detection of their drug use.
Tecumseh's policy thus falls short doubly if deterrence is its
aim: It invades the privacy of students who need deterrence
least, and risks steering students at greatest risk for substance abuse away from extracurricular involvement that potentially may palliate drug problems.4

To summarize, this case resembles Vernonia only in that
the School Districts in both cases conditioned engagement in
activities outside the obligatory curriculum on random subjection to urinalysis. The defining characteristics of the two
programs, however, are entirely dissimilar. The Vernonia
district sought to test a subpopulation of students distinguished by their reduced expectation of privacy, their special

using random testing, "might unfairly target members of unpopular
groups." Ante, at 837; see also ante, at 841-842 (Breyer, J., concurring).
Assuming, arguendo, that this is so, the School District here has not exchanged individualized suspicion for random testing. It has installed
random testing in addition to, rather than in lieu of, testing "at any time
when there is reasonable suspicion." App. 197.

susceptibility to drug-related injury, and their heavy involve-ment with drug use. The Tecumseh district seeks to test a

much larger population associated with none of these factors.It does so, moreover, without carefully safeguarding student
confidentiality and without regard to the program's unto-ward effects. A program so sweeping is not sheltered by
Vernonia; its unreasonable reach renders it impermissibleunder the Fourth Amendment.

II
In Chandler, this Court inspected "Georgia's require-ment that candidates for state office pass a drug test"; we

held that the requirement "d[id] not fit within the closelyguarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless searches." 520 U. S., at 309. Georgia's testing pre-scription, the record showed, responded to no "concrete danger," id., at 319, was supported by no evidence of a particularproblem, and targeted a group not involved in "high-risk,
safety-sensitive tasks," id., at 321-322. We concluded:

"What is left, after close review of Georgia's scheme,is the image the State seeks to project. By requiring

candidates for public office to submit to drug testing,Georgia displays its commitment to the struggle against
drug abuse. . . . The need revealed, in short, is symbolic,not `special,' as that term draws meaning from our case
law." Ibid.
Close review of Tecumseh's policy compels a similarconclusion. That policy was not shown to advance the

" `special needs' [existing] in the public school context [tomaintain] . . . swift and informal disciplinary procedures . . .
[and] order in the schools," Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 653 (inter-nal quotation marks omitted). See

supra, at 846-848, 849-853. What is left is the School District's undoubted purpose

to heighten awareness of its abhorrence of, and strong standagainst, drug abuse. But the desire to augment communica536US2 Unit: $U83 [01-14-04 18:49:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tion of this message does not trump the right of persons--even of children within the schoolhouse gate--to be "secure

in their persons . . . against unreasonable searches and sei-zures." U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.

In Chandler, the Court referred to a pathmarking dissent-ing opinion in which "Justice Brandeis recognized the importance of teaching by example: `Our Government is the po-tent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches
the whole people by its example.' " 520 U. S., at 322 (quoting
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928)). Thatwisdom should guide decisionmakers in the instant case: The

government is nowhere more a teacher than when it runs apublic school.

It is a sad irony that the petitioning School District seeksto justify its edict here by trumpeting "the schools' custodial
and tutelary responsibility for children." Vernonia, 515U. S., at 656. In regulating an athletic program or endeavoring to combat an exploding drug epidemic, a school's custo-dial obligations may permit searches that would otherwise
unacceptably abridge students' rights. When custodial du-ties are not ascendant, however, schools' tutelary obligations
to their students require them to "teach by example" byavoiding symbolic measures that diminish constitutional protections. "That [schools] are educating the young for citi-zenship is reason for scrupulous protection of Constitutional
freedoms of the individual, if we are not to strangle the freemind at its source and teach youth to discount important
principles of our government as mere platitudes." West
Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 637 (1943).

For the reasons stated, I would affirm the judgment ofthe Tenth Circuit declaring the testing policy at issue

CORRECTIONS v. SMITH

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 01-339. Decided June 28, 2002
Respondent filed a federal habeas petition, claiming, inter alia, ineffective

assistance of counsel. He had previously brought that claim in a state
petition for postconviction relief pursuant to Arizona Rule of Criminal
Procedure 32, but the County Superior Court found it waived under
Rule 32.2(a)(3) because he had not raised it in two previous Rule 32
petitions. The Federal District Court concluded that the state court's
ruling barred federal habeas relief, but the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that the state procedural default was not independent of federal law
and thus did not bar federal review. This Court granted certiorari and
certified to the Arizona Supreme Court a question concerning Rule
32.2(a)(3)'s proper interpretation. The latter court responded that, at
the time of respondent's state petition, the question whether an asserted
claim was of sufficient constitutional magnitude to require a knowing,
voluntary, and intelligent waiver for purposes of the Rule depended not
upon the merits of the particular claim but upon the particular right
alleged to have been violated.

Held: The District Court properly refused to review respondent's

ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. The Arizona Supreme Court's
reply makes clear that Rule 32.2(a)(3) only requires courts to categorize
a claim, not to evaluate the claim's merits. When resolution of a state
procedural law question depends on a federal constitutional ruling, the
state-law prong of the court's holding is not independent of federal law
and this Court's direct review jurisdiction is not precluded. Ake v.
Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75. Assuming that the same standard governs
the scope of a district court's power to grant federal habeas relief, Rule
32.2(a)(3) determinations are independent of federal law because they
do not depend upon a constitutional ruling on the merits. Although the
state court's decision would not be independent of federal law if it rested
primarily on a ruling on the merits, the record here reveals no such
ruling.

At issue in this case is whether, when an Arizona Superior
Court denied respondent's successive petition for state postconviction relief because respondent had failed to comply
with Arizona Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.2(a)(3) (West
2000), the state court's ruling was independent of federal law.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit thought not. We
granted certiorari and certified to the Arizona Supreme
Court a question concerning the proper interpretation of
Rule 32.2(a)(3). We have received a response and now reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.

I
Respondent, Robert Douglas Smith, was convicted in Arizona in 1982 of first-degree murder, kidnaping, and sexual
assault. He was sentenced to death on the murder count
and to consecutive 21-year prison terms on the other counts.
After a series of unsuccessful petitions for state postconviction relief, respondent filed a federal petition for a writ of
habeas corpus under 28 U. S. C. $$ 2241 and 2254 in the
United States District Court for the District of Arizona.
The petition alleged, among other things, that respondent's
Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated because
his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance during
the sentencing phase of his trial.

Respondent had previ ously brought this ineffectiveassistance claim in a 1995 petition for state postconviction
relief pursuant to Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32. The Pima
County Superior Court denied the claim, finding it waived
under Rule 32.2(a)(3) because respondent had failed to raise
it in two previous Rule 32 petitions. The state court rejected respondent's contention that his procedural default
was excused because his appellate and Rule 32 attorneys suffered from a conflict of interest between their responsibility

toward respondent and their allegiance to the Public Defender's office, of which respondent's trial counsel was also a
member.

The District Court relied on the Pima County Superior
Court's procedural ruling on respondent's ineffectiveassistance-of-trial-counsel claim to bar federal habeas relief.
Like the state court, the District Court rejected respondent's argument that his appellate and Rule 32 counsel suffered from a conflict of interest which excused his procedural
default. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that although the state court's procedural default ruling was regularly followed and therefore adequate,
see 241 F. 3d 1191, 1195, n. 2 (2001) (citing Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U. S. 578, 587 (1988)), the ruling required consideration of the merits of respondent's claim and was therefore
not independent of federal law, see 241 F. 3d, at 1196-1197.
Rule 32.2(a)(3) applies different standards for waiver depending on whether the claim asserted in a Rule 32 petition
is of "sufficient constitutional magnitude." If it is, the rule
requires that the waiver be "knowin[g], voluntar[y] and intelligen[t]," not merely omitted from previous petitions.
Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3), comment (West 2000).
The Ninth Circuit opined that, at the time the state court
ruled on respondent's ineffective-assistance claim, the determination of whether a claim is of sufficient magnitude required consideration of the merits of the claim. See 241
F. 3d, at 1197 (citing State v. French, 198 Ariz. 119, 121, 7
P. 3d 128, 130 (App. 2000); State v. Curtis, 185 Ariz. 112,
115, 912 P. 2d 1341, 1344 (App. 1995)). The Ninth Circuit
concluded that, under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U. S. 68, 75
(1985), the state court's ruling did not bar federal review of
the merits of respondent's claim. See 241 F. 3d, at 1196-
1197. We granted certiorari to review the Ninth Circuit's
decision. 534 U. S. 157 (2001) (per curiam).

Because we were uncertain about the proper interpreta-tion of Rule 32.2(a)(3), we certified the following question to

the Arizona Supreme Court:

"At the time of respondent's third Rule 32 petition in1995, did the question whether an asserted claim was of

"We hold that at the time of respondent's third Rule 32petition in 1995, the question whether an asserted claim

was of `sufficient constitutional magnitude' to require aknowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver for purposes
of Rule 32.2(a)(3), see Comment to 32.2(a)(3), dependednot upon the merits of the particular claim, but rather
merely upon the particular right alleged to have beenviolated."

Stewart v. Smith, 202 Ariz. 446, 447, 46 P. 3d1067, 1068 (2002) (en banc).

The Arizona Supreme Court's reply makes clear that Rule32.2(a)(3) does not require courts to evaluate the merits of
a particular claim, but only to categorize the claim. Accord-ing to the Arizona Supreme Court, courts must evaluate
whether "at its core, [a] claim implicates a significant rightthat requires a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver."
Id., at 450, 46 P. 3d, at 1071. Courts need not decide the

merits of the claim, i. e., whether the right was actually vio-lated. They need only identify what type of claim it is, and

there is no indication that this identification is based on aninterpretation of what federal law requires. See

Delaware
v. Prouse, 440 U. S. 648, 652-653 (1979).Our cases make clear that "when resolution of [a] state

procedural law question depends on a federal constitutional
ruling, the state-law prong of the court's holding is not inde-pendent of federal law, and our [direct review] jurisdiction is

not precluded." Ake, supra, at 75. Even assuming that thesame standard governs the scope of a district court's power
to grant federal habeas relief as governs this Court's jurisdiction to review a state-court judgment on direct review,
see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722, 729-732, 741 (1991),
Rule 32.2(a)(3) determinations are independent of federal law
because they do not depend upon a federal constitutional
ruling on the merits. The District Court properly refused
to review respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel
claim. The Ninth Circuit erred in holding otherwise.

Even though Rule 32.2(a)(3) does not require a federal constitutional ruling on the merits, if the state court's decision
rested primarily on a ruling on the merits nevertheless, its
decision would not be independent of federal law. The
Ninth Circuit interpreted the state court's order rejecting
respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim as
possibly resting on a ruling on the merits of the claim. The
record, however, reveals no such ruling.

The state court did not even reach the merits of respondent's ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim, finding it
waived because respondent had failed to raise it in prior petitions for postconviction relief. As an excuse, respondent asserted that his prior appellate and Rule 32 counsel, who were
members of the Arizona Public Defender's office, had refused
to file the claim because his trial counsel was also a member
of the Public Defender's office. The state court did not find
this excuse sufficient to overcome respondent's procedural

default. See App. H to Pet. for Cert. The state court ex-plained that, because deputies in the Public Defender's office

represent their clients and not their office, respondent's ap-pellate lawyers would never have allowed "a colorable claim
for ineffective assistance of counsel" to go unstated. Id.,at 2. The Ninth Circuit read the reference to a "colorable
claim" as a conclusion that respondent's claim that his trialcounsel had rendered ineffective assistance lacked merit,
that is, as a comment on the merits of respondent's underly-ing claim. 241 F. 3d, at 1197. In context, however, it is
clear that the reference to "colorable claim" was used onlyas a rhetorical device for emphasizing the lack of any conflict
of interest that might excuse respondent's waiver.Because the state court's determination that respondent
waived his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim underAriz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3) did not require an examination of the merits of that claim, it was independent of federallaw. We voice no opinion on whether respondent has provided valid cause to overcome his procedural default in statecourt. The Ninth Circuit's judgment is reversed, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

So ordered.

UNITED STATES v. BASS
on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the sixth circuit

No. 01-1471. Decided June 28, 2002
Claiming that the United States filed a notice of intent to seek the death

penalty in respondent's capital murder case because of his race, respondent moved to dismiss the notice and, in the alternative, for discovery of
information relating to the Government's capital charging practices.
The District Court granted his discovery motion and dismissed the notice after the Government said that it would not comply with the discovery order. The Sixth Circuit affirmed.

Held: The Sixth Circuit's decision is contrary to United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 465, in which this Court held that a defendant
seeking discovery on a selective prosecution claim must show some evidence of both discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent. As to
evidence of discriminatory effect, a defendant must make a credible
showing that similarly situated individuals of a different race were not
prosecuted. Id., at 465, 470. The Sixth Circuit concluded that respondent had made such a showing based on nationwide statistics demonstrating that the Government charges blacks with a death-eligible
offense more than twice as often as it charges whites and that it enters
into plea bargains more frequently with whites than with blacks. Even
assuming that a nationwide showing can satisfy the Armstrong requirement, raw statistics regarding overall charges say nothing about
charges brought against similarly situated defendants. And the plea
bargain statistics are even less relevant, since respondent declined the
plea bargain offered him.

Certiorari granted; 266 F. 3d 532, reversed.

Per Curiam.
A federal grand jury sitting in the Eastern District ofMichigan returned a second superseding indictment charging

respondent with, inter alia, the intentional firearm killings
of two individuals. The United States filed a notice of intent
to seek the death penalty. Respondent, who is black, al-leged that the Government had determined to seek the death

penalty against him because of his race. He moved to dis536US2 Unit: $U85 [12-17-03 19:36:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

miss the death penalty notice and, in the alternative, for dis-covery of information relating to the Government's capital

charging practices. The District Court granted the motionfor discovery, and after the Government informed the court
that it would not comply with the discovery order, the courtdismissed the death penalty notice. A divided panel of the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit af-firmed the District Court's discovery order. 266 F. 3d 532
(2001). We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari andnow summarily reverse.

In United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 465 (1996),we held that a defendant who seeks discovery on a claim
of selective prosecution must show some evidence of bothdiscriminatory effect and discriminatory intent. We need
go no further in the present case than consideration of theevidence supporting discriminatory effect. As to that,
Armstrong says that the defendant must make a "credibleshowing" that "similarly situated individuals of a different
race were not prosecuted." Id., at 465, 470. The Sixth Cir-cuit concluded that respondent had made such a showing
based on nationwide statistics demonstrating that "[t]heUnited States charges blacks with a death-eligible offense
more than twice as often as it charges whites" and that theUnited States enters into plea bargains more frequently with
whites than it does with blacks. 266 F. 3d, at 538-539 (citingU. S. Dept. of Justice, The Federal Death Penalty System: A
Statistical Survey (1988-2000), p. 2 (Sept. 12, 2000)).* Evenassuming that the Armstrong requirement can be satisfied

*In January 1995, the Department of Justice (DOJ) instituted a policy,
known as the death penalty protocol, that required the Attorney General
to make the decision whether to seek the death penalty once a defendant
had been charged with a capital-eligible offense. See Pet. for Cert. 3 (citing DOJ, United States Attorneys' Manual $ 9-10.010 et seq. (Sept. 1997)).
The charging decision continued to be made by one of the 93 United States
Attorneys throughout the country, but the protocol required that the
United States Attorneys submit for review all cases in which they had
charged a defendant with a capital-eligible offense. Ibid.

Per Curiam
by a nationwide showing (as opposed to a showing regard-ing the record of the decisionmakers in respondent's case),

raw statistics regarding overall charges say nothing aboutcharges brought against similarly si tuated defendants.
And the statistics regarding plea bargains are even less rele-vant, since respondent was offered a plea bargain but declined it. See Pet. for Cert. 16. Under Armstrong, there-fore, because respondent failed to submit relevant evidence
that similarly situated persons were treated differently, hewas not entitled to discovery.

The Sixth Circuit's decision is contrary to Armstrong andthreatens the "performance of a core executive constitutional
function." Armstrong, supra, at 465. For that reason, wereverse.

It is so ordered.

Kennedy, J., dissenting 536 U. S.
activities: (1) traditional credit reporting; (2) prescreening individ-uals for offers of credit or insurance; and (3) the creation of target
marketing lists. The lists in the third category are at issue inthis case. They contain the names and addresses of individuals
who meet specific criteria such as having obtained an auto loanor two or more mortgages, or having a department store credit
card. Marketers purchase these lists, then contact the individu-als by mail or telephone to offer them goods and services.

In 1994, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a decisionholding that the information communicated by petitioner's target marketing lists were "consumer reports," the sale of whichis prohibited by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 84
Stat. 1128, 15 U. S. C. $ 1681 et seq. The Court of Appeals forthe District of Columbia Circuit rejected petitioner's subsequent
First Amendment challenge to the FTC's decision. 245 F. 3d 809(2001). Relying on our decision in Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v.
Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U. S. 749 (1985), the Court of Ap-peals held that the information communicated by petitioner's target marketing lists is subject to reduced constitutional protectionbecause it "is solely of interest to the company and its business
customers and relates to no matter of public concern." 245 F. 3d,at 818. The court determined that the FTC's ban survived this
reduced level of scrutiny despite two arguments from petitioner.First, petitioner urged that an opt-out requirement would be a
less restrictive means to achieve the Government's stated pur-pose. Second, petitioner argued that the FTC's decision does little to protect consumer privacy because credit card companies arestill permitted to make widespread disclosures of more invasive
information about consumers.In my view this case meets the standards for review by this
Court. The plurality opinion in Dun & Bradstreet concluded thata false statement in a credit report was not speech on a matter
of public concern, as that term is used in the context of defama-tion law. It is questionable, however, whether this precedent has
any place in the context of truthful, nondefamatory speech. In-deed, Dun & Bradstreet rejected in specific terms the view that
its holding "leaves all credit reporting subject to reduced FirstAmendment protection." 472 U. S., at 762, n. 8. The Court of
Appeals, nonetheless, relied on Dun & Bradstreet to denigratethe importance of this speech. A grant of certiorari is warranted
to weigh the validity of this new principle.

Even accepting the Court of Appeals' distinction between public
and private speech, it appears that petitioner's speech touches
upon matters of public concern. The Government concedes the
speech is essential to the purchasing decisions of millions of
Americans. In addition, many charitable and political organizations use the information provided in petitioner's marketing information to solicit support for their causes.

In light of the fact that the FCRA permits prescreening--the
disclosure of consumer reports for target marketing for credit and
insurance, $ 1681b(c)(1)(B)(i)--the FTC's decision to ban target
marketing lists is nonsensical. Prescreening entails the disclosure of detailed credit performance information, including bill
payment history. Release of this information is far more invasive
of consumer privacy than release of the names and addresses
contained in petitioner's target marketing lists. Like target marketing, prescreening touches a vast majority of American adults;
credit providers extended close to 1.8 billion credit prescreening
offers to American consumers in 1997. And the public value of
prescreening is not obviously greater than that provided by other
forms of target marketing; only about 1 to 2 percent of consumers
who receive prescreening offers respond to them.

This case has important practical implications. Petitioner, one
of only three major credit reporting agencies in the United States,
faces bankruptcy as a result of the decision of the Court of
Appeals. Petitioner has been named as a defendant in a series
of class actions brought under the FCRA, allegedly on behalf of
the 190 million individuals in petitioner's database. Because the
FCRA provides for statutory damages of between $100 and $1,000
for each willful violation, petitioner faces potential liability approaching $190 billion. If the Court of Appeals' decision is given
collateral-estoppel effect in these class actions (as the class-action
plaintiffs seek), petitioner will face crushing liability. The company's demise will have adverse effects on both the national economy and petitioner's thousands of employees.

This case is of national importance, and the Court of Appeals
has adopted a novel approach to commercial speech. I would
grant the petition for certiorari.

No. 02-6010 (02A164). Patterson v. Texas. Ct. Crim. App.
Tex.; and

No. 02-6017 (02A165). In re Patterson. Applications for
stay of execution of sentence of death, presented to Justice
Scalia, and by him referred to the Court, denied. Certiorari
denied. Petition for writ of habeas corpus denied.

Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to
death for a crime he committed when he was 17 years old. In
his dissenting opinion in Stanford v. Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361, 382
(1989), Justice Brennan, writing for four Members of the Court,
explained why the Eighth Amendment prohibits the taking of the
life of a person as punishment for a crime committed when below
the age of 18. I joined that opinion and remain convinced that
it correctly interpreted the law. Since that opinion was written,
the issue has been the subject of further debate and discussion
both in this country and in other civilized nations. Given the
apparent consensus that exists among the States and in the international community against the execution of a capital sentence
imposed on a juvenile offender, I think it would be appropriate for
the Court to revisit the issue at the earliest opportunity. I would
therefore grant a stay of this execution to give the Court an
opportunity to confront the question at its next scheduled conference in September. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the
denial of a stay.

This Court's decision in Atkins v. Virginia, ante, p. 304, madeit tenable for a petitioner to urge reconsideration of Stanford v.
Kentucky, 492 U. S. 361 (1989), in which the Court rejected anEighth Amendment challenge to the execution of a person as
punishment for a crime committed while under the age of 18.For the reasons stated by Justice Stevens, I think it appropriate to revisit the issue at this time. I therefore join JusticeStevens in dissenting from the denial of a stay.

Executions--Mentally retarded criminals.--Executions of mentally retarded criminals are "cruel and unusual punishments" prohibited by
Eighth Amendment. Atkins v. Virginia, p. 304.

IV. Establishment of Religion.

Tuition aid program--Payments to religious schools.--Ohio's Pilot
Project Scholarship Program, which provides, inter alia, tuition aid for
Cleveland schoolchildren to attend a participating public or private, religious or nonreligious school of their parent's choosing, does not offend
Establishment Clause. Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, p. 639.

V. Freedom of Speech.

1. Door-to-door advocacy--Advance registration requirement.--A village ordinance making it a misdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy without first registering with mayor and receiving a permit violates
First Amendment as it applies to anonymous political speech. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, p. 150.

2. Judicial elections--Restrictions on candidates' speech.--Minnesota
Supreme Court's canon of judicial conduct prohibiting candidates for judicial election from announcing their views on disputed legal and political
issues violates First Amendment. Republican Party of Minn. v. White,
p. 765.

VI. Freedom of the Press.

Door-to-door advocacy--Advance registration requirement.--A village
ordinance making it a misdemeanor to engage in door-to-door advocacy
without first registering with mayor and receiving a permit violates First
Amendment as it applies to handbill distribution. Watchtower Bible &
Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, p. 150.

VII. Free Exercise of Religion.

Door-to-door advocacy--Village ordinance requiring advance registration.--A village ordinance making it a misdemeanor to engage in door-todoor advocacy without first registering with mayor and receiving a permit
violates First Amendment as it applies to religious proselytizing. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc. of N. Y., Inc. v. Village of Stratton, p. 150.

VIII. Privilege Against Self-Incrimination.

Sexual abuse treatment program--Forced participation.--Tenth Circuit's judgment--that Kansas prison officials' threat to reduce respondent
inmate's privilege status and transfer him to maximum security if he refused to participate in a sexual abuse treatment program constituted com536IND Unit: $UBV [11-22-03 14:44:02] PGT: INDBV (Bound Volume)

pelled self-incrimination in violation of Fifth Amendment--is reversed.
McKune v. Lile, p. 24.

IX. Right to Fair Trial.

1. Plea agreement--Material evidence disclosure.--Fifth and Sixth
Amendments do not require Government to disclose material impeachment evidence prior to entering a plea agreement with a criminal defendant. United States v. Ruiz, p. 622.

2. Sentencing--Judicial finding of brandishing a weapon.--Title 18
U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A)(ii)--which increases by two years minimum sentence
for using or carrying a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime upon
a judicial finding of brandishing--does not evade Fifth and Sixth Amendment requirements. Harris v. United States, p. 545.

X. Right to Jury Trial.

Capital sentencing--Determining aggravating factors.--Walton v.
Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, is irreconcilable with Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530
U. S. 466, and is, accordingly, overruled to extent that it allows a sentencing judge, sitting without a jury, to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of death penalty; because Arizona's enumerated aggravating factors operate as functional equivalent of an element of a
greater offense, Sixth Amendment requires that they be found by a jury.
Ring v. Arizona, p. 584.

XI. Searches and Seizures.

1. Bus passengers--Consent to search.--Fourth Amendment does not
require police officers to advise bus passengers of their right not to cooperate and to refuse consent to searches. United States v. Drayton, p. 194.

2. Drug testing--Students participating in extracurricular activities.--School district's drug testing policy for students participating in
extracurricular activities is a reasonable means of furthering district's
important interest in preventing and deterring drug use among its
schoolchildren and does not violate Fourth Amendment. Board of Ed. of
Independent School Dist. No. 92 of Pottawatomie Cty. v. Earls, p. 822.

3. Warrantless entry, arrest, and search--Absence of exigent circumstances.--Louisiana Court of Appeal's conclusion that exigent circumstances were not required to justify police officers' warrantless entry of
petitioner's home and their arrest and search of petitioner violates Payton
v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 590. Kirk v. Louisiana, p. 635.

penalty for similarly situated persons of a different race, he was not entitled to discovery of information relating to Government's capital charging
practices under United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456. United States
v. Bass, p. 862.

2. Firearm usage in relation to a crime--Effect on sentencing.--Title
18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1)(A)--which provides that a person who uses or carries
a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime shall have minimum sentence for underlying crime increased as specified in three subsections--
defines a single offense, in which brandishing and discharging of a weapon
are sentencing factors to be found by judge, not offense elements to be
found by jury. Harris v. United States, p. 545.

EMERGENCY LOW INCOME HOUSING PRESERVATION ACT OF

1987.

Housing Act of 1949 loans--Breach of contract--Loan prepayment.--
Because 1987 Act qualified as a repudiation of immediate-prepayment provision of petitioners' loan agreements with Farmers Home Administration
under 1949 Act, breach would occur, and 6-year limitations period would
commence to run, when a borrower tendered prepayment and Government
then dishonored its obligation to accept tender and released its control
over use of property securing loan. Franconia Associates v. United
States, p. 129.

1. Federal petition--Independent state ground.--Because Arizona Superior Court's determination that respondent waived his ineffectiveassistance-of-counsel claim under Ariz. Rule Crim. Proc. 32.2(a)(3) did not
require an examination of that claim's merits, it was independent of federal
law and thus not reviewable on federal habeas. Stewart v. Smith, p. 856.

2. Federal petition--Teague analysis.--In addition to performing any
analysis required by Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of
1996, a federal court considering a habeas petition must address a threshold Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, issue properly raised by State. Horn v.
Banks, p. 266.

3. Limitations period for filing federal petition--Tolling while state
petition is "pending."--As used in 28 U. S. C. $ 2244(d)(2), which tolls limitations period for filing federal habeas petitions while a state collateral
relief petition is "pending," "pending" covers time between a lower state
court's decision and filing of a notice of appeal to a higher state court; that
rule applies to California's collateral review system. Carey v. Saffold,
