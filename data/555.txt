Opinion of the Court 
tremely  difficult  to  detect  and  track.  Potential  adversaries of  the  United  States  possess  at  least  300  of  these  subma-

rines.  App. 571. The  most  effective  technology  for  identifying  submerged 
diesel-electric  submarines  within  their  torpedo  range  is  ac-tive sonar, which involves emitting pulses of sound underwa-
ter  and  then  receiving  the  acoustic  waves  that  echo  off  the target.  Pet.  App.  266a-267a,  274a.  Active  sonar  is  a  par-
ticularly useful tool because it provides both the bearing and the distance of target submarines; it is also sensitive enough 
to  allow  the  Navy  to  track  enemy  submarines  that  are  qui-
eter  than  the  surrounding  marine  environment.1  This  case concerns  the  Navy's  use  of  "mid-frequency  active"  (MFA) 

sonar,  which  transmits  sound  waves  at  frequencies  between 1 kHz and 10 kHz. 

Not surprisingly, MFA sonar is a complex technology, and sonar  operators  must  undergo  extensive  training  to  become 
proficient  in  its  use.  Sonar  reception  can  be  affected  by 
countless  different  factors,  including  the  time  of  day,  water density,  salinity,  currents,  weather  conditions,  and  the  con-

tours of the sea floor.  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 
have  been  "associated"  with  the  use  of  active  sonar.  They argue  that  certain  species  of  marine  mammals--such  as 

beaked  whales--are  uniquely  susceptible  to  injury  from  ac-tive  sonar;  these  injuries  would  not  necessarily  be  detected 
by  the  Navy,  given  that  beaked  whales  are  "very  deep  di-vers" that spend little time at the surface. 

II 
The  procedural  history  of  this  case  is  rather  complicated. The  Marine  Mammal  Protection  Act  of  1972  (MMPA),  86 

Stat.  1027,  generally  prohibits  any  individual  from  "taking" a  marine  mammal,  defined  as  harassing,  hunting,  capturing, 
or killing it.  16 U. S. C. $$ 1362(13), 1372(a).  The Secretary of  Defense  may  "exempt  any  action  or  category  of  actions" 
from  the  MMPA  if  such  actions  are  "necessary  for  national defense."  $ 1371(f)(1).  In January 2007, the Deputy Secre-
tary  of  Defense--acting  for  the  Secretary--granted  the Navy  a  2-year  exemption  from  the  MMPA  for  the  training 
exercises  at  issue  in  this  case.  Pet.  App.  219a-220a.  The exemption  was  conditioned  on  the  Navy  adopting  several 
mitigation procedures, including: (1) training lookouts and of-ficers  to  watch  for  marine  mammals;  (2)  requiring  at  least 
five  lookouts  with  binoculars  on  each  vessel  to  watch  for anomalies on the water surface (including marine mammals); 
(3) requiring aircraft and sonar operators to report detected marine  mammals  in  the  vicinity  of  the  training  exercises; 
(4) requiring reduction of active sonar transmission levels by 6  dB  if  a  marine  mammal  is  detected  within  1,000  yards  of 
the  bow  of  the  vessel,  or  by  10  dB  if  detected  within  500 yards; (5) requiring complete shutdown of active sonar trans-
mission  if  a  marine mammal  is  detected  within  200  yards  of the  vessel;  (6)  requiring  active  sonar  to  be  operated  at  the 
"lowest practicable level"; and (7) adopting coordination and reporting procedures.

2  The  Dis-

trict  Court  granted  plaintiffs'  motion  for  a  preliminary  in-junction and prohibited the Navy from using MFA sonar dur-

ing  its  remaining  training  exercises.  The  court  held  that plaintiffs  had  "demonstrated  a  probability  of  success"  on 
their  claims  under  NEPA  and  the  CZMA.  Pet.  App.  207a, 215a.  The  court  also  determined  that  equitable  relief  was 
appropriate  because,  under  Ninth  Circuit  precedent,  plain-tiffs  had  established  at  least  a  " `possibility' "  of  irreparable 
harm to the environment.  Id.,

able to train and be certified as fully mission capable."  Pet. App.  238a.  Under  the  alternative  arrangements,  the  Navy 

would  be  permitted  to  conduct  its  training  exercises  under the  mitigation  procedures  adopted  in  conjunction  with  the 
exemption  from  the  MMPA.  The  CEQ  also  imposed  addi-tional notice, research, and reporting requirements. 

In  light  of  these  actions,  the  Navy  then  moved  to  vacate the District Court's injunction with respect to the 2,200-yard 
shutdown  zone  and  the  restrictions  on  training  in  surface ducting conditions.  The District Court refused to do so, 527 
F.  Supp.  2d  1216  (2008),  and  the  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed. The  Ninth  Circuit  held  that  there  was  a  serious  question 
regarding  whether  the  CEQ's  interpretation  of  the  "emer-gency  circumstances"  regulation  was  lawful.  Specifically, 
the court questioned whether there was a true "emergency" in  this  case,  given  that  the  Navy  has  been  on  notice  of  its 
obligation  to  comply  with  NEPA  from  the  moment  it  first planned  the  SOCAL  training  exercises.  518  F.  3d,  at  681. 
The Court of Appeals concluded that the preliminary injunc-tion was entirely predictable in light of the parties' litigation 
history.  Ibid.

circumstances"  justified  alternative  arrangements  to  NEPA compliance.  40 CFR $ 1506.11.  Plaintiffs' briefs before 

this  Court  barely  discuss  the  ground  relied  upon  by  the lower courts--that the plain meaning of "emergency circum-
stances" does not encompass a court order that was "entirely predictable"  in  light  of  the  parties'  litigation  history.  518 
F. 3d, at 681.  Instead, plaintiffs contend that the CEQ's ac-tions 

violated  the  separation  of  powers  by  readjudicating  a factual issue already decided by an Article III court.  More-

over,  they  assert  that  the  CEQ's  interpretations  of  NEPA are not  entitled  to  deference because  the  CEQ has  not  been 
given statutory authority to conduct adjudications. 

The  District  Court  and  the  Ninth  Circuit  also  held  that 
when  a plaintiff  demonstrates  a  strong  likelihood of  prevail-
ing  on  the  merits,  a  preliminary  injunction  may  be  entered 
based  only  on  a  "possibility"  of  irreparable  harm.  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 
Roughead--the Chief of Naval Operations--stated that dur-ing training exercises: 

"It  is  important  to  stress  the  ship  crews  in  all  dimen-sions  of  warfare  simultaneously.  If  one  of  these  train-
ing  elements  were  impacted--for  example,  if  effective sonar  training  were  not  possible--the  training  value  of 
the  other  elements would also  be degraded  . .  . ."  Pet. App. 342a. 

Captain Martin May--the Third Fleet's Assistant Chief of Staff  for  Training  and  Readiness--emphasized  that  the  use 
of  MFA  sonar  is  "mission-critical."  App.  570-571.  He  de-scribed the ability to operate MFA sonar as a "highly perish-
able  skill"  that  must  be  repeatedly  practiced  under  realistic conditions.

prior training exercises in SOCAL; in several of these cases, the  Navy  turned  off  its  sonar  when  marine  mammals  were 

spotted  well  beyond  the  Navy's  self-imposed  200-yard  shut-down  zone.  518  F.  3d,  at  700,  n.  65.  Vice  Admiral  Samuel 
Locklear  III--the  Commander  of  the  Navy's  Third  Fleet-- stated  that  any  shutdowns  beyond  the  200-yard  zone  were 
voluntary avoidance measures that likely took place at tacti-
cally  insignificant  times;  the  Ninth  Circuit  discounted  this explanation  as  not  supported  by  the  record.

fact that the training has been going on for 40 years with no documented episode of harm to a marine mammal.  A court 
concluding that  the  Navy is  required to prepare  an EIS has many remedial tools at its disposal, including declaratory re-

rather  than  the  Navy's  training  in  the  interim.  See,  e.

Respondent  Michael  Pulido  was  convicted  by  a  California jury  of  felony  murder.  On  direct  appeal,  Pulido  sought  to 

vacate his conviction on the ground that the jury instructions were  erroneous:  They  permitted  the  jury  to  find  him  guilty 
of felony murder  if he  formed  the  intent to aid  and abet  the underlying felony before the murder, but they also permitted 
the jury to find him guilty if he formed that intent only after 
the  murder.  The  California  Supreme  Court  agreed  with Pulido  that  the  latter  theory  was  invalid  under  California 

law, but upheld the conviction on the ground that Pulido was not  prejudiced  by  the  error.

(MUTPA).  Specifically,  they  allege  that  petitioners'  adver-tising  fraudulently  conveyed  the  message  that  their  "light" 

cigarettes  deliver  less  tar  and  nicotine  to  consumers  than regular brands despite  petitioners' knowledge  that the  mes-
sage  was  untrue.  Petitioners  deny  the  charge,  asserting that  their  advertisements  were  factually  accurate.  The 
merits  of  the  dispute  are  not  before  us  because  the  District Court entered  summary judgment in  favor of petitioners on 
the  ground  that  respondents'  state-law  claim  is  pre-empted by  the  Federal  Cigarette  Labeling  and  Advertising  Act,  as 
amended  (Labeling  Act  or  Act).  The  Court  of  Appeals  re-versed  that  judgment,  and  we  granted  certiorari  to  review 
its  holding  that  the  Labeling  Act  neither  expressly  nor  im-pliedly pre-empts respondents' fraud claim.  We affirm. 

I 
Respondents are Maine residents and longtime smokers of Marlboro Lights and Cambridge Lights cigarettes, which are 

manufactured  by  petitioners.  Invoking  the  diversity  juris-diction  of  the  Federal  District  Court,  respondents  filed  a 
complaint  alleging  that  petitioners  deliberately  deceived them about the true and harmful nature of "light" cigarettes 
in violation of the MUTPA, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 5, $ 207 (Supp.  2008).

1  Respondents  claim  that  petitioners  fraudu-

lently marketed their cigarettes as being "light" and contain-ing " `[l]owered  [t]ar and [n]icotine' " to convey  to consumers 

that they deliver less tar and nicotine and are therefore less harmful than regular cigarettes.  App. 28a-29a. 

1 The  MUTPA  provides,  as  relevant,  that  "[u]nfair  methods  of  competi-
tion  and unfair or  deceptive acts  or practices  in the  conduct  of any trade 
or  commerce  are  declared  unlawful."  $ 207.  In  construing  that  section, 
courts are to "be guided by the interpretations given by the Federal Trade 
Commission  and  the  Federal  Courts  to  Section  45(a)(1)  of  the  Federal 
Trade  Commission  Act  (15  United  States  Code  45(a)(1)),  as  from  time  to 
time amended."  $ 207(1).

tising  or  promotion  of  any  cigarettes  the  packages  of  which are  labeled  in  conformity  with  the  provisions  of  this  chap-

ter."  $ 1334(b). Together, the labeling requirement and pre-emption provi-
sions  express  Congress'  determination  that  the  prescribed federal warnings are both necessary and sufficient to achieve 
its  purpose  of  informing  the  public  of  the  health  conse-
quences of smoking.  Because Congress has decided that no additional  warning  statement  is  needed  to  attain  that  goal, 

States may  not  impede commerce in  cigarettes by  enforcing rules that are based on an assumption that the federal warn-
ings  are  inadequate.  Although  both  of  the  Act's  purposes are furthered  by  prohibiting  States  from  supplementing the 
federally  prescribed  warning,  neither  would  be  served  by limiting  the  States'  authority  to  prohibit  deceptive  state-
ments  in  cigarette  advertising.  Petitioners  acknowledge

nies  from  liability  for  inaccurate  statements  about  the  rela-

$ 2244(d)(1).  This case i nvolves the date provided by $ 2244(d)(1)(A),  which  is  "the  date  on  which  the  judgment 

became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expira-tion  of  the  time  for  seeking  such  review."  Petitioner  con-
tends  that  "the  date  on  which  the  judgment  became  final" can be postponed by a state court's decision during collateral 
review  to  grant  a  defendant  the  right  to  file  an  out-of-time 
direct  appeal.  The  District  Court  disagreed,  holding  in-stead that the  date could not be moved to reflect the out-of-

time appeal, and that petitioner's federal habeas petition was untimely  for  that  reason.  The  United  States  Court  of  Ap-
peals  for  the  Fifth Circuit  denied a  certificate  of appealabil-
ity.  See  $ 2253(c).  We  now  reverse  the  judgment  of  the

sistent with this opinion.

petition,  he  relied  on  28  U. S. C.  $ 2244(d)(1)(A),  which  pro-vides  "the  date  on  which  the  judgment  became  final  by  the 

conclusion  of  direct  review  or  the  expiration  of  the  time  for seeking such review" as the trigger for AEDPA's 1-year limi-
tations  period.  Petitioner  argued  that  his  judgment  thus became final on January 6, 2004,

2  when time expired for seek-

ing certiorari review of the decision in his out-of-time appeal. Until that date, petitioner argued, direct review of his state-

court conviction was not complete. With  January  6,  2004,  as  the  start  date,  petitioner  con-
tended  that  his  July  19,  2005,  petition  was  timely  because the statute excludes from the 1-year limitations period "[t]he 
time  during  which  a  properly  filed  application  for  State post-conviction  or  other  collateral  review  with  respect  to 
the  pertinent  judgment  or  claim  is  pending."  $ 2244(d)(2). Petitioner  had  a  state  habeas  application  pending  from  De-
cember 6, 2004, through June 29, 2005, so less than one year of  included  time--specifically,  355  days--passed  between 
January 6, 2004, and July 19, 2005. The District Court disagreed and dismissed the federal ha-
beas  petition  as  time  barred.  In  the  District  Court's  view, the proper start date for AEDPA's 1-year limitations period 
was  October  11,  1996,  when  time  for  seeking  discretionary review  of  the  decision  in  petitioner's  first  direct  appeal  ex-
pired.  The  District  Court  concluded  that  it  could  not  take into  account  the  Texas  court's  later  decision  reopening  peti-
tioner's  direct  appeal  because  Circuit  precedent  established that  " `AEDPA  provides  for  only  a  linear  limitations  period, 
one that starts and ends on specific dates, with only the pos-sibility  that  tolling  will  expand  the  period  in  between.' "

date for purposes of the 1-year AEDPA limitations period as "the date on which the judgment became final by the conclu-

sion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such  review."  The  only  disputed  question  before  us  is 
whether  the  date  on  which  direct  review  became  "final" under the statute is October 11, 1996, when petitioner's con-
viction  initially  became  final,  or  January  6,  2004,  when  the 
out-of-time  appeal  granted  by  the  Texas  Court  of  Criminal Appeals became final.  We agree with petitioner that, under 

the  plain  meaning  of  the  statutory  text,  the  latter  date controls. 

Finality is a concept that has been "variously defined; like 
many  legal  terms,  its  precise  meaning  depends  on  context."

lished  in  $ 2244(d)(1).  But  it  is  the  plain  language  of $ 2244(d)(1) that pinpoints the uniform date of finality set by 

Congress.  And that language points to the conclusion of di-rect  appellate  proceedings  in  state  court.  The  statute  thus 
carries out "AEDPA's goal of promoting `comity, finality, and federalism'  by  giving  state  courts  `the  first  opportunity  to 
review [the]  claim,' and to `correct' any `constitutional viola-tion  in  the  first  instance.' "

Opinion of the Court 
ing one year, it satisfies none of the other parts of the definition.  Most 
critically, it does not "involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential 
risk  of  physical  injury  to  another."  Conceptually  speaking,  the  crime 
amounts to a form of inaction, and there is no reason to believe that an 
offender  who fails  to  report  is  otherwise  doing  something  that  poses  a 
serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury.  The  Government's  argument 
that a failure to report reveals the offender's special, strong aversion to 
penal  custody--pointing  to  three  state and  federal  cases  over  30  years 
in  which  individuals  shot  at  officers  attempting  to  recapture  them--is 
unconvincing.  Even assuming the relevance of violence that may occur 
long  after  an  offender  fails  to  report,  the  offender's  aversion  to  penal 
custody is beside the point.  The question is whether such an offender is 
significantly more likely than others to attack or resist an apprehender, 
thereby  producing  a  serious  risk  of  physical  injury.  Here  a  United 
States  Sentencing  Commission  report,  showing  no  violence  in  160  fed-
eral failure-to-report cases over two recent years, helps provide a nega-
tive answer.  The three reported cases to which the Government points 
do  not  show  the  contrary.  Simple  multiplication  (2  years  versus  30 
years;  federal  alone  versus  federal-plus-state) suggests  that they  show 
only a statistically insignificant risk of physical violence.  And the Gov-
ernment provides no other empirical information.  Pp. 127-130.

124  CHAMBERS  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 

I 
The  Armed  Career  Criminal  Act  (ACCA)  imposes  a  15-year  mandatory  prison  term  on  an  individual  convicted  of 

being a felon in possession of a firearm if that individual has "three previous convictions . . . for a violent felony or a seri-
ous  drug  offense,  or  both,  committed  on  occasions  different from  one  another."  $ 924(e)(1).  ACCA  defines  a  "violent 
felony"  as  a  "crime  punishable  by  imprisonment  for  a  term 
exceeding one year" that also either 

"(i)  has  as  an  element  the  use,  attempted  use,  or 
threatened  use  of  physical  force  against  the  person  of another; or 

"(ii)  is  burglary,  arson,  or  extortion,  involves  the  use of  explosives,  or  otherwise  involves  conduct  that  pre-
sents  a  serious  potential  risk  of  physical  injury  to  an-other."  $ 924(e)(2)(B). 

Clause (ii), ACCA's so-called residual clause, is at issue here. 

II 
The  petitioner,  Deondery  Chambers,  pleaded  guilty  to  a 
charge of being a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm. $ 922(g).  At  sentencing  the  Government  asked  the  District 

Court  to  apply  ACCA's  15-year  mandatory  prison  term  be-cause, in its view, three of Chambers' prior convictions quali-
fied  as  an  ACCA  "serious  drug  offense"  or  "violent  felony." Chambers conceded that two of his prior convictions, namely, 
a  1998  conviction  for  robbery  and  aggravated  battery  and  a 1999  drug  crime  conviction,  fell  within  ACCA's  definitions. 
But he disputed the Government's claim as to a third convic-
tion.  That third conviction arose out of Chambers' sentence for  his  1998  robbery  and  battery  offense.  The  sentence  re-

Opinion of the Court 
of  "fail[ing]  to  report  to  a  penal  institution."  Ill.  Comp. Stat., ch. 720, $ 5/31-6(a) (West Supp. 2008). 

The District Court treated the "failure to report" as a form of  what  the  relevant  Illinois  statute  calls  "escape  from  [a] 
penal institution," ibid., and held that the crime qualified as a  "violent  felony"  under  ACCA.  The  Court  of  Appeals 
agreed.  473 F. 3d 724 (CA7 2007).  In light of disagreement among the Circuits as to whether failure to report for impris-
onment falls within the scope of ACCA's definition of "violent felony,"  we  granted  certiorari.  Compare 

United  States  v. Winn, 364 F. 3d 7, 12 (CA1 2004) (failure to report is a "vio-

lent  felony"),  with  United  States  v.  Piccolo,  441  F.  3d  1084, 1088  (CA9  2006)  (failure  to  report  is  not  a  "violent  felony"). 

III 
We initially consider the classification of the crime.  In or-dinary  speech, words  such as "crime" and "felony" can  refer 

not only to a generic set of acts, say, burglary in general, but also to a specific act committed on a particular occasion, say, 
the burglary that the defendant engaged in last month.  We have  made  clear,  however,  that,  for  purposes  of  ACCA's 
definitions,  it  is  the  generic  sense  of  the  word  "felony"  that counts. 

Taylor  v.  United  States,  495  U. S.  575,  602  (1990); see also Shepard v.  United States, 544 U. S. 13, 16-17 (2005). 

The statute's defining language, read naturally, uses "felony" to refer to a crime as generally committed.  And by so con-
struing the statute, one avoids the practical difficulty of try-ing  to  ascertain  at  sentencing,  perhaps  from  a  paper  record 
mentioning  only  a  guilty  plea,  whether  the  present  defend-ant's  prior crime,  as committed  on a  particular occasion,  did 
or  did  not  involve  violent  behavior.  See  id.,  at  20-21. Thus,  to  determine,  for  example,  whether  attempted  bur-
glary  is  a  "violent  felony,"  we  have  had  to  examine,  not  the unsuccessful burglary the defendant attempted on a particu-
lar  occasion,  but  the  generic  crime  of  attempted  burglary.

126  CHAMBERS  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
This  categorical  approach  requires  courts  to  choose  the 
right  category.  And  sometimes  the  choice  is  not  obvious. 
The  nature  of  the  behavior  that  likely  underlies  a  statutory 
phrase  matters  in  this  respect.  Where  Massachusetts,  for 
example, placed within a single, separately numbered statu-
tory  section  (entitled  "Breaking  and  entering  at  night," 
Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, $ 16 (West 2008)) burglary of 
a  "building,  ship,  vessel  or  vehicle,"  this  Court  found  that 
the behavior underlying, say, breaking into a building differs 
so  significantly  from  the  behavior  underlying,  say,  breaking 
into  a  vehicle  that  for  ACCA  purposes  a  sentencing  court 
must treat the two as different crimes.  See Shepard, supra, 
at 16-17; see also Taylor, supra, at 598. 

The Illinois  statute now before  us,  like the  Massachusetts 
statute,  places  together  in  a  single  numbered  statutory  sec-
tion  several  different  kinds  of  behavior.  It  separately  de-
scribes those behaviors as (1) escape from a penal institution, 
(2) escape from the custody of an employee of a penal institu-
tion, (3) failing  to report  to  a  penal  institution,  (4)  failing to 
report  for  periodic  imprisonment,  (5)  failing  to  return  from 
furlough, (6) failing to return from work and day release, and 

(7)  failing  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  home  confinement.  Ill. 
Comp. Stat., ch. 720, $ 5/31-6(a); see Appendix A, infra.  We 
know  from  the  state-court  information  in  the  record  that 
Chambers  pleaded  guilty  to  "knowingly  fail[ing]  to  report" 
for  periodic  imprisonment  "to  the  Jefferson  County  Jail,  a 
penal institution."  App. 68; see Shepard, supra, at 25 (sen-
tencing  court  may  look,  for  example,  to  charging  document, 
plea agreement, jury instructions, or transcript of plea collo-
quy  to  determine  crime  at  issue).  But  we  must  decide 
whether  for  ACCA  purposes  a  failure  to  report  counts  as  a 
separate crime. 

Unlike the lower courts, we believe that a failure to report 
(as described  in  the statutory  provision's  third, fourth,  fifth, 
and sixth phrases) is a separate crime, different from escape

Opinion of the Court 
(the subject matter of the statute's first and second phrases), and  from  the  potentially  less  serious  failure  to  abide  by  the 

terms  of  home  confinement  (the  subject  of  the  final  phrase). The  behavior  that  likely  underlies  a  failure  to  report  would 
seem  less  likely  to  involve  a  risk  of  physical  harm  than  the less passive, more aggressive behavior underlying an escape 
from  custody.  See  Begay  v.  United  States,  553  U. S.  137, 144-146  (2008).  Moreover,  the  statute  itself  not  only  lists 
escape  and  failure  to  report  separately  (in  its  title  and  its body)  but  also  places  the  behaviors  in  two  different  felony 
classes  (Class  Two  and  Class  Three)  of  different  degrees  of seriousness.  See Appendix A, 

infra. At the same time, we believe the statutory phrases setting 

forth various kinds of failure to report (or to return) describe roughly similar forms of behavior.  Each is characterized by 
a failure to present oneself for detention on a specified occa-sion.  All amount to variations on a single theme.  For that 
reason  we  consider  them  as  together  constituting  a  single category.  Cf. 

James,  supra,  at  207-209  (determining  that where  separately  listed  behaviors  pose  a  similar  degree  of 

risk, sentencing courts may consider all listed behaviors as a single crime).  We consequently treat the statute for ACCA 
purposes as containing at least two separate crimes, namely, escape from custody on the one hand, and a failure to report 
on the other.  Failure to abide by home confinement terms-- potentially  the  least  serious  of  the  offenses--is  not  at  issue 
here.  IV 

We  now  must  consider  whether  the  "failure  to  report" crime satisfies ACCA's "violent felony" definition.  It clearly 
satisfies  the  first  part  of  that  definition,  for  it  is  a  "crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year." 
18  U. S. C.  $ 924(e)(2)(B).  But  it  satisfies  none  of  the  other parts.  It  does  not  have  "as  an  element  the  use,  attempted 
use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of

another."  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(i).  It does not consist of "burglary, 
arson,  or  extortion,"  or  "involv[e]  use  of  explosives." 

$ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  And, more critically for present purposes, 
it  does  not  " `involve  conduct  that  presents  a  serious  poten-
tial  risk  of  physical  injury  to  another.' "  See  Begay,  553 
U. S.,  at  141-142;  id.,  at  153-154  (Scalia,

cantly more likely than others to attack, or physically  to re-
sist, an apprehender,  thereby producing  a "serious  potential 
risk  of  physical  injury."  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  And  here  a 
United States Sentencing Commission report helps provide a 
conclusive, negative answer.  See Report on Federal Escape 
Offenses in Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007, p. 7 (Nov. 2008) (here-
inafter Commission's Report), reprinted in part in Appendix 
B,  infra.  See also 473 F. 3d, at 727 (Posner, J.) (urging that 
such research be done). 

The  Commission's  Report  identifies  every  federal  case  in 
2006 or 2007 in which a federal sentencing court applied the 
Sentencing  Guideline,  "Escape,  Instigating  or  Assisting  Es-
cape,"  1  United  States  Sentencing  Commission,  Guidelines 
Manual $ 2P1.1 (Nov. 2008), and in which sufficient detail was 
provided,  say,  in  the  presentence  report,  about  the  circum-
stances  of  the  crime  to  permit  analysis.  The  analysis  in-
cluded  calculation  of  the  likelihood  that  violence  would  ac-
company  commission  of  the  escape  or  the  offender's  later 
apprehension. 

Of  414  such  cases,  160  involved  a  failure  to  report  either 
for incarceration (42) or for custody after having been tempo-
rarily  released  (118).  Commission's  Report  7;  see  also  Ap-
pendix  B,  infra.  Of  these  160  cases,  none  at  all  involved 
violence--not  during  commission  of  the  offense  itself,  not 
during  the  offender's  later  apprehension--although  in  5  in-
stances  (3.1%)  the  offenders  were  armed.  Ibid.  The  up-
shot  is  that  the  study  strongly  supports  the  intuitive  belief 
that failure to report does not involve a serious potential risk 
of physical injury. 

The three reported cases to which the Government points 
do  not  show  the  contrary.  The  Sentencing  Commission 
culled  its  160  instances  from  a  set  of  federal  sentences  im-
posed  over  a  period  of  two  years.  The  Government  appar-
ently culled its three examples from a set of state and federal 
sentences imposed over a period of 30 years.  Compare Eag-

Appendix A to opinion of the Court 
lin,  supra  (CA9  1977),  with  Johnson,  supra  (Mo.  Ct.  App. 
2008).  Given the larger set, the presence of three instances 
of  violence  is  consistent  with  the  Commission's  data.  Sim-
ple  multiplication  (2  years  versus  30  years;  federal  alone 
versus  federal-plus-state)  suggests  that  they  show  only  a 

small risk of physical violence (less than one in several thou-
sand).  And  the  Government  provides  no  other  empirical 
information. 

For these reasons we conclude that the crime here at issue 
falls  outside  the  scope  of  ACCA's  definition  of  "violent  fel-
ony."  $ 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The  judgment  of  the  Court  of  Ap-
peals  is  reversed,  and  the  case  is  remanded  for  further  pro-
ceedings consistent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

if  an  officer  reasonably  believes  there  is  an  outstanding  ar-rest  warrant,  but  that  belief  turns  out  to  be  wrong  because 

of  a  negligent  bookkeeping  error  by  another  police  em-ployee?  The  parties  here  agree  that  the  ensuing  arrest  is 
still  a  violation  of  the  Fourth  Amendment,  but  dispute whether  contraband  found  during  a  search  incident  to  that 
arrest must be excluded in a later prosecution. Our  cases  establish  that  such  suppression  is  not  an  auto-
matic  consequence  of  a  Fourth  Amendment  violation.  In-stead, the question turns on the culpability of the police and 
the  potential  of  exclusion  to  deter  wrongful  police  conduct. Here  the  error  was  the  result  of  isolated  negligence  attenu-
ated  from  the  arrest.  We  hold  that  in  these  circumstances the  jury  should  not  be  barred  from  considering  all  the 
evidence.  I 

On July 7, 2004, Investigator Mark Anderson learned that Bennie Dean Herring had driven to the Coffee County Sher-
iff 's  Department  to  retrieve  something  from  his  impounded truck.  Herring  was  no  stranger  to  law  enforcement,  and 
Anderson  asked  the  county's  warrant  clerk,  Sandy  Pope,  to check  for  any  outstanding  warrants  for  Herring's  arrest. 
When  she  found  none,  Anderson  asked  Pope  to  check  with Sharon Morgan, her counterpart in neighboring Dale County. 
After  checking  Dale  County's  computer  database,  Morgan replied that there was an active arrest warrant for Herring's 
failure to appear on a felony charge.  Pope relayed the infor-mation to Anderson and asked Morgan to fax over a copy of 
the  warrant  as  confirmation.  Anderson  and  a  deputy  fol-lowed  Herring  as  he  left  the  impound  lot,  pulled  him  over, 
and arrested  him.  A  search  incident  to the  arrest  revealed methamphetamine  in  Herring's  pocket,  and  a  pistol  (which 
as  a  felon  he  could  not  possess)  in  his  vehicle.  App.  17-23. There  had,  however,  been  a  mistake  about  the  warrant.

scribed  facts.  Ore.  Rev.  Stat.  $ 137.123(1)  (2007).  In  most cases, finding such facts permits--but does not require--the

Opinion of the Court 
in a way that relieved the State of its burden to prove every element of 
the crime beyond a reasonable  doubt.  The  prosecutor consistently  ar-
gued that Sarausad  was guilty  as an  accomplice because he  acted with 
knowledge  that  he  was  facilitating  a  driveby  shooting.  She  never  ar-
gued that the admission by Sarausad and Reyes that they anticipated a 
fight  was  a  concession  of  accomplice  liability  for  murder.  Sarausad's 
attorney also homed in on the key question, stressing a lack of evidence 
showing that Sarausad knew that his assistance would promote or facili-
tate  a  premeditated  murder.  Every  state  and  federal  appellate  court 
that  reviewed  the  verdict  found  the  evidence  supporting  Sarausad's 
knowledge of a shooting legally sufficient to convict him under Washing-
ton  law.  Given the  strength  of  that evidence,  and the  jury's  failure  to 
convict Reyes--who had also been charged as an accomplice to murder 
and  admitted  knowledge  of  a possible  fight--it  was  not  objectively  un-
reasonable for the Washington courts to conclude that the jury convicted 
Sarausad  because  it  believed  that  he,  unlike  Reyes,  had  knowledge  of 
more  than  just  a  fistfight.  The  Ninth  Circuit's  contrary  reasoning  is 
unconvincing.  Pp. 192-196.

anticipated  a  fight,  Tr.  2671,  2794,  and  yet  the  prosecutor 
never argued that their admission was a concession of accom-
plice liability for murder.  She instead argued that Sarausad 
knew  that  a  shooting  was  intended,  App.  123,  because  he 
drove his car in a way that  would help  Ronquillo  "fire those

There are cases in which it is plain that a constitutional right 
is  not  clearly  established  but  far  from  obvious  whether  in 
fact  there  is  such  a  right.  District  courts  and courts  of  ap-
peals  with  heavy  caseloads  are  often  understandably  unen-
thusiastic  about  what  may  seem  to  be  an  essentially  aca-
demic exercise. 

Unnecessary  litigation  of constitutional issues also  wastes 
the  parties' resources.  Qualified  immunity  is "an  immunity

(i)  Title  IX's  only  express  enforcement  mechanism,  20  U. S. C. 

$ 1682,  is  an  administrative  procedure  resulting  in  the  withdrawal  of 
federal  funding  from  noncompliant  institutions.  This  Court  has  also 
recognized an  implied  private  right of  action,  Cannon  v.  University of 
Chicago, 441 U. S. 677, 717, for which both injunctive relief and damages 
are  available,  Franklin  v.  Gwinnett  County  Public  Schools,  503  U. S. 
60, 76.  These remedies stand in stark contrast to the "unusually elabo-
rate," "carefully tailored," and "restrictive" enforcement schemes of the 
statutes  in  Sea  Clammers,  Smith,  and  Rancho  Palos  Verdes.  Unlike 
those  statutes,  Title  IX  has  no  administrative  exhaustion  requirement 
and  no  notice  provisions.  Plaintiffs  can  file  directly  in  court  under  its 
implied private right of action and can obtain the full range of remedies. 
Accordingly,  parallel  and  concurrent  $ 1983  claims  will  neither  circum-
vent required procedures nor allow access to new remedies.  Moreover, 
under  Rancho  Palos  Verdes,  "[t]he  provision  of  an  express,  private 
means  of  redress  in  the  statute  itself"  is  a  key  consideration  in  deter-
mining  congressional  intent,  and  "the  existence  of  a  more  restrictive 
private  remedy  for  statutory  violations  has  been  the  dividing  line  be-
tween  those  cases  in  which  .  .  .  an  action  would  lie  under  $ 1983  and 
those in which we have held that it would not."  544 U. S., at 121.  Title 
IX  contains  no  express  private  remedy,  much  less  a  more  restrictive 
one.  Pp. 255-256. 

(ii)  Because Title IX's protections are narrower in some respects 
and broader in others than those guaranteed under the Equal Protection 
Clause,  the  Court  cannot  agree  with  the  First  Circuit  that  Congress 
saw  Title  IX  as  the  sole  means  of  correcting  unconstitutional  gender 
discrimination  in  schools.  Title  IX  reaches  institutions  and  programs 
that receive federal funds, 20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a), which may include non-
public institutions, $ 1681(c), but it has consistently been interpreted as 
not authorizing suit against school officials, teachers, and other individu-
als.  Moreover,  while  the  constitutional  provision  reaches  only  state 
actors, $ 1983 equal protection claims may be brought against individu-
als as well as state entities.  West v.  Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 48-51.  And 
Title  IX  exempts  from  its  restrictions  several  activities  that  may  be 
challenged  on  constitutional  grounds.  See,  e. g.,  $ 1681(a)(5).  Even 
where particular activities and particular defendants are subject to both 
Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, the standards for establishing 
liability may not  be wholly congruent.  Compare  Gebser  v.  Lago Vista 

Independent  School  Dist., 524 U. S.  274, 290,  with  Monell  v.  New  York 
City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694.  Pp. 256-258. 

(iii)  The  Court's  conclusion  is  consistent  with  Title  IX's  context 
and  history.  Because  the  Congress  that  enacted  Title  IX  authorized 
the Attorney General to intervene in private suits alleging sex discrimi-

Opinion of the Court 
nation  violative  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000h-2, 
Congress  must  have  explicitly  envisioned  that  private  plaintiffs  would 
bring constitutional claims to challenge gender discrimination via $ 1983. 
Moreover, Title IX  was modeled after Title VI  of the Civil  Rights  Act 
of  1964, Cannon,  supra,  at  694-695, and,  at the time of  Title  IX's  1972 
enactment, the lower courts routinely interpreted Title VI to allow for 
parallel and concurrent $ 1983 claims.  Absent contrary evidence, it fol-
lows  that  Congress  intended  Title  IX  to  be  interpreted  similarly  to 
allow for parallel and concurrent $ 1983 claims.  Pp. 258-259. 

2.  As neither of the courts below addressed the merits of petitioners' 
constitutional  claims  or  even  the  sufficiency  of  their  pleadings,  this 
Court will not do so in the first instance here.  Pp. 259-260.

I 
Because this case comes to us on a motion to dismiss under Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  12(b)(6),  we  assume  the 

truth of the facts as alleged in petitioners' complaint.  Dur-ing  the  2000-2001  school  year,  the  daughter  of  petitioners 
Lisa  and  Robert  Fitzgerald  was  a  kindergarten  student  in the  Barnstable,  Massachusetts,  school  system,  and  rode  the 
bus  to  school  each  morning.  One  day  she  told  her  parents that,  whenever  she  wore  a  dress,  a  third-grade  boy  on  the 
school bus would bully her into lifting her skirt.  Lisa Fitz-gerald  immediately  called  the  school  principal,  Frederick 
Scully, who arranged a meeting later that day with the Fitz-geralds,  their  daughter,  and  another  school  official,  Lynda 
Day.  Scully and Day then questioned the alleged bully, who denied the allegations.  Day also interviewed the bus driver 
and several students who rode the bus.  She concluded that she could not corroborate the girl's version of the events. 

The Fitzgeralds' daughter then provided new details of the alleged  abuse  to  her  parents,  who  relayed  them  to  Scully. 
Specifically, she told her parents that in addition to bullying her  into  raising  her  skirt,  the  boy  coerced  her  into  pulling 
down her underpants and spreading her legs.  Scully sched-uled  a  second  meeting  with  the  Fitzgeralds  to  discuss  the 
additional  details  and  again  questioned  the  boy  and  other students. 

Meanwhile, the local police department conducted an inde-pendent  investigation  and  concluded  there  was  insufficient 
evidence  to  bring  criminal  charges  against  the  boy.  Based partly  on  the  police  investigation  and  partly  on  the  school's 
own  investigation,  Scully  similarly  concluded  there  was  in-sufficient evidence to warrant discipline.  Scully did propose 
remedial measures to the Fitzgeralds.  He suggested trans-ferring  their  daughter  to  a  different  bus  or  leaving  rows  of 
empty seats between the kindergarteners and older students

Opinion of the Court 
on the original bus.  The Fitzgeralds felt that these propos-
als punished their daughter instead of the boy and countered 
with  alternative  proposals.  They  suggested  transferring 
the boy to a different bus or placing a monitor on the original 
bus.  The  Barnstable  school  system's  superintendent,  Rus-
sell Dever, did not act on these proposals. 

The Fitzgeralds began  driving their daughter to school to 
avoid  further  bullying  on  the  bus,  but  she  continued  to  re-
port  unsettling  incidents  at  school.  The  Fitzgeralds  re-
ported  each  incident  to  Scully.  The  Fitzgeralds'  daughter 
had an unusual number of absences during the remainder of 
the school year. 

In  April  2002,  the  Fitzgeralds  filed  suit  in  District  Court, 
alleging that the school system's response to their allegations 
of  sexual  harassment  had  been  inadequate,  resulting  in  fur-
ther  harassment  to  their  daughter.  Their  complaint  in-
cluded: (1) a claim for violation of Title IX against the Barn-
stable  School  Committee  (the  school  system's  governing 
body),  (2)  claims  under  42  U. S. C.  $ 1983  for  violations  of 
Title IX  and the  Equal  Protection  Clause of  the  Fourteenth 
Amendment  against  the  school  committee  and  Dever,  and 
(3)  Massachusetts  state-law  claims  against  the  school  com-
mittee  and  Dever.  The  school  committee  and  Dever  (re-
spondents here), filed a motion to dismiss, which the District 
Court  granted  as  to  the  $ 1983  claims  and  the  state-law 
claims.  On  the  Title  IX  claim,  the  school  committee  filed  a 
motion for summary judgment, which the District Court also 
granted.  Hunter v.  Barnstable School Comm., 456 F. Supp. 
2d 255, 266 (Mass. 2006). 

The  Court  of  Appeals  for the  First  Circuit  affirmed.  504 
F.  3d  165.  Turning  first  to  the  Title  IX  claim  against  the 
school committee, the court noted three points that were not 
in dispute: (1) The school committee was the recipient of fed-
eral  funds  and  was  therefore  subject  to  Title  IX,  (2)  the

Opinion of the Court 
school  committee  had  actual  knowledge  of  the  harassment 
the  Fitzgeralds'  daughter  suffered, and (3)  if the  allegations 
of the complaint were true, the harassment was "severe, per-
vasive,  and  objectively  offensive."  Id.,  at  172.  The  court 
concluded  that  the  Fitzgeralds'  Title  IX  claim  lacked  merit, 
however,  because  the  response  of  the  school  committee  and 
Dever to the reported harassment had been  objectively rea-
sonable.  Id., at 175. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  turned  next  to  the  Fitzgeralds' 

$ 1983  claims.  Relying  on  this  Court's  precedents  in 
Middlesex  County  Sewerage  Authority  v.  National  Sea 
Clammers Assn.,  453 U. S. 1 (1981),  Smith v.  Robinson, 468 
U. S.  992  (1984),  and  Rancho  Palos  Verdes  v.  Abrams,  544 
U. S.  113  (2005),  the  court  characterized  Title  IX's  implied 
private  remedy  as  "sufficiently  comprehensive"  to  preclude 
use  of  $ 1983  to  advance  statutory  claims  based  on  Title  IX 
itself.  504  F.  3d,  at  179.  This  reasoning,  the  court  held, 
"appl[ied]  with  equal  force"  to  the  constitutional  claims. 
Ibid.  The  court  concluded  that  "Congress  saw  Title  IX  as 
the  sole  means  of  vindicating  the  constitutional  right  to  be 
free  from  gender  discrimination  perpetrated  by  educational 
institutions."  Ibid. 

The Court  of Appeals' decision deepened a  conflict among 
the  Circuits  regarding  whether  Title  IX  precludes  use  of 

$ 1983  to  redress  unconstitutional  gender  discrimination  in 
schools.  Compare  Bruneau  ex  rel.  Schofield  v.  South 
Kortright Central School Dist., 163 F. 3d 749, 758-759 (CA2 
1998);  Waid  v.  Merrill  Area  Public  Schools,  91  F.  3d  857, 
862-863  (CA7  1996);  Pfeiffer  v.  Marion  Center  Area  School 
Dist.,  917  F.  2d  779,  789  (CA3  1990),  with  Communities  for 
Equity  v.  Michigan  High  School  Athletic  Assn.,  459  F.  3d 
676, 691 (CA6 2006); Crawford v.  Davis, 109 F. 3d 1281, 1284 
(CA8  1997);  Seamons  v.  Snow,  84  F.  3d  1226,  1234  (CA10 
1996).  We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  this  conflict,  553 
U. S. 1093 (2008), and we now reverse.

252  FITZGERALD  v.  BARNSTABLE  SCHOOL  COMM. 

Opinion of the Court 

II  

A  

In relevant part, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides: 

"Every  person  who,  under  color  of  any  statute,  ordi-nance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Ter-

ritory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be  subjected,  any  citizen  of  the  United  States  or  other 
person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of  any  rights,  privileges,  or  immunities  secured  by  the 
Constitution  and  laws,  shall  be  liable  to  the  party  in-jured  in  an action at law, suit in  equity, or other  proper 
proceeding for redress." 
In  three  cases,  this  Court  has  found  that  statutory  enact-ments precluded claims under this  statute.  Sea Clammers, 

supra;  Smith,  supra;  Rancho  Palos  Verdes,  supra.  These cases establish that "[t]he crucial consideration is what Con-
gress intended."  Smith, 468 U. S., at 1012.  If Congress in-tended a statute's remedial scheme to "be the exclusive ave-
nue through which a plaintiff may assert [the] claims," id., at  1009,  the  $ 1983  claims  are  precluded.  See 

Rancho  Palos Verdes,  544  U. S.,  at  120-121  ("The  critical  question,  then, 

is  whether  Congress  meant  the  judicial  remedy  expressly authorized  by  [the  statute]  to  coexist  with  an  alternative 
remedy available in a $ 1983 action"). In those cases in which the $ 1983 claim is based on a statu-
tory  right,  "evidence  of  such  congressional  intent  may  be found  directly  in  the  statute  creating  the  right,  or  inferred 
from  the  statute's  creation  of  a  comprehensive  enforcement scheme  that  is  incompatible  with  individual  enforcement 
under  $ 1983."  Id.,  at  120  (internal  quotation  marks  omit-ted).  In  cases  in  which  the  $ 1983  claim  alleges  a  constitu-
tional violation, lack of congressional intent may be inferred from  a  comparison  of  the  rights  and  protections  of  the  stat-
ute  and  those  existing  under  the  Constitution.  Where  the contours of such rights and protections diverge in significant

Opinion of the Court 
ways,  it  is  not  likely  that  Congress  intended  to  displace $ 1983 suits enforcing constitutional rights.  Our conclusions 

regarding  congressional  intent  can  be  confirmed  by  a  stat-ute's  context.

Opinion of the Court 
detailed  remedial  scheme  in  concluding  that  Congress  in-tended  the  statute  to  provide  the  sole  avenue  for  relief. 

Smith,  supra,  at  1011  (noting  "the  comprehensive  nature  of the  procedures  and  guarantees  set  out  in  the  [statute]  and 
Congress'  express  efforts  to  place  on  local  and  state  educa-tional  agencies  the  primary  responsibility  for  developing  a 
plan  to  accommodate  the  needs  of  each  individual  handi-capped child"). 

In  Rancho  Palos  Verdes,  we  again  focused  on  a  statute's remedial  scheme  in  inferring  congressional  intent  for  exclu-
sivity.  After  being  denied  a  permit  to  build  a  radio  tower on  his  property,  the  plaintiff  brought  claims  for  injunctive 
relief  under  the  Telecommunications  Act  of  1996  (TCA)  and for  damages  and  attorney's  fees  under  $ 1983.  Noting  that 
the TCA provides highly detailed and restrictive administra-tive  and  judicial  remedies,  and  explaining  that  "limitations 
upon the remedy contained in the statute are deliberate and are  not  to  be  evaded  through  $ 1983,"  we  again  concluded 
that Congress must have intended the statutory remedies to be exclusive.  544 U. S., at 124. 

In  all  three  cases,  the  statutes  at  issue  required  plaintiffs to comply with particular procedures and/or to exhaust par-
ticular  administrative  remedies  prior  to  filing  suit.  Sea Clammers,  supra, at  6;  Smith,  supra,  at  1011-1012;  Rancho 
Palos  Verdes,  supra,  at  122.  Offering  plaintiffs  a  direct route to court via $ 1983 would have circumvented these pro-
cedures and given plaintiffs access to tangible benefits--such as  damages,  attorney's  fees,  and  costs--that  were  unavail-
able  under  the  statutes.1  "Allowing  a  plaintiff  to  circum-

1 The  statutes  at  issue  in  Sea  Clammers  and  Smith  did  not  allow  for 
damages.  The statute at issue in Rancho Palos Verdes did not expressly 
allow  for  damages,  but  some  lower  courts  interpreted  it  to  do  so.  The 
statutes  at  issue  in  Smith  and  Rancho  Palos  Verdes  did  not  allow  for 
attorney's  fees  and  costs.  See  Sea  Clammers,  453  U. S.,  at  6-7,  13-14

Smith, 468 U. S., at 1012.  B

Section 901(a) of Title IX provides: 

"No  person  in  the  United  States  shall,  on  the  basis  of sex,  be  excluded  from  participation  in,  be  denied  the 

benefits  of,  or  be  subjected  to  discrimination  under  any education  program  or  activity  receiving  Federal  finan-
cial assistance."  20 U. S. C. $ 1681(a). 
The statute's only express enforcement mechanism, $ 1682, is an  administrative  procedure  resulting  in  the  withdrawal  of 

federal  funding  from  institutions  that  are  not  in  compliance. In  addition,  this  Court  has  recognized  an  implied  private 
right of action.  Cannon v.  University of Chicago, 441 U. S. 677,  717  (1979).  In  a  suit  brought  pursuant  to  this  private 
right,  both  injunctive  relief  and  damages  are  available. 
Franklin  v.  Gwinnett  County  Public  Schools,  503  U. S.  60, 76 (1992). 

These  remedies--withdrawal  of  federal  funds  and  an  im-plied cause of action--stand in stark contrast to the "unusu-
ally  elaborate,"  "carefully  tailored,"  and  "restrictive"  en-forcement schemes of the statutes at issue in Sea Clammers, 
Smith,  and  Rancho  Palos  Verdes.  Unlike  those  statutes, Title  IX  has  no  administrative  exhaustion  requirement  and 
no  notice  provisions.  Under  its  implied  private  right of  ac-tion,  plaintiffs  can  file  directly  in  court, 

Cannon,  supra,  at 717, and can obtain the full range of remedies, see Franklin, 

supra,  at  72  (concluding  that  "Congress  did  not  intend  to limit  the  remedies  available  in  a  suit  brought  under  Title 
IX").  As a result, parallel and concurrent $ 1983 claims will

Opinion of the Court 
neither  circumvent  required  procedures,  nor  allow  access  to new remedies. 

Moreover,  this  Court  explained  in  Rancho  Palos  Verdes that "[t]he provision of an  express, private means of redress 
in  the  statute  itself "  is  a  key  consideration  in  determining congressional  intent,  and  that  "the  existence  of  a  more  re-
strictive  private  remedy  for  statutory  violations  has  been the dividing line between those cases in which we have held 
that  an action  would  lie  under $ 1983  and  those  in  which  we have  held  that  it  would  not."  544  U. S.,  at  121  (emphasis 
added).  As noted, Title IX contains no express private rem-edy, much less a more restrictive one.  This Court has never 
held that an implied right of action had the effect of preclud-ing  suit  under  $ 1983,  likely  because  of  the  difficulty  of  dis-
cerning congressional intent in such a situation.  See Frank-lin, supra, at 76 (

Opinion of the Court 
Title  IX  reaches  institutions  and  programs  that  receive 
federal  funds,  20  U. S. C.  $ 1681(a),  which  may  include  non-
public  institutions,  $ 1681(c),  but  it  has  consistently  been  in-
terpreted  as  not  authorizing  suit  against  school  officials, 
teachers, and other individuals, see, e. g., Hartley v.  Parnell, 
193  F.  3d  1263,  1270  (CA11  1999).  The  Equal  Protection 
Clause reaches only state actors, but $ 1983 equal protection 
claims may be brought against individuals as well as munici-
palities and certain other state entities.  West v.  Atkins, 487 
U. S. 42, 48-51 (1988). 

Title  IX  exempts  from  its  restrictions  several  activities 
that  may  be  challenged  on  constitutional  grounds.  For  ex-
ample,  Title  IX  exempts  elementary  and  secondary  schools 
from  its  prohibition  against  discrimination  in  admissions, 

$ 1681(a)(1); it exempts military service schools and tradition-
ally  single-sex  public  colleges  from  all  of  its  provisions, 

$$ 1681(a)(4)-(5).  Some  exempted  activities  may  form  the 
basis  of  equal  protection  claims.  See  United  States  v.  Vir-
ginia,  518  U. S.  515,  534  (1996)  (men-only  admissions  policy 
at  Virginia  Military  Institute  violated  the  Equal  Protection 
Clause);  Mississippi  Univ.  for  Women  v.  Hogan,  458  U. S. 
718,  731  (1982)  (women-only  admission  policy  at  a  tradition-
ally  single-sex  public  college  violated  the  Equal  Protection 
Clause). 

Even where particular activities and particular defendants 
are subject to both Title IX and the Equal Protection Clause, 
the  standards  for  establishing  liability  may  not  be  wholly 
congruent.  For  example,  a  Title  IX  plaintiff  can  establish 
school  district  liability  by  showing  that  a  single  school  ad-
ministrator  with  authority  to  take  corrective  action  re-
sponded to harassment with deliberate indifference.  Gebser 
v.  Lago  Vista  Independent  School  Dist.,  524  U. S.  274,  290 
(1998).  A plaintiff stating a similar claim via $ 1983 for vio-
lation  of  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  by  a  school  district  or 
other  municipal  entity  must  show  that  the  harassment  was

the  result  of  municipal  custom,  policy,  or  practice.  Monell v.  New  York  City  Dept.  of  Social  Servs.,  436  U. S.  658,  694 

(1978). In  light  of  the  divergent  coverage  of  Title  IX  and  the 
Equal Protection Clause, as well as the absence of a compre-hensive remedial scheme comparable to those at issue in Sea 
Clammers,  Smith,  and  Rancho  Palos  Verdes,  we  conclude that  Title  IX  was  not  meant  to  be  an  exclusive  mechanism 
for  addressing  gender  discrimination  in  schools,  or  a  substi-tute  for  $ 1983  suits  as  a  means  of  enforcing  constitutional 
rights.  Accordingly,  we  hold  that  $ 1983  suits  based  on  the Equal Protection  Clause remain  available  to plaintiffs alleg-
ing unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools. 

3 
This  conclusion  is  consistent  with  Title  IX's  context  and history.  In  enacting  Title  IX,  Congress  amended  $ 902,  78 

Stat.  267,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000h-2,  to  authorize  the  Attorney General to intervene in private suits alleging discrimination 
on  the  basis  of  sex  in  violation  of  the  Equal  Protection Clause.  See  $ 906,  86  Stat.  375  (adding  the  term  "sex"  to 
the  listed  grounds,  which  already  included  race,  color,  reli-gion,  or  national  origin).  Accordingly,  it  appears  that  the 
Congress that enacted Title IX explicitly envisioned that pri-vate plaintiffs would bring constitutional claims to challenge 
gender discrimination; it must have recognized that plaintiffs would do so via 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. 

Moreover, Congress modeled Title IX after Title VI of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964, 

Cannon, 441  U. S., at 694-695,  and passed Title IX with the explicit understanding that it would 

be  interpreted  as  Title  VI  was,  id.,  at  696.  At  the  time  of Title  IX's  enactment  in  1972,  Title  VI  was  routinely  inter-
preted to allow for parallel and concurrent $ 1983 claims, see, e. g., Alvarado v.  El Paso Independent School Dist., 445 F. 2d 
1011  (CA5  1971);  Nashville  I-40  Steering  Comm.  v.  Elling-
ton, 387  F.  2d  179  (CA6  1967);  Bossier  Parish  School  Bd.  v.

Opinion of the Court 
Lemon, 370 F. 2d 847 (CA5 1967), and we presume Congress was aware of this when it passed Title IX, see 

Franklin, 503 
U. S.,  at  71  (in  assessing  Congress'  intent,  "we  evaluate  the state of the law when the Legislature passed Title IX").  In 

the  absence  of  any  contrary  evidence,  it  follows  that  Con-gress  intended  Title  IX  to  be  interpreted  similarly  to  allow 
for  parallel  and  concurrent  $ 1983  claims.  At  the  least,  this 
indicates that Congress did not affirmatively intend Title IX to preclude such claims.

One matter remains.  Respondents contend that the judg-
ment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  should  be  affirmed  on  inde-
pendent  grounds--namely,  that  the  Fitzgeralds  have  no  ac-
tionable  $ 1983  claim  on  which  to  proceed.  They  contend 
that  the  Court  of  Appeals'  holding  that  neither  the  school 
committee  nor  Dever  acted  with  deliberate  indifference  is 
conclusive  and  forecloses  a  $ 1983  constitutional  claim  based 
on  a similar  theory of  liability.  They contend  that  all  other 

$ 1983  constitutional  claims  on  these  facts  are  precluded  by 
the  Fitzgeralds'  failure  to  allege  such  claims  adequately  or

2 Respondents argue that constitutional protections against gender dis-
crimination were minimal in 1972, as the only gender-based equal protec-
tion  case  this  Court  had  decided  employed  a  rational-basis  standard. 
Reed v.  Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971).  But see Gunther, In Search of Evol-
ving  Doctrine  on a  Changing  Court: A Model for a Newer  Equal  Protec-
tion,  86  Harv.  L.  Rev.  1,  34  (1972)  (Reed  exemplified  the  application  of 
rationality  review  "with  bite").  They  further  argue  that  because  Con-
gress  could  not  have  viewed  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  as  offering  a 
meaningful  remedy  for  sex  discrimination  by  schools,  it  could  not  have 
envisioned  and  intended  for  Title  IX  and  $ 1983  constitutional  claims  to 
proceed side by side.  But the relevant question is not whether Congress 
envisioned that the two types of claims would proceed together in address-
ing gender discrimination in schools; it is whether Congress affirmatively 
intended to preclude this result.  The limited nature of constitutional pro-
tections  against  gender  discrimination  in  1972  offers  no  evidence  that 
Congress did.

260  FITZGERALD  v.  BARNSTABLE  SCHOOL  COMM. 

Opinion of the Court 
The  Fitzgeralds  respond  that  they  have  no  intention  of relitigating  the  issue  of  deliberate  indifference.  They  in-

tend, they say, to advance claims of discriminatory treatment in the investigation of student behavior and in the treatment 
of  student  complaints,  which  they  were  foreclosed  from  de-veloping  at  the  earliest  stages  of  litigation  by  the  dismissal 
of the $ 1983 claims. As the Fitzgeralds note, no court has addressed the merits 
of  their  constitutional  claims  or  even  the  sufficiency  of  their pleadings.  Ordinarily, "we do not decide in the first instance 
issues  not  decided  below,"  National  Collegiate  Athletic 
Assn. v.  Smith, 525 U. S. 459, 470 (1999), and we  see no rea-son for doing so here. 

Accordingly,  we  reverse  the  Court  of  Appeals'  judgment that  the  District  Court's  dismissal  of  the  $ 1983  claims  was 
proper and remand this case for further proceedings consist-ent with this opinion. 

It is so ordered.

Opinion of the Court 
The District Court granted summary judgment for Metro. 
It held that Crawford could not satisfy the opposition clause 
because  she  had  not  "instigated  or  initiated  any  complaint," 
but  had  "merely  answered  questions  by  investigators  in  an 
already-pending internal investigation, initiated by someone 
else."  Memorandum  Opinion,  No.  3:03-cv-0996  (MD  Tenn., 
Jan. 6, 2005), App. C to Pet. for Cert. 16a-17a.  It concluded 
that  her  claim  also  failed  under  the  participation  clause, 
which  Sixth  Circuit  precedent  confined  to  protecting  " `an 
employee's  participation  in  an  employer's  internal  inves-
tigation . . .  where  that  investigation  occurs  pursuant  to 
a  pending  EEOC  charge' "  (not  the  case  here).  Id.,

Less certain rules could force plan administrators to examine numerous 
external documents purporting to be waivers and draw them into litiga-
tion like this over those waivers' meaning and enforceability.  The guar-
antee  of  simplicity  is  not  absolute,  since  a  QDRO's  enforceability  may 
require an administrator to look for beneficiaries outside plan documents 
notwithstanding  $ 1104(a)(1)(D).  But  an  administrator  enforcing  a 
QDRO must be said to enforce plan documents, not ignore them, and a 
QDRO enquiry is relatively discrete, given its specific and objective cri-
teria.  These  are  good  and  sufficient  reasons  for  holding  the  line,  just 
as the Court did in holding that ERISA preempted state laws that could 
blur  the bright-line  requirement  to  follow  plan  documents in  distribut-
ing  benefits.  See  Boggs,

Opinion of the Court 
The  SIP  is  an  ERISA  " `employee  pension  benefit  plan,' " 497  F.  3d  426,  427  (CA5  2007);  29  U. S. C.  $ 1002(2),  and  the 

parties  do  not  dispute  that  the  plan  satisfies  ERISA's  anti-alienation  provision,  $ 1056(d)(1),  which  requires  it  to  "pro-
vide  that  benefits  provided  under  the  plan  may  not  be  as-signed  or  alienated." 

1  The  plan  does,  however,  permit  a 

beneficiary  to  submit  a  "qualified  disclaimer"  of  benefits  as defined under the Tax Code, see 26 U. S. C. $ 2518, which has 

the  effect  of  switching  the  beneficiary  to  an  "alternate  .  .  . determined  according  to  a  valid  beneficiary  designation 
made by the deceased."  Supp. Record 86-87 (Exh. 15). In  1971,  William  married  Liv  Kennedy,  and,  in  1974,  he 
signed a form designating her to take benefits under the SIP, but  naming  no  contingent  beneficiary  to  take  if  she  dis-
claimed  her  interest.  497  F.  3d,  at  427.  William  and  Liv divorced in 1994, subject to a decree that Liv "is . . . divested 
of  all  right,  title,  interest,  and  claim  in  and  to  .  .  .  [a]ny  and all sums . . . the proceeds [from], and any other rights related 
to any . . . retirement plan, pension plan, or like benefit pro-gram  existing  by  reason  of  [William's]  past  or  present  or 

future  employment."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  64-65.  Wil-liam did not, however, execute any documents removing Liv 
as  the  SIP  beneficiary,  497  F.  3d,  at  428,  even  though  he did  execute  a  new  beneficiary-designation  form  naming  his 
daughter,  Kari  Kennedy,  as  the  beneficiary  under  DuPont's Pension and Retirement Plan, also governed by ERISA. 

On  William's  death  in  2001,  petitioner  Kari  Kennedy  was named  executrix  and  asked  DuPont  to  distribute  the  SIP 

1 The plan states that "[e]xcept as provided by Section 401(a)(13) of the 
[Internal  Revenue]  Code,  no  assignment  of  the  rights  or  interests  of  ac-
count  holders  under  this  Plan  will  be  permitted  or  recognized,  nor  shall 
such rights or interests be subject to attachment or other legal processes 
for debts."  App. 50-51.  Title 26 U. S. C. $ 401(a)(13)(A), in language sub-
stantially  tracking  the  text  of  $ 1056(d)(1),  provides  that  "[a]  trust  shall 
not constitute a qualified trust under this section unless the plan of which 
such  trust  is  a  part  provides  that  benefits  provided  under  the  plan  may 
not be assigned or alienated."

the waiver as an "arrangement" having the indirect effect of 
a  transfer  to  the  next  possible  beneficiary,  it  would  be  odd 
usage to speak of an estate as the transferee of its own dece-
dent's property, just as it  would be to speak of the decedent 
in  his  lifetime  as  his  own  transferee.  And  treating  the  es-
tate  or  even  the  ultimate  estate  beneficiary  as  the  assignee 
or transferee would be strange under the terms of the regu-
lation: it would be hard to say the estate or future beneficiary 
"acquires" a right or interest when at the time of the waiver 
there  was  no  estate  and  the  beneficiary  of  a  future  estate 
might  be  anyone's  guess.  If  there  were  a  contingent  bene-
ficiary  (or  the  participant  made  a  subsequent  designation) 
the estate would get no interest; as for an estate beneficiary, 
the  identity  could  ultimately  turn  on  the  law  of  intestacy 
applied  to  facts  as  yet  unknown,  or  on  the  contents  of  the 
participant's  subsequent  will,  or  simply  on  the  participant's 
future  exercise  of  (or  failure  to  invoke)  the  power  to  desig-
nate  a  new beneficiary  directly  under  the  terms of  the  plan. 
Thus,  if  such  a  waiver  created  an  "arrangement"  assigning 
or  transferring  anything  under  the  statute,  the  assignor 
would  be  blindfolded,  operating,  at  best,  on  the  fringe  of 
what "assignment" or "alienation" normally suggests. 

The  questionability  of  this  broad  reading  is  confirmed  by 
exceptions  to  it  that  are  apparent  right  off  the  bat.  Take 
the  case  of a  surviving  spouse's  interest in  pension  benefits, 
for  example.  Depending  on  the  circumstances,  a  surviving 
spouse  has  a  right  to  a  survivor's  annuity  or  to  a  lump-sum 
payment  on  the  death  of  the  participant,  unless  the  spouse 
has  waived  the  right  and  the  participant  has  eliminated 
the  survivor  annuity  benefit  or  designated  a  different  ben-
eficiary.  See  Boggs,

$ 1056(d)(3)(B)(i)(I).  There is no QDRO for a simple waiver; there  must  be  some  succeeding  designation  of  an  alternate 
payee.8  Not  being  a  mechanism  for  simply  renouncing  a claim  to  benefits,  then,  the  QDRO  provisions  shed  no  light 
on whether a beneficiary may waive by a non-QDRO. In  sum,  Liv  did  not  attempt  to  direct  her  interest  in  the 
SIP benefits to the Estate or any other potential beneficiary, and  accordingly  we  think  that  the  better  view  is  that  her 
waiver  did  not  constitute  an  assignment  or  alienation  ren-dered void under the terms of $ 1056(d)(1). 

B 
DuPont  has  three  other  reasons  for  saying  that  Liv's waiver was barred by ERISA.  They are unavailing. 

First,  it  argues  that  even  if  the  waiver  is  not  an  assign-ment  or  alienation  barred  under  the  terms  of  $ 1056(d)(1), 

$ 1056(d)(3)(A) still prohibits it, in providing that $ 1056(d)(1) "shall  apply  to  the  creation,  assignment,  or  recognition  of  a 
right  to  any  benefit  payable  with  respect  to  a  participant pursuant to a domestic relations order [that is not a QDRO]." 
At  the  very  least,  DuPont  reasons,  Liv's  waiver  included  a "recognition" of William's rights with respect to the SIP ben-
efits.  But DuPont overlooks the point that when subsection (d)(3)(A) provides that the bar to assignments or alienations 
extends to  non-QDROs,  it  does  nothing to expand  the  scope of  prohibited  assignment  and  alienation  under  subsection 
(d)(1).  Whether Liv's  action is  seen as  a  waiver  or as a  do-mestic relations order that incorporated a waiver, subsection 

8 Even if one understands Liv's waiver to have resulted somehow in her 
interest reverting to William, he does not qualify as an "alternate payee," 
which is defined by statute as "any spouse, former spouse, child, or other 
dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order 
as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under 
a plan with respect to such participant."  29 U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(3)(K).

ERISA preempts "any and all State laws insofar as they may now  or  hereafter  relate  to  any  employee  benefit  plan,"  with 

"State  law"  being  defined  to  include  "decisions"  or  "other State  action  having  the  effect  of  law." 

9  $$ 1144(a),  (c)(1). 

DuPont  says  that  Liv's  waiver,  expressed  in  a  state-court decision  and  related  to  an  employee  benefit  plan,  is  thus 

preempted.  But  recognizing  a  waiver  in  a  divorce  decree would not be giving effect to state law; the argument is that 
the waiver should be treated as a creature of federal common law, in which case its setting in a state divorce decree would 
be  only  happenstance.  A  court  would  merely  be  applying federal law to a document that might also have independent 
significance  under  state  law.  See,  e.

threat that $ 1673 was meant to counter.  But the same injury will occur 
if a SWU contract is untouchable.  Under a SWU contract, the domestic 
utility pays  cash  to a  third  party for  unenriched  uranium and  provides 
this along with additional cash in exchange for LEU; any EUP contract 
could be structured as a SWU contract simply by splitting the transac-
tion  in  two,  one  contract  to  buy  unenriched  uranium  and  another  to 
enrich  it.  And  the  restructuring  would  not  stop  with  uranium;  con-
tracts for many types of goods would be replaced by separate contracts 
for the goods and for processing services, and antidumping duties would 
primarily  chastise  the  uncreative.  The  Department's  attempt  to  fore-
close  this absurd result by treating  such  transactions as sales of goods 
is eminently reasonable.  Pp. 316-322.

enhanced to 20 percent or more is weapons-grade, highly en-riched  uranium,  whereas  LEU  has  a  U-235  assay  of  3  to 

5  percent,  making  it  useful  as  nuclear  fuel.  One  way  to produce LEU, and the method at issue in these cases, is gas-
eous  diffusion,1  whereby  gaseous  feed  uranium  is  pushed through  a  long  series  of  filters,  separating  the  gas  into  two 
streams.  The stream passing through the filters (the "prod-uct  stream")  gains  a  higher  concentration  of  the  lighter 
U-235  isotope  than  the  stream  that  is  filtered  out  (the "tails").  Because the concentration reached at each individ-
ual filter is  minor, the gas  must be forced through hundreds or even thousands of filters, at great expenditure of electric-
ity,  before  the  product  stream  reaches  the  desired  assay. The  amount  of  energy  required  to  enrich  a  quantity  of  feed 
uranium to a given assay is measured in terms of an industry standard  called  a  "separative  work  unit"  or  SWU  (pro-
nounced  "swoo").  In  practice,  however,  a  given  degree  of enrichment  will  depend  on  adjusting  the  quantities  of  two 
separate  variables,  feed  uranium  and  electricity,  in  inverse proportions.  Thus, if the electric rate is stable but the value 
of  feed  uranium  falls,  an  enricher  may  produce  LEU  by "overfeeding," subjecting a greater quantity of feed uranium 
to fewer SWUs, and when the value of feed uranium goes up and electricity does not, "underfeeding" can use more SWUs 
to squeeze extra U-235 from the tails. Nuclear  utilities  generally  get  LEU  in  one  of  two  ways. 
Under  an  "enriched  uranium  product"  or  "EUP"  contract,  a utility simply buys  a desired quantity and assay of LEU for 
cash.  Under a "SWU contract," the utility provides a quan-tity  of feed  uranium and  pays  the  enricher for  the  SWUs  to 
produce the quantity and assay of LEU called for.2  Despite 

1 LEU  can  also  be  produced  through  a  centrifuge  method  or  by  back-
blending unenriched uranium with weapons-grade uranium. 

2 Many SWU contracts give the utility the option of providing a compa-

rable quantity of uranium concentrate in lieu of the specified feed uranium.

Opinion of the Court 
In  approaching  the  Department's  position  on  the  applica-tion  of  $ 1673,  two  threshold  propositions  must  be  taken  as 

given.  First,  we  think  the  Department  reasonably  con-cluded  that  $ 1673  is  not  limited  by  its  terms  to  cash-only 
sales.  Otherwise, any sale of a manufactured product could be  exempted  from  the  operation  of  $ 1673  by  a  contractual 
term  stating  part  of  the  purchase  price  in  terms  of  a 
commodity.8 Second,  in  applying  $ 1673,  the  Commerce  Department  is 

not  bound  by  the  "legal  fiction  [created  by  SWU  contracts] that  the  very  feed  uranium  delivered  by  a  utility  to  an  en-
richer is  enriched and then returned as LEU to the utility."

And when the manufacturer is not only free to return differ-ent  material,  but  also  substantially  transforms  the  material 

it  uses,  it  is  even  more  likely  that  the  object  of  the  transac-tion  will  be  seen  as  a  new  product,  not  work  on  enduring 
material  of  primary  interest  to  the  buyer.  After  all,  what makes  the  hypothetical  exchange  of  sand  for  silicon  proces-
sors so obviously a sale of goods is the extreme transforma-
tion brought about by the chip manufacturer. These  are  good  analytical  grounds  to  show  that  SWU 

transactions  are  reasonably  placed  within  the  ambit  of  sale of goods, and the Department's reliance on them is reinforced 
by practical reasons aimed at preserving the effectiveness of antidumping  duties.  There  is  no  dispute  that  LEU  sold 
under  an  EUP  contract  at  less  than  fair  value  must  be  sub-jected  to  antidumping  duties  under  $ 1673,  there  being  a 
clear sale of goods when a domestic utility pays a single sale price  in  cash  for  the  feed  uranium  and  enrichment  compo-
nents  represented  by  LEU.  If  foreign  enrichers  set  this 
price  below  the  fair  value  of  LEU,  the  domestic  enrichment 
industry is obviously open to material injury, the very threat 
the  antidumping  statute  was  meant  to  counter,  see  H.  R. 
Rep.  No.  1,  at  23.  But  the  same  injury  would  occur  if  a 
SWU  contract  were  untouchable.  Under  a  SWU  contract, 
the domestic utility pays cash to a third party for unenriched 
uranium  and  provides  this  along  with  additional  cash  in  ex-
change for LEU; any EUP contract could be structured as a 
SWU contract simply by splitting the transaction in two, one 
contract  to  buy  unenriched  uranium  and  another  to  enrich 
it.11  And  the  restructuring  would  not  stop  with  uranium; 

11 This  would  be  particularly  easy  in  these  cases,  since  COGEMA,  Eu-
rodif's parent company, "is a major world supplier of natural uranium for 
the  production  of  LEU."  Final  Remand  Determination,  App.  G  to  Pet. 
for Cert. 221a, n.  38.  In fact, many SWU contracts provide that if a util-
ity fails to deliver feed uranium, the enricher will substitute feed uranium 
of its own, which may then be purchased from the enricher.  App. 13-14,

mitting  this  suit  to  go  forward  would  also  create  practical  anomalies. 
A  trial  prosecutor  would  remain  immune  for  intentional  misconduct, 
while  her  supervisor  might  be  liable  for  negligent  training  or  supervi-
sion.  And  the  ease  with  which  a  plaintiff  could  restyle  a  complaint 
charging  trial  failure  to  one  charging  a  training  or  supervision  failure 
would eviscerate Imbler.  Pp. 346-348. 

(3)  The  differences  between  an  information  management  system 
and  training  or  supervision  do  not  require  a  different  outcome,  for  the 
critical  element  of  any  information  system  is  the  information  it  con-
tains.  Deciding what to include and what not to include is little differ-
ent  from  making  similar  decisions  regarding  training,  for  it  requires 
knowledge  of  the  law.  Moreover,  were  this  claim  allowed,  a  court 
would  have  to  review  the  office's  legal  judgments,  not  simply  about 
whether  to  have  an  information  system  but  also  about  what  kind  of 
system  is  appropriate,  and whether  an  appropriate  system would  have 
included  Giglio-related  information  about  one  particular  kind  of  in-
formant.  Such  decisions--whether  made  before  or  during  trial--are

Opinion of the Court 
U. S. C.  $ 1983.  See  Imbler  v.  Pachtman,  424  U. S.  409 (1976).  We  ask  whether  that  immunity  extends  to  claims 

that the prosecution failed to disclose impeachment material, see Giglio v.  United States, 405 U. S. 150 (1972), due to: (1) a 
failure properly to train prosecutors, (2) a failure properly to supervise  prosecutors,  or  (3)  a  failure  to  establish  an  infor-
mation  system  containing  potential  impeachment  material about informants.  We conclude that a prosecutor's absolute 
immunity extends to all these claims. 

I 
In  1998,  respondent  Thomas  Goldstein  (then  a  prisoner) filed a habeas corpus action in the Federal District Court for 

the  Central  District  of  California.  He  claimed  that  in  1980 he was convicted of murder;  that his conviction depended in 
critical  part  upon  the  testimony  of  Edward  Floyd  Fink,  a jailhouse informant; that Fink's testimony was unreliable, in-
deed  false;  that  Fink  had  previously  received  reduced  sen-tences  for  providing  prosecutors  with  favorable  testimony 

in  other  cases;  that  at  least  some  prosecutors  in  the  Los Angeles  County  District  Attorney's  Office  knew  about  the 
favorable  treatment;  that  the  office  had  not  provided  Gold-stein's attorney with that information; and that, among other 
things, the prosecution's failure to provide Goldstein's attor-ney  with  this  potential  impeachment  information  had  led  to 
his  erroneous  conviction.  Goldstein  v.  Long  Beach,  481 F. 3d 1170, 1171-1172 (CA9 2007). 

After  an  evidentiary  hearing  the  District  Court  agreed with  Goldstein  that  Fink  had  not  been  truthful  and  that  if 
the  prosecution  had  told  Goldstein's  lawyer  that  Fink  had received  prior  rewards  in  return  for  favorable  testimony  it 
might have made a difference.  The court ordered the State either to grant Goldstein a new trial or to release him.  The 
Court  of  Appeals  affirmed  the  District  Court's  determina-tion.  And  the  State  decided  that,  rather  than  retry  Gold-
stein  (who  had  already  served  24  years  of  his  sentence),  it would release him.  App. 54-55, 59-60.

Opinion of the Court 
Court  considered  prosecutorial  actions  that  are  "intimately associated  with  the  judicial  phase  of  the  criminal  process." 

Id.,  at  430.  And,  referring  to  Chief  Judge  Hand's  views,  it held  that  prosecutors  are  absolutely  immune  from  liability 

in  $ 1983  lawsuits  brought  under  such  circumstances.  Id., at 428. 

The  $ 1983  action  at  issue  was  that  of  a  prisoner  freed  on a  wr

it  of  habeas  corpus  who  subsequently  sought  damages from his former prosecutor.  His action, like the action now 

before  us,  tracked  the  claims  that  a  federal  court  had  found valid when granting his habeas corpus petition.  In particu-
lar,  the  prisoner  claimed  that  the  trial  prosecutor  had  per-
mitted a  fingerprint expert  to  give false  testimony,  that  the 
prosecutor  was  responsible  for  the  expert's  having  sup-
pressed  important  evidence,  and  that  the  prosecutor  had 
introduced  a  misleading  artist's  sketch  into  evidence.  Id., 
at 416. 

In concluding  that the  prosecutor was absolutely immune, 
the  Court  pointed  out  that  legislators  have  long  "enjoyed 
absolute immunity  for their  official actions," id., at 417; that 
the common law granted immunity to "judges and . . . jurors 
acting within the scope of their  duties," id.,  at 423; and that 
the law had also granted prosecutors absolute immunity from 
common-law  tort  actions,  say,  those  underlying  a  "decision 
to  initiate  a  prosecution,"  id.,  at  421.  The  Court  then  held 
that the  "same considerations of public policy that underlie" 
a  prosecutor's  common-law  immunity  "countenance  absolute 
immunity under $ 1983."  Id., at 424.  Those considerations, 
the Court said, arise out of the general common-law "concern 
that  harassment  by  unfounded  litigation"  could  both  "cause 
a  deflection  of  the  prosecutor's  energies  from  his  public  du-
ties" and also lead the prosecutor to "shade his  decisions in-
stead  of  exercising  the  independence  of  judgment  required 
by his public trust."  Id., at 423. 

Where $ 1983 actions are at issue, the Court said, both sets 
of  concerns  are  present  and  serious.  The  "public  trust  of

Opinion of the Court 
"reasons  for  absolute  immunity  appl[ied]  with  full  force"  to the  conduct  at  issue  because  it  was  "intimately  associated 

with  the  judicial  phase  of  the  criminal  process."  424  U. S., at 430.  The fact that one constitutional duty at issue was a 
positive  duty  (the  duty  to  supply  "information  relevant  to the  defense")  rather  than  a  negative  duty  (the  duty  not  to 
"use  .  .  .  perjured  testimony")  made  no  difference.  Id., at  431,  n.  34.  After  all,  a  plaintiff  can  often  transform  a  posi-
tive into a negative duty simply by reframing the pleadings; in either case, a constitutional violation is at issue. 

Ibid. Finally, the Court specifically reserved the  question 

whether or when "similar reasons require immunity for those aspects of the prosecutor's responsibility that cast him in the 
role  of  an  administrator . . .  rather  than  that  of  advocate." Id.,  at  430-431.  It  said  that  "[d]rawing  a  proper  line  be-
tween  these  functions  may  present  difficult  questions,  but this  case  does  not  require  us  to  anticipate  them." 

Id.,  at 431, n. 33. 

In  the  years  since  Imbler,  we  have  held  that absolute  im-munity applies when a prosecutor prepares to initiate a judi-
cial proceeding, Burns, supra,  at 492, or appears in  court  to present evidence  in support of a search  warrant application, 
Kalina,  supra,  at  126.  We  have  held  that  absolute  immu-nity does not apply when a prosecutor gives advice to police 
during  a  criminal  investigation,  see  Burns,  supra,  at  496, when the prosecutor makes statements to the press, Buckley 
v.  Fitzsimmons, 509 U. S. 259, 277 (1993), or when a prosecu-tor  acts  as  a  complaining  witness  in  support  of  a  warrant 
application,  Kalina,  supra,  at  132  (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 

A 
We  reach  this  conclusion  by  initially  considering  a  hypo-thetical case  that  involves  supervisory  or other  office prose-

cutors  but  does  not  involve  administration.  Suppose  that Goldstein had brought such a case, seeking damages not only 
from the  trial prosecutor but also from a supervisory prose-cutor  or  from  the  trial  prosecutor's  colleagues--all  on  the 
ground that they should have found and turned over the im-peachment  material  about  Fink. 

Imbler  makes  clear  that all  these  prosecutors  would  enjoy  absolute  immunity  from 

such  a  suit.  The  prosecutors'  behavior,  taken  individually or separately, would involve "[p]reparation . . . for  . . . trial,"  
424  U. S.,  at  431,  n.  33,  and  would  be  "intimately  associated with  the  judicial  phase  of  the  criminal  process"  because  it 
concerned  the  evidence  presented  at  trial,  id.,  at  430.  And all  of  the  considerations  that  this  Court  found  to  militate  in 
favor of absolute immunity in Imbler would militate in favor of immunity in such a case. 

The  only  difference  we  can  find  between  Imbler  and  our hypothetical  case  lies  in  the  fact  that,  in  our  hypothetical 
case,  a  prosecutorial  supervisor  or  colleague  might  himself be  liable  for  damages 

instead  of  the  trial  prosecutor.  But we  cannot  find  that  difference  (in  the  pattern  of  liability 

among prosecutors within a single office) to be critical.  De-cisions  about  indictment  or  trial  prosecution  will  often  in-
volve more than one prosecutor within an office.  We do not see  how  such  differences  in  the  pattern  of  liability  among  a 
group of prosecutors in a single office could alleviate Imbler's basic fear, namely, that the threat of damages liability would 
affect  the  way  in  which  prosecutors  carried  out  their  basic court-related  tasks.  Moreover,  this  Court  has  pointed  out 
that  "it  is  the  interest  in  protecting  the  proper  functioning of  the  office,  rather  than  the  interest  in  protecting  its  occu-
pant,  that  is  of  primary  importance."  Kalina,  522  U. S.,  at 125.  Thus, we must assume that the prosecutors in our hy-
pothetical suit would enjoy absolute immunity.

Opinion of the Court 
account  of  that  risk  when  making  trial-related  decisions,  so, too, could the threat of more widespread liability throughout 

the  office  (ultimately  traceable  to  that  trial  error)  lead  both that  prosecutor  and  other  office  prosecutors  as  well  to  take 
account of such a risk.  Indeed, members of a large prosecu-torial office, when making prosecutorial decisions, could have 
in  mind  the  "consequences  in  terms  of "  damages  liability 
whether  they  are  making  general  decisions  about  supervis-ing  or training  or whether  they are  making  individual  trial-

related decisions.  Imbler, 424 U. S., at 424. Moreover,  because  better  training  or  supervision  might 
prevent most, if not all, prosecutorial errors at trial, permis-
sion  to  bring  such  a  suit  here  would  grant  permission  to 
criminal  defendants  to  bring  claims  in  other  similar  in-
stances,  in  effect  claiming  damages  for  (trial-related)  train-
ing  or  supervisory  failings.  Cf.  Imbler,  supra.  Further, 
given the complexity of the constitutional issues, inadequate 
training and supervision suits could, as in Imbler, "pose sub-
stantial  danger  of  liability  even  to  the  honest  prosecutor." 
Id., at 425.  Finally, as Imbler pointed out, defending prose-
cutorial  decisions,  often  years  after  they  were  made,  could 
impose  "unique  and  intolerable  burdens  upon  a  prosecutor 
responsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials." 
Id., at 425-426. 

At the same time, to permit this suit to go forward would 
create practical anomalies.  A trial prosecutor would remain 
immune, even for intentionally failing to turn over, say Gig-
lio material; but her supervisor might be liable for negligent 
training or supervision.  Small prosecution offices where su-
pervisors can personally participate in all of the cases would 
likewise  remain  immune  from  prosecution;  but  large  offices, 
making use of more general officewide supervision and train-
ing,  would  not.  Most  important,  the  ease  with  which  a 
plaintiff  could  restyle  a  complaint  charging  a  trial  failure  so 
that it becomes a complaint charging  a failure of training or 
supervision would eviscerate Imbler.

Opinion of the Court 
Giglio-related information about one particular kind of trial informant.  Such decisions--whether made prior to or dur-

ing  a  particular  trial--are  "intimately  associated  with  the judicial  phase  of  the  criminal  process."  Imbler,  supra,  at 
430;  see  Burns,  500  U. S.,  at  486.  And,  for  the  reasons  set out  above,  all 

Imbler's  functional  considerations  (and  the anomalies  we  mentioned  earlier,  supra,  at  346-347)  apply 

here as well. We  recognize that sometimes it  would be easy for a  court 
to  determine  that  an  office's  decision  about  an  information system  was  inadequate.  Suppose,  for  example,  the  office 
had no system at all.  But the same could be said of a prose-cutor's trial error.  Immunity does not exist to help prosecu-
tors  in  the  easy  case;  it  exists  because  the  easy  cases  bring difficult  cases  in  their  wake.  And,  as  Imbler  pointed  out, 
the likely presence of too many difficult cases threatens, not prosecutors,  but  the  public,  for  the  reason  that  it  threatens 
to  undermine  the  necessary  independence  and  integrity  of the  prosecutorial  decisionmaking  process.  Such  is  true  of 
the  kinds  of  claims  before  us,  to  all  of  which  Imbler's  func-tional  considerations  apply.  Consequently,  where  a  $ 1983 
plaintiff  claims  that  a  prosecutor's  management  of  a  trial-related information system is responsible for a constitutional 
error at his or her particular trial, the prosecutor responsible for  the  system  enjoys  absolute  immunity  just  as  would  the 
prosecutor who handled the particular trial itself. 

* * * 
For these reasons we conclude that petitioners are entitled to  absolute  immunity  in  respect  to  Goldstein's  claims  that 

their  supervision,  training,  or  information-system  manage-ment was constitutionally inadequate.  Accordingly, the 

judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  is  reversed,  and  the  case is  remanded  for  further  proceedings  consistent  with  this 
opinion. 

It is so ordered.

(b)  The ban at issue is valid at the local level.  The same deferential 
review applies whether the ban is directed at state or local governmen-
tal  entities.  Political  subdivisions  have  never  been  considered  sover-
eign entities but are instead "subordinate governmental instrumentali-
ties."  Reynolds  v.  Sims,  377  U. S.  533,  575.  The  State's  legislative 
action  is  subject  to First  Amendment scrutiny whether it  is applicable 
at the state level, the local level, both, or some subpart of either, but no 
case suggests that a different analysis applies depending on the level of

the  operation  of  government  from  partisan  politics,  and  that  interest 
extends  to  all  public  employers  at  whatever  level  of  government.

the  employee's  "signed  written  authorization,"  $ 44-2004(1). The Act covers all employees, "including all employees of the 
state and its political subdivisions."  $ 44-2011. Prior  to  2003,  employees  could  authorize  both  a  payroll 
deduction for general union dues and a payroll deduction for union political activities conducted through a political action 
committee.  App. 55-56, 83-84.  In 2003, the Idaho Legisla-ture  passed  the  Voluntary  Contributions  Act  (VCA).  2003 
Sess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho Code $$ 44-2601 through  44-2605,  and  $ 44-2004).  That  legislation,  among 
other  things,  amended  the  Right  to  Work  Act  by  adding a  prohibition  on  payroll  deductions  for  political  purposes. 
That  amendment  provides:  "Deductions  for  political  activi-ties  as  defined  in  chapter  26,  title  44,  Idaho  Code,  shall  not 
be deducted from the wages, earnings or compensation of an employee."  $ 44-2004(2).  The  term  "political  activities"  is 
defined as "electoral activities, independent expenditures, or expenditures made to any candidate, political party, political 
action  committee or  political  issues  committee  or in  support of  or  against  any  ballot  measure."  $ 44-2602(1)(e).  Viola-

Shortly  before  the  VCA  was  to  take  effect,  plaintiff  labor organizations  sued  the  Bannock  County  prosecuting  attor-

requiring labor organizations to establish a "separate segregated fund" for

see App. 27-34.  In response to that challenge, the State agreed to strike

ment with respect to public employers at the state level, con-cluding that the First Amendment does not compel the State 

"to subsidize speech by providing, at its own expense, payroll deductions  for  the  purpose  of  paying  union  dues  or  asso-
ciation  fees  for  State  employees."  Pocatello  Ed.  Assn.  v. 
Heideman,  2005  WL  3241745,  *2  (D  Idaho,  Nov.  23,  2005). The  ban  was  valid  at  the  state  level  because  "the  State  is 

incurring costs to set up and maintain the [payroll deduction] program."  Ibid.  The  court  struck  down  the  VCA,  how-
ever, "to the extent that it applies to local governments and private  employers,"  because  the  State  had  failed  to  identify 
any subsidy it provided to such employers to administer pay-roll deductions. 

Id., at *2 (footnote omitted), *6. The state defendants appealed, contending that the ban on 

political  payroll  deductions  may  be  constitutionally  applied to  local  government  employees. 

Pocatello  Ed.  Assn.  v. Heideman,  504  F.  3d  1053,  1057 (CA9  2007).  Neither party 

challenged  the  District  Court's  rulings  as  to  private  and state-level  employees,  and  therefore  the  only  issue  remain-
ing  concerned  application  of  the  ban  to  local  government employees. 

The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that there  was  "no  subsidy  by  the  State  of  Idaho  for  the  pay-
roll  deduction  systems  of  local  governments."  Id.,  at  1059. The appellate court remarked that "the generalized lawmak-
ing  power  held  by  the  legislature  with  respect  to  a  state's political subdivisions does not establish that the state is act-
ing  as  a  proprietor"  with  respect  to  local  government  em-

analogous to that between the State and a regulated private utility.  See  id.,  at  1063-1065  (citing  Consolidated  Edison 
Co. of N. Y.  v.  Public  Serv.  Comm'n  of  N.  Y.,  447  U.  S.  530 (1980)).  While  "Idaho  has  the  ultimate  power  of  control 
over  the  units  of  government  at  issue,"  it  did  not  "actually operat[e]  or  contro[l]  the  payroll  deduction  systems  of  local 
units of government."  504 F. 3d, at 1068.  The court there-fore  applied  strict  scrutiny  to  Idaho's  decision  to  prevent 
local  government  employers  from  allowing  payroll  deduc-tions  for  political  purposes,  and  held  the  statute  unconstitu-
tional as applied at the local level.  Ibid. We  granted  certiorari,  552  U. S.  1294  (2008),  and  now

Restrictions on speech based on its content are "presump-tively  invalid"  and  subject  to  strict  scrutiny.

St.  Paul,  505  U. S.  377,  382  (1992).  The  unions  assert  that the ban on checkoffs for political activities falls into this cate-
gory  because  the  law  singles  out  political  speech  for  disfa-vored treatment. 

The  First  Amendment,  however,  protects  the  right  to  be free from government abridgment of speech.  While in some 
contexts the government must accommodate expression, it is not  required  to  assist  others  in  funding  the  expression  of 
particular  ideas,  including  political  ones.  "[A]  legislature's decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right 
does  not  infringe  the  right,  and  thus  is  not  subject  to  strict scrutiny. "

Opinion of the Court 
The  court  below  concluded,  and  Idaho  does  not  dispute, that  "unions  face  substantial  difficulties  in  collecting  funds 

for  political  speech  without  using  payroll  deductions."  504 F.  3d,  at  1058.  But  the  parties  agree  that  the  State  is  not 
constitutionally  obligated  to  provide  payroll  deductions  at all.  See  Plaintiffs'  Reply  Memorandum  10;  see  also 

Toledo 
Area  AFL-CIO  Council  v.  Pizza,  154  F.  3d  307,  319-320 
(CA6  1998);  cf.  Charlotte  v.  Firefighters,  426  U. S.  283,  286 (1976) ("Court would reject . . . contention . . . that respond-

ents'  status  as  union  members or  their  interest  in  obtaining a dues checkoff . . .  entitle[s] them to special treatment under 
the Equal Protection Clause").  While publicly administered 
payroll  deductions  for  political  purposes  can  enhance  the 
unions'  exercise  of  First  Amendment  rights,  Idaho  is  under 
no  obligation  to  aid  the  unions  in  their  political  activities. 
And the State's decision not to do so is not an abridgment of 
the unions' speech; they are free to engage in such speech as 
they  see  fit.  They  simply  are  barred  from  enlisting  the 
State  in  support  of  that  endeavor.  Idaho's  decision  to  limit 
public  employer  payroll  deductions  as  it  has  "is  not  subject 
to strict scrutiny" under the First Amendment.  Regan, 461 
U. S., at 549. 

Given  that  the  State  has  not  infringed  the  unions'  First 
Amendment  rights,  the  State  need  only  demonstrate  a  ra-
tional basis to justify the ban on political payroll deductions. 
Id.,  at  546-551.  The  prohibition  is  not  "aim[ed]  at  the  sup-
pression  of  dangerous  ideas,"  id.,  at  548  (internal  quotation 
marks  omitted),  but  is  instead  justified  by  the  State's  inter-
est  in  avoiding  the  reality  or  appearance  of  government  fa-
voritism  or  entanglement  with  partisan  politics.  We  have 
previously  recognized  such  a  purpose  in  upholding  limita-
tions on public employee political activities.  See Civil Serv-
ice  Comm'n  v.  Letter  Carriers,  413  U. S.  548,  565  (1973)

public officials to promote integrity in the discharge of official duties); cf. 

Cornelius v.  NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, 
Inc.,  473  U. S. 788,  809  (1985)  (limitations  on  speech  may  be justified  by  interest  in  "avoiding  the  appearance  of  political 

favoritism"); Greer v.  Spock, 424 U. S. 828, 839 (1976) (uphold-ing policy aimed at keeping official military activities "wholly 
free of entanglement with partisan political campaigns of any 
kind").  Banning payroll deductions for political speech simi-larly furthers the government's interest in distinguishing be-

tween internal governmental operations and private speech. Idaho's  decision  to  allow  payroll  deductions  for  some  pur-
poses but not for political activities is plainly reasonable.2 

Davenport guides our  resolution here.  That  case also in-
volved  a  distinction  based  on  the  content  of  speech:  Specific consent was required from nonunion members before agency 

fees charged to them could be used for election-related activ-ities,  but  consent  was  not  required  with  respect  to  agency 
fees used for other purposes.  551 U. S., at 181-182.  We re-
jected  the  unions'  argument  that  this  requirement  violated

Opinion of the Court 
the First Amendment because it turned on the content of the speech  at  issue.  Id.,  at  188-190.  We  recognized  that  the 

statute,  rather  than  suppressing  union  speech,  simply  de-clined to assist that speech by granting the unions the right 
to  charge  agency  fees  for  election  activities.  That  decision was  reasonable  given  the  State's  interest  in  preserving  the 
integrity  of  the  election  process.  Ibid.  We  also  concluded that  the  State  did  "not  have  to  enact  an  across-the-board 
limitation  .  .  .  to  vindicate  [its]  more  narrow  concern."  Id., at 189. 

Here  the  restriction  is  on  the  use  of  a  checkoff  to  fund political  activities,  but  the  same  analysis  governs.  Idaho 
does not suppress political speech but simply declines to pro-mote it through public employer checkoffs for political activi-
ties.  The concern that political payroll deductions might be seen as involving public employers in politics arises only be-
cause  Idaho  permits  public  employer  payroll  deductions  in the  first  place.  As  in  Davenport,  the  State's  response  to 
that  problem  is  limited  to  its  source--in  this  case,  politi-cal  payroll  deductions.  The  ban  on  such  deductions  plainly 
serves  the  State's  interest  in  separating  public  employment from political activities.

Opinion of the Court 

III 
The question remains whether the ban is valid at the local level.  The  unions  abandoned  their  challenge  to  the  restric-

tion  at  the  state  level,  but  contend  that  strict  scrutiny  is still  warranted when  the  ban  is  applied  to local  government 
employers.  In  that  context,  the  unions  argue,  the  State  is no longer declining to facilitate speech through its own pay-
roll  system,  but  is  obstructing  speech  in  the  local  govern-ments'  payroll  systems.  See  Brief  for  Respondents  44-46. 
We find that distinction unpersuasive, and hold that the same deferential review applies whether the prohibition on payroll 
deductions  for  political  speech  is  directed  at  state  or  local governmental entities. 

"Political subdivisions of States--counties, cities, or what-ever--never were and never have been considered as sover-
eign  entities."  Reynolds  v.  Sims,  377  U. S.  533,  575  (1964). They  are  instead  "subordinate  governmental  instrumentali-
ties created by the State to assist in the carrying out of state governmental  functions." 

Ibid.;  see  also  Louisiana  ex  rel. Folsom  v.  Mayor  and  Administrators  of  New  Orleans,  109 

U. S. 285, 287 (1883) ("Municipal corporations are instrumen-talities of the State for the convenient administration of gov-
ernment  within  their  limits").  State  political  subdivisions are  "merely . . .  department[s]  of  the  State,  and  the  State 
may  withhold,  grant  or  withdraw  powers  and  privileges  as it sees fit."  Trenton v.  New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182, 187 (1923). 
Here the Idaho Legislature has  elected to withhold from all public employers the power to provide payroll deductions for 
political activities. The  State's  legislative  action  is  of  course  subject  to  First 
Amendment  and  other  constitutional  scrutiny  whether  that 
deduction  regarding  political  issues,  applies  regardless  of  viewpoint  or 
message, applies to all employers, and it does not single out any candidates 
or issues."  App. 110.  If the ban is not enforced evenhandedly, plaintiffs 
are free to bring an as-applied challenge.  See National Endowment for 
Arts v.  Finley, 524 U. S. 569, 587 (1998).

action is applicable at the state level, the local level, both, or some  subpart  of  either.  But  we  are  aware  of  no  case  sug-

gesting  that  a  different  analysis  applies  under  the  First Amendment  depending  on  the  level  of  government  affected, 
and  the  unions  have  cited  none.  The  ban  on  political  pay-roll  deductions  furthers  Idaho's  interest  in  separating  the 
operation of government from partisan politics.  That inter-
est  extends  to  all  public  employers  at  whatever  level  of government. 

In  reaching  the  opposite  conclusion,  the  Court  of  Appeals invoked  our  decision  in 

Consolidated  Edison  Co.  of  N. Y.  v. 
Public  Serv.  Comm'n  of  N. Y.,  447  U. S.  530.  In  that  case, 
we  held  that  a  state  commission  could  not,  consistent  with 
the  First  Amendment,  prohibit  a  privately  owned  electric 
utility from discussing controversial issues in its bill inserts. 
Id., at 544.  We ruled that the fact that the State regulated 
the  utility  did  not  authorize  the  prohibition.  Id.,  at  540. 
The  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that  the  same  analysis  ap-
plied here, and that "the State's broad powers of control over 
local  government  entities  are  solely  those  of  a  regulator, 
analogous to the [state commission's] regulatory powers over 
[the private utility]."  504 F. 3d, at 1065. 

That analogy is misguided.  A private corporation is sub-
ject  to  the  government's  legal  authority  to  regulate  its  con-
duct.  A  political subdivision, on the other hand, is a subor-
dinate unit of government  created by the  State to carry out 
delegated  governmental  functions.  A  private  corporation 
enjoys  constitutional  protections,  see  First  Nat.  Bank  of 
Boston v.  Bellotti, 435 U. S. 765, 778, n. 14 (1978), but a politi-
cal  subdivision,  "created  by  a  state  for  the  better  ordering 
of  government,  has  no  privileges  or  immunities  under  the 
federal constitution which it may invoke in opposition to the 
will  of  its  creator."  Williams  v.  Mayor  of  Baltimore,  289 
U. S. 36,  40 (1933);  see  Trenton  v.  New Jersey, supra,  at 185 
(municipality, as successor  to a private water company, does 
not enjoy against the State the same constitutional rights as

Held:  Because  the  term  "now  under  Federal  jurisdiction"  in  $ 479  unam-

biguously  refers  to  those  tribes  that  were  under  federal  jurisdiction 
when the IRA was enacted in 1934, and because the Narragansett Tribe 
was not under federal jurisdiction in 1934, the Secretary does not have 
the authority to take the 31-acre parcel into trust.  Pp. 387-396. 

(a)  When  a statute's  text is plain  and unambiguous,  United States  v. 
Gonzales,  520  U. S.  1,  4,  the  statute  must  be  applied  according  to  its 
terms,  see,  e. g.,  Dodd  v.  United  States,  545  U. S.  353,  359.  Here, 
whether  the  Secretary  has  authority  to  take  the  parcel  into  trust  de-
pends on whether the Narragansetts are members of a "recognized In-
dian  tribe  now  under  Federal  jurisdiction,"  which,  in  turn,  depends  on 
whether  "now"  refers  to  1998, when  the  Secretary  accepted  the  parcel 
into  trust,  or  1934,  when  Congress  enacted  the  IRA.  The  ordinary 
meaning of "now," as understood at the time of enactment, was at "the 
present time; at this moment; at the time of speaking."  That definition 
is consistent with interpretations given "now" by this Court both before 
and after the IRA's passage.  See, e. g., Franklin v.  United States, 216 
U. S.  559,  569;  Montana  v.  Kennedy,  366  U. S.  308,  310-311.  It  also 
aligns with the word's natural reading in the context of the IRA.  Fur-
thermore, the Secretary's current interpretation is at odds with the Ex-
ecutive  Branch's  construction  of  $ 479  at  the  time  of  enactment.  The 
Secretary's additional arguments in support of his contention that "now" 
is  ambiguous  are  unpersuasive.  There  is  also  no  need  to  consider  the 
parties' competing views on whether Congress had a policy justification 
for limiting the Secretary's trust authority to tribes under federal juris-
diction  in  1934,  since  Congress'  use  of  "now"  in  $ 479  speaks  for  itself 
and  "courts  must  presume  that  a  legislature  says  in  a  statute  what  it 
means  and  means  in  a  statute  what  it  says  there."  Connecticut  Nat. 
Bank v.  Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 253-254.  Pp. 387-393. 

(b)  The Court rejects alternative arguments by the Secretary and his 
amici  that  rely  on  statutory  provisions  other  than  $ 479  to  support 
the  Secretary's  decision  to  take  the  parcel  into  trust  for  the  Narra-
gansetts.  Pp. 393-395.

Opinion of the Court 
land  for  Indians."  $ 5,  48  Stat.  985,  25  U. S. C.  $ 465.  The 
IRA defines the  term "Indian" to "include all persons  of In-
dian  descent  who  are  members  of  any  recognized  Indian 
tribe  now  under  Federal  jurisdiction."  $ 479.  The  Secre-
tary notified petitioners--the State of Rhode Island, its Gov-
ernor,  and  the  town  of  Charlestown,  Rhode  Island--that  he 
intended  to  accept  in  trust  a  parcel  of  land  for  use  by  the 
Narragansett  Indian  Tribe  in  accordance  with  his  claimed 
authority  under  the  statute.  In  proceedings  before  the  In-
terior  Board  of  Indian  Appeals  (IBIA),  the  District  Court, 
and  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  First  Circuit,  petitioners 
unsuccessfully  challenged  the  Secretary's  authority  to  take 
the parcel into trust. 

In  reviewing  the  determination  of  the  Court  of  Appeals, 
we  are  asked  to  interpret  the  statutory  phrase  "now  under 
Federal  jurisdiction"  in  $ 479.  Petitioners  contend  that  the 
term "now" refers to the time of the statute's enactment, and 
permits the Secretary to take land into trust for members of 
recognized  tribes  that  were  "under  Federal  jurisdiction"  in 
1934.  Respondents argue that the word "now" is an ambig-
uous term that can reasonably be construed to authorize the 
Secretary  to take land  into  trust for members  of tribes that 
are "under  Federal jurisdiction"  at the  time  that  the  land  is 
accepted into trust. 

We  agree  with  petitioners  and  hold  that,  for  purposes  of 

$ 479,  the  phrase  "now  under  Federal  jurisdiction"  refers  to 
a tribe that was under federal jurisdiction at the time of the 
statute's  enactment.  As  a  result,  $ 479  limits  the  Secre-
tary's  authority  to  taking  land  into  trust  for  the  purpose  of 
providing land to members of a tribe that was under federal 
jurisdiction  when  the  IRA  was  enacted  in  June  1934.  Be-
cause  the  record  in  this  case  establishes  that  the  Narra-
gansett  Tribe  was  not  under  federal  jurisdiction  when  the 
IRA was enacted, the Secretary does not have the authority

At the time of colonial settlement, the Narragansett Indian Tribe  was  the  indigenous  occupant  of  much  of  what  is  now 

the  State  of  Rhode  Island.  See  Final  Determination  for Federal  Acknowledgement  of  Narragansett  Indian  Tribe  of 
Rhode  Island,  48  Fed.  Reg.  6177  (1983)  (hereinafter  Final Determination).  Initial  relations  between  colonial  settlers, 
the  Narragansett  Tribe,  and  the  other  Indian  tribes  in  the region  were  peaceful,  but  relations  deteriorated  in  the  late 
17th  century.  The  hostilities  peaked  in  1675  and  1676  dur-ing  the  2-year  armed  conflict  known  as  King  Philip's  War. 
Hundreds  of  colonists  and  thousands  of  Indians  died.  See E.  Schultz  &  M.  Tougias,  King  Philip's  War  5  (1999).  The 
Narragansett  Tribe,  having  been  decimated,  was  placed under formal guardianship by the Colony of Rhode Island in 
1709.  48 Fed. Reg. 6177, 6178.1 Not quite  two  centuries  later, in 1880,  the  State  of Rhode 
Island  convinced  the  Narragansett  Tribe  to  relinquish  its tribal authority as part of an effort to assimilate tribal mem-
bers  into  the  local  population.  See  Narragansett  Indian Tribe  v.  National  Indian  Gaming  Comm'n,  158  F.  3d  1335, 
1336  (CADC  1998).  The  Tribe  also  agreed  to  sell  all  but two acres of its remaining reservation land for $5,000.  Ibid. 
Almost  immediately,  the  Tribe  regretted  its  decisions  and embarked on a campaign to regain its land and tribal status. 
Ibid.  In  the  early  20th  century,  members  of  the  Tribe sought economic support and other assistance from the Fed-

1 The  Narragansett  Tribe  recognized  today  is  the  successor  to  two 
tribes,  the  Narragansett  and  the  Niantic  Tribes.  The  two  predecessor 
Tribes  shared  territory  and  cultural  traditions  at  the  time  of  European 
settlement and effectively  merged in  the aftermath  of  King Philip's  War.

eral  Government.  But,  in  correspondence  spanning  a  10-year period from 1927 to 1937, federal officials declined their 

request,  noting  that  the  Tribe  was,  and  always  had  been, under  the  jurisdiction  of  the  New  England  States,  rather 
than the Federal Government. Having  failed  to  gain  recognition  or  assistance  from  the 
United  States  or  from  the  State  of  Rhode  Island,  the  Tribe filed  suit in the 1970's to recover its ancestral  land, claiming 
that the  State  had misappropriated  its  territory  in  violation of  the  Indian  Non-Intercourse  Act,  25  U. S. C.  $ 177.

2  The 

claims were resolved in 1978  by enactment  of the  Rhode Is-land  Indian  Claims  Settlement  Act,  92  Stat.  813,  25  U. S. C. 

$ 1701  et  seq.  Under  the  agreement  codified  by  the  Settle-ment  Act,  the  Tribe  received  title  to  1,800  acres  of  land  in 
Charlestown, Rhode Island, in exchange for relinquishing its past and future claims to land based on aboriginal title.  The 
Tribe also agreed that the 1,800 acres of land received under the  Settlement  Act  "shall  be  subject  to  the  civil  and  crim-
inal  laws  and  jurisdiction  of  the  State  of  Rhode  Island." $ 1708(a); see also $ 1712(a). 

The  Narragansett  Tribe's  ongoing  efforts to  gain  recogni-tion from the United States Government finally succeeded in 
1983.  48  Fed.  Reg.  6177.  In  granting  formal  recognition, the  Bureau  of  Indian  Affairs  (BIA)  determined  that  "the 
Narragansett  community  and  its  predecessors  have  existed autonomously  since  first  contact,  despite  undergoing  many 
modifications. "  Id., at  6178.  The BIA referred to the Tribe's  "documented  history  dating  from  1614"  and  noted 
that  "all  of  the  current  membership  are  believed  to  be  able to  trace  to  at  least  one  ancestor  on  the  membership  lists  of 
the Narragansett community prepared after the 1880 Rhode

from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any validity in law 
or  equity,  unless  the  same  be  made  by  treaty  or  convention  entered  into 
pursuant to the Constitution."

Island  `detribalization'  act."  Ibid.  After  obtaining  federal recognition,  the  Tribe  began  urging  the  Secretary  to accept 

a  deed  of  trust  to  the  1,800  acres  conveyed  to  it  under  the Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act.  25 CFR $ 83.2 
(2008)  (providing  that  federal  recognition  is  needed  before an Indian tribe may seek "the protection, services, and bene-
fits of the Federal government").  The Secretary acceded to the  Tribe's  request  in  1988.  See 

Charlestown  v.  Eastern Area Director, Bur. of Indian Affairs, 18 IBIA 67, 69 (1989).

In  1991,  the  Tribe's  housing  authority  purchased  an  addi-tional  31  acres  of  land  in  the  town  of  Charlestown  adjacent 

to the Tribe's 1,800 acres of settlement lands.  Soon thereaf-ter,  a  dispute  arose  about  whether  the  Tribe's  planned  con-
struction  of  housing  on  that  parcel  had  to  comply  with  local regulations.  Narragansett  Indian  Tribe  v.  Narragansett 
Elec. Co., 89 F. 3d 908, 911-912 (CA1 1996).  The Tribe's pri-mary argument for noncompliance--that its ownership of the 
parcel  made  it  a  "dependent  Indian  community"  and  thus "Indian  country"  under  18  U. S. C.  $ 1151--ultimately  failed. 
89 F. 3d, at 913-922.  But, while the litigation was pending, the  Tribe  sought  an  alternative  solution  to  free  itself  from 
compliance  with  local  regulations:  It  asked  the  Secretary  to accept the 31-acre parcel into trust for the Tribe pursuant to 
25  U. S. C.  $ 465.  By  letter  dated March  6,  1998,  the  Secre-tary notified petitioners of his acceptance of the Tribe's land 
into  trust.  Petitioners  appealed  the  Secretary's  decision to  the  IBIA,  which  upheld  the  Secretary's  decision.  See 
Charlestown  v.  Eastern  Area  Director,  Bureau  of  Indian Affairs, 35 IBIA 93 (2000). 

Petitioners  sought  review  of  the  IBIA  decision  pursuant to  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  5  U. S. C.  $ 702.  The

386  CARCIERI  v.  SALAZAR 

Opinion of the Court 
District  Court  granted  summary  judgment  in  favor  of  the 
Secretary  and  other  Department  of  Interior  officials.  As 
relevant  here,  the  District  Court  determined  that  the  plain 
language of 25 U. S. C. $ 479 defines "Indian" to include mem-
bers  of  all  tribes  in  existence  in  1934,  but  does  not  require 
a  tribe  to  have  been  federally  recognized  on  that  date. 
Carcieri  v.  Norton,  290  F.  Supp.  2d  167,  179-181  (RI  2003). 
According  to  the  District  Court,  because  it  is  currently 
"federally-recognized"  and  "existed  at  the  time  of  the  en-
actment  of  the  IRA,"  the  Narragansett  Tribe  qualifies  "as 
an  `Indian  tribe'  within  the  meaning  of  $ 479."  Id.,  at  181. 
As  a  result,  "the  secretary  possesses  authority  under  $ 465 
to  accept  lands  into  trust  for  the  benefit  of  the  Narragan-
setts."  Ibid. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  First  Circuit  affirmed,  first 
in  a  panel  decision,  Carcieri  v.  Norton,  423  F.  3d  45  (2005), 
and then sitting en  banc, 497  F. 3d 15 (2007).  Although the 
Court  of  Appeals  acknowledged  that  "[o]ne  might  have  an 
initial  instinct  to  read  the  word  `now'  [in  $ 479]  . . . to  mean 
the date of [the] enactment of the statute, June 18, 1934," the 
court  concluded  that  there was  "ambiguity as  to whether  to 
view  the  term . . . as  operating  at  the  moment  Congress 
enacted  it  or at the  moment  the  Secretary  invokes it."  Id., 
at  26.  The  Court  of  Appeals  noted  that  Congress  has  used 
the  word "now"  in  other  statutes  to  refer  to  the  time  of the 
statute's application, not its enactment.  Id., at 26-27.  The 
Court  of  Appeals  also  found  that  the  particular  statutory 
context  of  $ 479  did  not  clarify  the  meaning  of  "now."  On 
one  hand,  the  Court  of  Appeals  noted  that  another  provi-
sion within the IRA, 25 U. S. C. $ 472, uses the term "now or 
hereafter," which supports petitioners' argument that "now," 
by  itself,  does  not  refer  to  future  events.  But  on  the  other 
hand, $ 479  contai ns  the par ticu lar applicati on date  of 
"June  18,  1934,"  suggesting  that  if  Congress  had  wanted  to 
refer  to  the  date  of  enactment,  it  could  have  done  so  more

Opinion of the Court 
specifically.  497 F. 3d, at 27.  The Court of Appeals further reasoned  that  both  interpretations  of  "now"  are  supported 

by reasonable  policy explanations, id.,  at 27-28, and it found that the legislative history failed to "clearly resolve the 
issue," id., at 28. Having found the statute ambiguous, the Court of Appeals 
applied  the  principles  set  forth  in  Chevron  U. S. A.  Inc.  v. 
Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,  467  U. S. 837, 843 (1984),  and  deferred  to  the  Secretary's  construction  of  the 

provision.  497 F. 3d, at 30.  The court rejected petitioners' arguments that the Secretary's interpretation was an imper-
missible  construction  of  the  statute.  Id.,  at  30-34.  It  also held that petitioners had failed to demonstrate that the Sec-
retary's interpretation was inconsistent  with earlier prac-tices  of  the  Department  of  the  Interior.  Furthermore,  the 
court  determined  that  even  if  the  interpretation  were  a  de-parture  from  the  Department's  prior  practices,  the  decision 
should be affirmed based on the Secretary's "reasoned expla-nation for his interpretation." 

Id., at 34. We granted certiorari,  552 U. S. 1229 (2008), and now 

reverse.  II 

This  case  requires  us  to  apply  settled  principles  of  statu-tory  construction  under  which  we  must  first  determine 
whether  the  statutory  text  is  plain  and  unambiguous. United  States v.  Gonzales,  520  U. S.  1,  4  (1997).  If  it  is,  we 
must apply the statute according to its terms.  See, e. g., 
Dodd  v.  United  States,  545  U. S.  353,  359  (2005);  Lamie  v. 
United  States  Trustee,  540  U. S.  526,  534  (2004);  Hartford 
Underwriters  Ins.  Co.  v.  Union  Planters  Bank,  N.  A.,  530

"The  term  `Indian'  as  used  in  this  Act  shall  include  all persons  of Indian descent  who are  members of any  rec-

ognized  Indian  tribe  now  under  Federal  jurisdiction, and  all  persons  who  are  descendants  of  such  members 
who  were,  on  June  1,  1934,  residing  within  the  pres-ent  boundaries  of  any  Indian  reservation,  and  shall 
further include all other persons of one-half or more In-dian  blood. . . . The  term `tribe'  wherever  used  in  this 
Act  shall  be  construed  to  refer  to  any  Indian  tribe,  or-ganized  band,  pueblo,  or  the  Indians  residing  on  one 
reservation. . . . "   $  479  (emphasis added). 
The  parties  are  in  agreement,  as  are  we,  that  the  Secre-tary's authority  to take  the  parcel in  question  into  trust  de-

pends on whether the Narragansetts are members of a "rec-ognized Indian Tribe now under Federal jurisdiction."  Ibid. 
That  question,  in  turn,  requires  us  to  decide  whether  the word  "now  under  Federal  jurisdiction"  refers  to  1998,  when 
the Secretary accepted the 31-acre parcel into trust, or 1934, when Congress enacted the IRA. 

We  begin  with  the  ordinary  meaning  of  the  word  "now," as understood when the  IRA was  enacted.  Director,  Office 
of  Workers'  Compensation  Programs  v.  Greenwich  Collier-
ies,  512  U. S.  267,  272  (1994);  Moskal  v.  United  States,  498 U. S.  103,  108-109  (1990).  At  that  time,  the  primary  defini-

tion  of  "now" was  "[a]t  the  present  time; at  this  moment;  at the  time  of  speaking."  Webster's  New  International  Dic-
tionary  1671  (2d  ed.  1934);  see  also  Black's  Law  Dictionary 1262 (3d ed. 1933) (defining "now" to mean "[a]t this time, or 
at  the  present  moment,"  and  noting  that  " `[n]ow'  as  used  in a  statute  ordinarily  refers  to  the  date  of  its  taking  effect 
. . . " (emphasis  added)).  This  definition  is  consistent  with interpretations given to the word "now" by this Court, both 
before and after passage  of the  IRA, with respect  to its use in  other  statutes.  See, 

e. g.,  Franklin  v.  United  States,  216 U. S.  559,  568-569  (1910)  (interpreting  a  federal  criminal 

statute to have "adopted such punishment as the laws of the

State  in  which  such  place  is  situated  now  provide  for  the like  offense"  (citing  United  States v.  Paul,  6  Pet.  141  (1832); 

internal  quotation  marks  omitted));  Montana  v.  Kennedy, 366 U. S. 308, 310-311 (1961) (interpreting a statute granting 
citizenship  status  to  foreign-born  "children  of  persons  who 
now  are, or have  been, citizens  of the United States" (inter-nal  quotation  marks  omitted;  emphasis  added  and  deleted)). 

It also aligns with the natural reading of the  word within the context of the IRA.  For example, in the original version 
of  25  U. S. C.  $ 465,  which  provided  the  same  authority  to the  Secretary  to  accept  land  into  trust  for  "the  purpose  of 
providing  land  for  Indians,"  Congress  explicitly  referred  to current  events,  stating  "[t]hat  no  part  of  such  funds  shall 
be  used  to  acquire  additional  land  outside  of  the  exterior boundaries  of  [the]  Navajo  Indian  Reservation . . .  in  the  
event  that  the  proposed  Navajo  boundary  extension  meas-ures 

now  pending  in  Congress  .  .  .  become  law."  IRA,  $ 5, 48  Stat.  985  (emphasis  added).

4  In  addition,  elsewhere  in 

the  IRA,  Congress  expressly  drew  into  the  statute  contem-poraneous  and  future  events  by  using  the  phrase  "now  or 

hereafter."  See  25  U. S. C.  $ 468  (referring  to  "the  geo-graphic  boundaries  of  any  Indian  reservation  now  existing 
or  established  hereafter");  $ 472  (referring  to  "Indians  who may  be  appointed . . . to the  various  positions  maintained, 
now  or  hereafter,  by  the  Indian  Office").  Congress'  use  of the word "now" in this provision, without the accompanying 
phrase "or hereafter," thus provides further textual support for  the  conclusion  that  the  term  refers  solely  to  events  con-
temporaneous  with  the  Act's  enactment.  See  Barnhart  v. 
Sigmon  Coal  Co.,  534  U. S.  438,  452  (2002)  ("[W]hen  Con-gress includes particular language in one section of a statute 

4 The current version of $ 465 provides "[t]hat no part of such funds shall 
be  used  to  acquire  additional  land  outside  of  the  exterior  boundaries  of 
Navajo Indian  Reservation  . . . in the  event that legislation  to define  the 
exterior boundaries of the Navajo Indian Reservation in New Mexico, and 
for other purposes, or similar legislation, becomes law."

Opinion of the Court 
but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed  that  Congress  acts  intentionally  and  purposely 

in  the  disparate  inclusion  or  exclusion"  (internal  quotation marks omitted)). 

Furthermore,  the  Secretary's  current  interpretation  is  at odds  with  the  Executive  Branch's  construction  of  this  pro-
vision  at  the  time  of  enactment.  In  correspondence  with those  who  would  assist  him  in  implementing  the  IRA,  the 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier, explained: 

"Section  19  of  the  Indian  Reorganization  Act  of  June 18,  1934  (48  Stat.  L.,  988),  provides,  in  effect,  that  the 

term  `Indian'  as  used  therein  shall  include--(1)  all  per-sons  of  Indian  descent  who  are  members  of  any  recog-
nized  tribe  that  was  under  Federal  jurisdiction  at  the date  of  the  Act  .  .  .  ."  Letter  from  John  Collier,  Com-
missioner, to Superintendents (Mar. 7, 1936), Lodging of Respondents (emphasis added).

5 

Thus,  although  we  do  not  defer  to Commissioner  Collier's interpretation  of  this  unambiguous  statute,  see  Estate  of 

5 In addition to serving as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier 
was "a principal author of the [IRA]."  United States v. Mitchell, 463 U. S. 
206, 221, n. 21 (1983).  And, as both parties note, he appears to have been 
responsible for the insertion of the words "now under Federal jurisdiction" 
into what  is now 25 U. S. C. $ 479.  See Hearings on S. 2755  et al.: A Bill 
to Grant to Indians Living Under Federal Tutelage the Freedom to Orga-
nize for Purposes of Local Self-Government and Economic Enterprise, be-
fore  the  Senate  Committee  on  Indian  Affairs,  73d  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  pt.  2, 
p. 266 (1934).  Also, the record contains a 1937 letter from Commissioner 
Collier  in  which,  even  after  the  passage  of  the  IRA,  he  stated  that  the 
Federal  Government  still  lacked  any  jurisdiction  over  the  Narragansett 
Tribe.  App. 23a-24a.  Commissioner  Collier's responsibilities  related to 
implementing the IRA make him an unusually persuasive source as to the 
meaning  of  the  relevant  statutory  language  and  the  Tribe's  status  under 
it.  See Christensen v.  Harris  County,  529 U. S. 576,  587 (2000) (explain-
ing that an Executive Branch statutory interpretation that lacks the force 
of law is  "entitled to respect . . . to the  extent that those  interpretations 
have  the  `power  to  persuade' "  (some  internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).

Opinion of the Court 
Cowart  v.  Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U. S. 469, 476 (1992), we agree with his conclusion that the word "now" in $ 479 limits 

the  definition  of  "Indian,"  and  therefore  limits  the  exercise of the Secretary's trust authority under $ 465 to those mem-
bers of tribes that were under federal jurisdiction at the time the IRA was enacted. 

The  Secretary  makes  two  other  arguments  in  support  of his 

contention that the term "now" as used in $ 479 is ambig-uous.  We  reject  them  both.  First,  the  Secretary  argues 

that although the "use of `now' can refer to the time of enact-ment"  in  the  abstract,  "it  can  also  refer  to  the  time  of  the 
statute's  application."  Brief  for  Respondents  18.  But  the 
susceptibility  of  the  word  "now"  to  alternative  meanings 
"does  not  render  the  word  .  .  .  whenever  it  is  used,  am-
biguous," particularly where  "all but one of  the  meanings is 
ordinarily  eliminated  by  context."  Deal  v.  United  States, 
508  U. S.  129,  131-132  (1993).  Here,  the  statutory  context 
makes  clear  that  "now"  does  not  mean  "now  or  hereafter" 
or  "at  the  time  of  application."  Had  Congress  intended  to 
legislate such a definition, it could have done so explicitly, as 
it  did  in  $$ 468  and  472,  or  it  could  have  omitted  the  word 
"now" altogether.  Instead, Congress limited the statute by 
the  word  "now"  and  "we  are  obliged  to  give  effect,  if  pos-
sible,  to  every  word  Congress  used."  Reiter  v.  Sonotone 
Corp.,  442 U. S. 330, 339 (1979). 

Second,  the  Secretary  argues  that  $ 479  left  a  gap  for  the 
agency to fill by using the phrase "shall include" in its intro-
ductory  clause.  Brief  for  Respondents  26-27.  The  Secre-
tary,  in  turn,  claims  to  have  permissibly  filled  that  gap  by 
defining  " `Tribe' "  and  " `Individual  Indian' "  without  refer-
ence to the date of the statute's enactment.  Id., at 28 (citing 
25  CFR  $$ 151.2(b),  (c)(1)  (2008)).  But,  as  explained  above, 
Congress left no gap in 25 U. S. C. $ 479 for the agency to fill. 
Rather,  it  explicitly  and  comprehensively  defined  the  term 
by including only three discrete definitions: "[1] members  of 
any  recognized  Indian  tribe  now  under Federal  jurisdiction,

Opinion of the Court 
and  [2]  all  persons  who  are  descendants  of  such  members 
who  were,  on  June  1,  1934,  residing  within  the  present 
boundaries  of  any  Indian  reservation,  and . . . [3]  all  other 
persons  of  one-half  or  more  Indian  blood."  Ibid.  In  other 
statutory  provisions,  Congress  chose  to  expand  the  Secre-
tary's  authority  to  particular  Indian  tribes  not  necessarily 
encompassed  within  the  definitions  of  "Indian"  set  forth  in 

$ 479.6  Had it understood the word "include" in $ 479 to en-
compass  tribes  other  than  those  satisfying  one  of  the  three 

$ 479  definitions,  Congress  would  have  not  needed  to  enact 
these additional statutory references to specific Tribes. 

The Secretary and his amici also go beyond the statutory 
text  to  argue  that  Congress  had  no  policy  justification  for 
limiting the Secretary's trust authority to those tribes under 
federal  jurisdiction  in  1934,  because  the  IRA  was  intended 
to  strengthen  Indian  communities  as  a  whole,  regardless  of 
their status in 1934.  Petitioners counter that the main pur-
pose  of  $ 465  was  to  reverse  the  loss  of  lands  that  Indians 
sustained  under  the  General  Allotment  Act,  see  Atkinson 
Trading  Co.  v.  Shirley,  532  U. S. 645,  650,  n.  1  (2001),  so  the 
statute  was  limited  to  tribes  under  federal  jurisdiction  at 
that time because  they were the  tribes who  lost their lands. 
We need not consider these competing policy views, because 
Congress'  use  of  the  word  "now"  in  $ 479  speaks  for  itself 
and "courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute 
what  it  means  and  means  in  a  statute  what  it  says  there." 

6 See, e. g.,  25 U. S. C. $ 473a ("Sections . . . 465 . . . and 479 of this title 
shall after May 1, 1936, apply to the Territory of Alaska"); $ 1041e(a) ("The 
[Shawnee]  Tribe  shall  be  eligible  to  have  land  acquired  in  trust  for  its 
benefit pursuant to section 465 of this title . . . "); $ 1300b-14(a) ("[Sections 
465 and 479 of  this  title are]  hereby made  applicable  to the [Texas]  Band 
[of  Kickapoo  Indians]  .  .  .  ");  $ 1300g-2(a)  ("[Sections  465  and  479]  shall 
apply to  the  members  of the  [Ysleta  del Ser Pueblo]  tribe, the  tribe, and 
the reservation").

III 
The Secretary and his  supporting amici also  offer two al-ternative  arguments  that  rely  on  statutory  provisions  other 

than the definition of "Indian" in $ 479 to support the Secre-tary's  decision  to  take  this  parcel  into  trust  for  the  Narra-
gansett Tribe.  We reject both arguments. First,  the  Secretary  and  several  amici  argue  that  the 
definition  of  "Indian"  in  $ 479  is  rendered  irrelevant  by  the broader  definition  of  "tribe"  in  $ 479  and  by  the  fact  that 
the statute authorizes the Secretary to take title to lands "in the  name  of  the  United  States  in  trust  for  the  Indian  tribe 
or  individual  Indian  for  which  the  land  is  acquired."  $ 465 (emphasis  added);  Brief  for  Respondents  12-14.  But  the 
definition  of  "tribe"  in  $ 479  itself  refers  to  "any  Indian tribe" (emphasis added), and therefore is limited by the tem-
poral  restrictions that  apply to $ 479's definition of "Indian." See  $ 479  ("The  term  `tribe'  wherever  used  in  this  Act  shall 
be  construed  to  refer  to  any  Indian  tribe,  organized  band, pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation" (emphasis 
added)).  And,  although  $ 465  authorizes  the  United  States to take land in trust for an Indian tribe, $ 465 limits the Sec-
retary's exercise of that authority "for the purpose of provid-ing  land  for  Indians."  There  simply  is  no  legitimate  way 
to  circumvent  the  definition  of  "Indian"  in  delineating  the Secretary's authority under $$ 465 and 479.

8 

7 Because  we  conclude  that  the  language  of  $ 465  unambiguously  pre-
cludes the Secretary's action with respect to the parcel of land at issue in 
this  case,  we  do  not  address  petitioners'  alternative  argument  that  the 
Rhode Island Indian Claims Settlement Act, 92 Stat. 813, 25 U. S. C. $ 1701 
et seq., precludes the Secretary from exercising his authority under $ 465. 

8 For this reason, we disagree with the argument made by Justice

Opinion of the Court 
Second,  amicus  National  Congress  of  American  Indians (NCAI) argues that 25 U. S. C. $ 2202, which was enacted as 

part  of  the  Indian  Land  Consolidation  Act  (ILCA),  Title  II, 96  Stat.  2517,  overcomes  the  limitations  set  forth  in  $ 479 
and, in turn, authorizes  the Secretary's  action.  Section 2202 provides: 

"The  provisions of section 465  of this  title shall apply to  all  tribes  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  section 
478  of  this  title:  Provided,  That  nothing  in  this  section is  intended to  supersede any  other provision  of Federal 

law which authorizes, prohibits, or restricts the acquisi-tion of land for Indians with respect to any specific tribe, 
reservation, or state(s)." 
NCAI  argues  that  the  "ILCA  independently  grants  author-ity  under  Section  465  for  the  Secretary  to  execute  the  chal-

lenged trust acquisition."  NCAI Brief 8.  We do not agree. The  plain  language  of  $ 2202  does  not  expand  the  power 
set  forth  in  $ 465,  which  requires  that  the  Secretary  take land  into  trust  only  "for  the  purpose  of  providing  land  for 
Indians."  Nor does $ 2202 alter the definition of "Indian" in $ 479, which is limited to members of tribes that were under 

federal jurisdiction in 1934.9  See supra, at 387-393.  Rather, $ 2202  by  its  terms  simply  ensures  that  tribes  may  benefit 
from  $ 465  even  if  they  opted  out  of  the  IRA  pursuant  to 
recognition  of  tribes  like  the  Narragansetts.  See  post,  at  404-406,  409- 
411  (dissenting  opinion).  When  Congress  has  enacted  a  definition  with 
"detailed  and  unyielding  provisions,"  as  it  has  in  $ 479,  this  Court  must 
give effect to that definition even when " `it could be argued that the line 
should  have  been  drawn  at a  different  point.' "  INS  v.  Hector, 479  U. S. 
85,  88-89  (1986)  (per  curiam)  (quoting  Fiallo  v.  Bell,  430  U. S.  787,  798 
(1977)). 

9 NCAI  notes  that  the  ILCA's  definition  of  "tribe"  "means  any  Indian 

tribe, band, group, pueblo, or community for which, or for the members of 
which, the United States holds lands in trust."  $ 2201.  But $ 2201 is, by 
its express terms, applicable only to Chapter 24 of Title 25 of the United 
States Code.  Ibid.  The IRA is codified in Chapter 14  of Title 25.  See 

$ 465.  Section 2201, therefore, does not itself alter the authority granted 
to the Secretary by $ 465.

Opinion of the Court 

$ 478, which allowed tribal members to reject the application 
of  the  IRA  to  their  tribe.  $ 478  ("This  Act  shall  not  apply 
to  any  reservation  wherein  a  majority  of  the  adult  Indians 
. . . shall vote against its application").  As a result, there is 
no  conflict  between  $ 2202  and  the  limitation  on  the  Secre-
tary's  authority  to  take  lands  contained  in  $ 465.  Rather, 

$ 2202  provides  additional  protections  to  those  who  satisfied 
the definition of "Indian" in $ 479 at the time of the statute's 
enactment, but opted out of the IRA shortly thereafter. 

NCAI's  reading  of  $ 2202  also  would  nullify  the  plain 
meaning  of  the  definition  of  "Indian"  set  forth  in  $ 479  and 
incorporated  into  $ 465.  Consistent  with  our  obligation  to 
give effect to every provision of the statute, Reiter, 442 U. S., 
at 339, we  will  not assume  that Congress  repealed  the  plain 
and  unambiguous  restrictions  on  the  Secretary's  exercise  of 
trust  authority  in  $$ 465  and  479  when  it  enacted  $ 2202. 
"We  have  repeatedly  stated  .  .  .  that  absent  `a  clearly  ex-
pressed congressional intention,' . . . [a]n implied repeal will 
only be found where provisions in two statutes are in `irrec-
oncilable  conflict,'  or  where  the  latter  Act  covers  the  whole 
subject of the earlier one and `is clearly intended as a substi-
tute.' "  Branch v.  Smith, 538 U. S. 254, 273 (2003) (plurality 
opinion)  (quoting  Morton  v.  Mancari,  417  U. S.  535,  551 
(1974),  and  Posadas  v.  National  City  Bank,  296  U. S.  497, 
503 (1936)). 

IV 

We hold that the term "now under Federal jurisdiction" in 

$ 479  unambiguously  refers  to  those  tribes  that  were  under 
the  federal  jurisdiction  of  the  United  States  when  the  IRA 
was enacted in 1934.  None of the parties or amici, including 
the Narragansett Tribe itself, has argued that the Tribe was 
under federal jurisdiction in 1934.  And  the  evidence  in  the 
record is to the contrary.  48 Fed. Reg. 6177.  Moreover, the 
petition  for  writ  of  certiorari  filed  in  this  case  specifically 
represented  that  "[i]n  1934,  the  Narragansett  Indian  Tribe 
.  .  .  was  neither  federally  recognized  nor  under  the  juris-

such offenders generally were not charged with, or convicted of, felonies. 
Construing $ 922(g)(9) to exclude the domestic abuser convicted under a 
generic use-of-force statute would frustrate Congress' manifest purpose. 
The  statute  would  have  been  a  dead  letter  in  some  two-thirds  of  the 
States because, in 1996, only about one-third of them had criminal stat-
utes specifically proscribing domestic

Opinion of the Court 
three  counts  of  possessing  firearms  after  having  been  con-victed of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. 

The  indictment  identified  Hayes's  predicate  misdemeanor crime  of  domestic  violence  as  a  1994  conviction  for  battery 
in  violation  of  West  Virginia  law.1  The  victim  of  that  bat-tery,  the  indictment  alleged,  was  Hayes's  then-wife--a  per-
son  who  "shared  a  child  in  common"  with  Hayes  and  "who was cohabitating with . . . him  as a  spouse."  App. 3.

2 

Asserting  that  his  1994  West  Virginia  battery  conviction did not qualify as a predicate offense under $ 922(g)(9), Hayes 

moved  to  dismiss  the  indictment.  Section  922(g)(9),  Hayes maintained,  applies  only  to  persons  previously  convicted  of 
an  offense  that  has  as  an  element  a  domestic  relationship between  aggressor  and  victim.  The  West  Virginia  statute 
under which he was convicted in  1994, Hayes observed, was a  generic  battery  proscription,  not  a  law  designating  a  do-
mestic  relationship  between  offender  and  victim  as  an  ele-ment  of  the  offense.  The  United  States  District  Court  for 
the  Northern  District  of  West  Virginia  rejected  Hayes's  ar-gument  and  denied  his  motion  to  dismiss  the  indictment. 

1 West  Virginia's  battery  statute  provides:  "[A]ny  person  [who]  unlaw-
fully and intentionally makes physical contact of an insulting or provoking 
nature  with  the  person  of  another  or  unlawfully  and  intentionally  causes 
physical  harm  to  another  person, . . . shall  be  guilty  of a  misdemeanor." 
W. Va. Code Ann. $ 61-2-9(c) (Lexis 2005). 

2 The indictment stated, in relevant part: 

"Defendant  RANDY  EDWARD  HAYES'  February  24,  1994  Battery 
conviction  .  .  .  constituted  a  misdemeanor  crime  of  domestic  violence 
because: 

"a.  Battery is a misdemeanor under State law in West Virginia; 
"b.  Battery  has,  as  an  element,  the  use  and  attempted  use  of  physical 
force; 

"c.  Defendant  RANDY  EDWARD  HAYES  committed  the  offense  of 
Battery against the victim: 

"i.  who was his current spouse; and 
"ii.  who was a person with whom he shared a child in common; and 
"iii.  who  was  cohabitating  with  and  had  cohabitated  with  him  as  a 
spouse."  App. 2-3 (bold typeface deleted).

Opinion of the Court 
guardian  of  the  victim,  by  a  person  with  whom  the  vic-tim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohab-

itating  with  or  has  cohabitated  with  the  victim  as  a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly sit-
uated  to  a  spouse,  parent,  or  guardian  of  the  victim." (Footnote omitted.) 

This definition, all agree, imposes two requirements: First, a  "misdemeanor  crime  of  domestic  violence"  must  have,  "as 
an  element,  the  use  or  attempted  use  of  physical  force,  or the  threatened  use  of  a  deadly  weapon."  Second,  it  must 
be  "committed  by"  a  person  who  has  a  specified  domestic relationship with  the  victim.  The question  here is  whether 
the  language  of  $ 921(a)(33)(A)  calls  for  a  further  limitation: Must the statute describing the predicate offense include, as 
a  discrete  element,  the  existence  of  a  domestic  relationship between offender and victim?  In line with the large major-
ity of the Courts of Appeals, we conclude that $ 921(a)(33)(A) does  not  require  a  predicate-offense  statute  of  that  specific-
ity.  Instead,  in  a  $ 922(g)(9)  prosecution,  it  suffices  for  the Government to charge and prove a prior conviction that was, 
in  fact,  for  "an  offense  .  .  .  committed  by"  the  defendant against a spouse or other domestic victim. 

We  note  as  an  initial  matter  that  $ 921(a)(33)(A)  uses  the word  "element"  in  the  singular,  which  suggests  that  Con-
gress  intended  to  describe  only  one  required  element.  Im-mediately  following  the  word  "element,"  $ 921(a)(33)(A)(ii) 
refers  to  the  use  of  force  (undoubtedly  a  required  element) and  thereafter  to  the  relationship  between  aggressor  and 
victim,  e.

Opinion of the Court 
The  challenge  here  focuses  on  retail  prices--where  there is  no  predatory  pricing--and  the  terms  of  dealing--where 

there  is  no  duty  to  deal.  Plaintiffs'  price-squeeze  claims challenge  a  different  type  of  unilateral  conduct  in  which  a 
firm  "squeezes"  the  profit  margins  of  its  competitors.  This requires  the  defendant  to  be  operating  in  two  markets,  a 
wholesale  ("upstream")  market  and  a  retail  ("downstream") market.  A  firm  with  market  power  in  the  upstream  mar-
ket  can  squeeze  its  downstream  competitors  by  raising  the wholesale  price of inputs while  cutting its own  retail  prices. 
This  will  raise  competitors'  costs  (because  they  will  have  to pay more for their inputs) and lower their revenues (because 
they will have to match the dominant firm's low retail price). Price-squeeze  plaintiffs  assert  that  defendants  must  leave 
them  a  "fair"  or  "adequate"  margin  between  the  wholesale price and the retail price.  In this case, we consider whether 
a  plaintiff  can  state  a  price-squeeze  claim  when  the  defend-ant  has  no  obligation  under  the  antitrust  laws  to  deal  with 
the plaintiff at wholesale.  B

obligation to deal under terms and conditions favorable to its competitors.  If  AT&T  had  simply  stopped  providing  DSL 

transport service to the plaintiffs, it would not have run afoul of the Sherman Act.  Under these circumstances, AT&T was 
not required to offer this service at the wholesale prices the plaintiffs would have preferred.

Respondent  Summum  is  a  religious  organization  founded in 1975 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.  On two

denied  the  requests  and  explained  that  its  practice  was  to limit monuments in the Park to those that "either (1) directly

ment accepts and displays to the public on government land. It  certainly  is  not  common  for  property  owners  to  open  up 

their  property  for  the  installation  of  permanent  monuments that  convey  a  message  with  which  they  do  not  wish  to  be 
associated.  And  because  property  owners  typically  do  not permit  the  construction  of  such  monuments  on  their  land, 
persons  who  observe  donated  monuments  routinely--and 
reasonably--interpret  them  as  conveying  some  message  on the  property  owner's  behalf.  In  this  context,  there  is  little 

chance  that  observers  will  fail  to  appreciate  the  identity  of the  speaker.  This is  true whether the  monument is located 
on  private  property  or  on  public  property,  such  as  national, 
state, or city park land. 

We think it is fair to say that throughout our Nation's his-
tory,  the  general  government  practice  with  respect  to  do-
nated  monuments  has  been  one  of  selective  receptivity.  A 
great many of the monuments that adorn the Nation's public 
parks  were  financed  with  private  funds  or  donated  by  pri-
vate  parties.  Sites  managed  by  the  National  Park  Service 
contain thousands of privately designed or funded commemo-
rative  objects,  including  the  Statue  of  Liberty,  the  Marine 
Corps  War  Memorial  (the  Iwo  Jima  monument),  and  the 
Vietnam  Veterans  Memorial.  States  and  cities  likewise 
have  received  thousands  of  donated  monuments.  See,  e.

These  text-based  monuments  are  almost  certain  to  evoke different  thoughts  and  sentiments  in  the  minds  of  different

But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you'll join us 
And the world will be as one 

"Imagine no possessions 
I wonder if you can 
No need for greed or hunger 
A brotherhood of man 
Imagine all the people 
Sharing all  the  world . . .  

"You may say I'm a dreamer 
But I'm not the only one 
I hope someday you'll join us 
And the world will live as one."  J. Lennon, Imagine, on Imagine (Apple

The  message  that  a  government  entity  conveys  by  allow-ing  a  monument  to  remain  on  its  property  may  also  be  al-
tered by the subsequent addition of other monuments in the same vicinity.  For example, following controversy over the 
original design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a compro-
mise  was  reached  that  called  for  the  nearby  addition  of  a flagstaff  and  bronze  Three  Soldiers  statue,  which  many  be-

lieved changed the overall effect of the memorial.  See, e.

suffice.  Respondents  have  identified  no  application  of  the  invalidated 
regulations  that  threatens  imminent  and  concrete  harm  to  their  mem-
bers' interests.  Respondents' argument that they have standing based 
on  Burnt  Ridge  fails  because,  after  voluntarily  settling  the  portion  of 
their  lawsuit  relevant  to  Burnt  Ridge,  respondents  and  their  members 
are no longer under threat of injury from that project.  The remaining 
affidavit  submitted  in  support  of  standing  fails  to  establish  that  any

tions are being applied in  a  manner that will harm that  member's  con-

Opinion of the Court 
comment, provided that fire-rehabilitation activities on areas of less than 4,200 acres, and salvage-timber sales of 250 acres 

or less, did not cause a significant environmental impact and thus would be categorically exempt from the requirement to 
file an  EIS or EA.  68 Fed.  Reg. 33824 (2003)  (Forest Serv-ice Handbook (FSH) 1909.15, ch.  30, $ 31.2(11)); 68 Fed. Reg. 
44607  (FSH  1909.15,  ch.  30,  $ 31.2(13)).  This  had  the  effect 
of  excluding  these  projects  from  the  notice,  comment,  and appeal process. 

In the summer of 2002, fire burned a significant area of the Sequoia  National  Forest.  In  September  2003,  the  Service 
issued  a  decision  memo  approving  the  Burnt  Ridge  Project, 
a  salvage  sale  of  timber  on  238  acres  damaged  by  that  fire. 
Pursuant  to  its  categorical  exclusion  of  salvage  sales  of  less 
than  250  acres,  the  Forest  Service  did  not  provide  notice  in 
a form consistent with the Appeals Reform Act, did not pro-
vide a period of public comment, and did not make an appeal 
process available. 

In  December  2003,  respondents  filed  a  complaint  in  the 
Eastern  District of  California, challenging  the  failure  of the 
Forest Service to apply to the Burnt Ridge Project $ 215.4(a) 
of its regulations implementing the Appeals Reform Act (re-
quiring prior notice and comment), and $ 215.12(f) of the reg-
ulations (setting forth an appeal procedure).  The complaint 
also  challenged  six  other  Forest  Service  regulations  imple-
menting  the  Act  that  were  not  applied  to  the  Burnt  Ridge 
Project.  They are irrelevant to this appeal. 

The District  Court granted a preliminary  injunction 
against the Burnt Ridge salvage-timber sale.  Soon thereaf-
ter,  the  parties  settled  their  dispute  over  the  Burnt  Ridge 
Project  and  the  District  Court  concluded  that  "the  Burnt 
Ridge timber sale is not at issue in this case."  Earth

Opinion of the Court 
Respondents have identified no other application of the in-validated  regulations  that  threatens  imminent  and  concrete 

harm to the  interests of their  members.  The only other af-fidavit  relied  on  was  that  of  Jim  Bensman.*  He  asserted, 
first,  that  he  had  suffered  injury  in  the  past  from  devel-opment  on  Forest  Service  land.  That  does  not  suffice  for 
several  reasons:  because  it  was  not  tied  to  application  of the  challenged  regulations,  because  it  does  not  identify  any 
particular  site,  and  because  it  relates  to  past  injury  rather than  imminent  future  injury  that  is  sought  to  be  enjoined. 

Bensman's  affidavit  further  asserts  that  he  has  visited many national forests and plans to visit several unnamed na-
tional forests in the future.  Respondents describe this as a mere  failure  to  "provide  the  name  of  each  timber  sale  that 
affected  [Bensman's]  interests,"  Brief  for  Respondents  44. It  is  much  more  (or  much  less)  than  that.  It  is  a  failure  to

Opinion of the Court 
Respondents  alleged  such  injury  in  their  challenge  to  the Burnt Ridge  Project, claiming that but for the  allegedly un-

lawful  abridged  procedures  they  would  have  been  able  to oppose  the  project  that  threatened  to  impinge  on  their  con-
crete  plans  to  observe  nature  in  that  specific  area.  But Burnt Ridge is now off the table. 

It makes  no difference  that  the  procedural right  has  been accorded by Congress.  That can loosen the strictures of the 
redressability prong  of our  standing  inquiry--so  that  stand-ing  existed  with  regard  to  the  Burnt  Ridge  Project,  for  ex-
ample,  despite  the  possibility  that  Earth  Island's  allegedly guaranteed right to comment would not be successful in per-
suading the Forest Service to avoid impairment of Earth Is-land's  concrete  interests.  See

556  WYETH  v.  LEVINE 

Syllabus 
(b)  Wyeth's  argument  that  requiring  it  to  comply  with  a  state-law 
duty to provide a stronger warning would interfere with Congress' pur-
pose of entrusting an expert agency with drug labeling decisions is mer-
itless  because  it  relies  on  an  untenable  interpretation  of  congressional 
intent  and  an  overbroad  view  of  an  agency's  power  to  pre-empt  state 
law.  The  history  of  the  FDCA  shows that  Congress  did  not  intend  to 
pre-empt state-law failure-to-warn actions.  In advancing the argument 
that the FDA must be presumed to have established a specific labeling 
standard that leaves no room for different state-law judgments, Wyeth 
relies not on any statement by Congress but on the preamble to a 2006 
FDA regulation declaring that state-law failure-to-warn claims threaten 
the  FDA's  statutorily  prescribed  role.  Although  an  agency  regulation 
with  the  force  of  law  can  pre-empt  conflicting  state  requirements,  this 
case  involves  no  such  regulation  but  merely  an  agency's  assertion  that 
state  law  is  an  obstacle  to  achieving  its  statutory  objectives.  Where, 
as here, Congress has not authorized a federal agency to pre-empt state 
law  directly,  the  weight  this  Court  accords  the  agency's  explanation  of 
state  law's  impact  on  the  federal  scheme  depends  on  its  thoroughness, 
consistency, and persuasiveness.  Cf., e. g., Skidmore v.  Swift & Co., 323 
U. S.  134.  Under  this  standard,  the  FDA's  2006  preamble  does  not 
merit  deference:  It  is  inherently  suspect  in  light  of  the  FDA's  failure 
to  offer  interested  parties  notice  or  opportunity  for  comment  on  the 
pre-emption  question;  it  is  at  odds  with  the  available  evidence  of  Con-

Opinion of the Court 
Wyeth with a complete defense to Levine's tort claims.  We conclude that they do not. 

I 
Phenergan is Wyeth's brand name for promethazine hydro-chloride, an antihistamine used to treat nausea.  The inject-

able form of Phenergan can be administered intramuscularly or  intravenously,  and  it  can  be  administered  intravenously 
through  either  the  "IV-push"  method,  whereby  the  drug  is injected  directly  into  a  patient's  vein,  or  the  "IV-drip" 
method, whereby the drug is introduced into a saline solution in a hanging intravenous bag and slowly descends through a 
catheter  inserted  in  a  patient's  vein.  The  drug  is  corrosive and  causes  irreversible  gangrene  if  it  enters  a  patient's 
artery. Levine's injury resulted from an IV-push injection of Phen-
ergan.  On  April  7,  2000,  as  on  previous  visits  to  her  local clinic  for  treatment  of  a  migraine  headache,  she  received  an 
intramuscular  injection  of  Demerol  for  her  headache  and Phenergan for her nausea.  Because the combination did not 
provide  relief,  she  returned  later  that  day  and  received  a second injection of both drugs.  This time, the physician as-
sistant  administered  the  drugs  by  the  IV-push  method,  and Phenergan  entered  Levine's  artery,  either  because  the  nee-
dle  penetrated  an  artery  directly  or  because  the  drug  es-caped  from  the  vein  into  surrounding  tissue  (a  phenomenon 
called "perivascular extravasation") where it came in contact with  arterial  blood.  As  a  result,  Levine  developed  gan-
grene,  and  doctors  amputated  first  her  right  hand  and  then her  entire  forearm.  In  addition  to  her  pain  and  suffering, 
Levine incurred substantial medical expenses and the loss of her livelihood as a professional musician. 

After  settling  claims  against  the  health  center  and  clini-cian,  Levine  brought  an  action  for  damages  against  Wyeth, 
relying  on  common-law  negligence  and  strict-liability  theo-ries.  Although  Phenergan's  labeling  warned  of  the  danger 
of  gangrene  and  amputation  following  inadvertent  intra-

Opinion of the Court 
arterial  injection,1  Levine  alleged  that  the  labeling  was  de-fective  because  it  failed  to  instruct  clinicians  to  use  the  IV-

drip  method  of  intravenous  administration  instead  of  the higher risk IV-push method.  More broadly, she alleged that 
Phenergan is not reasonably safe for intravenous administra-tion  because  the  foreseeable  risks  of  gangrene  and  loss  of 
limb  are  great in  relation  to the  drug's therapeutic benefits. App. 14-15. 

Wyeth filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Levine's  failure-to-warn  claims  were  pre-empted  by  federal 
law.  The  court  found  no  merit  in  either  Wyeth's  field  pre-emption argument, which it has  since abandoned, or its con-
flict pre-emption argument.  With respect to the contention that  there  was  an  "actual  conflict  between  a  specific  FDA 
order,"  id.,  at  21,  and  Levine's  failure-to-warn  action,  the 

1 The warning for "Inadvertent Intra-arterial Injection" stated: "Due to 
the close proximity of arteries and veins in the areas most commonly used 
for intravenous injection, extreme care should be exercised to avoid peri-
vascular  extravasation  or  inadvertent  intra-arterial  injection.  Reports 
compatible  with  inadvertent  intra-arterial  injection  of  Phenergan  Injec-
tion, usually in conjunction with other drugs intended for intravenous use, 
suggest  that  pain,  severe  chemical  irritation,  severe  spasm  of  distal  ves-
sels,  and  resultant  gangrene  requiring  amputation  are  likely  under  such 
circumstances.  Intravenous  injection  was  intended  in  all  the  cases  re-
ported but perivascular extravasation or arterial placement of the needle 
is now suspect.  There is no proven successful management of this condi-
tion after it occurs.  . . . Aspiration of dark  blood does  not preclude intra-
arterial  needle  placement,  because  blood  is  discolored  upon  contact  with 
Phenergan  Injection.  Use  of  syringes  with  rigid  plungers  or  of  small 
bore needles might obscure typical arterial backflow if this is relied upon 
alone.  When used intravenously, Phenergan Injection should be given in 
a concentration no greater than 25 mg per mL and at a rate not to exceed 
25 mg per minute.  When administering any irritant drug intravenously, 
it  is  usually  preferable  to  inject  it  through  the  tubing  of  an  intravenous 
infusion  set  that  is  known  to  be  functioning  satisfactorily.  In  the  event 
that a  patient  complains  of pain  during  intended  intravenous  injection of 
Phenergan Injection, the injection should be stopped immediately to pro-
vide for evaluation of possible arterial placement or perivascular extrava-
sation."  App. 390.

Opinion of the Court 
court  reviewed  the  sparse  correspondence  between  Wyeth and  the  FDA  about  Phenergan's  labeling  and  found  no  evi-

dence  that  Wyeth  had  "earnestly  attempted"  to  strengthen the  intra-arterial  injection  warning  or  that  the  FDA  had 
"specifically  disallowed"  stronger  language,  id.,  at  23.  The record,  as  then  developed,  "lack[ed]  any  evidence  that  the 
FDA set a ceiling on this matter."  Ibid. The evidence presented during the 5-day jury trial showed 
that  the  risk  of  intra-arterial  injection  or  perivascular  ex-
travasation  can  be  almost  entirely  eliminated  through  the use of IV-drip, rather than IV-push, administration.  An IV 

drip  is  started  with  saline,  which  will  not  flow  properly  if 
the catheter is not in the vein and fluid is entering an artery 
or surrounding tissue.  See id., at 50-51, 60, 66-68, 75.  By 
contrast,  even  a  careful  and  experienced  clinician  using  the 
IV-push  method  will  occasionally  expose  an  artery  to  Phen-
ergan.  See  id.,  at  73,  75-76.  While  Phenergan's  labeling 
warned  against  intra-arterial  injection  and  perivascular  ex-
travasation and advised that "[w]hen administering any irri-
tant  drug  intravenously  it  is  usually  preferable  to  inject  it 
through  the  tubing  of  an  intravenous  infusion  set  that  is 
known to be functioning satisfactorily," id., at 390, the label-
ing  did  not  contain  a  specific  warning  about  the  risks  of  IV-
push administration. 

The  trial  record  also  contains  correspondence  between 
Wyeth  and  the  FDA  discussing  Phenergan's  label.  The 
FDA  first  approved  injectable  Phenergan  in  1955.  In  1973 
and  1976,  Wyeth  submitted  supplemental  new  drug  applica-
tions,  which  the  agency  approved  after  proposing  labeling 
changes.  Wyeth submitted a third supplemental application 
in 1981 in response to a new FDA rule governing drug labels. 
Over  the  next  17  years,  Wyeth  and  the  FDA  intermittently 
corresponded  about  Phenergan's  label.  The  most  notable 
activity occurred in 1987, when the FDA suggested different 
warnings  about  the  risk  of  arterial  exposure,  and  in  1988, 
when  Wyeth  submitted  revised  labeling  incorporating  the

Opinion of the Court 
proposed  changes.  The  FDA  did  not  respond.  Instead,  in 1996,  it  requested  from  Wyeth  the  labeling  then  in  use  and, 

without addressing Wyeth's 1988 submission, instructed it to "[r]etain  verbiage  in  current  label"  regarding  intra-arterial 
injection.  Id.,  at  359.  After  a  few  further  changes  to  the labeling  not  related  to  intra-arterial  injection,  the  FDA  ap-
proved  Wyeth's  1981  application  in  1998,  instructing  that 
Phenergan's final printed label "must be identical" to the ap-proved package insert. 

Id., at 382. 
Based on this regulatory history, the trial judge instructed the  jury  that  it  could  consider  evidence  of  Wyeth's  compli-

ance  with  FDA  requirements  but  that  such  compliance  did 
not establish that the warnings were adequate.  He also in-
structed,  without  objection  from  Wyeth,  that  FDA  regula-
tions "permit a drug manufacturer to change a product label 
to  add  or  strengthen  a  warning  about  its  product  without 
prior  FDA  approval  so  long  as  it  later  submits  the  revised 
warning for review and approval."  Id., at 228. 

Answering  questions  on  a  special  verdict  form,  the  jury 
found  that  Wyeth  was  negligent,  that  Phenergan  was  a  de-
fective  product  as  a  result  of  inadequate  warnings  and  in-
structions,  and  that  no  intervening  cause  had  broken  the 
causal connection between the product defects and the plain-
tiff 's  injury.  Id.,  at  233-235.  It  awarded  total  damages  of 
$7,400,000,  which  the  court  reduced  to  account  for  Levine's 
earlier settlement with the  health center and clinician.  Id., 
at 235-236. 

On  August  3,  2004,  the  trial  court  filed  a  comprehensive 
opinion denying Wyeth's motion for judgment as a matter of 
law.  After making findings of fact based on the trial record 
(supplemented  by  one  letter  that  Wyeth  found  after  the 
trial),  the  court  rejected  Wyeth's  pre-emption  arguments. 
It determined that there was no direct conflict between FDA 
regulations and Levine's state-law claims because those reg-
ulations  permit  strengthened  warnings  without  FDA  ap-
proval on an interim basis and the record contained evidence

Opinion of the Court 
of at least 20 reports of amputations similar to Levine's since the  1960's.  The  court  also  found  that  state  tort  liability  in 

this  case  would  not  obstruct  the  FDA's  work  because  the agency had paid no more than passing attention to the ques-
tion whether to warn against IV-push administration of Phen-ergan.  In  addition,  the  court  noted  that  state  law  serves  a 
compensatory function distinct from federal regulation.  Id., at 249-252. 

The  Vermont  Supreme  Court  affirmed.  It  held  that  the jury's  verdict  "did  not  conflict  with  FDA's  labeling  require-
ments  for  Phenergan  because  [Wyeth]  could  have  warned against IV-push administration without prior FDA approval, 
and because federal labeling requirements create a floor, not a  ceiling,  for  state  regulation."  183  Vt.  76,  84,  944  A.  2d 
179, 184 (2006).  In dissent, Chief Justice Reiber argued that the  jury's  verdict  conflicted  with  federal  law  because  it  was 
inconsistent  with  the  FDA's  conclusion  that  intravenous  ad-ministration of Phenergan was safe and effective. 

The importance of the pre-emption issue, coupled with the fact that the FDA has changed its position on state tort law 
and now endorses the views expressed in Chief Justice Reib-er's  dissent,  persuaded  us  to  grant  Wyeth's  petition  for  cer-
tiorari.  552  U. S.  1161  (2008).  The  question  presented  by the  petition  is  whether  the  FDA's  drug  labeling  judgments 
"preempt  state  law  product  liability  claims  premised  on  the theory  that  different  labeling  judgments  were  necessary  to 
make drugs reasonably safe for use."  Pet. for Cert. i.

Wyeth  makes  two  separate  pre-emption  arguments:  first, that it would have been impossible for it to comply with the 

state-law  duty  to  modify  Phenergan's  labeling  without  vio-lating federal law, see 

Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v.  De 
la Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153 (1982), and second, that recogni-tion of Levine's state tort action creates an unacceptable "ob-

stacle  to  the  accomplishment  and  execution  of  the  full  pur-

Opinion of the Court 
poses and objectives of Congress," Hines v.  Davidowitz, 312 
U. S. 52, 67 (1941), because it substitutes a lay jury's decision 
about  drug  labeling  for  the  expert  judgment  of  the  FDA. 
As a  preface to our  evaluation  of these arguments,  we  iden-
tify  two  factual  propositions  decided  during  the  trial  court 
proceedings,  emphasize  two  legal  principles  that  guide  our 
analysis,  and  review  the  history  of  the  controlling  federal 
statute. 

The  trial  court  proceedings  established  that  Levine's  in-
jury  would  not  have  occurred  if  Phenergan's  label  had  in-
cluded  an  adequate  warning  about  the  risks  of  the  IV-push 
method of administering the drug.  The record contains evi-
dence  that  the  physician  assistant  administered  a  greater 
dose  than  the  label  prescribed,  that  she  may  have  inadvert-
ently injected the drug into an artery rather than a vein, and 
that  she  continued  to  inject  the  drug  after  Levine  com-
plained of pain.  Nevertheless, the jury rejected Wyeth's ar-
gument that the clinician's conduct was an intervening cause 
that  absolved  it  of  liability.  See  App.  234  ( jury  verdict), 
252-254.  In finding  Wyeth  negligent as well as strictly  lia-
ble,  the  jury  also  determined  that  Levine's  injury  was  fore-
seeable.  That  the  inadequate  label  was  both  a  but-for  and 
proximate  cause  of  Levine's  injury  is  supported  by  the  rec-
ord and no longer challenged by Wyeth.2 

The  trial  court  proceedings  further  established  that  the 
critical  defect  in  Phenergan's  label  was  the  lack  of  an  ade-
quate  warning  about  the  risks  of  IV-push  administration. 
Levine also offered evidence that the IV-push method should 

2 The  dissent  nonetheless  suggests  that  physician  malpractice  was  the 
exclusive  cause  of  Levine's  injury.  See,  e. g.,  post,  at  605  (opinion  of

Opinion of the Court 
be  contraindicated  and  that  Phenergan  should  never  be  ad-ministered intravenously, even by the IV-drip method.  Per-

haps for this reason, the dissent incorrectly assumes that the state-law  duty  at  issue  is  the  duty  to  contraindicate  the  IV-
push method.  See, e. g., post, at 611, 628.  But, as the  Ver-mont Supreme Court explained, the jury verdict established 
only  that  Phenergan's  warning  was  insufficient.  It  did  not mandate a particular replacement warning, nor did it require 
contraindicating  IV-push  administration:  "There  may  have been  any  number  of  ways  for  [Wyeth]  to  strengthen  the 
Phenergan  warning  without completely  eliminating  IV-push administration."  183 Vt., at 92,  n. 2,  944 A. 2d, at 189, n. 2. 
We therefore need not decide whether a state rule proscrib-ing  intravenous  administration  would  be  pre-empted.  The 
narrower  question  presented  is  whether  federal  law  pre-empts  Levine's  claim  that  Phenergan's  label  did  not  contain 
an  adequate  warning  about  using  the  IV-push  method  of administration. 

Our  answer  to  that  question  must  be  guided  by  two  cor-nerstones  of  our  pre-emption  jurisprudence.  First,  "the 
purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone in every pre-emption  case."  Medtronic,  Inc.  v.  Lohr,  518  U. S.  470,  485 
(1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Retail Clerks v.  Schermerhorn,  375  U. S.  96,  103  (1963).  Second,  "[i]n  all 
pre-emption  cases,  and  particularly  in  those  in  which  Con-gress  has  `legislated  .  .  .  in  a  field  which  the  States  have 
traditionally  occupied,'  .  .  .  we  `start  with  the  assumption that  the  historic  police  powers  of  the  States  were  not  to  be 
superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest  purpose  of  Congress.' " 

Lohr,  518  U. S.,  at  485 (quoting  Rice v.  Santa Fe  Elevator  Corp.,  331 U. S.  218, 230 

(1947)).3 

3 Wyeth  argues  that  the  presumption  against  pre-emption  should  not 
apply  to  this  case  because  the  Federal  Government  has  regulated  drug 
labeling  for  more  than  a  century.  That  argument  misunderstands  the 
principle:  We  rely  on  the  presumption  because  respect  for  the  States  as

566  WYETH  v.  LEVINE 

Opinion of the Court 
In order to identify the "purpose of Congress," it is appro-
priate  to  briefly  review  the  history  of  federal  regulation  of 
drugs and drug labeling.  In 1906, Congress enacted its first 
significant  public  health  law,  the  Federal  Food  and  Drugs 
Act,  ch.  3915,  34  Stat.  768.  The  Act,  which  prohibited  the 
manufacture  or  interstate  shipment  of  adulterated  or  mis-
branded  drugs,  supplemented  the  protection  for  consumers 
already provided by state regulation and common-law liabil-
ity.  In  the  1930's,  Congress became  increasingly  concerned 
about unsafe drugs and fraudulent marketing, and it enacted 
the  Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act  (FDCA), ch.  675, 
52  Stat.  1040,  as  amended,  21  U. S. C.  $ 301  et  seq.  The 
FDCA's  most  substantial  innovation  was  its  provision  for 
premarket approval of new drugs.  It required every manu-
facturer to submit a new  drug application, including reports 
of  investigations  and  specimens  of  proposed  labeling,  to  the 
FDA  for  review.  Until  its  application  became  effective,  a 
manufacturer was prohibited from distributing a drug.  The 
FDA  could  reject  an  application  if  it  determined  that  the 
drug  was  not  safe  for  use  as  labeled,  though  if  the  agency 
failed  to  act,  an  application  became  effective  60  days  after 
the filing.  FDCA, $ 505(c), 52 Stat. 1052. 

"independent  sovereigns  in  our  federal  system"  leads  us  to  assume  that 
"Congress does not cavalierly pre-empt state-law causes of action."  Lohr, 
518 U. S., at 485.  The presumption thus accounts for the historic presence 
of state law but does not rely on the absence of federal regulation. 

For  its  part,  the  dissent  argues  that  the  presumption  against  pre-
emption  should  not  apply  to  claims  of  implied  conflict  pre-emption  at  all, 
post, at 623-624, but this Court  has long held to the contrary.  See, e. g., 
California  v.  ARC  America  Corp.,  490  U. S.  93,  101-102  (1989);  Hills-
borough County v.  Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.,  471 U. S.  707, 
716 (1985);  see also Rush Prudential HMO, Inc. v.  Moran, 536 U. S.  355, 
387  (2002).  The  dissent's  reliance  on  Buckman  Co.  v.  Plaintiffs'  Legal 
Comm., 531 U. S. 341 (2001), see post, at 624, and n. 14, is especially curi-
ous,  as  that  case  involved  state-law  fraud-on-the-agency  claims,  and  the 
Court  distinguished  state  regulation  of  health  and  safety  as  matters  to 
which the presumption does apply.  See 531 U. S., at 347-348.

Opinion of the Court 
In 1962, Congress amended the FDCA and shifted the bur-den  of  proof  from  the  FDA  to  the  manufacturer.  Before 

1962,  the  agency  had  to  prove  harm  to  keep  a  drug  out  of the  market, but the amendments  required the  manufacturer 
to  demonstrate  that  its  drug  was  "safe  for  use  under  the conditions  prescribed,  recommended,  or  suggested  in  the 
proposed  labeling"  before  it  could  distribute  the  drug. 

$$ 102(c),  104(b),  76  Stat.  781,  784.  In  addition,  the  amend-ments  required  the  manufacturer  to  prove  the  drug's  effec-

As  it  enlarged  the  FDA's  powers  to  "protect  the  public 
health"  and  "assure  the  safety,  effectiveness,  and  reliability 
of  drugs,"  id.,  at  780,  Congress  took  care  to  preserve  state 
law.  The  1962  amendments  added  a  saving  clause,  indicat-
ing  that  a  provision  of  state  law  would  only  be  invalidated 
upon a "direct and positive conflict" with the FDCA.  $ 202,

law suits "continued unabated  despite . .  . FDA  regulation."

main  responsible  for  updating  their  labels.  See  121  Stat. 925-926. 

III 
Wyeth first argues that Levine's state-law claims are pre-empted  because  it  is  impossible  for  it  to  comply  with  both 

the  state-law  duties  underlying  those  claims  and  its  federal labeling  duties.  See 

De  la  Cuesta,  458  U. S.,  at  153.  The FDA's  premarket  approval  of  a  new  drug  application  in-

cludes  the  approval  of  the  exact  text  in  the  proposed  label. See 21 U. S. C. $ 355; 21 CFR $ 314.105(b) (2008).  Generally 
speaking, a manufacturer may only change a drug label after the  FDA  approves  a  supplemental  application.  There  is, 
however,  an  FDA  regulation  that  permits  a  manufacturer to  make  certain  changes  to  its  label  before  receiving  the 
agency's approval.  Among other things, this "changes being effected"  (CBE)  regulation  provides  that  if  a  manufacturer 
is changing a label  to "add  or strengthen  a contraindication, warning,  precaution,  or  adverse  reaction"  or  to  "add  or 
strengthen  an  instruction  about  dosage  and  administration that is intended to increase the safe use of the drug product," 
it may make the labeling change upon filing its supplemental application  with  the  FDA;  it  need  not  wait  for  FDA  ap-
proval.  $$ 314.70(c)(6)(iii)(A), (C). Wyeth  argues  that  the  CBE  regulation  is  not  implicated 
in this case because a 2008 amendment provides that a manu-facturer may only change its label "to reflect newly acquired 
information."  73  Fed.  Reg.  49609.  Resting  on  this  lan-guage  (which  Wyeth  argues  simply  reaffirmed  the  interpre-
tation  of  the  regulation  in  effect  when  this  case  was  tried), Wyeth contends that it could have changed Phenergan's label 
only  in  response  to  new  information  that  the  FDA  had  not considered.  And  it  maintains  that  Levine  has  not  pointed 
to  any  such  information  concerning  the  risks  of  IV-push  ad-ministration.  Thus,  Wyeth  insists,  it  was  impossible  for  it

Opinion of the Court 
to  discharge  its  state-law  obligation  to  provide  a  stronger warning about IV-push administration without violating fed-

eral law.  Wyeth's argument misapprehends both the federal drug  regulatory  scheme  and  its  burden  in  establishing  a 
pre-emption defense. We  need  not  decide  whether  the  2008  CBE  regulation  is 
consistent  with  the  FDCA  and  the  previous  version  of  the regulation,  as  Wyeth  and  the  United  States  urge,  because 
Wyeth  could  have  revised  Phenergan's  label  even  in  accord-ance  with  the  amended  regulation.  As  the  FDA  explained 
in its notice of the final rule, " `newly acquired information' " is not limited to new data, but also encompasses "new analy-
ses  of previously  submitted data."  Id.,  at 49604.  The  rule accounts for the  fact that  risk  information accumulates over 
time and that the same data may take on a different meaning in  light  of  subsequent  developments:  "[I]f  the  sponsor  sub-
mits  adverse  event  information  to FDA,  and  then  later  con-ducts a new analysis of data showing risks of a different type 
or  of  greater  severity  or  frequency  than  did  reports  pre-viously  submitted  to  FDA,  the  sponsor  meets  the  require-
ment  for  `newly  acquired  information.' "  Id.,  at  49607;  see also id., at 49606. 

The  record  is  limited  concerning  what  newly  acquired  in-formation  Wyeth  had  or  should  have  had  about  the  risks  of 
IV-push administration of Phenergan because Wyeth did not argue  before  the  trial  court  that  such  information  was  re-
quired  for  a  CBE  labeling  change.  Levine  did,  however, present  evidence  of  at  least  20  incidents  prior  to  her  injury 
in  which  a  Phenergan injection  resulted  in  gangrene  and an amputation.  See  App.  74,  252.

4  After  the  first  such  inci-

dent  came  to  Wyeth's  attention  in  1967,  it  notified  the  FDA and  worked  with  the  agency  to  change  Phenergan's  label. 

4 Levine  also  introduced  evidence  that  Pfizer  had  withdrawn  Vistaril, 
another antinausea drug, from intravenous use several decades earlier be-
cause its intravenous injection had resulted in gangrene and amputations. 
See App. 79.

570  WYETH  v.  LEVINE 

Opinion of the Court 
In  later  years,  as  amputations  continued  to  occur,  Wyeth could  have  analyzed  the  accumulating  data  and  added  a 

stronger warning about IV-push administration of the drug. Wyeth argues that if it had unilaterally added such a warn-
ing,  it  would  have  violated  federal  law  governing  unauthor-ized  distribution  and  misbranding.  Its  argument  that  a 
change  in  Phenergan's  labeling  would  have  subjected  it  to 
liability  for  unauthorized  distribution  rests  on  the  assump-tion  that  this  labeling  change  would  have  rendered  Phen-

ergan  a  new  drug  lacking  an  effective  application.  But strengthening  the  warning  about  IV-push  administration 
would  not  have  made  Phenergan  a  new  drug.  See  21 
U. S. C. $ 321(p)(1)  (defining "new  drug"); 21  CFR $ 310.3(h). 
Nor  would  this  warning  have  rendered  Phenergan  mis-
branded.  The  FDCA  does  not  provide  that  a  drug  is  mis-
branded  simply  because  the  manufacturer  has  altered  an 
FDA-approved  label;  instead,  the  misbranding  provision  fo-
cuses on the substance of the label and, among other things, 
proscribes  labels  that  fail  to  include  "adequate  warnings." 
21  U. S. C.  $ 352(f).  Moreover,  because  the  statute  contem-
plates  that  federal  juries  will  resolve  most  misbranding 
claims,  the  FDA's  belief  that  a  drug  is  misbranded  is  not 
conclusive.  See  $$ 331,  332,  334(a)-(b).  And  the  very  idea 
that  the  FDA  would  bring  an  enforcement  action  against  a 
manufacturer  for  strengthening  a  warning  pursuant  to  the 
CBE regulation is difficult to accept--neither Wyeth nor the 
United  States  has  identified  a  case  in  which  the  FDA  has 
done so. 

Wyeth's  cramped  reading  of  the  CBE  regulation  and  its 
broad reading  of the  FDCA's misbranding  and unauthorized 
distribution provisions are  premised  on a more fundamental 
misunderstanding.  Wyeth  suggests  that  the  FDA,  rather 
than the manufacturer, bears primary responsibility for drug 
labeling.  Yet through many amendments to the FDCA and 
to  FDA  regulations,  it  has  remained  a  central  premise  of 
federal drug regulation that the manufacturer bears respon-

Opinion of the Court 
sibility for the content of its label at all times.  It is charged both with crafting  an adequate label and with ensuring that 

its  warnings  remain  adequate  as  long  as  the  drug  is  on  the market.  See, 

e. g., 21 CFR $ 201.80(e) (requiring a manufac-
turer  to  revise  its  label  "to  include  a  warning  as  soon  as there  is  reasonable  evidence  of  an  association  of  a  serious 

hazard  with  a  drug");  $ 314.80(b)  (placing  responsibility  for 
postmarketing  surveillance  on  the  manufacturer);  73  Fed. Reg. 49605 ("Manufacturers continue to have a responsibility 

under Federal law . . . to maintain  their labeling and update the labeling with new safety information"). 

Indeed,  prior  to  2007,  the  FDA  lacked  the  authority  to 
order  manufacturers  to  revise  their  labels.  See  121  Stat. 
924-926.  When  Congress  granted  the  FDA  this  authority, 
it  reaffirmed  the  manufacturer's  obligations  and  referred 
specifically  to  the  CBE  regulation,  which  both  reflects  the 
manufacturer's  ultimate  responsibility  for  its  label  and  pro-
vides a mechanism for adding safety information to the label 
prior  to  FDA  approval.  See  id.,  at  925-926  (stating  that  a 
manufacturer retains the responsibility "to maintain its label 
in  accordance with  existing  requirements, including  subpart 
B of part 201 and sections 314.70 and 601.12 of title 21, Code 
of  Federal  Regulations  (or  any  successor  regulations)"  (em-
phasis  added)).  Thus,  when  the  risk  of  gangrene  from  IV-
push  injection  of  Phenergan  became  apparent,  Wyeth  had  a 
duty  to  provide  a  warning  that  adequately  described  that 
risk, and the  CBE regulation permitted it to provide  such a 
warning before receiving the FDA's approval. 

Of  course,  the  FDA  retains  authority  to  reject  labeling 
changes  made pursuant to the  CBE regulation in its  review 
of the manufacturer's supplemental application, just as it re-
tains  such  authority  in  reviewing  all  supplemental  applica-
tions.  But  absent  clear  evidence  that  the  FDA  would  not 
have  approved  a  change  to  Phenergan's  label,  we  will  not 
conclude  that  it  was  impossible  for  Wyeth  to  comply  with 
both federal and state requirements.

572  WYETH  v.  LEVINE 

Opinion of the Court 
Wyeth  has  offered  no  such  evidence.  It  does  not  argue 
that  it  attempted  to  give  the  kind  of  warning  required  by 
the  Vermont  jury  but  was  prohibited  from  doing  so  by  the 
FDA.5  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 12-13; see also Brief for United 
States  as  Amicus  Curiae  25.  And  while  it  does  suggest 
that the FDA intended to prohibit it from strengthening the 
warning  about  IV-push  administration  because  the  agency 
deemed  such  a  warning  inappropriate  in  reviewing  Phener-
gan's drug applications, both the trial court and the Vermont 
Supreme Court rejected this account as a matter of fact.  In 
its  decision  on  Wyeth's  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of 
law,  the  trial  court  found  "no  evidence  in  this  record  that 
either the FDA or the manufacturer gave more than passing 
attention to the issue of " IV-push versus IV-drip administra-
tion.  App. 249.  The Vermont Supreme Court likewise con-
cluded that the FDA had not made an affirmative decision to 
preserve the IV-push method or intended to prohibit Wyeth 
from  strengthening  its  warning  about  IV-push  administra-
tion.  183  Vt.,  at  91-92,  944  A.  2d,  at  188-189.  Moreover, 
Wyeth does not argue that it supplied the FDA with an eval-

5 The  record  would  not,  in  any  event,  support  such  an  argument.  In 
1988, Wyeth did propose different language for Phenergan's warning about 
intra-arterial injection, adapted from revisions the FDA proposed in 1987. 
See  id.,  at  339-341,  311-312.  When  the  FDA  approved  Wyeth's  appli-
cation,  it  instructed  Wyeth  to  retain  the  wording  in  its  current  label. 
During  the  trial  court  proceedings,  Levine  indicated  that  the  language 
proposed  in  1988  would  have  more  strongly  warned  against  IV-push  ad-
ministration.  But the trial court and the Vermont Supreme Court found 
that  the  1988  warning  did  not  differ  in  any  material  respect  from  the 
FDA-approved  warning.  See  183  Vt.  76,  92,  944  A.  2d  179,  189  (2006) 
("Simply stated, the proposed warning was different, but not stronger.  It 
was  also  no  longer  or  more  prominent  than  the  original  warning  .  .  .  "); 
App. 248-250.  Indeed, the United States concedes that the FDA did not 
regard the proposed warning as substantively different: "[I]t appears the 
FDA viewed the change as non-substantive and rejected it for formatting 
reasons."  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25; see also 183 Vt., 
at 92-93, 944 A. 2d, at 189.

uation  or  analysis  concerning  the  specific  dangers  posed  by the IV-push method.  We accordingly cannot credit Wyeth's 

contention that the FDA would have prevented it from add-ing a stronger warning about the IV-push method of intrave-
nous administration.6 Impossibility  pre-emption  is  a  demanding  defense.  On 
the  record  before  us,  Wyeth  has  failed  to  demonstrate  that it was impossible for it to comply with both federal and state 
requirements.  The  CBE  regulation  permitted  Wyeth  to unilaterally  strengthen  its  warning,  and  the  mere  fact  that 
the FDA approved Phenergan's label does not establish that it would have prohibited such a change. 

IV 
Wyeth  also  argues  that  requiring  it  to  comply  with  a state-law duty to provide a stronger warning about IV-push 

administration  would  obstruct  the  purposes  and  objectives of  federal  drug  labeling  regulation.  Levine's  tort  claims,  it 
maintains, are pre-empted because they interfere with "Con-gress's  purpose  to  entrust  an  expert  agency  to  make  drug 
labeling  decisions  that  strike  a  balance  between  competing objectives."  Brief  for  Petitioner  46.  We  find  no  merit  in 
this  argument,  which  relies  on  an  untenable  interpretation of congressional intent and an overbroad view of an agency's 
power to pre-empt state law. Wyeth  contends  that  the  FDCA  establishes  both  a  floor 
and  a  ceiling  for  drug  regulation:  Once  the  FDA  has  ap-

6 The  dissent's  suggestion  that  the  FDA  intended  to  prohibit  Wyeth 
from  strengthening  its  warning  does  not  fairly  reflect  the  record.  The 
dissent creatively paraphrases a few FDA orders--for instance by conflat-
ing  warnings  about  IV-push  administration  and  intra-arterial  injection, 
see,  e. g.,  post,  at  612-613,  614-651,  618-619--to  suggest  greater  agency 
attention to the question, and it undertakes a study of Phenergan's label-
ing  that  is  more  elaborate  than  any  FDA  order.  But  even  the  dissent's 
account  does  not  support  the  conclusion  that  the  FDA  would  have  pro-
hibited  Wyeth  from  adding  a  stronger  warning  pursuant  to  the  CBE 
regulation.

Opinion of the Court 
proved a drug's  label, a state-law  verdict may  not deem  the 
label inadequate, regardless of whether there is any evidence 
that the  FDA  has  considered  the  stronger  warning  at issue. 
The most glaring problem with this argument is that all evi-
dence of Congress' purposes is to the contrary.  Building on 
its  1906  Act,  Congress  enacted  the  FDCA  to  bolster  con-
sumer  protection  against  harmful  products.  See  Kordel  v. 
United States, 335 U. S. 345, 349 (1948); United States v.  Sul-
livan, 332 U. S. 689, 696 (1948).  Congress did not provide a 
federal  remedy  for  consumers  harmed  by  unsafe  or  ineffec-
tive  drugs  in  the  1938  statute  or  in  any  subsequent  amend-
ment.  Evidently,  it  determined  that  widely  available  state 
rights  of  action  provided  appropriate  relief  for  injured 
consumers.7  It  may  also  have  recognized  that  state-law 
remedies  further  consumer  protection  by  motivating  man-
ufacturers  to  produce  safe  and  effective  drugs  and  to  give 
adequate warnings. 

If  Congress  thought  state-law  suits  posed  an  obstacle  to 
its  objectives,  it  surely  would  have  enacted  an  express  pre-
emption provision at some point during the FDCA's 70-year 
history.  But  despite  its  1976  enactment  of  an  express  pre-
emption  provision  for  medical  devices,  see  $ 2,  90  Stat.  574 
(codified  at  21  U. S. C.  $ 360k(a)),  Congress  has  not  enacted 
such  a  provision  for  prescription  drugs.  See  Riegel,  552 
U. S.,  at  327  ("Congress  could  have  applied  the  pre-emption 
clause  to  the  entire  FDCA.  It  did  not  do  so,  but  instead

7 Although  the  first  version  of  the  bill  that  became  the  FDCA  would 
have provided a federal cause of action for damages for injured consumers, 
see H. R. 6110, 73d Cong., 1st Sess., $ 25 (1933) (as introduced), witnesses 
testified that such a right of action was unnecessary because common-law 
claims  were  already  available  under  state  law.  See  Hearings  on  S.  1944 
before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 73d Cong., 
2d Sess., 400 (1933) (statement of W. A. Hines); see id., at 403 (statement 
of  J.  A.  Ladds)  ("This  act  should  not  attempt  to  modify  or  restate  the

vices").8  Its  silence  on  the  issue,  coupled  with  its  certain awareness of the prevalence of state tort litigation, is power-

ful evidence  that  Congress  did  not  intend FDA  oversight  to be the exclusive means of ensuring drug safety and effective-
ness.  As  Justice  O'Connor  explained  in  her  opinion  for  a unanimous  Court:  "The  case  for  federal  pre-emption  is  par-
ticularly  weak  where  Congress  has  indicated  its  awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and 
has  nonetheless  decided  to  stand  by  both  concepts  and  to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them." 

Bonito Boats, Inc. v.  Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S. 141, 166- 

167 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also supra, at 565 (discussing the presumption against pre-emption). 

Despite  this  evidence  that  Congress  did  not  regard  state tort litigation as an obstacle to achieving its purposes, Wyeth 
nonetheless  maintains that,  because  the  FDCA  requires  the FDA  to  determine  that  a  drug  is  safe  and  effective  under 
the  conditions  set  forth  in  its  labeling,  the  agency  must  be presumed to have performed a precise balancing of risks and 
benefits  and  to  have  established  a  specific  labeling  standard that  leaves  no  room  for  different  state-law  judgments.  In 
advancing this argument, Wyeth relies not on any statement by  Congress,  but  instead  on  the  preamble  to  a  2006  FDA 
regulation governing the  content and format of prescription drug  labels.  See  Brief  for  Petitioner  8,  11,  42,  45,  and  50 
(citing  71  Fed.  Reg.  3922  (2006)).  In  that  preamble,  the FDA declared that the FDCA establishes "both a `floor' and 
a `ceiling,' " so that "FDA approval of labeling . . . preempts conflicting  or  contrary  State  law."  Id.,  at  3934-3935.  It 
further  stated  that  certain  state-law  actions,  such  as  those involving failure-to-warn claims, "threaten FDA's statutorily

This Court has recognized that an agency regulation with the force of law can pre-empt conflicting state requirements. 
See, e. g., Geier v.  American Honda Motor Co., 529 U. S. 861 (2000); 

Hillsborough County v.  Automated Medical Labora-tories,  Inc.,  471  U. S.  707,  713  (1985).  In  such  cases,  the 

Court  has  performed  its  own  conflict determination,  relying on the substance  of state  and federal law and not on agency 
proclamations  of  pre-emption.  We  are  faced  with  no  such regulation in this case, but rather with an agency's mere as-
sertion that state law is an obstacle to achieving its statutory objectives.  Because  Congress  has  not  authorized  the  FDA 
to pre-empt state law directly, cf. 21 U. S. C. $ 360k (authoriz-ing  the  FDA  to  determine  the  scope  of  the  Medical  Devices 
Amendments'  pre-emption  clause),9  the  question  is  what weight we should accord the FDA's opinion. 

In prior cases, we have given "some weight" to an agency's 
views  about  the  impact  of  tort  law  on  federal  objectives when "the subject matter is technica[l] and the relevant his-

tory  and  background  are  complex  and  extensive."  Geier, 529 U. S., at 883.  Even in such cases, however, we have not 
deferred  to  an  agency's  conclusion  that  state  law  is  pre-empted.  Rather,  we  have  attended  to  an  agency's  explana-
tion of how state law affects the regulatory scheme.  While

scheme  depends  on  its  thoroughness,  consistency,  and  per-suasiveness.  Cf. 

United States v.  Mead Corp., 533 U. S. 218, 
234-235  (2001);  Skidmore  v.  Swift  &  Co.,  323  U. S.  134,  140 
(1944). 

Under  this  standard,  the  FDA's  2006  preamble  does  not 
merit  deference.  When  the  FDA  issued  its  notice  of  pro-
posed  rulemaking  in  December  2000,  it  explained  that  the 
rule would "not contain policies that have federalism implica-
tions  or  that  preempt  State  law."  65  Fed.  Reg.  81103;  see 
also  71  id.,  at  3969  (noting  that  the  "proposed  rule  did  not 
propose  to  preempt  state  law").  In  2006,  the  agency  final-
ized the rule and, without offering States or other interested 
parties  notice  or  opportunity  for  comment,  articulated  a 
sweeping  position  on  the  FDCA's  pre-emptive  effect  in  the 
regulatory  preamble.  The  agency's  views  on  state  law  are 
inherently suspect in light of this procedural failure. 

Further,  the  preamble  is  at  odds  with  what  evidence  we 
have  of  Congress'  purposes,  and  it  reverses  the  FDA's  own 
longstanding position without providing a reasoned explana-
tion, including any discussion of how state law has interfered 
with  the  FDA's  regulation  of  drug  labeling  during  decades 
of coexistence.  The FDA's 2006 position plainly does not re-
flect the agency's own view at all times relevant to this litiga-
tion.  Not once prior to Levine's injury did the FDA suggest 
that state  tort law stood as an  obstacle  to its statutory  mis-
sion.  To  the  contrary,  it  cast  federal  labeling  standards  as 
a  floor  upon  which  States  could  build  and  repeatedly  dis-

Opinion of the Court 
claimed  any  attempt  to  pre-empt  failure-to-warn  claims. 
For instance, in 1998, the FDA stated that it did "not believe 
that the evolution of state tort law [would] cause the develop-
ment  of  standards  that  would  be  at  odds  with  the  agency's 
regulations."  63 id., at 66384.  It further noted that, in es-
tablishing "minimal standards" for drug labels, it did not in-
tend  "to  preclude  the  states  from  imposing  additional  label-
ing requirements."  Ibid.10 

In  keeping  with  Congress'  decisi on  not  to  pre-empt 
common-law tort suits, it appears that the FDA traditionally 
regarded state law as a complementary form of drug regula-
tion.  The FDA  has  limited resources  to monitor  the  11,000 
drugs on the  market,11  and  manufacturers  have  superior ac-

of consumer protection). 

11 In 1955, the same year that the agency approved Wyeth's Phenergan 

application,  an  FDA  advisory  committee  issued  a  report  finding  "conclu-
sively" that "the budget and staff of the [FDA] are  inadequate to  permit 
the discharge of its existing responsibilities for the protection of the Amer-
ican  public."  Citizens  Advisory  Committee  on  the  FDA,  Report  to  the

Opinion of the Court 
cess to information about their drugs, especially in the post-marketing  phase  as  new  risks  emerge.  State  tort  suits  un-

cover unknown drug hazards and provide incentives for drug manufacturers  to  disclose safety  risks promptly.  They 
also  serve  a  distinct  compensatory  function  that  may  mo-tivate  injured  persons  to  come  forward  with  information. 
Failure-to-warn  actions,  in  particular,  lend  force  to  the 
FDCA's premise that manufacturers, not the FDA, bear pri-mary  responsibility  for  their  drug  labeling  at  all  times. 

Thus, the FDA long maintained that state law offers an addi-tional, and important, layer of consumer protection that com-
plements  FDA  regulation.12  The  agency's  2006  preamble represents a dramatic change in position. 

Largely  based  on  the  FDA's  new  position,  Wyeth  argues that  this  case  presents  a  conflict  between  state  and  federal 
law  analogous  to  the  one  at  issue  in  Geier.  There,  we  held that  state  tort  claims  premised  on  Honda's  failure  to  install 
airbags  conflicted  with  a  federal  regulation  that  did  not  re-
quire  airbags  for  all  cars.  The  Department  of  Transporta-

tations  have  hobbled  the  agency's  ability  to  improve  and  expand  this  es-

580  WYETH  v.  LEVINE 

Opinion of the Court 
tion (DOT) had promulgated  a rule that  provided car  manu-facturers  with  a  range  of  choices  among  passive  restraint 

devices.  Geier,  529  U. S.,  at  875.  Rejecting  an  " `all  air-bag' " standard, the agency had called for a gradual phase-in 
of  a  mix  of  passive  restraints  in  order  to  spur  technological development  and  win  consumer  acceptance. 

Id.,  at  879. Because the plaintiff 's claim was that car manufacturers had 

a duty to install airbags, it presented an obstacle to achieving "the  variety  and  mix  of  devices  that  the  federal  regulation 
sought."  Id., at 881. Wyeth and the dissent contend that the regulatory scheme 
in  this  case  is  nearly  identical, but,  as  we  have  described,  it is  quite  different.  In 

Geier,  the  DOT  conducted  a  formal 
rulemaking  and  then  adopted  a  plan  to  phase  in  a  mix  of passive restraint devices.  Examining the rule itself and the 

DOT's  contemporaneous  record,  which  revealed  the  factors the  agency  had  weighed  and  the  balance  it  had  struck,  we 
determined that state tort suits presented an obstacle to the 
federal  scheme.  After  conducting  our  own  pre-emption analysis, we considered the agency's explanation of how state 

law  interfered  with  its  regulation,  regarding  it  as  further support  for  our  independent  conclusion  that  the  plaintiff 's 
tort claim obstructed the federal regime. By  contrast,  we  have  no  occasion  in  this  case  to  consider 
the pre-emptive effect of a specific agency regulation bearing the  force  of  law.  And  the  FDA's  newfound  opinion,  ex-
pressed in its 2006 preamble, that state law "frustrate[s] the agency's  implementation  of  its  statutory  mandate,"  71  Fed. 
Reg. 3934, does not merit deference for the reasons we have explained.

13  Indeed,  the  "complex  and  extensive"  regula-

13 The United States' amicus brief is similarly undeserving of deference. 
Unlike  the  Government's  brief  in  Geier  v.  American  Honda  Motor  Co., 
529 U. S. 861 (2000), which explained the effects of state law on the DOT's 
regulation  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  agency's  prior  accounts,  see 
ibid.,  the  Government's  explanation  of  federal  drug  regulation  departs 
markedly from the FDA's understanding at all times relevant to this case.
