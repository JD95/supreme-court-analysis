subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  a  $ 4  petition:  Should  a  dis-trict  court,  if  asked  to  compel  arbitration  pursuant  to  $ 4, 

"look  through" the petition and grant the  requested relief if the  court  would  have  federal-question  jurisdiction  over  the 
underlying controversy?  And if the answer to that question is  yes,  may  a  district  court  exercise  jurisdiction  over  a  $ 4 
petition  when  the  petitioner's  complaint  rests  on  state  law 
but an actual or potential counterclaim rests on federal law? The  litigation  giving  rise  to  these  questions  began  when 

Discover Bank's servicing affiliate filed a complaint in Mary-land  state  court.  Presenting  a  claim  arising  solely  under 
state law, Discover sought to recover past-due charges from 
one of its credit cardholders, Betty Vaden.  Vaden answered 
and counterclaimed, alleging that Discover's finance charges, 
interest, and late fees violated state law.  Invoking an arbi-
tration  clause  in  its  cardholder  agreement  with  Vaden,  Dis-
cover  then  filed  a  $ 4  petition  in  the  United  States  District 
Court  for  the  District  of  Maryland  to  compel  arbitration  of 
Vaden's  counterclaims.  The  District  Court  had  subject-
matter  jurisdiction  over  its  petition,  Discover  maintained, 
because  Vaden's  state-law  counterclaims  were  completely 
preempted  by  federal  banking  law.  The  District  Court 
agreed  and  ordered  arbitration.  Reasoning  that  a  federal 
court has jurisdiction over a $ 4 petition if the parties' under-
lying dispute presents a federal question, the Fourth Circuit 
eventually affirmed. 

We agree with the Fourth Circuit in part.  A federal court 
may  "look  through"  a  $ 4  petition  and  order  arbitration  if, 
"save for [the arbitration] agreement," the court would have 
jurisdiction over "the [substantive] controversy between the 
parties."  We hold, however, that the Court of Appeals mis-
identified  the  dimensions  of  "the  controversy  between  the 
parties."  Focusing on only a slice of the parties' entire con-
troversy,  the  court  seized  on  Vaden's  counterclaims,  held 
them  completely  preempted,  and  on  that  basis  affirmed  the 
District  Court's  order  compelling  arbitration.  Lost  from

In  addition  to  its  textual  implausibility,  the  approach Vaden  advocates  has  curious  practical  consequences.  It 

would permit  a  federal court to entertain  a  $ 4 petition  only when  a  federal-question  suit  is  already  before  the  court, 
when  the  parties  satisfy  the  requirements  for  diversity-of-citizenship  jurisdiction,  or  when  the  dispute  over  arbitrabil-

Opinion of the Court 
As  the  dissent  would  have  it,  parties  could  commandeer 
a  federal  court  to  slice  off  responsive  pleadings  for  arbi-
tration  while  leaving  the  remainder  of  the  parties'  contro-
versy  pending  in  state  court.  That  seems  a  bizarre  way  to 
proceed.  In  this  case,  Vaden's  counterclaims would  be  sent 
to  arbitration  while  the  complaint  to  which  they  are  ad-
dressed--Discover's  state-law-grounded  debt-collection  ac-
tion--would remain pending in a Maryland court.  When the 
controversy between the parties is not one over which a fed-
eral  court  would  have  jurisdiction,  it  makes  scant  sense  to 
allow  one  of  the  parties  to  enlist  a  federal  court  to  disturb 
the  state-court  proceedings  by  carving  out  issues  for  sepa-
rate resolution.18 

Furthermore,  the  presence  of  a  threshold  question 
whether  a  counterclaim  alleged  to  be  based  on  state  law  is 
totally  preempted  by  federal  law  may  complicate  the  dis-
sent's $ 4 inquiry.  This case is illustrative.  The dissent re-
lates that  Vaden eventually  conceded that  FDIA $ 27(a), not 

nent  parries  with  a  federal  counterclaim,  the  action  is  not  removable  to 
federal court, even though it would have been removable had the order of 
filings been reversed.  See Holmes

(2)  The Vermont Supreme Court further erred by treating the pe-
riod of each counsel's representation discretely.  The court failed appro-
priately to take into account Brillon's role during the first year of delay. 
Brillon  sought  to  dismiss  his  first  attorney  on  the  eve  of  trial.  His 
strident, aggressive behavior with regard  to his third attorney further 
impeded prompt trial and likely made it more difficult for the Defender 
General's office to find replacement counsel.  Absent Brillon's efforts to 
force  the  withdrawal  of  his  first  and  third  attorneys,  no  speedy-trial 
issue would have arisen.  Pp. 93-94. 

(c)  The general rule attributing to the defendant delay caused by as-
signed counsel is not absolute.  Delay resulting from a systemic break-
down  in  the  public  defender  system  could  be  charged  to  the  State.

Opinion of the Court 
Supreme Court charged against Brillon the delays associated with those periods, but charged against the State periods in 

which  assigned  counsel  failed  "to  move  his  case  forward." 183 Vt. 475, 494-495, 955 A. 2d 1108, 1121, 1122 (2008). 

We hold that the Vermont Supreme Court erred in ranking assigned  counsel  essentially  as  state  actors  in  the  criminal 
justice  system.  Assigned  counsel,  just  as  retained  counsel, 
act  on  behalf  of  their  clients,  and  delays  sought  by  counsel are ordinarily attributable to the defendants they represent. 

For  a  total  of  some  six  months  of  the  time  that  elapsed  be-tween  Brillon's  arrest  and  his  trial,  Brillon  lacked  an  attor-
ney.  The  State  may  be  charged  with  those  months  if  the 
gaps resulted from the trial court's failure to appoint replace-
ment  counsel  with  dispatch.  Similarly,  the  State  may  bear 
responsibility if there is "a breakdown in the public defender 
system."  Id.,

hearing, however,  Altieri moved to  withdraw  on  the ground that  Brillon  had  threatened  his  life  during  a  break  in  the 
proceedings.  The trial court granted Brillon's motion to dis-miss Altieri,  but warned Brillon  that "this  is  somewhat  of a 
dubious  victory  in  your  case  because  it  simply  prolongs  the time that you will remain in jail until we can bring this mat-
ter to trial."  Id.,

Vt.,  at  494,  955  A.  2d,  at  1121,  may  not  be  attributed  to  the State simply because they are assigned counsel. 

A  contrary  conclusion  could  encourage  appointed  counsel to  delay  proceedings  by  seeking  unreasonable  continuances, 
hoping  thereby  to  obtain  a  dismissal  of  the  indictment  on speedy-trial  grounds.  Trial  courts  might  well  respond  by 
viewing  continuance  requests  made  by  appointed  counsel with skepticism,  concerned that even  an apparently  genuine 
need for more time is in reality a delay tactic.  Yet the same considerations  would  not  attend  a  privately  retained  coun-
sel's  requests  for  time  extensions.  We  see  no  justification for treating defendants' speedy-trial claims differently based 
on  whether  their  counsel  is  privately  retained  or  publicly assigned.

assumption  that  these  fees  were  not  limited  by  the  $40  per day  attendance  fee  set  out  in  $ 1821(b)  and  called  for  an 

award  of  $9,214,727.81  in  expert  witness  fees.  The  other calculation, which was based on the assumption that $ 1821(b) 
did apply, calculated the amount that Kansas was entitled to recover for expert witness fees at $162,927.94. 

After  hearing  argument,  the  Special  Master  held  that $ 1821  applies  in  cases  within  our  original  jurisdiction. 
Based  on  this  holding,  the  two  States  entered  into  a  cost settlement  agreement  that  provided  for  total  witness  costs 
of  $199,577.19  but  preserved  the  right  of  the  States  to  file exceptions to the Special Master's rulings on legal issues re-
garding costs.  II 

Kansas  argues  that  the  Special  Master  erred  in  holding that  $ 1821(b)  applies  to  cases  within  our  original  jurisdic-
tion.  Kansas  contends  that  early  statutes  governing  the award  of  costs  in  cases  in  the  lower  courts  did  not  apply  to 
this  Court's  original  cases  and  that  this  scheme  has  been carried  forward  to  the  present  day.  Kansas  notes  that  the 
statutory  provision  authorizing  the  taxation  of  costs,  28 U. S. C.  $ 1920,  authorizes  "[a]  judge  or  clerk  of  any  court  of 
the  United  States"  to  tax  as  costs  "[f]ees . . . for  . . . wit-nesses" and that the definition of the term "judge . . . of the  
United States," as used in Title 28, does not include a Justice of  this  Court.  In  Kansas'  view,  $ 1911, which  provides  that 
"[t]he  Supreme  Court  may  fix  the  fees  to  be  charged  by  its clerk,"  manifests  Congress'  understanding  that  we  should 
have the authority to determine the fees that may be recov-ered by a prevailing party in a case brought under our origi-
nal  jurisdiction.  Kansas  further  maintains  that  "[e]ven  if Congress  had  intended  to  regulate  taxation  of  costs  in  the 
original jurisdiction of this Court, such an act would be sub-ject  to  the  Court's  ultimate  authority  to  regulate  procedure 
within  its  constitutionally  created  original  jurisdiction." Kansas' Exception and Brief 10.  Kansas therefore contends

litigation,  including  expert  witness  fees  and  miscellaneous costs such as transcripts and duplication).  While this policy 

choice  is  debatable,  we  see  no  good  reason  why  the  rule  re-garding  the  recovery  of  expert  witness  fees  should  differ 
markedly depending on whether a case is originally brought in  a  district  court  or  in  this  Court.  Many  cases  brought  in 
the  district  courts  are  no  less  complex  than  those  brought originally in this Court.  And while the parties in our origi-
nal  cases  sometimes  are  required  to  incur  very  substantial expert  costs,  as  happened  in  the  present  case,  the  same  is 
frequently  true  in  lower  court  litigation.  Thus,  assuming for  the  sake  of  argument  that  the  matter  is  left  entirely  to 
our discretion, we conclude that the best approach is to have a uniform rule that applies in all federal cases. 

We therefore hold that the expert witness attendance fees that  are  available  in  cases  brought  under  our  original  juris-
diction  shall  be  the  same  as  the  expert  witness  attendance fees  that  would  be  available  in  a  district  court  under 

$ 1821(b).  We  thus  overrule  Kansas'  exception  to  the  Re-port of the Special Master.

that end, he presented medical testimony that he was insane at the time of the crime and was, therefore, incapable of the 

premeditation  or  deliberation  necessary  for  a  first-degree murder  conviction.  The  jury  nevertheless  convicted  Mir-
zayance of first-degree murder. The  trial  judge  set  the  NGI  phase  to  begin  the  day  after 
the conviction was entered but, on the advice of counsel, Mir-
zayance  abandoned  his  NGI  plea  before  it  commenced.  He would have borne  the burden of proving  his insanity during 

the NGI phase to the same jury that had just convicted him of  first-degree  murder.  Counsel  had  planned  to  meet  that 
burden by presenting medical testimony similar to that pre-
sented in the guilt phase, including evidence that Mirzayance 
was  insane  and  incapable  of  premeditating  or  deliberating. 
Because the jury rejected similar evidence at the guilt phase 
(where the State bore the burden of proof), counsel believed 
a  defense  verdict  at  the  NGI  phase  (where  the  burden  was 
on the defendant) was unlikely.  He planned, though, to have 
Mirzayance's  parents  testify  and  thus  provide  an  emotional 
account of Mirzayance's struggles with mental illness to sup-
plement the medical evidence of insanity.  But on the morn-
ing  that  the  NGI  phase  was  set  to  begin,  Mirzayance's  par-
ents  refused  to  testify.  After  consulting  with  co-counsel, 
counsel  advised  Mirzayance  that  he  should  withdraw  the 
NGI plea.  Mirzayance accepted the advice. 

After he was sentenced, Mirzayance challenged his convic-
tion in state postconviction proceedings.  Among other alle-
gations,  he  claimed  that  counsel's  recommendation  to  with-
draw  the  NGI  plea  constituted  ineffective  assistance  of 
counsel under Strickland.

Opinion of the Court 

II 
Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act 
of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d)(1), a federal court may 
not grant a state prisoner's habeas application unless the rel-
evant  state-court  decision  "was  contrary  to,  or  involved  an 
unreasonable  application  of,  clearly  established  Federal  law, 
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States." 2 
Here,  the  relevant  state-court  decision  is  the  California 
Court of Appeal's decision denying state habeas relief. 

We conclude that the state court's decision to deny Mirzay-
ance's  ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  claim  did  not  vio-
late  clearly  established  federal  law.  The  Court  of  Appeals 
reached a contrary result based, in large measure, on its ap-
plication of an improper standard of review--it blamed coun-
sel for abandoning the NGI claim because there was nothing 

2 Before the Court of Appeals, Mirzayance contended that the standard 
of review set forth in $ 2254(d)(1) should not apply to his case.  See Brief 
for  Appellee  in  No.  04-57102  (CA9),  pp.  28-29,  33.  Before  this  Court, 
however, Mirzayance contends that the Court of Appeals correctly applied 

$ 2254(d) to his claim.  See Brief for Respondent 27, 32.  Mirzayance did 
question  whether  the  California  Court  of  Appeal's  denial  of  his  claim 
should receive as much deference as the "prototypical" state-court adjudi-
cation "involv[ing] both a reasoned, written opinion and an adequate devel-
opment of the  factual  record in  support of  the claims."  Id.,

Opinion of the Court 
In the NGI phase, the burden would have switched to Mir-
zayance  to  prove  insanity  by  a  preponderance  of  the  evi-
dence.  Mirzayance's  counsel reasonably believed that  there 
was almost no chance that the same jury would have reached 
a  different  result  when  considering  similar  evidence,  espe-
cially  with  Mirzayance  bearing  the  burden  of  proof.  Fur-
thermore,  counsel  knew  he  would  have  had  to  present  this 
defense without  the benefit of the  parents' testimony, which 
he believed to be his strongest evidence.  See ibid.

of  appeals  has  the  discretion  to  remedy  the  error  if  it  " `seriously  af-
fect[s]  the  fairness,  integrity  or  public  reputation  of  judicial  proceed-
ings,' " id., at 736.  The question here is not whether plain-error review 
applies when a defendant fails to preserve a claim that the Government 
defaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but what conceivable reason 
exists for disregarding its evident application.  The breach undoubtedly 
violates  the  defendant's  rights,  but  the  defendant  has  the  opportunity 
to  seek  vindication of  those  rights  in  district  court; if  he  fails  to  do so, 
Rule  52(b)  as  clearly  sets  forth  the  consequences  for  that  forfeiture  as 
it does for all others.  Pp. 134-136. 

(b)  Neither Puckett's doctrinal arguments nor the practical considera-
tions  that  he  raises  counsel  against  applying  plain-error  review  in  the 
present context.  The Government's breach of the plea agreement does 
not retroactively cause the defendant's guilty plea to have been unknow-
ing  or  involuntary.  This  Court's  decision  in  Santobello  v.  New  York, 
404 U. S. 257, does not govern, since the question whether an error can 
be found harmless is different from the question whether it can be sub-
jected  to  plain-error  review.  Puckett  is  wrong  in  contending  that  no 
purpose  is  served  by  applying  plain-error  review:  There  is  much  to  be 
gained  by  inducing  the  objection  to  be  made  at  the  trial  court  level, 
where (among other things) the error can often be remedied.  And not 
all  plea  breaches  will  satisfy  the  doctrine's  four  prongs.  Pp.  136-143.

132  PUCKETT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
District Court held a plea colloquy, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b), and accepted Puckett's plea. 

Because  of  delays  due  to  health  problems  experienced  by Puckett, sentencing did not take place for almost three years. 
In  the  interim,  Puckett  assisted  another  man  in  a  scheme to  defraud  the  Postal  Service,  and  confessed  that  assistance 
(under  questioning)  to  a  probation  officer.  The  officer  pre-
pared  an  addendum  to  Puckett's  presentence  report  recom-mending that he receive 

no $ 3E1.1 reduction for acceptance 
of  responsibility,  on  the  theory  that  true  acceptance  of  re-sponsibility  requires  termination  of  criminal  conduct.  See 

USSG $ 3E1.1, comment., n. 1(b). 

When  sentencing  finally  did  take  place  on  May  4,  2006, 
Puckett's  counsel  objected  to  the  addendum,  pointing  out 
that  the  Government  had  filed  a  motion  requesting  that  the 
full  three-level  reduction  in  offense  level  be  granted.  The 
District Judge turned to the prosecutor, who responded that 
the  motion  was  filed  "a  long  time  ago,"  App.  79a,  before 
Puckett  had  engaged  in  the  additional  criminal  behavior. 
She made clear that the Government opposed any reduction 
in  Puckett's  offense  level  for  acceptance  of  responsibility. 
The  probation  officer  then  added  his  view  that  under  the 
Guidelines, a reduction would be improper. 

After  hearing  these  submissions,  the  District  Judge  con-
cluded  that  even  assuming  he  had  the  discretion  to  grant 
the  reduction,  he  would  not  do  so.  "[I]t's  so  rare  [as]  to  be 
unknown around here where one has committed a crime sub-
sequent to the crime for which they appear before the court 
and  for  them  even  then  to  get  the  three  points."  Id.,  at 
80a-81a.  He  agreed,  however,  to  follow  the  recommenda-
tion that the Government made, pursuant to its commitment 
in the plea agreement, that Puckett be  sentenced at the low 
end  of  the  applicable  Guidelines  range,  which  turned  out  to 
be  262  months  in  prison  for  the  armed  bank  robbery  and  a 
mandatory  minimum  consecutive  term  of  84  months  for  the 
firearm  crime.  Had  the  District  Court  granted  the  three-

Opinion of the Court 
level  reduction  for  acceptance  of  responsibility,  the  bottom of the Guidelines range would have been 188 months for the 

robbery; the firearm sentence would not have been affected. Importantly, at no time during the exchange did Puckett's 
counsel object that the Government was violating its obliga-tions  under  the  plea  agreement  by  backing  away  from  its 
request for the reduction.  He never cited the relevant pro-
vision of the plea agreement.  And he did not move to with-draw  Puckett's  plea  on  grounds  that  the  Government  had 

broken its sentencing promises. On  appeal  to  the  United  States  Court  of  Appeals  for  the 
Fifth Circuit, Puckett did argue, inter alia, that the Govern-
ment  violated  the  plea  agreement  at  sentencing.  The  Gov-
ernment  conceded that  by objecting  to the  reduction  for  ac-
ceptance  of  responsibility,  it  had  violated  the  obligation  set 
forth  in  paragraph  8  of  the  agreement,  but  maintained  that 
Puckett  had  forfeited  this  claim  by  failing  to  raise  it  in  the 
District  Court.  The  Court  of  Appeals  agreed,  and  applied 
the plain-error standard that Rule 52(b) makes applicable to 
unpreserved  claims  of  error.  505  F.  3d  377,  384  (2007).  It 
held  that  although  error  had  occurred  and  was  obvious, 
Puckett  had  not  satisfied  the  third  prong  of  the  plain-error 
analysis  by  demonstrating  that  the  error  affected  his  sub-
stantial rights, i. e., caused him prejudice.  Id., at 386.  Es-
pecially in light of the District Judge's statement that grant-
ing a reduction when the defendant had continued to engage 
in  criminal  conduct was "so  rare [as] to be  unknown," Puck-
ett  could  not  show  that  the  Government's  breach  had 
affected  his  ultimate  sentence.  The  Court  of  Appeals  ac-
cordingly  affirmed the  conviction  and  sentence.  Id.,  at  388. 

We  granted  certiorari,  554  U. S.  945  (2008),  to  consider  a 
question  that  has  divided  the  Federal  Courts  of  Appeals: 
whether  Rule  52(b)'s  plain-error  test  applies  to  a  forfeited 
claim, like  Puckett's,  that the  Government  failed  to meet its 
obligations under a plea agreement.  See In re Sealed Case, 
356  F.  3d  313,  315-318  (CADC  2004)  (discussing  conflict

134  PUCKETT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
among the Circuits).  Concluding that Rule 52(b) does apply and in the usual fashion, we now affirm. 

II 
If a litigant believes that an error has occurred (to his det-riment)  during  a  federal  judicial  proceeding,  he  must  object 

in order to preserve the issue.  If he fails to do so in a timely manner, his claim for relief from the error is forfeited.  "No 
procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a . . . right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases 
by  the  failure  to  make  timely  assertion  of  the  right  before a  tribunal  having  jurisdiction  to  determine  it." 

Yakus  v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944). 

If  an  error  is  not  properly  preserved,  appellate-court  au-thority to remedy the error (by reversing the judgment, for 
example,  or  ordering  a  new  trial)  is  strictly  circumscribed. There is good reason for this; "anyone familiar with the work 
of  courts  understands  that  errors  are  a  constant  in  the  trial process,  that  most  do  not  much  matter,  and  that  a  reflexive 
inclination  by  appellate  courts  to  reverse  because  of  unpre-served error would be fatal." 

United States v.  Padilla, 415 F. 3d 211, 224 (CA1 2005) (Boudin, C. J., concurring). 

This  limitation  on  appellate-court  authority  serves  to  in-duce the timely raising of claims and objections, which gives 
the  district  court  the  opportunity  to  consider  and  resolve them.  That court is ordinarily in the best position to deter-
mine  the  relevant  facts  and  adjudicate  the  dispute.  In  the case  of  an  actual  or  invited  procedural  error,  the  district 
court can often correct or avoid the mistake so that it cannot possibly  affect  the  ultimate  outcome.  And  of  course  the 
contemporaneous-objection  rule  prevents  a  litigant  from " `sandbagging' "  the  court--remaining  silent  about  his  ob-
jection  and  belatedly  raising  the  error  only  if  the  case  does not conclude in his favor.  Cf. 

Wainwright v.  Sykes, 433 U. S. 72,  89  (1977);  see  also  United  States  v.  Vonn,  535  U. S.  55, 

72 (2002).

Opinion of the Court 
In  federal  criminal  cases,  Rule  51(b)  tells  parties  how  to preserve claims of error: "by informing the court--when the 

court  ruling  or  order  is  made  or  sought--of  the  action  the party  wishes  the  court  to  take,  or  the  party's  objection  to 
the court's action and the grounds for that objection."  Fail-ure  to  abide  by  this  contemporaneous-objection  rule  ordi-
narily  precludes  the  raising  on  appeal  of  the  unpreserved 
claim  of  trial  error.  See  United  States  v.  Young,  470  U. S. 1,  15,  and  n.  12  (1985).  Rule  52(b),  however,  recognizes  a 

limited  exception  to that  preclusion.  The Rule  provides, in full:  "A  plain  error  that  affects  substantial  rights  may  be 
considered  even  though  it  was  not  brought  to  the  court's 
attention." 

We  explained  in  United  States  v.  Olano,  507  U. S.  725 
(1993),  that  Rule  52(b)  review--so-called  "plain-error  re-
view"--involves four steps, or prongs.  First, there must be 
an  error  or  defect--some  sort  of  "[d]eviation  from  a  legal 
rule"--that  has  not  been  intentionally  relinquished  or  aban-
doned,  i. e.,  affirmatively  waived,  by  the  appellant.  Id.,  at 
732-733.  Second,  the  legal  error  must  be  clear  or  obvious, 
rather  than  subject  to  reasonable  dispute.  See  id.,  at  734. 
Third,  the  error  must  have  affected the  appellant's  substan-
tial  rights,  which  in  the  ordinary  case  means  he  must  dem-
onstrate  that  it  "affected  the  outcome  of  the  district  court 
proceedings."  Ibid.  Fourth  and  finally,  if  the  above  three 
prongs  are  satisfied,  the  court  of  appeals  has  the  discretion 
to remedy the error--discretion which ought to be exercised 
only  if  the  error  " `seriously  affect[s]  the  fairness,  integrity 
or  public  reputation  of  judicial  proceedings.' "  Id.,  at  736 
(quoting United States v.  Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157, 160 (1936)). 
Meeting all four prongs is difficult, "as it should be."  United 
States v.  Dominguez Benitez, 542 U. S. 74, 83, n. 9 (2004). 

We have repeatedly cautioned that "[a]ny unwarranted ex-
tension"  of  the  authority  granted  by  Rule  52(b)  would  dis-
turb the careful balance it strikes between judicial efficiency 
and the redress of injustice, see Young, supra, at 15; and that

Opinion of the Court 
the creation of an unjustified exception to the Rule would be 
"[e]ven less appropriate," Johnson v.  United States, 520 U. S. 
461, 466 (1997).  The real question in this case is not whether 
plain-error review applies when a defendant fails to preserve 
a claim that the Government defaulted on its plea-agreement 
obligations,  but  rather  what  conceivable  reason  exists  for 
disregarding its evident application.  Such a  breach is 
undoubtedly  a  violation  of  the  defendant's  rights,  see 
Santobello  v.  New  York,  404  U. S.  257,  262  (1971),  but  the 
defendant  has  the  opportunity  to  seek  vindication  of  those 
rights  in  district  court;  if  he  fails  to  do  so,  Rule  52(b)  as 
clearly  sets  forth  the  consequences  for  that  forfeiture  as  it 
does for all others.

Puckett  puts  forward  several  possible  reasons  why  plain-
error  review  should  not  apply  in  the  present  context.  We 
understand  him  to  be  making  effectively  four  distinct  argu-
ments:  two  doctrinal,  two  practical.  We  consider  each  set 
in turn. 

A 

Puckett's  primary  precedent-based  argument  proceeds  as 
follows:  When  the  Government  breaks  a  promise  that  was 
made  to  a  defendant  in  the  course  of  securing  a  guilty  plea, 
the  knowing  and  voluntary  character  of  that  plea  retroac-
tively  vanishes,  because  (as  it  turns  out)  the  defendant  was 
not aware of its true consequences.  Since guilty pleas must 
be  knowing  and  voluntary  to  be  valid,  McCarthy  v.  United 
States, 394 U. S. 459, 466  (1969), the  guilty plea  is thus  void, 
along with the defendant's corresponding waiver of his right 
to  trial.  And  because,  under  this  Court's  precedents,  a 
waiver  of  the  right  to  trial  must  be  made  by  the  defendant 
personally, see Taylor  v.  Illinois, 484 U. S. 400, 417-418, and 
n.  24  (1988),  no  action  by  counsel  alone  could  resurrect  the 
voided waiver.  Therefore, Puckett concludes, counsel's fail-
ure  timely  to  object  to  a  Government  breach  can  have  no

Opinion of the Court 
effect  on the  analysis, and  the  court  of appeals  must always 
correct the error. 

This  elaborate  analysis  suffers  from  at  least  two  defects. 
First,  there  is  nothing  to  support  the  proposition  that  the 
Government's  breach  of  a  plea  agreement  retroactively 
causes  the  defendant's  agreement  to  have  been  unknowing 
or involuntary.  Any more than there is anything to support 
the  proposition  that  a  mere  breach  of contract  retroactively 
causes  the  other  party's  promise  to  have  been  coerced  or 
induced  by  fraud.  Although  the  analogy  may  not  hold  in 
all  respects,  plea  bargains  are  essentially  contracts.  See 
Mabry v.  Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 508 (1984).  When the con-
sideration  for  a  contract  fails--that  is,  when  one  of  the  ex-
changed promises is not kept--we do not say that the volun-
tary  bilateral  consent  to  the  contract  never  existed,  so  that 
it is automatically and utterly void; we say that the contract 
was  broken.  See  23  R.  Lord,  Williston  on  Contracts  $ 63.1 
(4th ed. 2002) (hereinafter Williston).  The party injured by 
the  breach will  generally be entitled  to some remedy, which 
might  include  the  right  to  rescind  the  contract  entirely,  see 
26 id., $ 68.1 (4th ed. 2003); but that is not the same thing as 
saying the contract was never validly concluded. 

So too  here.  When a  defendant agrees  to a  plea  bargain, 
the Government takes on certain obligations.  If those obli-
gations are not met, the defendant is entitled to seek a rem-
edy,  which  might  in  some  cases  be  rescission  of  the  agree-
ment,  allowing  him  to  take  back  the  consideration  he  has 
furnished,  i. e.,  to  withdraw  his  plea.  But  rescission  is  not 
the only possible remedy; in Santobello we allowed for a re-
sentencing  at  which  the  Government  would  fully  comply 
with  the  agreement--in  effect,  specific  performance  of  the 
contract.  404 U. S., at 263.  In any case, it  is entirely clear 
that  a  breach  does  not  cause  the  guilty  plea,  when  entered, 
to  have  been  unknowing  or  involuntary.  It  is  precisely  be-
cause the plea was knowing and voluntary (and hence valid)

Opinion of the Court 
that  the  Government  is  obligated  to  uphold  its  side  of  the 
bargain.1 

Moreover,  and  perhaps  more  fundamentally,  Puckett's  ar-
gument confuses the concepts of waiver and forfeiture.  No-
body  contends  that  Puckett's  counsel  has  waived--that  is, 
intentionally relinquished or abandoned, Olano, 507 U. S., at 
733--Puckett's  right  to  seek  relief  from  the  Government's 
breach.  (If he had, there would be no error at all and plain-
error  analysis  would  add  nothing.)  The  objection  is  rather 
that Puckett forfeited the claim of error through his counsel's 
failure  to  raise  the  argument  in  the  District  Court.  This 
Court's  precedents  requiring  that  certain  waivers  be  per-
sonal,  knowing,  and  voluntary  are  thus  simply  irrelevant. 
Those  holdings  determine  whether  error  occurred,  but  say 
nothing about the proper standard of review when the claim 
of  error  is  not  preserved.  The  question  presented  by  this 
case assumes error; only the standard of review is in dispute. 

Puckett's  second  doctrinal  attack  rests  on  our  decision  in 
Santobello.  In  that  case,  the  State  had  promised  in  a  plea 

1 Puckett points out that in Brady v.  United States, 397 U. S. 742 (1970), 
we quoted approvingly the Fifth Circuit's statement that guilty pleas must 
stand unless induced by "misrepresentation (including unfulfilled or unful-
fillable promises)," id., at 755 (quoting Shelton v.  United States, 246 F. 2d 
571,  572,  n.  2  (CA5  1957)  (en  banc);  internal  quotation  marks  omitted). 
But  it  is  hornbook  law  that  misrepresentation  requires  an  intent  at  the 
time of contracting not to perform.  26 Williston $ 69.11.  It is more dif-
ficult to explain the other precedent relied upon by Puckett--our sugges-
tion in Mabry v.  Johnson, 467 U. S. 504, 509 (1984), that "when the prose-
cution  breaches  its  promise  with  respect  to  an  executed  plea  agreement, 
the  defendant  pleads  guilty  on  a  false  premise,  and  hence  his  conviction 
cannot  stand."  That  statement,  like  the  one  in  Brady,  was  dictum.  Its 
conclusion that the conviction cannot stand is only sometimes true (if that 
is  the  remedy  the  court  prescribes  for  the  breach).  And  even  when  the 
conviction  is  overturned,  the  reason  is  not  that  the  guilty  plea  was  un-
knowing  or  involuntary.  We  disavow  any  aspect  of  the  Mabry  dictum 
that contradicts our holding today.

deal  that it  would make  no sentencing  recommendation,  but the  prosecutor  (apparently  unaware  of  that  commitment) 

asked  the  state  trial  court  to  impose  the  maximum  penalty of  one  year.  Defense  counsel  immediately  objected.  404 
U. S.,  at  259.  The  trial  judge  proceeded  anyway  to  impose the 1-year sentence, reassuring Santobello that the prosecu-
tor's  recommendation  did  not  affect  his  decision.  Id.,  at 259-260.  This  Court  vacated  the  conviction  and  remanded 
the case because "the interests of justice" would thus be best served. 

Id., at 262. Puckett  maintains  that  if  the  "interests  of  justice"  re-

quired a remand in Santobello even though the breach there was  likely  harmless,  those  same  interests  call  for  a  remand 
whenever the Government reneges on a plea bargain, forfeit-ure  or  not.  We  do  not  agree.  Whether  an  error  can  be 
found  harmless  is  simply  a  different  question  from  whether it can be subjected to plain-error review. 

Santobello (given that  the  error  in  that  case  was  preserved)  necessarily  ad-

dressed only the former.  B 

Doctrine and precedent  aside, Puckett  argues  that practi-cal  considerations  counsel  against  subjecting  plea-breach 
claims to the rule of plain-error review.  Specifically, he con-tends that no purpose would be served by applying the rule; 
and  that  plea  breaches  will  always  satisfy  its  four  prongs, making  its  application  superfluous.  Accepting,  arguendo 
(and  dubitante),  that  policy  concerns  can  ever  authorize  a departure  from  the  Federal  Rules,  both  arguments  are 
wrong. Puckett suggests that once the prosecution has broken its 
agreement, e. g., by requesting a higher sentence than agreed upon,  it  is  too  late  to  "unring"  the  bell  even  if  an  objection 
is  made:  The  district  judge  has  already  heard  the  request, and under 

Santobello it does not matter if he was influenced 
by it.  So why demand the futile objection?

140  PUCKETT  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
For  one  thing,  requiring  the  objection  means  the  defend-ant  cannot  "game"  the  system,  "wait[ing]  to  see  if  the  sen-

tence  later  str[ikes]  him  as satisfactory,"  Vonn,  535  U. S.,  at 73,  and  then  seeking  a  second  bite  at  the  apple  by  raising 
the claim.  For another, the breach itself will not always be conceded.

2  In  such  a  case,  the  district  court  if  apprised  of 

the  claim  will  be  in  a  position  to  adjudicate  the  matter  in the  first  instance,  creating  a  factual  record  and  facilitating 

appellate  review.  Thirdly,  some  breaches  may  be  curable upon  timely  objection--for  example,  where  the  prosecution 
simply forgot its commitment and is willing to adhere to the 
agreement.  And finally, if the breach is established but can-not be cured, the district court can grant an immediate rem-

edy  (e. g.,  withdrawal  of  the  plea  or  resentencing  before  a different  judge)  and  thus  avoid  the  delay  and  expense  of  a 
full appeal. Puckett  also  contends  that  plain-error  review  "does  no 
substantive work" in the context of the Government's breach 
of  a  plea  agreement.  Brief  for  Petitioner  22.  He  claims that the third prong, the prejudice prong, has no application, 

since plea-breach claims fall within "a special category of for-feited errors  that  can  be corrected  regardless  of their  effect 
on the outcome."  Olano, 507 U. S., at 735. This  Court  has  several  times  declined  to  resolve  whether 
"structural" errors--those that affect "the framework within which the trial proceeds," 

Arizona v.  Fulminante, 499 U. S. 
279, 310  (1991)--automatically satisfy the  third  prong  of the plain-error  test. 

Olano,  supra,  at  735;  Johnson,  520  U. S., 
at  469;  United  States  v.  Cotton,  535  U. S.  625,  632  (2002). 
Once  again  we  need  not  answer  that  question,  because 

2 Indeed,  in  this  case  the  Government  might  well  have  argued  that  it 
was  excused  from  its  obligation  to  assert  "demonstrated  acceptance  of 
responsibility"  because  Puckett's  ongoing  criminal  conduct  hindered  per-
formance.  See  13  Williston  $ 39.3  (4th  ed.  2000).  That  argument  might 
have convinced us had it been pressed, but the Government conceded the 
breach, and we analyze the case as it comes to us.

breach  of  a  plea  deal  is  not  a  "structural"  error  as  we  have used  that  term.  We  have  never  described  it  as  such,  see 

Johnson,  supra,  at  468-469,  and  it  shares  no  common  fea-tures  with  errors  we  have  held  structural.  A  plea  breach 
does  not  "necessarily  render  a  criminal  trial  fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or inno-
cence," Neder v.  United States, 527 U. S. 1, 9 (1999) (emphasis deleted); it does not "defy analysis by `harmless-error' stand-
ards"  by  affecting  the  entire  adjudicatory  framework,  Ful-
minante,  supra,  at  309;  and  the  "difficulty  of  assessing  the effect  of  the  error,"  United  States  v.  Gonzalez-Lopez,  548 

U. S.  140,  149,  n.  4  (2006),  is  no  greater  with  respect  to  plea breaches at sentencing than with respect to other procedural 
errors  at  sentencing,  which  are  routinely  subject  to  harm-lessness review, see, e. g., United  States v.  Teague,  469  F. 3d 
205, 209-210 (CA1 2006). Santobello  did  hold  that  automatic  reversal  is  warranted 
when  objection  to  the  Government's  breach  of  a  plea  agree-ment  has  been  preserved,

3  but  that  holding  rested  not  upon 

the premise that plea-breach errors are (like "structural" er-rors)  somehow  not 

susceptible,  or  not  amenable,  to  review for harmlessness, but rather upon a policy interest in estab-

lishing  the  trust  between  defendants  and  prosecutors  that is  necessary  to  sustain  plea  bargaining--an  "essential"  and 
"highly  desirable"  part  of the  criminal  process,  404  U. S.,  at 261-262.  But  the  rule  of  contemporaneous  objection  is 
equally essential and desirable, and when the two collide we see  no  need  to  relieve  the  defendant  of  his  usual  burden  of 
showing prejudice.  See Olano, supra, at 734. The  defendant  whose  plea  agreement  has  been  broken  by 

the  Government  will  not  always  be  able  to  show  prejudice, either because he obtained the benefits contemplated by the 
deal anyway (e. g., the sentence that the prosecutor promised 

3 We  need  not  confront  today  the  question  whether  Santobello's 
automatic-reversal  rule  has  survived  our  recent  elaboration  of  harmless-
error principles in such cases as Fulminante and Neder.

those  benefits  in  any  event  (as  is  seemingly  the  case  here).4 

On the dissent's view, a defendant in Puckett's position has 
always  suffered  an  impairment  of  his  "substantial  rights" 
under  Olano's  third  prong,  because  he  has  been  convicted 
"in  the  absence  of  trial  or  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the 
plea agreement dispensing with the Government's obligation 
to prove its case."  Post, at 143-144 (opinion of Souter,

nal defendants have a constitutionally protected liberty interest in their 
state-provided peremptory challenge rights; that the issue is not amena-
ble  to  harmless-error  analysis,  as  it  is  impossible  to  ascertain  how  a 
properly  constituted  jury  would  have  decided  his  case;  and  that  auto-
matic  reversal  therefore  must  be  the  rule  as  a  matter  of  federal  law. 
Rivera's  arguments  do  not  withstand  scrutiny.  If  a  defendant  is  tried 
before  a  qualified  jury  composed  of  individuals  not  challengeable  for 
cause,  the  loss  of  a  peremptory  challenge  due  to  a  state  court's  good-
faith error is not a matter of federal constitutional concern.  Rather, it 
is  a  matter  for  the  State  to  address  under  its  own  laws.  There  is  no 
freestanding  constitutional  right  to  peremptory  challenges.  See,  e. g., 
United  States  v.  Martinez-Salazar,  528  U. S.  304,  311.  They  are  "a 
creature of statute," Ross v.  Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81, 89, which a State 
may decline to offer at all, Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57.  Thus, 
the mistaken denial of a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, 
without  more,  violate  the  Federal  Constitution.  See,  e. g.,  Engle  v. 
Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 121, n. 21.  The Due Process Clause safeguards not 
the  meticulous  observance  of  state  procedural  prescriptions,  but  "the 
fundamental elements of fairness in a criminal trial."  Spencer v.  Texas, 
385 U. S. 554, 563-564.  Pp. 156-158. 

(b)  The trial  judge's refusal to excuse Gomez did not deprive Rivera 
of his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.  Ross 
is  instructive.  There,  a  criminal  defendant  used  a  peremptory  chal-
lenge to rectify an Oklahoma trial court's erroneous denial of a for-cause 
challenge,  leaving  him  with  one  fewer  peremptory  challenge  to  use  at 
his discretion.  Even though the trial court's error might "have resulted 
in a jury panel different from that which would otherwise have decided 
[Ross's] case," 487 U. S., at 87, because no member of the jury as finally 
composed  was removable  for cause, there  was no  violation of  his  Sixth 
Amendment  right  to  an  impartial  jury  or  his  Fourteenth  Amendment 
right to due process, id., at 86-91.  This Court reached the same conclu-
sion with regard to a federal-court trial in Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S., 
at  316.  Rivera's  efforts  to  distinguish  Ross  and  Martinez-Salazar 
are  unavailing.  First,  although  in  contrast  to  Rivera,  the  Ross  and 
Martinez-Salazar  defendants  did  not  challenge  any  of  the  jurors  who 
were  in  fact  seated,  neither  Gomez  nor  any  other  member  of  Rivera's 
jury  was  removable  for  cause.  Thus,  like  the  Ross  and  MartinezSalazar  juries,  Rivera's  jury  was  impartial  for  Sixth  Amendment  pur-
poses.  Rivera  suggests  that  due  process  concerns  persist  because 
Gomez  knew  he  did  not  want  her  on  the  panel,  but  this  Court  rejects 
the  notion  that  a  juror  is  constitutionally  disqualified  whenever  she  is 
aware of a challenge.  Second, it is not constitutionally significant that, 
in  contrast  to  Ross  and  Martinez-Salazar,  the  seating  of  Gomez  over

150  RIVERA  v.  ILLINOIS 

Syllabus 
Rivera's  peremptory  challenge  was  at  odds  with  state  law.  Errors  of 
state law do not automatically become violations of due process.  As in 
Ross  and  Martinez-Salazar,  there  is  no  suggestion  here  that  the  trial 
judge repeatedly or deliberately misapplied the law or acted in an arbi-
trary  or  irrational  manner.  Rather,  his  conduct  reflected  a  good-faith 
effort  to  enforce  Batson's  antidiscrimination  requirements.  To  hold 
that a one-time, good-faith misapplication of Batson violates due process 
would  likely  discourage  trial  courts  and  prosecutors  from  policing  a 
defendant's  discriminatory  use  of  peremptory  challenges.  The  Four-
teenth Amendment does not compel such a tradeoff.  Pp. 158-160. 

(c)  Rivera  errs  in  insisting  that,  even  without  a  constitutional  viola-
tion, the deprivation of a state-provided peremptory challenge requires 
reversal as a matter of federal law.  He relies on a suggestion in Swain 
v.  Alabama,  380  U. S.  202,  219,  that  "[t]he  denial  or  impairment  of  the 
right  [to  exercise  peremptory  challenges]  is  reversible  error  without  a 
showing  of  prejudice."  This  statement  was  disavowed  in  MartinezSalazar, see 528 U. S., at 317, n. 4.  Typically, an error is designated as 
"structural," therefore "requir[ing] automatic reversal," only when "the 
error  `necessarily  render[s]  a  criminal  trial  fundamentally  unfair  or  an 
unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.' "  Washington v. 
Recuenco,  548  U. S.  212,  218-219.  The  mistaken  denial  of  a  state-
provided peremptory challenge does not, in the circumstances here, con-
stitute  such  an  error.  The  automatic  reversal  precedents  Rivera  cites 
are  inapposite.  One  set  of  cases  involves  constitutional  errors  con-
cerning  the  qualification  of  the  jury  or  judge.  See,  e. g.,  Batson,  476 
U. S., at 86, 87.  A second set of cases involves circumstances in which 
federal judges or tribunals lacked statutory authority to adjudicate the 
controversy, resulting in a judgment invalid as a matter of federal law. 
See, e. g., Nguyen v.  United States, 539 U. S. 69.  Nothing in those deci-
sions  suggests  that  federal  law  renders  state-court  judgments  void 
whenever  there  is  a  state-law  defect  in  a  tribunal's  composition.  Ab-
sent  a  federal  constitutional  violation,  States  are  free  to  decide,  as  a 
matter of state law, that a trial court's mistaken denial of a peremptory 
challenge  is  reversible  error  per  se  or,  as  the  Illinois  Supreme  Court 
implicitly held here, that the improper seating of a competent and unbi-
ased juror could rank as a harmless error under state law.  Pp. 160-162.

Opinion of the Court 
are  qualified  and  unbiased,  does  the  Due  Process  Clause  of the  Fourteenth  Amendment  nonetheless  require  automatic 

reversal of the defendant's conviction? Following a jury trial in an Illinois state court, defendant-
petitioner Michael Rivera was convicted of first-degree mur-der and sentenced to a prison term of 85 years.  On appeal, 
Rivera  challenged  the  trial  court's  rejection  of  his  peremp-tory challenge to venire member Deloris Gomez.  Gomez sat 
on  Rivera's jury  and indeed  served as  the  jury's  foreperson. It  is  conceded  that  there  was  no  basis  to  challenge  Gomez 
for  cause.  She  met  the  requirements  for  jury  service,  and Rivera  does  not  contend  that  she  was  in  fact  biased  against 
him.  The  Supreme  Court  of  Illinois  held  that  the  peremp-tory  challenge  should  have  been  allowed,  but  further  held 
that  the  error  was  harmless  and  therefore  did  not  warrant reversal  of  Rivera's  conviction.  We  affirm  the  judgment  of 
the Illinois Supreme Court. The right to exercise peremptory challenges in state court 
is  determined  by  state  law.  This  Court  has  "long  recog-nized" that "peremptory challenges are not of federal consti-
tutional  dimension."  United  States  v.  Martinez-Salazar, 528  U. S.  304,  311  (2000).  States  may  withhold  peremptory 
challenges  "altogether  without  impairing  the  constitutional guarantee  of an  impartial  jury  and a  fair trial."  Georgia  v. 
McCollum, 505 U. S. 42, 57 (1992).  Just as state law controls the existence and exercise of peremptory challenges, so state 
law  determines  the  consequences  of  an  erroneous  denial  of such a  challenge.  Accordingly, we  have  no cause  to disturb 
the  Illinois  Supreme  Court's  determination  that,  in  the  cir-cumstances Rivera's case presents, the trial court's error did 
not warrant reversal of his conviction. 

I 
Rivera  was  charged  with  first-degree  murder  in  the  Cir-cuit  Court  of  Cook  County,  Illinois.  The  State  alleged  that 

Rivera,  who  is  Hispanic,  shot  and  killed  Marcus  Lee,  a  16-

Opinion of the Court 
year-old  African-American,  after  mistaking  Lee  for  a  mem-ber of a rival gang. 

During  jury  selection,  Rivera's  counsel  questioned  pro-spective juror Deloris Gomez, a business office supervisor at 
Cook  County  Hospital's  outpatient  orthopedic  clinic.  App. 32-33.  Gomez  stated  that  she  sometimes  interacted  with 
patients  during  the  check-in  process  and  acknowledged  that 
Cook  County  Hospital  treats  many  gunshot  victims.  She maintained,  however,  that  her  work  experience  would  not 

affect her ability to be impartial.  After questioning Gomez, Rivera's counsel sought to use a peremptory challenge to ex-
cuse  her.  Id.,  at  33.  At  that  point  in  the  jury's  selection, 
Rivera had already used three peremptory challenges.  Two 
of  the  three  were  exercised  against  women;  one  of  the  two 
women thus eliminated  was African-American.  Illinois law 
affords each side seven peremptory challenges.  See Ill. Sup. 
Ct. Rule 434(d) (West 2006). 

Rather than dismissing Gomez, the trial judge called coun-
sel  to  chambers,  where  he  expressed  concern  that  the  de-
fense was discriminating against Gomez.  App. 34- 36. 
Under Batson v.  Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), and later de-
cisions  building  upon  Batson,  parties  are  constitutionally 
prohibited from exercising peremptory challenges to exclude 
jurors on the basis of race, ethnicity, or sex.  Without speci-
fying the type of discrimination he suspected or the reasons 
for  his  concern,  the  judge  directed  Rivera's  counsel  to  state 
his  reasons  for  excusing  Gomez.  Counsel  responded,  first, 
that  Gomez  saw  victims  of  violent  crime  on  a  daily  basis. 
Counsel  next  added  that  he  was  "pulled  in  two  different 
ways" because Gomez had "some kind of Hispanic connection 
given  her  name."  App.  34.  At  that  point,  the  judge  inter-
jected  that  Gomez  "appears  to  be  an  African  American"-- 
the  second  "African  American  female"  the  defense  had 
struck.  Id., at 34-35.  Dissatisfied with counsel's proffered 
reasons, the judge denied the challenge to Gomez, but agreed 
to allow counsel to question Gomez further.

154  RIVERA  v.  ILLINOIS 

Opinion of the Court 
After  asking  Gomez  additional  questions  about  her  work at  the  hospital,  Rivera's  counsel  renewed  his  challenge. 

Counsel  observed,  outside  the  jury's  presence,  that  most  of the  jurors  already  seated  were  women.  Counsel  said  he 
hoped  to  "get  some  impact  from  possibly  other  men  in  the case." 

Id.,  at  39.  The  court  reaffirmed  its  earlier  ruling, 
and Gomez was seated on the jury. Rivera's case proceeded to trial.  The jury, with Gomez as 

its  foreperson,  found  Rivera  guilty  of  first-degree  murder. 
A  divided  panel  of  the  Appellate  Court  of  Illinois  rejected Rivera's  challenge  to  the  trial  judge's 

Batson  ruling  and  af-
firmed  his  conviction.  348  Ill.  App.  3d  168,  810  N.  E.  2d 
129 (2004). 

The  Supreme  Court  of  Illinois  accepted  Rivera's  petition 
for  leave  to  appeal  and  remanded  for  further  proceedings. 
221  Ill.  2d  481,  852  N.  E.  2d  771  (2006).  A  trial  judge,  the 
court  held,  may  raise  a  Batson  issue  sua  sponte  only  when 
there  is  a  prima  facie  case  of  discrimination.  Concluding 
that  the  record  was  insufficient  to  evaluate  the  existence  of 
a  prima  facie  case,  the  court  instructed  the  trial  judge  to 
articulate the bases  for his Batson  ruling  and, in  particular, 
to  clarify  whether  the  alleged  discrimination  was  on  the 
basis of race, sex, or both.  221 Ill. 2d, at 515-516, 852 N. E. 
2d, at 791. 

On  remand,  the  trial  judge  stated  that  prima  facie  evi-
dence  of  sex  discrimination--namely,  counsel's  two  prior 
challenges  to  women  and  "the  nature  of  [counsel's]  ques-
tions"--had  prompted  him  to  raise  the  Batson  issue.  App. 
136.  Counsel's  stated  reasons  for  challenging  Gomez,  the 
judge  reported,  convinced  him  that  "there  had  been  a  pur-
poseful  discrimination  against  Mrs.  Gomez  because  of  her 
gender."  Id., at 137. 

The  case  then  returned  to  the  Illinois  Supreme  Court. 
Although  that  court  disagreed  with  the  trial  judge's  assess-
ment, it affirmed Rivera's conviction.  227 Ill. 2d 1, 879 N. E.

Opinion of the Court 
2d  876  (2007).  The  Illinois  High  Court  concluded  "that  the record  fails  to  support  a 

prima  facie  case  of  discrimination 
of any kind."  Id., at 15, 879 N. E. 2d, at 884.  Accordingly, the court determined, the trial judge erred, first in demand-

ing an explanation from  Rivera's counsel,  and next, in deny-ing Rivera's peremptory challenge of Gomez. 

Ibid. 
Even so, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected Rivera's ulti-mate 

argument  that  the  improper  seating  of  Gomez  ranked as  "reversible  error  without  a  showing  of  prejudice." 

Id., 
at  16,  879  N.  E.  2d,  at  885  (quoting  Swain  v.  Alabama,  380 U. S. 202, 219 (1965)).  Citing this Court's guiding decisions, 

the  Illinois  court  observed  that  "the  Constitution  does  not 
confer a right to peremptory challenges."  227 Ill. 2d, at 17, 
879  N.  E.  2d,  at  885  (quoting  Batson,  476  U. S.,  at  91).  Al-
though  "peremptory  challenges  are  `one  means  of  assuring 
the  selection  of  a  qualified  and  unbiased  jury,' "  the  court 
explained,  they  are  not  "indispensable  to  a  fair  trial."  227 
Ill.  2d,  at  16,  879  N.  E.  2d,  at  885  (quoting  Batson,  476 
U. S., at 91). 

Accordingly, the court held, the denial of Rivera's peremp-
tory challenge did not qualify as a structural error requiring 
automatic  reversal.  See  227  Ill.  2d,  at  19-20,  879  N.  E.  2d, 
at 887 (citing Washington v.  Recuenco, 548 U. S. 212, 218-219 
(2006)).  The  court  saw  no  indication  that  Rivera  had  been 
"tried  before  a  biased  jury,  or  even  one  biased  juror."  227 
Ill. 2d, at 20, 879 N. E. 2d, at 887.  In that regard, the court 
stressed, Rivera did "not suggest that Gomez was subject to 
excusal for cause."  Ibid. 

Relying  on  both  federal  and  state  precedents,  the  court 
proceeded to consider whether it was "clear beyond a reason-
able  doubt  that  a  rational  jury  would  have  found  [Rivera] 
guilty  absent  the  error."  Id.,  at  21,  879  N.  E.  2d,  at  887 
(quoting  Neder  v.  United  States,  527  U. S.  1,  18  (1999)). 
After  reviewing  the  trial  record,  the  court  concluded  that 
Gomez's  presence  on  the  jury  did  not  prejudice  Rivera  be-

cause  "any  rational  trier  of  fact  would  have  found  [Rivera] guilty of murder on the evidence adduced at trial."  227 Ill. 

2d, at 26, 879 N. E. 2d, at 890. Having held the  error harmless beyond a reasonable 
doubt, the court added  that  it  "need  not  decide whether  the erroneous  denial  of  a  peremptory  challenge  is  an  error  of 
constitutional dimension in these circumstances."  Id., at 27, 879  N.  E.  2d,  at  891.  This  comment,  it  appears,  related  to 
Rivera's  arguments  that,  even  absent  a  freestanding  consti-tutional  entitlement  to  peremptory  challenges,  the  inclusion 
of  Gomez  on  his  jury  violated  his  Fourteenth  Amendment right to due process of law. 

We  granted  certiorari,  554  U. S.  945  (2008),  to  resolve  an apparent  conflict  among  state  high  courts  over  whether  the 
erroneous  denial  of  a  peremptory  challenge  requires  auto-matic reversal of a defendant's conviction as a matter of fed-
eral  law.  Compare  Angus  v.  State,  695  N.  W.  2d  109,  118 (Minn.  2005)  (applying  automatic  reversal  rule);  State  v. 
Vreen, 143 Wash. 2d 923, 927-932, 26 P. 3d 236, 238-240 (2001) (same), with People v.  Bell, 473 Mich. 275, 292-299, 702 N. W. 
2d 128, 138-141 (2005) (rejecting automatic reversal rule and looking  to  state  law  to  determine  the  consequences  of  an 
erroneous  denial  of  a  peremptory  challenge);  227  Ill.  2d,  at 15-27, 879 N. E. 2d, at 884-891 (case below).  We now affirm 
the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois. 

II 
The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment, Rivera maintains, requires reversal whenever a criminal de-

fendant's  peremptory  challenge  is  erroneously  denied.  Ri-vera recalls the ancient lineage  of the peremptory challenge 
and  observes  that  the  challenge  has  long  been  lauded  as  a means to guard against latent bias and to secure "the consti-
tutional  end  of  an  impartial  jury  and  a  fair  trial."  McCol-lum,  505  U. S.,  at  57.  When  a  trial  court  fails  to  dismiss  a 
lawfully  challenged  juror,  Rivera  asserts,  it  commits  struc-

Opinion of the Court 
tural  error:  The  jury  becomes  an  illegally  constituted  tribu-nal,  and  any  verdict  it  renders  is 

per  se  invalid.  According 
to  Rivera,  this  holds  true  even  if  the  Constitution  does not  itself  mandate  peremptory  challenges,  because  criminal 

defendants  have  a  constitutionally  protected  liberty  inter-est  in  their  state-provided  peremptory  challenge  rights. 
Cf.  Evitts  v.  Lucey,  469  U. S.  387,  393  (1985)  (although  "the 
Constitution  does  not  require  States  to  grant  appeals  as  of right  to  criminal  defendants,"  States  that  provide  such  ap-

peals  "must  comport  with  the  demands  of  the  Due  Process and Equal Protection Clauses"). 

The improper seating of a juror, Rivera insists, is not ame-
nable  to  harmless-error  analysis  because  it  is  impossible  to 
ascertain how a properly constituted jury--here, one without 
juror Gomez--would have decided his case.  Thus, he urges, 
whatever the constitutional status of peremptory challenges, 
automatic  reversal  must  be  the  rule  as  a  matter  of  federal 
law. 

Rivera's  arguments  do  not  withstand  scrutiny.  If  a  de-
fendant is tried before a qualified jury composed of individu-
als not challengeable for cause, the loss of a peremptory chal-
lenge  due  to  a  state  court's  good-faith  error  is  not  a  matter 
of  federal  constitutional  concern.  Rather,  it  is  a  matter  for 
the State to address under its own laws. 

As  Rivera  acknowledges,  Brief  for  Petitioner  38,  this 
Court  has  consistently  held  that  there  is  no  freestanding 
constitutional  right  to  peremptory  challenges.  See,  e. g., 
Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S., at 311.  We have characterized 
peremptory  challenges  as  "a  creature  of  statute,"  Ross  v. 
Oklahoma, 487 U. S. 81, 89 (1988), and have made clear that 
a State may decline to offer them at all, McCollum, 505 U. S., 
at 57.  See also Holland v.  Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 482 (1990) 
(dismissing the notion "that the requirement of an `impartial 
jury'  impliedly  compels  peremptory  challenges").  When 
States  provide  peremptory  challenges  (as  all  do  in  some 
form),  they  confer  a  benefit  "beyond  the  minimum  require-

ments of  fair [ jury] selection,"  Frazier v.  United  States, 335 U. S. 497, 506 (1948), and thus retain discretion to design and 

implement their own systems, Ross, 487 U. S., at 89.1 Because  peremptory  challenges  are  within  the  States' 
province  to  grant  or  withhold,  the  mistaken  denial  of  a state-provided peremptory challenge does not, without more, 
violate  the  Federal  Constitution.  "[A]  mere  error  of  state law," we have noted, "is not a denial of due process." 

Engle v.  Isaac,  456  U. S.  107,  121,  n.  21  (1982)  (internal  quotation 

marks  omitted).  See  also  Estelle  v.  McGuire,  502  U. S.  62, 67, 72-73 (1991).  The Due Process Clause, our decisions in-
struct,  safeguards  not  the  meticulous  observance  of  state procedural  prescriptions,  but  "the  fundamental  elements  of 
fairness in a criminal trial."  Spencer v.  Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 563-564 (1967). 

The  trial  judge's  refusal  to  excuse  juror  Gomez  did  not deprive Rivera of his constitutional right to a fair trial before 
an  impartial  jury.  Our  decision  in  Ross  is  instructive. Ross,  a  criminal  defendant  in Oklahoma,  used  a  peremptory 
challenge  to  rectify  the  trial  court's  erroneous  denial  of  a for-cause challenge, leaving him with one fewer peremptory 
challenge  to  use  at  his  discretion.  The  trial  court's  error, we acknowledged, "may have resulted in a jury panel differ-
ent  from  that  which  would  otherwise  have  decided  [Ross's] case."  487 U. S., at 87.  But because no member of the jury 
as  finally  composed  was  removable  for  cause,  we  found  no violation  of  Ross's  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  an  impartial 
jury  or  his  Fourteenth  Amendment  right  to  due  process. Id., at 86-91. 

We  encountered  a  similar  situation  in  Martinez-Salazar and  reached  the  same  conclusion.  Martinez-Salazar,  who 
was  tried  in  federal  court,  was  entitled  to  exercise  peremp-

tory challenges pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Proce-dure 24(b).  His decision  to use  one of  his peremptory  chal-

lenges to cure the trial court's erroneous denial of a for-cause challenge, we held, did not impair his rights under that Rule. 
"[A] principal reason for peremptories," we explained, is "to help secure the constitutional guarantee of trial by an impar-
tial  jury."  528  U. S.,  at  316.  Having  "received  precisely 
what federal law provided," and having been tried "by a jury on  which  no  biased  juror  sat,"  Martinez-Salazar  could  not 

"tenably assert any violation of his . . . right to due process." 
Id., at 307, 317. 

Rivera's efforts to distinguish Ross and Martinez-Salazar 
are  unavailing.  First,  Rivera  observes,  the  defendants  in 
Ross  and  Martinez-Salazar  did  not  challenge  any  of  the  ju-
rors who were in fact seated.  In contrast, Rivera attempted 
to  exercise  a  peremptory  challenge  against  a  specific  per-
son--Gomez--whom  he  perceived  to  be  unfavorable  to  his 
cause.  But,  as  Rivera  recognizes,  neither  Gomez  nor  any 
other  member  of  his  jury  was  removable  for  cause.  See 
Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  9.  Thus,  like  the  juries  in  Ross  and 
Martinez-Salazar,  Rivera's  jury  was  impartial  for  Sixth 
Amendment  purposes.  Rivera  suggests  that  due  process 
concerns persist because Gomez knew he did not want her on 
the panel.  Gomez, however, was not privy to the in camera 
discussions  concerning  Rivera's  attempt  to  exercise  a  pe-
remptory strike against her.  See supra, at 153.  We reject 
the  notion  that  a  juror  is  constitutionally  disqualified  when-
ever she is aware that a party has challenged her.  Were the 
rule otherwise, a party could circumvent Batson by insisting 
in  open  court  that  a  trial  court  dismiss  a  juror  even  though 
the  party's  peremptory  challenge  was  discriminatory.  Or  a 
party  could  obtain  a  juror's  dismissal  simply  by  making  in 
her  presence  a  baseless  for-cause  challenge.  Due  process 
does not require such counterintuitive results. 

Second,  it  is  not  constitutionally  significant  that  the  seat-
ing  of  Gomez  over  Rivera's  peremptory  challenge  was  at

Opinion of the Court 
odds with state law.  The defendants in Ross and MartinezSalazar,  Rivera  emphasizes,  were  not  denied  their  peremp-
tory  challenge  rights  under  applicable  law--state  law  in 
Ross  and  the  Federal  Rules  of  Criminal  Procedure  in 
Martinez-Salazar.  But as we have already explained, 
supra,  at  157-159,  errors  of  state  law  do  not  automatically 
become  vi olations  of  due  process.  As  in  Ross  and 
Martinez-Salazar,  there is  no  suggestion  here  that  the  trial judge repeatedly or deliberately misapplied the law or acted 

in an arbitrary or irrational manner.  Martinez-Salazar, 528 U. S.,  at  316; 

Ross,  487  U. S.,  at  91,  n.  5.  Rather,  the  trial 
judge's  conduct  reflected  a  good-faith,  if  arguably  overzeal-
ous,  effort  to  enforce  the  antidiscrimination  requirements 
of  our  Batson-related  precedents.  To  hold  that  a  one-time, 
good-faith  misapplication  of  Batson  violates  due  process 
would likely discourage trial courts and prosecutors from po-
licing  a  criminal  defendant's  discriminatory  use  of  peremp-
tory challenges.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not com-
pel such a tradeoff. 

Rivera insists that, even without a constitutional violation, 
the deprivation of a state-provided peremptory challenge re-
quires  reversal  as  a  matter  of  federal  law.  We  disagree. 
Rivera  relies  in  part  on  Swain,  380  U. S.  202,  which  sug-
gested that "[t]he denial or impairment of the right [to exer-
cise  peremptory  challenges]  is  reversible  error  without  a 
showing  of  prejudice."  Id.,  at  219.  We  disavowed  this 
statement  in  Martinez-Salazar,  observing,  albeit  in  dicta, 
"that  the oft-quoted language  in Swain  was not only unnec-
essary  to the decision in that  case . . . but was  founded on a 
series of our  early cases decided long before the  adoption of 
harmless-error  review."  528  U. S.,  at  317,  n. 4.  As  our  re-
cent decisions make clear, we typically designate an error as 
"structural," therefore "requir[ing] automatic reversal," only 
when "the error `necessarily render[s] a criminal trial funda-
mentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt 
or  innocence.' "  Recuenco,  548  U. S.,  at  218-219  (quoting

Neder,  527  U. S.,  at  9).  The  mistaken  denial  of  a  state-provided  peremptory  challenge  does  not,  at  least  in  the  cir-

cumstances  we  confront  here,  constitute  an  error  of  that character. 

The  automatic  reversal  precedents  Rivera  cites  are  inap-posite.  One set of cases involves constitutional errors con-
cerning  the  qualification  of  the  jury  or  judge.  In  Batson, for  example,  we  held  that  the  unlawful  exclusion  of  jurors 
based on race requires reversal because it "violates a defend-ant's right to equal protection," "unconstitutionally discrimi-
nate[s] against the excluded juror," and "undermine[s] public confidence  in  the  fairness  of  our  system  of  justice."  476 
U. S., at 86, 87.  Similarly, dismissal of a juror in violation of 
Witherspoon  v.  Illinois,  391  U. S.  510  (1968),2  we  have  held, is constitutional error  that requires vacation of  a  death sen-

tence.  See  Gray  v.  Mississippi,  481  U. S.  648  (1987).  See also 

Gomez  v.  United  States,  490  U. S.  858,  876  (1989) ("Among  those  basic  fair  trial  rights  that  can  never  be 

treated  as  harmless  is  a  defendant's  right  to  an  impartial adjudicator,  be  it  judge  or  jury."  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted)). A second set of cases involves circumstances in which fed-
eral judges or tribunals lacked statutory authority to adjudi-cate the controversy.  We have held the resulting judgment 
in  such  cases  invalid  as  a  matter  of  federal  law.  See,  e. g., Nguyen  v.  United States,  539  U. S.  69  (2003);  Wingo  v.  Wed-
ding,  418  U. S.  461  (1974).  Nothing  in  these  decisions  sug-gests  that  federal  law  renders  state-court  judgments  void 
whenever there is a state-law defect in a tribunal's composi-tion.  Absent a federal constitutional violation, States retain 
the prerogative to decide whether such errors deprive a tri-

death  cannot  be  carried  out  if  the  jury  that  imposed  or  recommended  it 
was chosen by excluding veniremen for cause simply because they voiced 
general objections to the death penalty or expressed conscientious or reli-
gious scruples against its infliction."  Id., at 522.

bunal  of  its  lawful  authority  and  thus  require  automatic  re-versal.  States  are  free  to  decide,  as  a  matter  of  state  law, 

that a trial court's mistaken denial of a peremptory challenge is reversible error per se.  Or they may conclude, as the Su-
preme Court of Illinois implicitly did here, that the improper seating  of  a  competent  and  unbiased  juror  does  not  convert 
the  jury  into  an  ultra  vires  tribunal;  therefore  the  error could rank as harmless under state law. 

In  sum,  Rivera  received  precisely  what  due  process  re-quired:  a  fair  trial  before  an  impartial  and  properly  in-
structed jury, which found him guilty of every element of the charged offense. 

* * * For  the  reasons  stated,  the  judgment  of  the  Supreme 
Court of Illinois is 

Affirmed.

Syllabus 
Court  has  jurisdiction  whenever  "a  state  court  decision  fairly  appears 
to  rest  primarily  on  federal  law,  or  to  be  interwoven  with  the  federal 
law."  Michigan  v.  Long,  463  U. S.  1032,  1040.  Far  from  providing  a 
plain  statement  that  its  decision  rested  on  state  law,  the  state  court 
plainly  held  that  the  decision  was  dictated  by  federal  law,  particularly 
the Apology Resolution.  Pp. 171-172. 

2.  The  Apology  Resolution  did  not  strip  Hawaii  of  its  sovereign  au-
thority to alienate the lands the United States held in absolute fee and 
granted to the State upon its admission to the Union.  Pp. 172-177. 

(a)  Neither  of  the  resolution's  substantive  provisions  justifies  the 
judgment  below.  The  first  such  provision's  six  verbs--i. e.,  Congress 
"acknowledge[d]  the  historical  significance"  of  the  monarchy's  over-
throw, "recognize[d] and commend[ed] efforts of reconciliation" with na-
tive Hawaiians, "apologize[d] to [them]" for the overthrow, "expresse[d] 
[the]  commitment  to  acknowledge  [the  overthrow's]  ramifications,"  and 
"urge[d]  the  President  .  .  .  to  also  acknowledge  [those]  ramifications," 

$ 1--are all conciliatory or precatory.  This is not  the kind  of language 
Congress uses to create substantive rights, especially rights enforceable 
against the cosovereign States.  See, e. g., Pennhurst State School and 
Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17-18.  The resolution's second sub-
stantive provision, the $ 3 disclaimer, by its terms speaks only to those 
who  may  or  may  not  have  "claims  against  the  United  States."  The 
State Supreme Court, however, read $ 3 as a congressional recognition-- 
and  preservation--of  claims  against  Hawaii.  There  is  no  justification 
for  turning  an  express  disclaimer  of  claims  against  one  sovereign  into 
an affirmative recognition of claims against another.  Pp. 173-174. 

(b)  The  State  Supreme  Court's  conclusion  that  the  37  "whereas" 
clauses  prefacing  the  Apology  Resolution  clearly  recognize  native  Ha-
waiians'  "unrelinquished"  claims  over  the  ceded  lands  is  wrong  for  at 
least  three  reasons.  First,  such  "whereas"  clauses  cannot  bear  the 
weight  that the lower  court placed  on them.  See, e. g., District  of  Co-
lumbia  v.  Heller,  554  U. S.  570,  578,  n.  3.  Second,  even  if  the  clauses 
had some legal effect, they did not restructure Hawaii's rights and obli-
gations,  as  the  lower  court  found.  "[R]epeals  by  implication  are  not 
favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature 
to repeal [is] clear and manifest."  National Assn. of Home Builders v. 
Defenders of Wildlife, 551 U. S. 644, 662.  The Apology Resolution re-
veals  no  such  intention,  much  less  a  clear  and  manifest  one.  Third, 
because  the  resolution  would  raise  grave  constitutional  concerns  if  it 
purported  to  "cloud"  Hawaii's  title  to  its  sovereign  lands  more  than 
three decades after the State's admission to the Union, see, e. g., Idaho 
v.  United  States, 533  U. S.  262,  280, n. 9,  the  Court  refuses to  read  the

nonsubstantive "whereas" clauses to create such a "cloud" retroactively,

John  Stevens,  the  United  States  Minister  to  Hawaii,  acting with the  United  States Armed Forces,  replaced the  [Hawai-

ian] monarchy with a provisional government."  Rice v.  Cay-
etano,  528  U. S.  495,  504-505  (2000).  "That  government 
sought  annexation  by  the  United  States,"  id.,  at  505,  which 
the  United  States  granted,  see  Joint  Resolution  to  Provide for  Annexing  the  Hawaiian  Islands  to  the  United  States, 

No.  55,  30  Stat.  750  (hereinafter  Newlands  Resolution). Pursuant  to  the  Newlands  Resolution,  the  Republic  of 
Hawaii "cede[d] absolutely and without reserve to the United States  of  America  all  rights  of  sovereignty  of  whatsoever 
kind"  and  further  "cede[d]  and  transfer[red]  to  the  United States  the  absolute  fee  and ownership  of all public,  Govern-
ment, or Crown lands, public buildings or edifices, ports, har-bors,  military  equipment,  and  all  other  public  property  of 
every  kind  and  description  belonging  to  the  Government  of 
the  Hawaiian  Islands,  together  with  every  right  and  appur-tenance  thereunto  appertaining"  (hereinafter  ceded  lands).

Ibid.  The  Newlands  Resolution  further  provided  that  all 
"property  and  rights"  in  the  ceded  lands  "are  vested  in  the 
United States of America."  Ibid. Two  years  later,  Congress  established  a  government  for 

the  Territory  of  Hawaii.  See  Act  of  Apr.  30,  1900,  ch.  339, 31 Stat. 141 (hereinafter Organic Act).  The Organic Act re-
iterated  the  Newlands  Resolution  and  made  clear  that  the new  Territory  consisted  of  the  land  that  the  United  States 
acquired  in  "absolute  fee"  under  that  resolution.  See  $ 2, 
ibid.  The Organic Act further provided: 

"[T]he  portion  of  the  public  domain  heretofore  known as  Crown  land  is  hereby  declared  to  have  been,  on  [the 

effective  date  of  the  Newlands  Resolution],  and  prior thereto,  the  property  of  the  Hawaiian  government,  and

"Public" and "Government" lands were  other lands held  by the Hawaiian 
government.

the rents, issues, and profits thereof.  It shall be subject to alienation and other uses as may be provided by law."

In  1959,  Congress  admitted  Hawaii  to  the  Union.  See Pub. L. 86-3, 73 Stat. 4 (hereinafter Admission Act).  Under 

the  Admission  Act,  with  exceptions  not  relevant  here,  "the United  States  grant[ed]  to  the  State  of  Hawaii,  effective 
upon  its  admission  into  the  Union,  the  United  States'  title to  all  the  public  lands  and  other  public  property  within  the 
boundaries  of  the  State  of  Hawaii,  title  to  which  is  held  by the United States immediately prior to its admission into the 
Union."  $ 5(b),  id.,  at  5.  These  lands,  "together  with  the proceeds  from  the  sale  or  other  disposition  of  [these]  lands 
and  the  income  therefrom,  shall  be  held  by  [the]  State  as  a public  trust"  to  promote  various  public  purposes,  including 
supporting  public  education,  bettering  conditions  of  native Hawaiians,  developing  home  ownership,  making  public  im-
provements,  and  providing  lands  for  public  use.  $ 5(f),  id., at  6.  Hawaii  state  law  also  authorizes  the  State  to  use  or 
sell  the  ceded  lands,  provided  that  the  proceeds  are  held  in trust  for  the  benefit  of  the  citizens  of  Hawaii.  See, 

e. g., Haw. Rev. Stat. $$ 171-45, 171-18 (1993). 

In  1993,  Congress  enacted  a  joint  resolution  "to  acknowl-edge  the  historic  significance  of the  illegal  overthrow  of the 
Kingdom of Hawaii, to express its deep regret to the Native Hawaiian people, and to support the reconciliation efforts of 
the  State  of  Hawaii  and  the  United  Church  of  Christ  with Native  Hawaiians."  Joint  Resolution  to  Acknowledge  the 
100th Anniversary of the January 17, 1893 Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Pub. L. 103-150, 107 Stat. 1513 (herein-
after  Apology  Resolution).  In  a  series  of  the  preambular "whereas"  clauses,  Congress  made  various  observations 
about  Hawaii's  history.  For  example,  the  Apology  Resolu-tion  states  that  "the  indigenous  Hawaiian  people  never  di-

rectly relinquished their claims . . . over their national lands to the United States" and that "the health and well-being of 

the Native Hawaiian people is intrinsically tied to their deep feelings  and  attachment  to  the  land."  Id.,  at  1512.  In  the 
same  vein,  the  Apology  Resolution's  only  substantive  sec-tion--entitled "Acknowledgement and Apology"--states 
that Congress: 

"(1)  .  .  .  acknowledges  the  historical  significance  of this  event  which  resulted  in  the  suppression  of  the  in-

herent sovereignty of the Native Hawaiian people; "(2)  recognizes and commends efforts of reconciliation 
initiated  by the  State  of Hawaii  and  the  United  Church of Christ with Native Hawaiians; 

"(3)  apologizes  to  Native  Hawaiians  on  behalf  of  the people  of  the  United  States  for  the  overthrow  of  the 
Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893 with the partici-pation  of  agents  and  citizens  of  the  United  States,  and 
the  deprivation  of  the  rights  of  Native  Hawaiians  to self-determination; 

"(4)  expresses  its  commitment  to  acknowledge  the ramifications  of  the  overthrow  of  the  Kingdom  of  Ha-
waii,  in  order  to  provide  a  proper  foundation  for  rec-onciliation  between  the  United  States  and  the  Native 
Hawaiian people; and "(5)  urges  the  President  of  the  United  States  to  also 
acknowledge  the  ramifications  of  the  overthrow  of  the Kingdom of Hawaii and to support reconciliation efforts 
between  the  United  States  and  the  Native  Hawaiian people." 

Id., at 1513. 

Finally,  $ 3  of  the  Apology  Resolution  states  that  "[n]othing in  this  Joint Resolution  is  intended  to  serve as  a  settlement 

of any claims against the United States."  Id., at 1514.

lute  fee"  to  the  United  States  at  annexation  and  has  been held by the  State since  1959 as part of the trust established 

by  $ 5(f)  of  the  Admission  Act.  The  Housing  Finance  and Development Corporation (HFDC)--Hawaii's affordable 
housing  agency--received  approval  to  remove  the  Leiali'i parcel  from  the  $ 5(f)  trust  and  redevelop  it.  In  order  to 
transfer  the  Leiali'i  parcel  out  of  the  public  trust,  HFDC 
was  required  to  compensate  respondent  Office  of  Hawaiian Affairs (OHA), which was established to receive and manage 

funds from  the use  or sale  of the  ceded lands for the  benefit of native Hawaiians.  Haw. Const., Art. XII, $$ 4-6. 

In  this  case,  however,  OHA  demanded  more  than  mone-
tary compensation.  Relying on the Apology Resolution, re-
spondent  OHA  demanded  that  HFDC  include  a  disclaimer 
preserving any native Hawaiian claims to ownership of lands 
transferred  from  the  public  trust  for  redevelopment. 
HFDC  declined  to  include the  requested  disclaimer  because 
"to  do  so  would  place  a  cloud  on  title,  rendering  title  insur-
ance unavailable."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 207a. 

Again  relying  on  the  Apology  Resolution,  respondents 
then  sued  the  State,  its  Governor,  HFDC  (since  renamed), 
and its officials.  Respondents sought "to enjoin the defend-
ants from selling or otherwise transferring the Leiali'i parcel 
to third parties and selling or otherwise transferring to third 
parties  any  of  the  ceded  lands  in  general  until  a  determina-
tion  of  the  native  Hawaiians'  claims  to  the  ceded  lands  is 
made."  Office  of  Hawaiian  Affairs  v.  Housing  and  Com-
munity Development Corporation of Hawaii, 117 Haw. 174, 
189,  177  P.  3d  884,  899  (2008).  Respondents  "alleged  that 
an  injunction  was  proper  because,  in  light  of  the  Apology 
Resolution,  any  transfer  of  ceded  lands  by  the  State  to 
third-parties  would  amount  to  a  breach  of  trust  .  .  .  ."  Id., 
at 188, 177 P. 3d, at 898. 

The  state  trial  court  entered  judgment  against  respond-
ents,  but  the  Supreme  Court  of  Hawaii  vacated  the  lower 
court's  ruling.  Relying  on  a  "plain  reading  of  the  Apology

Opinion of the Court 
Resolution," which "dictate[d]" its conclusion, id., at 212, 177 P.  3d,  at  922,  the  State  Supreme  Court  ordered  "an  injunc-

tion  against  the  defendants  from  selling or otherwise  trans-ferring  to  third  parties  (1)  the  Leiali'i  parcel  and  (2)  any 
other ceded lands from the public lands trust until the claims of  the  native  Hawaiians  to  the  ceded  lands  have  been  re-
solved," id., at 218, 177 P. 3d, at 928.  In doing so, the court rejected  petitioners'  argument  that  "the  State  has  the  un-
doubted  and  explicit  power  to  sell  ceded  lands  pursuant  to the  terms  of  the  Admission  Act  and  pursuant  to  state  law." 
Id.,  at  211,  177  P.  3d,  at  921  (internal  quotation  marks  and alterations  omitted).  We  granted  certiorari.  554  U. S.  944 
(2008).  II 

Before  turning  to  the  merits,  we  first  must  address  our jurisdiction.  According  to respondents, the Supreme Court 
of Hawaii "merely held that, in light of the ongoing reconcili-ation  process,  the  sale  of  ceded  lands  would  constitute  a 
breach  of  the  State's  fiduciary  duty  to  Native  Hawaiians 
under  state  law."  Brief  for  Respondents  17.  Because  re-spondents believe that this case does not raise a federal ques-

tion, they urge us to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. Although  respondents  dwell  at  length  on  that  argument, 
see  id.,  at  19-34,  we  need  not  tarry  long  to  reject  it.  This Court has jurisdiction whenever "a state court decision fairly 
appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with  the  federal  law,  and  when  the  adequacy  and  independ-
ence  of  any  possible  state  law  ground  is  not  clear  from  the face  of  the  opinion." 

Michigan  v.  Long,  463  U. S.  1032, 1040-1041  (1983).  Far  from  providing  a  "plain  statement" 

that  its  decision  rested  on  state  law,  id.,  at  1041,  the  State Supreme Court plainly held that its decision was "dictate[d]" 
by  federal  law--in  particular,  the  Apology  Resolution,  see 117  Haw.,  at  212,  177  P.  3d,  at  922.  Indeed,  the  court  ex-
plained  that  the  Apology  Resolution  lies  "[a]t  the  heart  of [respondents']  claims,"  that  respondents'  "current  claim  for

Opinion of the Court 
injunctive relief is . . . based largely upon the Apology Reso-lution,"  and  that  respondents'  arguments  presuppose  that 

the Apology Resolution "changed the legal landscape and re-structured  the  rights  and  obligations  of  the  State."  Id.,  at 
189-190,  177  P.  3d,  at  899-900  (internal  quotation  marks omitted).  The  court  noted  that  "[t]he  primary  question  be-
fore this  court on  appeal is  whether, in  light of the  Apology Resolution,  this  court  should 

issue  an  injunction"  against sale  of  the  trust  lands,  id.,  at  210,  177  P.  3d,  at  920,  and  it 

concluded, "[b]ased on a plain reading" of the Apology Reso-lution, that "Congress has clearly recognized that the native 
Hawaiian  people  have  unrelinquished  claims  over  the  ceded lands," 

id., at 191, 177 P. 3d, at 901. Based  on  these  and  the  remainder  of  the  State  Supreme 

Court's 77 references to the Apology Resolution, we have no doubt  that  the  decision  below  rested  on  federal  law.

2  We 

are therefore satisfied that this Court has jurisdiction.  See 28 U. S. C. $ 1257. 

III 
Turning  to the  merits,  we  must decide  whether  the  Apol-ogy  Resolution  "strips  Hawaii  of  its  sovereign  authority  to 

sell,  exchange,  or  transfer,"  Pet.  for  Cert.  i,  the  lands  that the  United  States  held  in  "absolute  fee,"  30  Stat.  750,  and 
"grant[ed]  to  the  State  of  Hawaii,  effective  upon  its  admis-sion into the Union," 73 Stat. 5.  We conclude that the Apol-
ogy Resolution has no such effect. 

2 Respondents  argue  that  the  Supreme  Court  of  Hawaii  relied  on  the 
Apology  Resolution  "simply  to  support  its  factual  determination  that 
Native Hawaiians have unresolved claims to the ceded  lands."  Brief for 
Respondents  21.  Regardless  of  its  factual  determinations,  however,  the 
lower  court's  legal  conclusions  were,  at  the  very  least,  "interwoven  with 
the federal law."  Michigan v.  Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1040 (1983).  See 117 
Haw. 174, 217, 218, 177 P. 3d 884, 927, 928 (2008) ("hold[ing]" that respond-
ents'  legal  claim  "arose"  only  when  "the  Apology  Resolution  was  signed 
into law on November 23, 1993"); id., at 211, n. 25, 177 P. 3d, at 921, n. 25 
(emphasizing  that  "our  holding  is  grounded  in  Hawai`i  and  federal  law").

Opinion of the Court 

A 
"We begin, as always, with the text of the statute."  Per-
manent Mission  of  India  to  United  Nations  v.  City of New York,  551  U. S.  193,  197  (2007).  The  Apology  Resolution 

contains  two  substantive  provisions.  See  107  Stat.  1513- 1514.  Neither justifies the judgment below. 

The  Apology  Resolution's  first  substantive  provision  uses six  verbs,  all  of  which  are  conciliatory  or  precatory.  Spe-
cifically,  Congress  "acknowledge[d]  the  historical  signifi-cance"  of the  Hawaiian  monarchy's  overthrow, "recognize[d] 
and  commend[ed]  efforts  of  reconciliation"  with  native  Ha-waiians,  "apologize[d]  to  [n]ative  Hawaiians"  for  the  monar-
chy's overthrow, "expresse[d] [Congress'] commitment to ac-knowledge the ramifications of the overthrow," and "urge[d] 
the  President  of  the  United  States  to  also  acknowledge  the ramifications  of  the  overthrow  .  .  .  ."  $ 1.  Such  terms  are 
not  the  kind  that  Congress  uses  to  create  substantive rights--especially those that are  enforceable against the  co-
sovereign  States.  See,  e. g.,  Pennhurst  State  School  and Hospital v.  Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17-18 (1981).

3 

The Apology Resolution's second and final substantive pro-vision is a disclaimer, which provides: "Nothing in this Joint 

Resolution is intended to serve as a settlement of any claims against  the  United  States."  $ 3.  By  its  terms,  $ 3  speaks 
only  to  those  who  may  or  may  not  have  "claims  against  the United  States."  The  court  below,  however,  held  that  the 

3 The Apology Resolution's operative provisions thus stand in sharp con-
trast  with  those  of  other  "apologies,"  which  Congress  intended  to  have 
substantive effect.  See, e. g., Civil Liberties Act of 1988, 102 Stat. 903, 50 
U. S. C.  App.  $ 1989  (2000  ed.)  (acknowledging  and  apologizing  "for  the 
evacuation, relocation and internment" of Japanese citizens during World 
War  II  and  providing  $20,000  in  restitution  to  each  eligible  individual); 
Radiation  Exposure  Compensation  Act,  104  Stat.  920,  notes  following  42 
U. S. C. $ 2210 (2000  ed. and Supp. V) ("apologiz[ing] on behalf of the Na-
tion . . .  for  the  hardships"  endured  by  those  exposed  to  radiation  from 
above-ground nuclear testing facilities and providing $100,000 in compen-
sation to each eligible individual).

Opinion of the Court 
only  way  to  save  $ 3  from  superfluity  is  to  construe  it  as 
a congressional recognition--and preservation--of  claims 
against  Hawaii  and  as  "the  foundation  (or  starting  point) 
for  reconciliation"  between  the  State  and  native  Hawaiians.

and  as  far  as  possible  give  effect  to  them,"  Louisville  & 
Nashville R. Co. v.  Mottley, 219 U. S. 467, 475 (1911), but that 
maxim is not a judicial license to turn an irrelevant statutory 
provision into  a relevant  one.  And  we know  of no justifica-
tion  for  turning  an  express  disclaimer  of  claims  against  one 
sovereign  into  an  affirmative  recognition  of  claims  against 
another.4  Cf.  Pacific  Bell  Telephone  Co.  v.  linkLine  Com-
munications,  Inc.,  555  U. S.  438,  457  (2009)  ("Two  wrong 
claims do not make one that is right").  The Supreme Court 
of  Hawaii  erred  in  reading  $ 3  as  recognizing  claims  incon-
sistent  with  the  title  held  in  "absolute  fee"  by  the  United 
States,  30  Stat.  750,  and  conveyed  to  the  State  of  Hawaii  at 
statehood.  See supra, at 167-168. 

4 The  court  below  held  that  respondents  "prevailed  on  the  merits"  by 
showing  that  "Congress  has  clearly  recognized  that  the  native  Hawaiian 
people have unrelinquished claims over the ceded lands, which were taken 
without  consent  or  compensation  and  which  the  native  Hawaiian  people 
are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations." 
117  Haw.,  at  212,  177  P.  3d,  at  922.  And  it  further  held  that  petitioners 
failed to show that the State has the "power to sell ceded lands pursuant 
to the terms of the Admission Act."  Id., at 211, 177 P. 3d, at 921 (internal 
quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Respondents now insist, how-
ever,  that  their  claims  are  "nonjusticiable"  to  the  extent  that  they  are 
grounded on "broader moral and political" bases.  Brief for Respondents 
18.  No matter how respondents characterize their claims, it is undeniable 
that they have asserted title to the ceded lands throughout this litigation, 
see  id.,  at  40,  n.  15  (conceding  the  point),  and  it  is  undeniable  that  the 
Supreme Court  of  Hawaii  relied  on those  claims in  issuing  an  injunction, 
which  is  a  legal (and  hence  justiciable)  remedy--not a  moral, political,  or 
nonjusticiable one.

Opinion of the Court 

B 
Rather  than  focusing  on  the  operative  words  of  the  law, the  court  below  directed  its  attention  to  the  37  "whereas" 

clauses  that  preface  the Apology  Resolution.  See  107  Stat. 1510-1513.  "Based  on  a  plain  reading  of "  the  "whereas" 
clauses,  the  Supreme  Court  of  Hawaii  held  that  "Congress has clearly recognized that the native Hawaiian people have 
unrelinquished  claims  over  the  ceded  lands."  117  Haw.,  at 191, 177  P. 3d,  at 901.  That conclusion is  wrong for  at least 
three reasons. First, "whereas" clauses like those in the Apology Resolu-
tion  cannot  bear  the  weight  that  the  lower  court  placed  on them.  As  we  recently  explained  in  a  different  context, 
"where  the  text  of  a  clause  itself  indicates  that  it  does  not have  operative  effect,  such  as  `whereas'  clauses  in  federal 
legislation . . . , a  court  has  no  license  to  make  it  do  what  it was  not  designed  to  do."  District  of  Columbia  v.  Heller, 
554 U. S. 570, 578, n. 3 (2008).  See also Yazoo & Mississippi Valley  R.  Co.  v.  Thomas,  132  U. S.  174,  188  (1889) ("[A]s  the 
preamble  is  no  part  of  the  act,  and  cannot  enlarge  or  con-fer  powers,  nor  control  the  words  of  the  act,  unless  they 
are  doubtful  or  ambiguous,  the  necessity  of  resorting  to  it to  assist  in  ascertaining  the  true  intent  and  meaning  of  the 
legislature is in itself fatal to the claim set up"). Second,  even  if  the  "whereas"  clauses  had  some  legal  ef-
fect,  they  did  not  "chang[e]  the  legal  landscape  and  restruc-tur[e] the rights and obligations of the State."  117 Haw., at 
190, 177 P. 3d, at 900.  As we have  emphasized, "repeals by implication are not  favored  and will not  be presumed unless 
the  intention of the  legislature to repeal [is] clear  and mani-fest." 

National  Assn.  of  Home  Builders  v.  Defenders  of 
Wildlife,  551  U. S. 644, 662  (2007)  (internal quotation  marks omitted).  The  Apology  Resolution  reveals  no  indication-- 

much  less  a  "clear  and  manifest"  one--that  Congress  in-tended to amend or repeal the State's rights and obligations

Opinion of the Court 
under the Admission Act (or any other federal law); nor does the  Apology  Resolution  reveal  any  evidence  that  Congress 

intended  sub  silentio  to  "cloud"  the  title  that  the  United States held in  "absolute fee" and transferred to the  State in 
1959.  On that score, we find it telling that even respondent OHA  has  now  abandoned  its  argument,  made  below,  that 
"Congress . . .  enacted  the Apology Resolution and thus . . .  change[d]"  the  Admission  Act.  App.  114a;  see  also  Tr.  of 
Oral Arg. 31, 37-38. Third, the Apology Resolution would raise grave constitu-
tional concerns if it purported to "cloud" Hawaii's title to its sovereign  lands  more  than  three  decades  after  the  State's 
admission  to  the  Union.  We  have  emphasized  that  "Con-gress  cannot,  after  statehood,  reserve  or  convey  submerged 
lands  that  have  already  been  bestowed  upon  a  State." 
Idaho v. United States, 533 U. S. 262, 280, n. 9 (2001) (internal quotation  marks  and  alteration  omitted);  see  also 

id.,  at  284 (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting) ("[T]he consequences of admis-

sion are instantaneous, and it ignores the uniquely sovereign character of that event . . . to  suggest that subsequent events 
somehow  can  diminish  what  has  already  been  bestowed"). And that proposition applies a fortiori where virtually all of 
the  State's  public  lands--not  just  its  submerged  ones--are at  stake.  In  light  of  those  concerns,  we  must  not  read  the 
Apology  Resolution's  nonsubstantive  "whereas"  clauses  to create  a  retroactive  "cloud"  on  the  title  that  Congress 
granted  to  the  State  of  Hawaii  in  1959.  See,  e. g.,  Clark  v. 
Martinez,  543  U. S.  371,  381-382  (2005)  (the  canon  of  consti-tutional avoidance "is a tool for choosing between competing 

plausible  interpretations  of  a  statutory  text,  resting  on  the reasonable presumption that Congress did not intend the al-
ternative which raises serious constitutional doubts").

Here,  the  State  Supreme  Court  incorrectly  held  that  Con-gress,  by  adopting  the  Apology  Resolution,  took  away  from 
the citizens of Hawaii the authority to resolve an issue that is of great importance to the people of the State.  Respondents 
defend  that  decision  by  arguing  that  they  have  both  state-law  property  rights  in  the  land  in  question  and  "broader 
moral  and  political  claims  for  compensation  for  the  wrongs of  the  past."  Brief  for  Respondents  18.  But  we  have  no 
authority  to  decide  questions  of  Hawaiian  law  or  to  provide redress  for  past  wrongs  except  as  provided  for  by  federal 
law.  The  judgment  of  the  Supreme  Court  of  Hawaii  is  re-versed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not 
inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.

(b)  The Government's attempts to overcome $ 3599's plain language 
are not  persuasive.  First, this Court's  reading of  the statute does  not 
produce  absurd  results.  Contrary  to  the  Government's  contention,  a 
lawyer  is  not  required  to  represent  her  client  during  a  state  retrial 
following postconviction relief because the retrial marks the commence-
ment  of  new  judicial  proceedings,  not  a  subsequent  stage  of  existing 
proceedings; state postconviction proceedings are also not "subsequent" 
to federal habeas proceedings.  Second, the legislative history does not 
support  the  Government's  argument  that  Congress  intended  $ 3599  to 
apply only to federal defendants.  Congress' decision to furnish counsel 
for state clemency proceedings reflects both clemency's role as the " `fail

quire  a  federal  lawyer  who  obtained  relief  for  her  client  in $ 2254  proceedings  to  continue  to  represent  him  during  his 

state  retrial;  similarly,  it  would  require  federal  counsel  to represent her client in any state habeas proceeding following 
her  appointment.  Second,  the  Government  claims  that  the statute's  legislative  history  shows  that  Congress  did  not  in-
tend to include state clemency proceedings within $ 3599(e)'s 
coverage.  Neither argument is persuasive. The Government suggests that reading $ 3599(e) to author-

ize  federally  funded  counsel  for  state  clemency  proceedings would  require  a  lawyer  who  succeeded  in  setting  aside  a 
state  death  sentence  during  postconviction  proceedings  to 
represent her client during an ensuing state retrial.  We do 
not  read  subsection  (e)  to  apply  to  state-court  proceedings 
that  follow  the  issuance  of  a  federal  writ  of  habeas  corpus. 
When  a  retrial  occurs  after  postconviction  relief,  it  is  not 
properly understood as a "subsequent stage" of judicial pro-
ceedings  but  rather  as  the  commencement  of  new  judicial 
proceedings.  Moreover, subsection (a)(2) provides for coun-
sel only when a state petitioner is unable to obtain adequate 
representation.  States are constitutionally required to pro-
vide  trial  counsel  for  indigent  defendants.  Thus,  when  a 
state  prisoner  is  granted  a  new  trial  following  $ 2254  pro-
ceedings, his  state-furnished representation renders  him in-
eligible  for  $ 3599  counsel  until  the  commencement  of  new 

$ 2254 proceedings. 

The  Government  likewise  argues  that  our  reading  of 

$ 3599(e) would require federally funded counsel to represent 
her client in any state habeas proceeding occurring after her 
appointment  because  such  proceedings  are  also  "available 
post-conviction process."  But as we have previously noted, 
subsection  (e)  authorizes  counsel  to  represent  her  client  in 
"subsequent" stages of available judicial proceedings.  State 
habeas  is  not  a  stage  "subsequent"  to  federal  habeas.  Just 
the  opposite:  Petitioners  must  exhaust  their  claims  in  state 
court before seeking federal habeas relief.  See $ 2254(b)(1).

Congress'  decision  to  furnish  counsel  for  clemency  pro-
ceedings  demonstrates  that  it,  too,  recognized  the  impor-
tance  of  such  process  to  death-sentenced  prisoners,  and  its 
reference  to  "other  clemency,"  $ 3599(e),  shows  that  it  was 
familiar with the availability of state as well as federal clem-
ency proceedings.  Moreover, Congress' sequential enumer-
ation  suggests  an  awareness  that  clemency  proceedings  are 
not as divorced from judicial proceedings as the Government 
submits.  Subsection  (e)  emphasizes  continuity  of  counsel, 
and  Congress  likely  appreciated  that  federal  habeas  counsel 
are  well  positioned  to  represent  their  clients  in  the  state 
clemency  proceedings  that  typically  follow  the  conclusion  of 

$ 2254 litigation. 

Indeed, as the history of this case demonstrates, the work 
of  competent  counsel  during  habeas  corpus  representation 
may provide the basis for a persuasive clemency application.

information about his life history and cognitive impairments

necessarily used to refer exclusively to the "greatest pos-sible  reduction."  For  example,  elsewhere  in  the  Clean 

Water  Act,  Congress  declared  that  the  procedures  imple-menting  the  Act  "shall  encourage  the  drastic  minimization 
of  paperwork  and  interagency  decision  procedures."  33 
U. S. C.  $ 1251(f).  If  respondents'  definition  of  the  term 
"minimize" is correct, the statute's use of the modifier "dras-
tic" is superfluous. 

Other  provisions  in  the  Clean  Water  Act  also  suggest  the 
agency's interpretation.  When Congress wished to mandate 
the greatest feasible reduction in water pollution, it did so in 
plain  language:  The  provision  governing  the  discharge  of 
toxic  pollutants  into  the  Nation's  waters  requires  the  EPA 
to set "effluent limitations [which] shall require the elimina-

Syllabus 
rights, and the EEOC issued each of them a right-to-sue notice.  In the 
ensuing lawsuit, the District Court denied petitioners' motion to compel 
arbitration of respondents' age-discrimination claims.  The Second Cir-
cuit  affirmed,  holding  that  Alexander  v.  Gardner-Denver  Co.,  415  U. S. 
36, forbids enforcement of collective-bargaining provisions requiring ar-
bitration of ADEA claims. 
Held:  A  provision  in  a  collective-bargaining  agreement  that  clearly  and 

unmistakably requires union members to arbitrate ADEA claims is en-
forceable as a matter of federal law.  Pp. 255-274. 

(a)  Examination of the two federal statutes at issue here, the ADEA 
and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), yields a straightforward 
answer to  the question presented.  The Union and the RAB, negotiat-
ing on behalf of 14 Penn Plaza, collectively bargained in good faith and 
agreed that employment-related discrimination claims, including ADEA 
claims,  would  be  resolved  in  arbitration.  This  freely  negotiated  con-
tractual  term  easily  qualifies  as  a  "conditio[n]  of  employment"  subject 
to  mandatory  bargaining  under  the  NLRA,  29  U. S. C.  $ 159(a).  See, 
e. g.,  Litton  Financial Printing Div.,  Litton Business  Systems, Inc.  v. 
NLRB,  501  U. S.  190,  199.  As  in  any  contractual  negotiation,  a  union 
may  agree  to  the  inclusion  of  an  arbitration  provision  in  a  collective-
bargaining  agreement  in  return  for  other  concessions  from  the  em-
ployer, and courts generally may not interfere in this bargained-for ex-
change.  See  NLRB  v.  Magnavox  Co.,  415  U. S.  322,  328.  Thus,  the 
CBA's  arbitration  provision  must  be  honored  unless  the  ADEA  itself 
removes  this  particular  class  of  grievances  from  the  NLRA's  broad 
sweep.  See  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.  v.  Soler  Chrysler-Plymouth, 
Inc., 473 U. S. 614, 628.  It does not.  This Court has squarely held that 
the  ADEA  does  not  preclude  arbitration  of  claims  brought  under  the 
statute.  See  Gilmer  v.  Interstate/Johnson  Lane  Corp.,  500  U. S.  20, 
26-33.  Accordingly, there is no legal basis for the Court to strike down 
the arbitration  clause  in  this  CBA,  which  was freely  negotiated  by the 
Union  and  the  RAB,  and  which  clearly  and  unmistakably  requires  re-
spondents to arbitrate the age-discrimination claims at issue in this ap-
peal.  Pp. 255-260. 

(b)  The  CBA's  arbitration  provision  is  also  fully  enforceable  under 
the  Gardner-Denver  line  of  cases.  Respondents  incorrectly  interpret 
Gardner-Denver and its  progeny as holding  that an agreement to arbi-
trate  ADEA  claims  provided  for  in  a  collective-bargaining  agreement 
cannot  waive  an  individual  employee's  right  to  a  judicial  forum  under 
federal antidiscrimination statutes.  Pp. 260-272. 

(i)  The facts underlying Gardner-Denver and its progeny reveal the 
narrow scope  of  the legal  rule  they engendered.  Those  cases  "did not 
involve the issue of the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate statu-

Syllabus 
tory  claims,"  but  "the  quite  different  issue  whether  arbitration  of 
contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statu-
tory claims."  Gilmer, supra, at 35.  Gardner-Denver does not control 
the outcome where, as here, the collective-bargaining agreement's arbi-
tration  provision  expressly  covers  both  statutory  and  contractual  dis-
crimination claims.  Pp. 260-264. 

(ii)  Apart  from  their  narrow  holdings,  the  Gardner-Denver  line  of 
cases  included  broad  dicta  highly  critical  of  using  arbitration  to  vindi-
cate  statutory  antidiscrimination  rights.  That  skepticism,  however, 
rested  on  a  misconceived  view  of  arbitration  that  this  Court  has  since 
abandoned.  First,  contrary  to  Gardner-Denver's  erroneous  assump-
tion,  415  U. S.,  at  51,  the  decision  to  resolve  ADEA  claims  by  way  of 
arbitration instead of litigation does not waive the statutory right to be 
free from workplace age discrimination; it waives only the right to seek 
relief  from  a  court  in the  first  instance,  see,  e. g.,  Gilmer,  supra, at  26. 
Second,  Gardner-Denver's  mistaken  suggestion  that  certain  informal 
features of arbitration made it a forum "well suited to the resolution of 
contractual disputes," but "a comparatively inappropriate forum for the 
final  resolution  of  [employment]  rights,"  415  U. S.,  at  56,  has  been  cor-
rected.  See,  e. g.,  Shearson/American  Express  Inc.  v.  McMahon,  482 
U. S. 220,  232.  Third, Gardner-Denver's concern that, in arbitration, a 
union may subordinate an individual employee's interests to the collec-
tive  interests  of  all  employees  in  the  bargaining  unit,  415  U. S.,  at  58, 
n.  19,  cannot  be  relied  on  to  introduce  a  qualification  into  the  ADEA 
that is not found in its text.  Until Congress amends the ADEA to meet 
the  conflict-of-interest  concern  identified  in  the  Gardner-Denver  dicta, 
there is "no reason to color the lens through which the arbitration clause 
is  read."  Mitsubishi,  supra,  at  628.  In  any  event,  the  conflict-of-
interest argument amounts to an unsustainable collateral attack on the 
NLRA,  see  Emporium  Capwell  Co.  v.  Western  Addition  Community 
Organization, 420 U. S. 50, 62, and Congress has accounted for the con-
flict in several ways: Union members may bring a duty of fair represen-
tation claim against the union; a union can be subjected to direct liability 
under the ADEA if it discriminates on the basis of age; and union mem-
bers  may  also  file  age-discrimination  claims  with  the  EEOC  and  the 
National Labor Relations Board.  Pp. 265-272. 

(c)  Because  respondents'  arguments  that  the  CBA  does  not  clearly 
and  unmistakably  require  them  to  arbitrate  their  ADEA  claims  were 
not  raised  in  the  lower  courts,  they  have  been  forfeited.  Moreover, 
although a substantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not 
be  upheld,  see,  e. g.,  Mitsubishi,  supra,  at  637,  and  n.  19,  this  Court  is 
not  positioned  to  resolve  in  the  first  instance  respondents'  claim  that 
the CBA allows the Union to prevent them from effectively vindicating

their federal statutory rights in the arbitral forum, given that this ques-

fully  briefed  here  or  below,  and  is  not  fairly  encompassed  within  the

Petitioner  14  Penn  Plaza  LLC  is  a  member  of  the  RAB. It  owns  and  operates  the  New  York  City  office  building 
where,  prior  to  August  2003,  respondents  worked  as  night lobby  watchmen  and  in  other  similar  capacities.  Respond-
ents were directly employed by petitioner Temco Service In-dustries,  Inc.  (Temco),  a  maintenance  service  and  cleaning 
contractor.  In  August  2003,  with  the  Union's  consent,  14 Penn  Plaza  engaged  Spartan  Security,  a  unionized  security 
services contractor and affiliate of Temco, to provide licensed security guards to staff the lobby and entrances of its build-
ing.  Because this  rendered respondents' lobby services un-necessary,  Temco  reassigned  them  to  jobs  as  night  porters 

1 Article V establishes the grievance process, which applies to all claims 
regardless of whether they are subject to arbitration under the CBA.  Ar-
ticle VI establishes the procedures for arbitration and postarbitration judi-
cial review, and, in particular, provides that the arbitrator "shall . . . decide 
all differences arising between the parties as to interpretation, application 
or performance of any part of this Agreement and such other issues as the 
parties are expressly required to arbitrate before him under the terms of 
this Agreement."  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a-47a.

Opinion of the Court 
and  light-duty  cleaners  in  other  locations  in  the  building. Respondents  contend  that  these  reassignments  led  to  a  loss 

in  income,  caused  them  emotional  distress,  and  were  other-wise less desirable than their former positions. 

At  respondents'  request,  the  Union  filed  grievances  chal-lenging  the  reassignments.  The  grievances  alleged  that 
petitioners: (1) violated the CBA's ban on workplace discrim-
ination  by  reassigning  respondents  on  account  of  their  age; (2)  violated  seniority  rules  by  failing  to  promote  one  of  the 

respondents to a handyman position; and (3) failed to equita-bly rotate overtime.  After failing to obtain relief on any of 
these  claims  through  the  grievance  process,  the  Union  re-
quested arbitration under the CBA. 

Af ter the initial arbitration hearing, the Union with-
drew  the  first  set  of  respondents'  grievances--the  age-
discrimination claims--from  arbitration.  Because it had 
consented  to  the  contract  for  new  security  personnel  at  14 
Penn Plaza, the Union believed that it could not legitimately 
object  to  respondents'  reassignments  as  discriminatory. 
But the Union continued to arbitrate the seniority and over-
time  claims,  and,  after  several  hearings,  the  claims  were 
denied. 

In  May  2004,  while  the  arbitration  was  ongoing  but  after 
the  Union withdrew  the  age-discrimination claims,  respond-
ents filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportu-
nity  Commission  (EEOC)  alleging  that  petitioners  had  vio-
lated  their  rights  under  the  ADEA.  Approximately  one 
month  later,  the  EEOC  issued  a  Dismissal  and  Notice  of 
Rights,  which  explained  that  the  agency's  " `review  of  the 
evidence . . . fail[ed]  to  indicate  that  a  violation  ha[d]  oc-
curred,' "  and  notified  each  respondent  of  his  right  to  sue. 
Pyett  v.  Pennsylvania  Building  Co.,  498  F.  3d  88,  91  (CA2 
2007). 

Respondents thereafter filed suit against petitioners in the 
United  States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of 
New  York,  alleging  that  their  reassignment  violated  the

Opinion of the Court 
ADEA  and  state  and  local  laws  prohibiting  age  discrimina-tion.

2  Petitioners filed a motion to compel arbitration of re-

spondents' claims pursuant to $$ 3 and 4 of the Federal Arbi-tration  Act  (FAA),  9  U. S. C.  $$ 3,  4.

3  The  District  Court 

denied  the  motion  because  under  Second  Circuit  precedent, "even a clear and unmistakable union-negotiated waiver of a 

right to litigate certain federal and state statutory claims in a  judicial  forum  is  unenforceable."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert. 
21a.  Respondents  immediately  appealed  the  ruling  under $ 16  of  the  FAA,  which  authorizes  an  interlocutory  appeal 
of  "an  order  .  .  .  refusing  a  stay  of  any  action  under  sec-tion  3  of  this  title"  or  "denying  a  petition  under  section 
4  of  this  title  to  order  arbitration  to  proceed."  9  U. S. C. $$ 16(a)(1)(A)-(B). 

The Court of Appeals affirmed.  498 F. 3d 88.  According to  the  Court  of  Appeals,  it  could  not  compel  arbitration  of 
the  dispute  because  Gardner-Denver,  which  "remains  good law," held "that a collective bargaining agreement could not 
waive covered workers'  rights to a  judicial forum for causes of  action  created  by  Congress."  498  F.  3d,  at  92,  91,  n.  3 
(citing  Gardner-Denver,  415  U. S.,  at  49-51).  The  Court  of Appeals  observed  that  the  Gardner-Denver  decision  was  in 
tension  with  this  Court's  more  recent  decision  in  Gilmer  v. 

2 Respondents also  filed a  "hybrid" lawsuit  against  the  Union and  peti-
tioners  under  $ 301  of  the  Labor  Management  Relations  Act,  1947,  29 
U. S. C.  $ 185,  see  also  DelCostello  v.  Teamsters,  462  U. S.  151,  164-165 
(1983),  alleging  that  the Union  breached  its "duty  of fair  representation" 
under  the  NLRA  by  withdrawing  support  for  the  age-discrimination 
claims  during  the  arbitration  and  that  petitioners  breached  the  CBA  by 
reassigning  respondents.  Respondents  later  voluntarily  dismissed  this 
suit with prejudice. 

3 Petitioners  also  filed  a  motion  to  dismiss  the  complaint  for  failure  to 

state  a  claim.  The  District  Court  denied  the  motion,  holding  that  re-
spondents  had  sufficiently  alleged  an  ADEA  claim  by  claiming  that  they 
"were over the age of 40, . . .  they were reassigned to positions which led 
to  substantial  losses  in  income,  and . . .  their  replacements  were  both 
younger  and  had  less  seniority  at  the  building."  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert. 
20a (footnote omitted).  Petitioners have not appealed that ruling.

Opinion of the Court 
Interstate/Johnson  Lane  Corp.,  500  U. S.  20  (1991),  which "held  that  an  individual  employee  who  had  agreed  individu-

ally to waive his right to a federal forum could be compelled to  arbitrate  a  federal  age  discrimination  claim."  498  F.  3d, 
at 91, n. 3 (citing Gilmer, supra, at 33-35; emphasis in origi-nal).  The  Court  of  Appeals  also  noted  that  this  Court  pre-
viously declined to resolve this tension in Wright v.  Univer-
sal  Maritime  Service  Corp.,  525  U. S.  70,  82  (1998),  where the  waiver  at  issue  was  not  "clear  and  unmistakable."  498 

F. 3d, at 91, n. 3. The  Court  of  Appeals  attempted  to  reconcile  GardnerDenver and Gilmer by holding that arbitration provisions in a  collective-bargaining  agreement,  "which  purport  to  waive 
employees'  rights  to  a  federal  forum  with  respect  to  statu-tory  claims,  are  unenforceable."  498  F.  3d,  at  93-94.  As  a 
result,  an  individual employee  would  be  free to  choose  com-pulsory arbitration under 

Gilmer, but a labor union could not collectively bargain for arbitration on behalf of its members. 

We  granted  certiorari,  552  U. S.  1178  (2008),  to  address  the issue  left  unresolved  in  Wright,  which  continues  to  divide 
the Courts of Appeals,4  and now reverse.

grievances  from  the  NLRA's  broad  sweep.  See  Mitsubishi 
Motors  Corp.  v.  Soler  Chrysler-Plymouth,  Inc.,  473  U. S. 
614, 628  (1985).  It does  not.  This  Court  has squarely  held 
that  the  ADEA  does  not  preclude  arbitration  of  claims 
brought under the statute.  See Gilmer, 500 U. S., at 26-33. 

In  Gilmer,  the  Court  explained  that  "[a]lthough  all  statu-
tory claims may not be appropriate for arbitration, `[h]aving 
made the bargain to arbitrate, the party should be held to it 
unless  Congress  itself  has  evinced  an  intention  to  preclude 
a  waiver  of  judicial  remedies  for  the  statutory  rights  at 
issue.' "  Id., at 26 (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp., supra, 
at 628).  And "[i]f Congress intended the substantive protec-
tion  afforded  by  the  ADEA  to  include  protection  against 
waiver of the right to a judicial forum, that intention will be 
deducible  from  text  or  legislative  history."  500  U. S.,  at  29 
(internal quotation marks and some brackets omitted).  The 
Court determined that "nothing in the text of the ADEA or 
its  legislative  history  explicitly  precludes  arbitration."  Id., 
at 26-27.  The Court also concluded that arbitrating ADEA 
disputes  would  not  undermine  the  statute's  "remedial  and 
deterrent  function."  Id.,  at  28  (internal  quotation  marks 
omitted).  In  the  end,  the  employee's  "generalized  attacks" 
on  "the  adequacy  of  arbitration  procedures"  were  "insuffi-
cient  to  preclude  arbitration  of  statutory  claims,"  id.,  at  30, 
because  there  was  no  evidence  that  "Congress,  in  enacting 
the  ADEA, intended to preclude arbitration of claims under 
that Act," id., at 35. 

The  Gilmer  Court's  interpretation  of  the  ADEA  fully  ap-
plies  in  the  collective-bargaining  context.  Nothing  in  the 
law  suggests  a  distinction  between  the  status  of  arbitration 
agreements  signed  by  an  individual  employee  and  those 
agreed  to  by  a  union  representative.  This  Court  has  re-
quired only that an agreement to arbitrate statutory antidis-
crimination  claims  be  "explicitly  stated"  in  the  collective-
bargaining  agreement.  Wright,  525  U. S.,  at  80  (internal

Opinion of the Court 
quotation  marks  omitted).  The  CBA  under  review  here meets  that  obligation.  Respondents  incorrectly  counter 

that an individual employee must personally "waive" a "[sub-stantive] right" to proceed in court for a waiver to be "know-
ing and voluntary" under the ADEA.  29 U. S. C. $ 626(f )(1). As  explained  below,  however,  the  agreement  to  arbitrate 
ADEA  claims  is  not  the  waiver  of  a  "substantive  right"  as that term is  employed in the ADEA. 

Wright, supra, at 80; see  infra,  at  265-266.  Indeed,  if  the  "right"  referred  to  in 

$ 626(f)(1)  included  the  prospective  waiver  of  the  right  to bring  an  ADEA  claim  in  court,  even  a  waiver  signed  by  an 
individual employee would be invalid as the statute also pre-vents  individuals  from  "waiv[ing]  rights  or  claims  that  may 
arise after the date the waiver is executed."  $ 626(f)(1)(C).6 

6 Respondents' contention that $ 118 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. 
L.  102-166,  105  Stat.  1081,  note  following  42  U. S. C.  $ 1981  (2000  ed.), 
precludes the enforcement of this arbitration agreement also is misplaced. 
See  Brief  for  Respondents  31-32.  Section  118  expresses  Congress'  sup-
port for alternative dispute resolution: "Where appropriate and to the ex-
tent authorized by law, the use of alternative means of dispute resolution, 
including . . . arbitration, is encouraged to resolve disputes arising under" 
the  ADEA.  105  Stat.  1081,  note  following  42  U. S C.  $ 1981.  Respond-
ents  argue  that  the  legislative  history  actually  signals  Congress'  intent 
to  preclude  arbitration  waivers  in  the  collective-bargaining  context.  In 
particular, respondents point to a House Report that, in spite of the stat-
ute's plain language, interprets $ 118 to support their position.  See H. R. 
Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, p. 97 (1991) ("[A]ny agreement to submit disputed 
issues  to  arbitration . . .  in  the  context  of  a  collective  bargaining 
agreement  .  .  .  does  not  preclude  the  affected  person  from  seeking  relief 
under  the  enforcement  provisions  of  Title  VII.  This  view  is  consistent 
with  the  Supreme  Court's  interpretation  of  Title  VII  in  Alexander  v. 
Gardner-Denver  Co.,  415  U. S.  36  (1974)").  But  the  legislative  history 
mischaracterizes the  holding of  Gardner-Denver,  which does  not prohibit 
collective bargaining for arbitration of ADEA claims.  See infra, at 260- 
264.  Moreover,  reading  the  legislative  history  in  the  manner  suggested 
by  respondents  would  create  a  direct  conflict  with  the  statutory  text, 
which encourages the use of arbitration for dispute resolution without im-
posing  any  constraints  on  collective  bargaining.  In  such  a  contest,  the

Opinion of the Court 
Examination  of  the  two  federal  statutes  at  issue  in  this case, therefore, yields a straightforward answer to the ques-

tion presented: The NLRA provided the Union and the RAB with  statutory  authority  to  collectively  bargain  for  arbitra-
tion  of  workplace  discrimination  claims,  and  Congress  did not  terminate  that  authority  with  respect  to  federal  age-
discrimination  claims  in  the  ADEA.  Accordingly,  there  is no  legal  basis  for  the  Court  to  strike  down  the  arbitration 
clause in this CBA, which was freely negotiated by the Union and  the  RAB,  and  which  clearly  and  unmistakably  requires 
respondents  to  arbitrate  the  age-discrimination  claims  at issue  in  this  appeal.  Congress  has  chosen  to  allow  arbitra-
tion  of  ADEA  claims.  The  Judiciary  must  respect  that choice. 

B 
The  CBA's  arbitration  provision  is  also  fully  enforceable under the Gardner-Denver line of cases.  Respondents 

interpret  Gardner-Denver  and  its  progeny  to  hold  that  "a union  cannot  waive  an  employee's  right  to  a  judicial  forum 
under the federal antidiscrimination statutes" because "allowing  the  union  to  waive  this  right  would  substitute 
the  union's  interests  for  the  employee's  antidiscrimination rights."  Brief  for  Respondents  12.  The  "combination  of 
union control over the process and inherent conflict of inter-est with respect to discrimination claims," they argue, "pro-
vided  the  foundation  for  the  Court's  holding  [in  GardnerDenv er] that arbitration under a collective bargaining agreement could not preclude an individual employee's right 

to bring a lawsuit in  court to vindicate a  statutory discrimi-nation claim." 

Id., at 15.  We disagree. 

1 
The holding of Gardner-Denver is not as broad as respond-ents  suggest.  The  employee  in  that  case  was  covered  by  a 

text  must  prevail.  See  Ratzlaf  v.  United  States,  510  U. S.  135,  147-148 
(1994) ("[W]e do not resort to legislative history to cloud a statutory text 
that is clear").

Opinion of the Court 
collective-bargaining agreement that prohibited "discrimina-
tion against any employee on account of race, color, religion, 
sex,  national  origin,  or  ancestry"  and  that  guaranteed  that 
"[n]o employee will be discharged . . . except for just cause." 
415  U. S.,  at  39  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  The 
agreement  also  included  a  "multistep  grievance  procedure" 
that  culminated  in  compulsory  arbitration  for  any  "differ-
ences  aris[ing]  between  the  Company  and  the  Union  as  to 
the meaning and application of the provisions of this Agree-
ment" and "any trouble aris[ing] in the plant."  Id., at 40-41 
(internal quotation marks omitted). 

The  employee  was  discharged  for  allegedly  producing  too 
many defective parts while working  for the  respondent as a 
drill operator.  He  filed a  grievance  with his  union claiming 
that he was " `unjustly discharged' " in violation of the " `just 
cause' "  provision  within  the  collective-bargaining  agree-
ment.  Id.,  at  39,  42.  Then  at  the  final  prearbitration  step 
of the grievance process, the employee added a claim that he 
was discharged because of his race.  Id., at 38-42. 

The  arbitrator  ultimately  ruled  that  the  employee  had 
been  " `discharged  for  just  cause,' "  but  "made  no  reference 
to  [the]  claim  of  racial  discrimination."  Id.,  at  42.  After 
obtaining a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC, the employee 
filed  a  claim  in  Federal  District  Court,  alleging  racial  dis-
crimination  in  violation  of  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act 
of  1964.  The  District  Court  issued  a  decision,  affirmed  by 
the  Court  of  Appeals,  which  granted  summary  judgment  to 
the  employer  because  it  concluded  that  "the  claim  of  racial 
discrimination  had  been  submitted  to  the  arbitrator  and  re-
solved adversely to [the employee]."  Id., at 43.  In the Dis-
trict  Court's view,  "having  voluntarily  elected  to  pursue  his 
grievance  to  final  arbitration  under  the  nondiscrimination 
clause of the collective-bargaining agreement," the employee 
was  "bound  by  the  arbitral  decision"  and  precluded  from 
suing his employer on any other grounds, such as a statutory 
claim under Title VII.  Ibid.

262  14  PENN  PLAZA  LLC  v.  PYETT 

Opinion of the Court 
This  Court  reversed  the  judgment  on  the  narrow  ground that  the  arbitrati on  was  not  preclusive  because  the 

collective-bargaining  agreement  did  not  cover  statutory claims.  As a result, the lower courts erred in relying on the 
"doctrine of election of remedies" to bar the employee's Title VII claim. 

Id., at 49.  "That doctrine, which refers to situa-
tions  where  an  individual  pursues  remedies  that  are  legally 
or  factually  inconsistent"  with  each  other,  did  not  apply  to the  employee's  dual  pursuit  of  arbitration  and  a  Title  VII 

discrimination  claim  in  district  court.  Ibid.  The  employ-ee's  collective-bargaining  agreement  did  not  mandate  arbi-
tration  of  statutory  antidiscrimination  claims.  Id.,  at  49- 

50.  "As  the  proctor  of  the  bargain,  the  arbitrator's  task  is 
to effectuate the intent of the parties."  Id., at 53.  Because 
the collective-bargaining agreement gave the arbitrator "au-
thority  to  resolve  only  questions  of  contractual  rights,"  his 
decision  could  not  prevent  the  employee  from  bringing  the 
Title  VII  claim  in  federal  court  "regardless  of  whether  cer-
tain  contractual  rights  are  similar  to,  or  duplicative  of,  the 
substantive rights secured by Title VII."  Id., at 53-54; see 
also id., at 50. 

The  Court  also  explained  that  the  employee  had  not 
waived his right to pursue his Title VII claim in federal court 
by  participating  in  an  arbitration  that  was  premised  on  the 
same underlying facts as the Title VII claim.  See id., at 52. 
Thus, whether the legal theory of preclusion advanced by the 
employer  rested  on  "the  doctrines  of  election  of  remedies" 
or was recast "as resting instead on the doctrine of equitable 
estoppel  and  on  themes  of  res  judicata  and  collateral  estop-
pel,"  id.,  at  49,  n.  10  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted),  it 
could  not  prevail  in  light  of  the  collective-bargaining  agree-
ment's  failure  to  address  arbitration  of  Title  VII  claims. 
See id., at 46, n. 6 ("[W]e hold that the federal policy favoring 
arbitration  does  not  establish  that  an  arbitrator's  resolution 
of  a  contractual  claim  is  dispositive  of  a  statutory  claim 
under Title VII" (emphasis added)).

Opinion of the Court 
The  Court's  decisions  following  Gardner-Denver  have  not broadened  its  holding  to  make  it  applicable  to  the  facts  of 

this  case.  In Barrentine  v.  Arkansas-Best  Freight System, 
Inc.,  450  U. S.  728  (1981),  the  Court  considered  "whether  an 
employee may bring an action in federal district court, alleg-ing  a  violation  of  the  minimum  wage  provisions  of  the  Fair 

Labor Standards Act, . . . after having unsuccessfully submit-
ted  a  wage  claim  based  on  the  same  underlying  facts  to  a joint  grievance  committee  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of  his 

union's  collective-bargaining  agreement."  Id.,  at  729-730. The Court held that the unsuccessful arbitration did not pre-
clude  the  federal  lawsuit.  Like  the  collective-bargaining 
agreement  in  Gardner-Denver,  the  arbitration  provision 
under  review  in  Barrentine  did  not  expressly  reference  the 
statutory  claim  at  issue.  See  450  U. S.,  at  731,  n.  5.  The 
Court thus reiterated that an "arbitrator's power is both de-
rived  from,  and  limited  by,  the  collective-bargaining  agree-
ment" and "[h]is task is limited to construing the meaning of 
the  collective-bargaining  agreement  so  as  to  effectuate  the 
collective intent of the parties."  Id., at 744. 

McDonald  v.  West  Branch,  466  U. S.  284  (1984),  was  de-
cided  along  similar  lines.  The  question  presented  in  that 
case was "whether a federal court may accord preclusive ef-
fect  to  an  unappealed  arbitration  award  in  a  case  brought 
under [42 U. S. C. $ 1983]."  Id., at 285.  The Court declined 
to fashion such a rule, again explaining that "because an ar-
bitrator's authority derives solely from the contract, Barren-
tine, supra, at 744, an arbitrator may not have the authority 
to enforce $ 1983" when that provision is left unaddressed by 
the  arbitration  agreement.  Id.,  at  290.  Accordingly,  as  in 
both Gardner-Denver and Barrentine, the Court's decision in 
McDonald  hinged  on  the  scope  of  the  collective-bargaining 
agreement and the arbitrator's parallel mandate. 

The  facts  underlying  Gardner-Denver,  Barrentine,  and 
McDonald reveal  the  narrow  scope  of  the  legal  rule  arising 
from that  trilogy  of decisions.  Summarizing  those opinions

Opinion of the Court 
in  Gilmer,  this  Court  made  clear  that  the  Gardner-Denver line  of  cases  "did  not  involve  the  issue  of  the  enforceability 

of  an  agreement  to  arbitrate  statutory  claims."  500  U. S., at 35.  Those decisions instead "involved the quite different 
issue whether arbitration of contract-based claims precluded subsequent judicial resolution of statutory claims.  Since the 
employees  there  had  not  agreed  to  arbitrate  their  statutory claims,  and  the  labor  arbitrators  were  not  authorized  to  re-
solve such claims, the arbitration in those cases understand-ably was held not to preclude subsequent statutory actions." 
Ibid.; see also Wright, 525 U. S., at 76; Livadas v.  Bradshaw, 512  U. S.  107,  127,  n.  21  (1994).

7  Gardner-Denver  and  its 

progeny  thus  do  not  control  the  outcome  where,  as  is  the case  here,  the  collective-bargaining  agreement's  arbitration 

provision  expressly  covers  both  statutory  and  contractual discrimination claims.

Opinion of the Court 

2 
We  recognize  that  apart  from  their  narrow  holdings,  the 
Gardner-Denver line of cases included broad dicta that were highly critical of the use of arbitration for the vindication of 

statutory  antidiscrimination  rights.  That  skepticism,  how-ever,  rested  on  a  misconceived  view  of  arbitration  that  this 
Court has since abandoned. First,  the  Court  in  Gardner-Denver  erroneously  assumed 
that an agreement to submit statutory discrimination claims to  arbitration  was  tantamount  to  a  waiver  of  those  rights. 
See  415  U. S.,  at  51  ("[T]here  can  be  no  prospective  waiver of  an  employee's  rights  under  Title  VII"  (emphasis  added)). 
For  this  reason,  the  Court  stated,  "the  rights  conferred  [by Title VII] can form no part of the collective-bargaining proc-
ess since waiver of these rights would defeat the paramount congressional purpose behind Title VII." 

Ibid.; see also id., at 56 ("[W]e have long recognized that `the choice of forums 

inevitably  affects  the  scope  of  the  substantive  right  to  be vindicated' " (quoting 

U. S. Bulk  Carriers, Inc.  v.  Arguelles, 400 U. S. 351, 359-360 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring))). 

The  Court  was  correct  in  concluding  that  federal  antidis-crimination  rights  may  not  be  prospectively  waived,  see  29 
U. S. C.  $ 626(f )(1)(C);  see  supra,  at  259,  but  it  confused  an agreement  to  arbitrate  those  statutory  claims  with  a  pro-
spective  waiver  of  the  substantive  right.  The  decision  to resolve ADEA claims by way of arbitration instead of litiga-
tion does not waive the statutory right to be free from work-place age discrimination; it waives only the right to seek re-

this Court's arbitration jurisprudence in the intervening years, see infra, 
at  266-269,  Gardner-Denver  would  appear  to  be  a  strong  candidate  for 
overruling  if  the  dissents' broad  view  of  its  holding,  see post,  at  282-283

Opinion of the Court 
lief from a court in the first instance.  See Gilmer, supra, at 26  (" `[B]y  agreeing  to  arbitrate  a  statutory  claim,  a  party 

does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than 
a  judicial,  forum' "  (quoting  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.,  473 U. S.,  at  628)).  This  "Court  has  been  quite  specific  in  hold-
ing  that  arbitration  agreements  can  be  enforced  under  the 
FAA  without  contravening  the  policies  of  congressional  en-actments  giving  employees  specific  protection  against  dis-

crimination prohibited by federal law."  Circuit City Stores, 
Inc.,  532  U. S.,  at  123.  The  suggestion  in  Gardner-Denver 
that the decision to arbitrate statutory discrimination claims 
was  tantamount  to  a  substantive  waiver  of  those  rights, 
therefore,  reveals  a  distorted  understanding  of  the  com-
promise made when an employee agrees to  compulsory 
arbitration. 

In  this  respect,  Gardner-Denver  is  a  direct  descendant  of 
the  Court's  decision  in  Wilko  v.  Swan,  346  U. S.  427  (1953), 
which  held  that  an  agreement  to  arbitrate  claims  under  the 
Securities  Act  of  1933  was  unenforceable.  See  id.,  at  438. 

The  Court  subsequently  overruled  Wilko  and,  in  so  doing, 
characterized  the  decision  as  "pervaded  by  .  .  .  `the  old 
judicial  hostility  to  arbitration.' "  Rodriguez  de  Quijas  v. 
Shearson/American  Express,  Inc.,  490  U. S.  477,  480  (1989). 
The Court added: "To the extent that Wilko rested on suspi-
cion of arbitration as a method of weakening the protections 
afforded in  the substantive  law to would-be complainants,  it 
has  fallen  far  out  of  step  with  our  current  strong  endorse-
ment  of  the  federal  statutes  favoring  this  method  of  resolv-
ing disputes."  Id., at 481; see also Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 
supra, at 626-627 ("[W]e are well past the time when judicial 
suspicion of the desirability  of arbitration  and of the  compe-
tence of arbitral tribunals inhibited the development of arbi-
tration as an alternative means of dispute resolution").  The 
timeworn "mistrust of the arbitral process" harbored by the 
Court  in  Gardner-Denver  thus  weighs  against  reliance  on

tivity  to  arbitration,"  Wright,  525  U. S.,  at  77,  reliance  on any  judicial  decision  similarly  littered  with 

Wilko's  overt hostility to the enforcement of arbitration agreements would 

be ill advised.9

Opinion of the Court 
Second,  Gardner-Denver  mistakenly  suggested  that  cer-tain  features  of  arbitration  made  it  a  forum  "well  suited  to 

the resolution of contractual disputes," but "a comparatively inappropriate forum for the final resolution of rights created 
by  Title  VII."  415  U. S.,  at  56.  According  to  the  Court, the  "factfinding  process  in  arbitration"  is  "not  equivalent  to 
judicial  factfinding"  and  the  "informality  of  arbitral  pro-
cedure . . .  makes  arbitration  a  less  appropriate  forum  for final  resolution  of  Title  VII  issues  than  the  federal  courts." 

Id., at 57, 58.  The Court also questioned the competence of arbitrators to decide federal statutory claims.  See 

id., at 57 
("[T]he  specialized  competence  of  arbitrators  pertains  pri-
marily to the law of the shop, not the law of the land"); Bar-
rentine,  450  U. S.,  at  743  ("Although  an  arbitrator  may  be 
competent  to  resolve  many  preliminary  factual  questions, 
such  as  whether  the  employee  `punched  in'  when  he  said  he 
did, he may lack the competence to decide the ultimate legal 
issue whether an employee's right to a minimum wage  or to 
overtime pay under the statute has been violated").  In the 
Court's  view,  "the  resolution  of  statutory  or  constitutional 
issues is  a primary responsibility  of courts, and judicial con-
struction  has  proved  especially  necessary  with  respect  to 
Title  VII,  whose  broad  language  frequently  can  be  given 
meaning  only  by  reference  to  public  law  concepts. " 
Gardner-Denver, supra, at 57; see also McDonald, 466 U. S., 
at  290  ("An  arbitrator  may  not  .  .  .  have  the  expertise  re-
quired  to  resolve  the  complex  legal  questions  that  arise  in 

$ 1983 actions"). 

These misconceptions have been corrected.  For example, 
the Court has "recognized that arbitral tribunals are readily 
capable of handling the factual and legal complexities of anti-
trust claims, notwithstanding the absence of judicial instruc-
tion and supervision" and that "there is no reason to assume 
at  the  outset  that  arbitrators  will  not  follow  the  law."  McMahon, supra, at 232; Mitsubishi Motors Corp., 473 U. S., at 
634 ("We decline to indulge the presumption that the parties

Opinion of the Court 
and  arbitral  body conducting  a  proceeding  will be  unable  or unwilling  to  retain  competent,  conscientious,  and  impartial 

arbitrators").  An  arbitrator's  capacity  to  resolve  complex questions of fact and law extends with equal force to discrim-
ination  claims  brought  under  the  ADEA.  Moreover,  the recognition that arbitration procedures are more streamlined 
than  federal  litigation  is  not  a  basis  for  finding  the  forum 
somehow  inadequate;  the  relative  informality  of  arbitration is  one  of  the  chief  reasons  that  parties  select  arbitration. 

Parties  "trad[e]  the  procedures  and  opportunity  for  review of  the  courtroom  for  the  simplicity,  informality,  and  expedi-
tion  of  arbitration."  Id.,  at  628.  In  any  event,  "[i]t  is unlikely . . . that age discrimination claims require more ex-
tensive discovery than other claims that we have found to be arbitrable, such as [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Orga-
nizations  Act]  and  antitrust  claims."  Gilmer,  supra,  at  31. 
At  bottom,  objections  centered  on  the  nature  of  arbitration 
do not offer a credible basis for discrediting the choice of that 
forum to resolve statutory antidiscrimination claims.10 

Third, the Court in Gardner-Denver raised in a footnote a 
"further  concern"  regarding  "the  union's  exclusive  control 
over the manner and extent to which an individual grievance 
is presented."  415 U. S., at 58, n. 19.  The Court suggested 
that  in  arbitration,  as in  the  collective-bargaining  process,  a 
union  may  subordinate  the  interests  of  an  individual  em-
ployee to the collective interests of all employees in the bar-
gaining unit.  Ibid.; see also McDonald, supra, at 291 ("The 
union's  interests  and  those  of  the  individual  employee  are 
not  always  identical  or  even  compatible.  As  a  result,  the 

10 Moreover, an arbitrator's decision as to whether a unionized employee 
has  been  discriminated  against  on  the  basis  of  age  in  violation  of  the 
ADEA  remains  subject  to  judicial  review  under  the  FAA.  9  U. S. C. 

$ 10(a).  "[A]lthough  judicial  scrutiny of  arbitration awards  necessarily  is 
limited,  such  review  is  sufficient  to  ensure  that  arbitrators  comply  with 
the  requirements  of  the  statute."  Shearson/American  Express  Inc.  v. 
McMahon, 482 U. S. 220, 232 (1987).

tive  strength  and  bargaining  power,  in  full  awareness  that the  superior  strength  of  some  individuals  or  groups  might 

be subordinated to the interest of the majority."  Ibid. (foot-note omitted); see also 

Ford Motor Co. v.  Huffman, 345 U. S. 
330, 338 (1953) ("The complete satisfaction of all who are rep-resented  is  hardly  to  be  expected"); 

Pennsylvania  R.  Co.  v. 
Rychlik,  352  U. S.  480,  498  (1957)  (Frankfurter,  J.,  concur-
ring).  It  was  Congress'  verdict  that  the  benefits  of  orga-nized  labor  outweigh  the  sacrifice  of  individual  liberty  that 

this  system  necessarily  demands.  Respondents'  argument that they  were deprived  of the  right  to pursue  their  ADEA 
claims  in  federal  court  by  a  labor  union  with  a  conflict  of 
interest is therefore unsustainable; it amounts to a collateral 
attack on the NLRA. 

In  any  event,  Congress  has  accounted  for  this  conflict  of 
interest  in  several  ways.  As  indicated  above,  the  NLRA 
has  been  interpreted  to  impose  a  "duty  of  fair  representa-
tion" on labor unions, which a union breaches "when its con-
duct  toward  a  member  of  the  bargaining  unit  is  arbitrary, 
discriminatory, or  in  bad  faith."  Marquez v.  Screen  Actors, 
525  U. S.  33,  44  (1998).  This  duty  extends  to  "challenges 
leveled not only  at a union's  contract  administration and en-
forcement  efforts  but  at  its  negotiation  activities  as  well." 
Beck,  487  U. S.,  at  743  (citation  omitted).  Thus,  a  union  is 
subject  to  liability  under  the  NLRA  if  it  illegally  discrimi-
nates  against  older  workers  in  either  the  formation  or  gov-
ernance  of  the  collective-bargaining  agreement,  such  as  by 
deciding  not  to  pursue  a  grievance  on  behalf  of  one  of  its 
members for discriminatory reasons.  See Vaca v.  Sipes, 386 
U. S.  171,  177  (1967)  (describing  the  duty  of  fair  representa-
tion as the "statutory obligation to serve the interests of all 
members  without  hostility  or  discrimination  toward  any,  to 
exercise its discretion with complete good faith and honesty, 
and  to  avoid  arbitrary  conduct"  (emphasis  added)).  Re-
spondents  in  fact  brought  a  fair  representation  suit  against 
the  Union  based  on  its  withdrawal  of  support  for  their  age-

Opinion of the Court 
discrimination  claims.  See  n.  2,  supra.  Given  this  avenue that Congress  has  made available  to redress  a union's viola-

tion of its duty to its members,  it is  particularly inappropri-ate to ask this Court to impose an artificial limitation on the 
collective-bargaining process. In addition, a union is subject to liability under the ADEA 
if  the  union  itself  discriminates  against  its  members  on  the basis  of  age.  See  29  U. S. C.  $ 623(d);  see  also  1  B.  Linde-
mann  &  P.  Grossman,  Employment  Discrimination  Law 1575-1581  (4th  ed.  2007)  (explaining  that  a  labor  union  may 
be held jointly liable with an employer under federal antidis-crimination  laws  for  discriminating  in  the  formation  of  a 
collective-bargaining  agreement,  knowingly  acquiescing  in the  employer's  discrimination,  or  inducing  the  employer  to 
discriminate); cf. Goodman v.  Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656, 669 (1987).  Union members may also file age-discrimination 
claims  with  the  EEOC  and  the  National  Labor  Relations Board, which may then seek judicial intervention under this 
Court's  precedent.  See  EEOC  v.  Waffle  House,  Inc.,  534 U. S.  279,  295-296  (2002).  In  sum,  Congress  has  provided 
remedies  for  the  situation  where  a  labor  union  is  less  than vigorous  in  defense  of  its  members'  claims  of  discrimination 
under the ADEA.  III 

Finally,  respondents  offer  a  series  of  arguments  contend-ing  that  the  particular  CBA  at  issue  here  does  not  clearly 
and  unmistakably  require  them  to  arbitrate  their  ADEA claims.  See Brief for Respondents 44-47.  But respondents 
did not raise these contract-based arguments in the District Court  or  the  Court  of  Appeals.  To  the  contrary,  respond-
ents acknowledged on appeal that the CBA provision requir-ing  arbitration  of  their  federal  antidiscrimination  statutory 
claims  "is  sufficiently  explicit"  in  precluding  their  federal lawsuit.  Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellees in No. 06-3047-cv(L) 
etc. (CA2),  p. 9.  In light  of  respondents' litigating position, both lower courts assumed that the CBA's arbitration clause

Opinion of the Court 
clearly  applied  to  respondents  and  proceeded  to  decide  the question  left  unresolved  in 

Wright.  We  granted  review  of 
the question presented on that understanding. "Without cross-petitioning for certiorari, a prevailing 

party  may,  of  course,  `defend  its  judgment  on  any  ground properly raised below whether or not that ground was relied 
upon,  rejected,  or  even  considered  by  the  District  Court  or 
the Court of Appeals.' "  Granfinanciera, S. A. v.  Nordberg, 492  U. S.  33,  38-39  (1989)  (quoting 

Washington  v.  Confeder-
ated Bands and Tribes of Yakima Nation, 439 U. S. 463, 476, n.  20  (1979)).  But  this  Court  will  affirm  on  grounds  that 

have  " `not  been  raised  below  .  .  .  "only  in  exceptional 
cases." ' "  Nordberg, supra, at 39 (quoting Heckler v.  Camp-
bell,  461  U. S.  458,  468-469,  n.  12  (1983)).  This  is  not  an 
"exceptional  case."  As  a  result,  we  find  that  respondents' 
alternative  arguments  for  affirmance  have  been  forfeited. 
See,  e. g.,  Rita  v.  United  States,  551  U. S.  338,  360  (2007); 
Sprietsma  v.  Mercury  Marine,  537  U. S.  51,  56,  n.  4  (2002). 
We will not resurrect them on respondents' behalf. 

Respondents  also  argue  that  the  CBA  operates  as  a  sub-
stantive  waiver  of  their  ADEA  rights  because  it  not  only 
precludes  a  federal  lawsuit,  but  also  allows  the  Union  to 
block arbitration of these claims.  Brief for Respondents 28- 
30.  Petitioners  contest  this  characterization  of  the  CBA, 
see  Reply  Brief  for  Petitioners  23-27,  and  offer  record  evi-
dence  suggesting  that  the  Union  has  allowed  respondents 
to  continue  with  the  arbitration  even  though  the  Union  has 
declined  to  participate,  see  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  42a.  But 
not  only  does  this  question  require  resolution  of  contested 
factual  allegations,  it  was  not  fully  briefed  to  this  or  any 
court and is not fairly encompassed within the question pre-
sented, see this Court's Rule 14.1(a).  Thus, although a sub-
stantive waiver of federally protected civil rights will not be 
upheld,  see  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.,  473  U. S.,  at  637,  and 
n.  19;  Gilmer,  500  U. S.,  at  29,  we  are  not  positioned  to  re-
solve in the first instance whether the CBA allows the Union

Opinion of the Court 
C.  Proceedings on Remand 
On remand, the Tribe argued that even if its suit could not be maintained on the basis of the IMLA, the IMDA, or $ 399, 

a "network" of other statutes, treaties, and regulations could provide  the  basis  for  its  claims.  The  Government  objected 
that  our  opinion  foreclosed  that  possibility,  but  the  Federal Circuit  disagreed  and  remanded  for  consideration  of  the  ar-
gument  in  the  first  instance.  347  F.  3d  1327  (2003).  The Court  of  Federal  Claims,  however,  persisted  in  its  original 
decision to dismiss the Tribe's claim, explaining that nothing in the suggested "network" succeeded in tying "specific laws 
or  regulatory  provisions  to  the  issue  at  hand,"  namely,  the Secretary's  approval  of  royalty  rates  in  coal  leases  negoti-
ated by tribes.  68 Fed. Cl. 805, 811 (2005). Once again the Federal Circuit reversed, this time relying 
primarily on three statutory provisions--two sections of the Navajo-Hopi Rehabilitation Act of 1950, $$5, 8, 64 Stat. 46, 25 
U. S. C. $$ 635(a), 638; and one section of the Surface Mining Control  and  Reclamation  Act  of  1977,  30  U. S. C.  $ 1300(e)-- 
to  allow  the  Tribe's  claim  to  proceed.  The  court  held  that the  Government  had  violated  the  specific  duties  created  by 
those  statutes,  as  well  as  "common  law  trust  duties  of  care, candor,  and  loyalty"  that  arise from  the  comprehensive  con-
trol  over  tribal  coal  that  is  exercised  by  the  Government. 501 F. 3d 1327, 1346 (2007). 

Once  again  we  granted  the  Government's  petition  for  a writ of certiorari.  554 U. S. 944 (2008).

The Federal Circuit's opinion also suggested that the Gov-ernment's  "comprehensive  control"  over  coal  on  Indian  land 

gives  rise  to  fiduciary  duties  based  on  common-law  trust principles.  It  noted  that  the  Government  had  conducted 
surveys  and  studies  of  the  Tribe's  coal  resources,  501  F.  3d, at  1341;  that  the  Interior  Department  imposed  various  re-
quirements on coal mining operations on Indian land--regu-lating,  for  example,  "signs  and  markers,  postmining  use  of 
land,  backfilling  and  grading,  waste  disposal,  topsoil  han-dling,  protection  of  hydrologic  systems,  revegetation,  and 
steep-slope  mining,"  id.,

explaining  there  was  no  unreasonable  delay  under  Rule  5(a)  because 
Corley  had  requested  the  break.  He  was  convicted  of  conspiracy  and 
bank  robbery.  The  Third  Circuit  affirmed.  Relying  on  Circuit  prece-

it  with  a  pure  voluntariness  test,  it  concluded  that  if  a  district  court

(a)  The Government claims that because $ 3501(a) makes a confession 
"admissible" "if it is voluntarily given," it entirely eliminates  McNabbMallory  with its bar  to  admitting even a  voluntary  confession if  given 
during  an  unreasonable  presentment  delay.  Corley  argues  that 

$ 3501(a)  was  only  meant  to  overrule  Miranda,  and  notes  that  only 

$ 3501(c)  touches  on  McNabb-Mallory,  making  the  rule  inapplicable  to 
confessions given within six hours of an arrest.  He has the better argu-
ment.  Pp. 313-321. 

(1)  The Government's reading renders $ 3501(c) nonsensical and su-
perfluous.  If subsection (a) really meant that any voluntary confession 
was  admissible,  then  subsection  (c)  would  add  nothing;  if  a  confession 
was "made voluntarily" it would be admissible, period, and never "inad-
missible  solely  because  of  delay,"  even  a  delay  beyond  six  hours.  The 
Government's reading is thus at odds with the basic interpretive canon 
that " `[a] statute should be construed [to give effect] to all its provisions, 
so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.' " 
Hibbs  v.  Winn, 542 U. S. 88, 101.  The Government  claims that in  pro-
viding that a confession "shall not be admissible," Congress meant that 
a  confession "shall  not be  [involuntary]."  Thus  read,  (c) would  specify 
a bright-line rule applying (a) to cases of delay: it would tell courts that 
delay  alone  does  not  make  a  confession  involuntary  unless  the  delay 
exceeds  six  hours.  But  " `Congress  did  not  write  the  statute  that 
way.' "  Russello  v.  United  States,  464  U. S.  16,  23.  The  terms  "inad-
missible"  and  "involuntary"  are  not  synonymous.  Congress  used  both 
in (c), and this Court "would not presume to ascribe this difference to a 
simple  mistake  in  draftsmanship."  Ibid.  There  is  also  every  reason 
to believe that Congress used the distinct terms deliberately, specifying 
two  criteria  that  must  be  satisfied  to  prevent  a  confession  from  being 
"inadmissible solely because of delay": the confession must be "[1] made 
voluntarily  and . . . [2]  within  six  hours  [of  arrest]."  Moreover,  under

Syllabus 
the  McNabb-Mallory  rule,  "inadmissible"  and  "involuntary"  mean  dif-
ferent things.  Corley's position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and 
(a), by reading (a) as overruling Miranda and (c) as qualifying McNabbMallory.  The  Government's  counterargument--that  Corley's  reading 
would  also  create  a  conflict,  since  (a)  makes  all  voluntary  confessions 
admissible  while  (c)  would  leave some  voluntary confessions  inadmissi-
ble--falls  short.  First,  (a)  is  a  broad  directive  while  (c)  aims  only  at 
McNabb-Mallory,  and  "a  more  specific  statute  [is]  given  precedence 
over  a  more  general  one."  Busic  v.  United  States,  446  U. S.  398,  406. 
Second,  reading  (a)  to  create  a  conflict  with  (c)  not  only  would  make 
(c) superfluous, but would also create conflicts with so many other Rules 
of  Evidence  that  the  subsection  cannot  possibly  be  given  its  literal 
scope.  Pp. 313-317. 

(2)  The  legislative  history  strongly  favors  Corley's  reading.  The 
Government  points  to  nothing  in  this  history  supporting  its  contrary 
view.  Pp. 317-320. 

(3)  The Government's position would leave the Rule 5 presentment 
requirement without  teeth, for if  there  is no McNabb-Mallory there  is 
no apparent remedy for a presentment delay.  The prompt presentment 
requirement  is  not  just  an  administrative  nicety.  It  dates  back  to  the 
common  law.  Under  Rule  5,  presentment  is  the  point  at  which  the 
judge  must  take  several  key steps to foreclose  Government overreach-
ing: e. g., informing the defendant of the charges against him and giving 
the  defendant  a  chance  to  consult  with  counsel.  Without  McNabbMallory, federal agents would be free to question suspects for extended 
periods  before  bringing  them  out  in  the  open,  even  though  "custodial 
police interrogation, by its very nature, isolates and pressures the indi-
vidual," Dickerson v.  United States, 530 U. S. 428, 435, inducing people 
to confess to crimes they never committed.  Pp. 320-321. 

(b)  There is no merit to the Government's fallback claim that even if 

$ 3501 preserved a limited version of McNabb-Mallory, Congress cut it 
out by enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 402, which provides that "[a]ll 
relevant  evidence  is  admissible,  except  as  otherwise  provided  by  the 
Constitution  of  the  United  States,  by  Act  of  Congress,  by  these  rules, 
or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court . . . ."  The Advisory 
Committee's  Notes  expressly  identified  McNabb-Mallory  as  a  statuto-
rily  authorized rule  that would  survive  Rule  402,  and  the  Government 
has  previously  conceded  before  this  Court  that  Rule  402  preserved 
McNabb-Mallory.  Pp. 321-322.

ment rule.  318 U. S., at 342 (citing, among others, 18 U. S. C. $ 595  (1940  ed.),  which  provided  that  " `[i]t  shall  be  the  duty 

of  the  marshal . . . who  may  arrest  a  person . . . to take  the  defendant  before  the  nearest . . .  judicial  officer . . . for  a  
hearing' ").  There,  federal  agents  flouted  the  requirement by  interrogating  several  murder  suspects  for  days  before 
bringing them before a magistrate, and then only after they 
had given the confessions that convicted them.  318 U. S., at 334-338, 344-345. 

On the defendants' motions to exclude the confessions from evidence,  we  saw  no  need  to  reach  any  constitutional  issue. 
Instead  we  invoked  the  supervisory  power  to  establish  and 
maintain  "civilized  standards  of  procedure  and  evidence"  in 
federal courts, id., at 340, which we exercised for the sake of 
making  good  on  the  traditional  obligation  embodied  in  the 
federal  presentment  legislation.  We  saw  both  the  statutes 
and  the  traditional  rule  as  aimed  not  only  at  checking  the 
likelihood  of  resort  to  the  third  degree  but  meant  generally 
to  "avoid  all  the  evil  implications  of  secret  interrogation  of 
persons  accused  of  crime."  Id.,  at  344.  We  acknowledged 
that  "Congress  ha[d]  not  explicitly  forbidden  the  use  of  evi-
dence  .  .  .  procured"  in  derogation  of  the  presentment  obli-
gation,  id.,  at  345,  but  we  realized  that  "permit[ting]  such 
evidence  to  be  made  the  basis  of  a  conviction  in  the  fed-
eral  courts  would  stultify  the  policy  which  Congress  ha[d] 
enacted  into  law,"  ibid.,  and  in  the  exercise  of  supervisory 
authority  we  held  confessions  inadmissible  when  obtained 
during unreasonable presentment delay. 

Shortly  after  McNabb,  the  combined  action  of  the  Judi-
cial Conference of the United States and Congress produced 
Federal  Rule  of  Criminal  Procedure  5(a),  which  pulled  the 
several  statutory  presentment  provisions  together  in  one 
place.  See  Mallory,  supra,  at  452  (describing  Rule  5(a)  as 
"a compendious restatement, without substantive change, of 
several prior specific federal statutory provisions").  As first 
enacted, the  rule  told  "[a]n officer making  an arrest  under a

warrant  issued  upon  a  complaint  or  any  person  making  an arrest without a warrant [to] take the arrested person with-

out  unnecessary  delay  before  the  nearest  available  commis-sioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to com-
mit  persons  charged  with  offenses  against  the  laws  of  the United  States."  Fed.  Rule  Crim.  Proc.  5(a)  (1946).  The 
rule  remains  much  the  same  today:  "A  person  making  an 
arrest  within  the  United  States  must  take  the  defendant without  unnecessary  delay  before  a  magistrate  judge  .  .  .  ." 

Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(a)(1)(A) (2007). A  case  for  applying 

McNabb  and  Rule  5(a)  together  soon 
arose in Upshaw v.  United States, 335 U. S. 410 (1948).  De-
spite the Government's confession of error, the D. C. Circuit 
had  thought  McNabb's  exclusionary  rule  applied  only  to  in-
voluntary confessions obtained by coercion during the period 
of  delay,  335  U. S.,  at  411-412,  and  so  held  the  defendant's 
voluntary  confession  admissible  into  evidence.  This  was 
error, and we reiterated the reasoning of a few years earlier. 
"In  the  McNabb  case  we  held  that  the  plain  purpose  of  the 
requirement that prisoners should promptly be taken before 
committing  magistrates  was  to  check  resort  by  officers  to 
`secret  interrogation  of  persons  accused  of  crime.' "  Id.,  at 
412 (quoting McNabb, supra, at 344).  Upshaw consequently 
emphasized that even voluntary confessions are inadmissible 
if  given  after  an  unreasonable  delay  in  presentment.  335 
U. S., at 413. 

We  applied  Rule  5(a)  again  in  Mallory  v.  United  States, 
holding a confession given seven hours after arrest inadmis-
sible  for  "unnecessary  delay"  in  presenting  the  suspect  to  a 
magistrate,  where  the  police  questioned  the  suspect  for 
hours  "within  the  vicinity  of  numerous  committing  magis-
trates."  354 U. S., at 455.  Again, we repeated the reasons 
for the rule and explained, as we had before and have since, 
that delay for  the  purpose of interrogation  is the  epitome  of 
"unnecessary delay."  Id., at 455-456; see also McLaughlin, 
supra, at  61 (Scalia,

Opinion of the Court 
mon law "that the only element bearing upon the reasonable-ness  of  delay  was  not  such  circumstances  as  the  pressing 

need to conduct further investigation, but the arresting offi-cer's  ability,  once  the  prisoner  had  been  secured,  to  reach  a 
magistrate"); Upshaw, supra, at 414.  Thus, the rule known simply as 

McNabb-Mallory "generally render[s] inadmissible confessions  made  during  periods  of  detention  that  violat[e] 

the prompt presentment requirement of Rule 5(a)."  United States v.  Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 354 (1994). 

There the law remained until 1968, when Congress enacted 18  U. S. C.  $ 3501  in  response  to  Miranda  v.  Arizona,  384 
U. S.  436  (1966),  and  to  the  application  of  McNabb-Mallory in  some  federal  courts.  Subsections  (a)  and  (b)  of  $ 3501 
were meant to eliminate M iranda.1  See D ickerson v. United  States,  530  U. S.  428,  435-437  (2000);  infra,  at  318. 
Subsection  (a)  provides  that  "[i]n  any  criminal  prosecution brought  by  the  United  States  .  .  .  ,  a  confession  .  .  .  shall 
be  admissible  in  evidence  if  it  is  voluntarily  given,"  while subsection  (b)  lists  several  considerations  for  courts  to  ad-
dress  in  assessing  voluntariness.2  Subsection  (c),  which  fo-

2 In full, subsections (a) and (b) provide: 

"(a)  In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States or by the 
District of Columbia, a confession, as defined in subsection (e) hereof, shall 
be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.  Before such confession 
is  received  in  evidence,  the  trial  judge  shall,  out  of  the  presence  of  the 
jury,  determine  any  issue  as  to  voluntariness.  If  the  trial  judge  deter-

Opinion of the Court 
cused  on  McNabb-Mallory,  see  infra,  at  318,  provides  that 
in  any  federal  prosecution,  "a  confession  made . . . by .  . . a  
defendant therein,  while  such  person was  under arrest  . . .  , 
shall not  be inadmissible solely  because of delay  in bringing 
such person before a magistrate judge . . . if  such confession

and  if  such  confession  was  made . . . within  six  hours  [of

fense with which he was charged or of which he was suspected at the time 
of making the  confession,  (3)  whether or not  such  defendant  was advised 
or  knew  that  he  was  not  required  to  make  any  statement  and  that  any 
such statement could be used against him, (4) whether or not such defend-
ant had been advised prior to questioning of his right to the assistance of 
counsel; and (5) whether or not such defendant was without the assistance 
of counsel when questioned and when giving such confession. 

"The  presence  or  absence  of  any  of  the  above-mentioned  factors  to  be 
taken into consideration by the judge need not be conclusive on the issue 
of voluntariness of the confession."

"In any criminal prosecution by the United States or by the District of 
Columbia,  a  confession  made  or  given  by  a  person  who  is  a  defendant 
therein,  while  such  person  was  under  arrest  or  other  detention  in  the 
custody  of  any  law-enforcement  officer  or  law-enforcement  agency,  shall 
not be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing such person before 
a magistrate judge or other officer empowered to commit persons charged 
with  offenses  against  the  laws  of  the  United  States  or  of  the  District  of 
Columbia if such confession is found by the trial judge to have been made 
voluntarily and if the weight to be given the confession is left to the jury 
and if such confession was made or given by such person within six hours 
immediately  following  his  arrest  or  other  detention:  Provided,  That  the 
time limitation contained in this subsection shall not apply in any case in 
which the delay  in bringing  such person before such  magistrate judge  or

reasonable considering the means of transportation and the distance to be 
traveled  to  the  nearest  available  such  magistrate  judge  or  other  officer."

Opinion of the Court 
The  issue  in  this  case  is  whether  Congress  intended $ 3501(a) to sweep McNabb-Mallory's exclusionary rule aside 

entirely,  or  merely  meant  $ 3501(c)  to  provide  immunization to  voluntary  confessions  given  within  six  hours  of  a  sus-
pect's arrest.  B 

Petitioner Johnnie Corley was suspected of robbing a bank in  Norristown,  Pennsylvania.  After  federal  agents  learned 
that Corley was subject to arrest on an unrelated local mat-ter, some federal and state officers went together to execute 
the state warrant on September 17, 2003, and found him just as he was pulling out of a driveway in his car.  Corley nearly 
ran  over  one  officer,  then  jumped  out  of  the  car,  pushed  the officer  down,  and  ran.  The  agents  gave  chase  and  caught 
and arrested him for assaulting a federal officer.  The arrest occurred about 8 a.m.  500 F. 3d 210, 212 (CA3 2007). 

Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  agents  first  kept Corley  at  a  local  police  station  while  they  questioned  resi-
dents  near  the  place  he  was  captured.  Around  11:45  a.m. they took him to a Philadelphia hospital to treat a minor cut 
on  his  hand  that  he  got  during  the  chase.  At  3:30  p.m.  the agents  took  him  from  the  hospital  to  the  Philadelphia  FBI 
office  and  told  him  that  he  was  a  suspect  in  the  Norristown bank  robbery.  Though  the  office  was  in  the  same  building 
as the chambers of the nearest magistrate judges, the agents did  not  bring  Corley  before  a  magistrate  judge,  but  ques-
tioned  him  instead,  in  hopes  of  getting  a  confession.  App. 68-69, 83, 138-139. 

The  agents'  repeated  arguments  sold  Corley  on  the  bene-fits  of  cooperating  with  the  Government,  and  he  signed  a 
form  waiving  his  Miranda  rights.  At  5:27  p.m.,  some  9.5 hours  after  his  arrest,  Corley  began  an  oral  confession  that 
he robbed the bank, App. 62,  and spoke  on in  this vein  until about  6:30,  when  agents  asked  him  to  put  it  all  in  writing. 
Corley  said  he  was  tired  and  wanted  a  break,  so  the  agents

Opinion of the Court 
decided  to  hold  him  overnight  and  take  the  written  state-
ment the next morning.  At 10:30 a.m. on September 18 they 
began  the  interrogation  again,  which  ended  when  Corley 
signed  a  written  confession.  He  was  finally  presented  to  a 
Magistrate  Judge  at  1:30  p.m.  that  day,  29.5  hours  after  his 
arrest.  500 F. 3d, at 212. 

Corley  was  charged  with  armed  bank  robbery,  18  U. S. C. 

$$ 2113(a),  (d),  conspiracy  to  commit  armed  bank  robbery, 

$ 371,  and  using  a  firearm  in  furtherance  of  a  crime  of  vio-
lence,  $ 924(c).  When  he  moved  to  suppress  his  oral  and 
written  confessions  under  Rule  5(a)  and  McNabb-Mallory, 
the  District  Court  denied  the  motion,  with  the  explanation 
that the time Corley was receiving medical treatment should 
be excluded from the delay, and that the oral confession was 
thus  given  within  the  6-hour  window  of  $ 3501(c).  Crim. 
No.  03-775  (ED  Pa.,  May  10,  2004),  App.  97.  The  District 
Court  also  held  Corley's  written  confession  admissible,  rea-
soning  that "a break  from interrogation requested  by an ar-
restee who has already begun his confession does not consti-
tute  unreasonable  delay  under  Rule  5(a)."  Id.,  at  97-98. 
Corley  was  convicted  of  conspiracy  and  armed  robbery  but 
acquitted of using a firearm during a crime of violence.  500 
F. 3d, at 212-213. 

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Cir-
cuit  affirmed  the  conviction,  though  its  rationale  for  reject-
ing Corley's Rule  5(a) argument was different from the Dis-
trict Court's.  The panel majority considered itself bound by 
Circuit precedent to the effect that $ 3501 entirely abrogated 
the McNabb-Mallory rule and replaced it with a pure volun-
tariness  test.  See  500  F.  3d,  at  212  (citing  Government  of 
Virgin Islands v.  Gereau, 502 F. 2d 914 (CA3 1974)).  As the 
majority  saw  it,  if  a  district  court  found  a  confession  volun-
tary after considering  the points listed in  $ 3501(b), it would 
be  admissible,  regardless  of  whether  delay  in  presentment 
was unnecessary or unreasonable.  500 F. 3d, at 217.  Judge

Opinion of the Court 
Sloviter read Gereau differently and dissented with an opin-ion  that  "$ 3501  does  not  displace  Rule  5(a)"  or  abrogate 

McNabb-Mallory  for  presentment  delays  beyond  six  hours. 500 F. 3d, at 236. 

We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  a  division  in  the  Courts of  Appeals  on  the  reach  of  $ 3501.  554  U. S.  945  (2008). 
Compare United States v.  Glover, 104 F. 3d 1570, 1583 (CA10 
1997)  ($ 3501  entirely  supplanted  McNabb-Mallory);  United 
States v.  Christopher, 956 F. 2d 536, 538-539 (CA6 1991) (per 
curiam)  (same),  with  United  States  v.  Mansoori,  304  F.  3d 635, 660 (CA7 2002) ($ 3501 limited the 

McNabb-Mallory rule 
to  periods  more  than  six  hours  after  arrest);  United  States v. 

Perez, 733  F. 2d  1026, 1031-1032  (CA2  1984) (same).4  We 
now vacate and remand.  II 

The  Government's  argument  focuses  on  $ 3501(a),  which provides  that  any  confession  "shall  be  admissible  in  evi-
dence"  in  federal  court  "if  it  is  voluntarily  given."  To  the Government,  subsection  (a) means  that  once a  district court 
looks to the considerations in $ 3501(b) and finds a confession voluntary,  in  it  comes;  (a)  entirely  eliminates 

McNabbMallory  with  its  bar  to  admitting  even  a  voluntary  confes-
sion  if  given  during  an  unreasonable  delay  in  presentment. 

Corley  argues  that  $ 3501(a)  was  meant  to  overrule  Mi-
randa and nothing more, with no effect on McNabb-Mallory, 
which  $ 3501  touches  only  in  subsection  (c).  By  providing 
that a confession "shall not be inadmissible solely because of 
delay"  in  presentment  if  "made  voluntarily  and  .  .  .  within 
six hours [of arrest]," subsection (c) leaves McNabb-Mallory 
inapplicable  to  confessions  given  within  the  six  hours,  but 
when  a  confession  comes  even  later,  the  exclusionary  rule 

4 We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  this  question  once  before,  in  United

that case on a different ground, id., at 355-360.

314  CORLEY  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
applies and courts have to see whether the delay was unnec-essary or unreasonable. 

Corley has the better argument. 

A 
The  fundamental  problem  with  the  Government's  reading of $ 3501 is that it renders $ 3501(c) nonsensical and superflu-

ous.  Subsection (c) provides  that a  confession  "shall not  be inadmissible  solely  because  of  delay"  in  presentment  if  the 
confession  is  "made  voluntarily  and  .  .  .  within  six  hours  [of arrest]."  If  (a)  really  meant  that  any  voluntary  confession 
was admissible, as the Government  contends, then  (c) would add nothing; if a confession was "made voluntarily" it would 
be admissible, period, and never "inadmissible solely because of  delay,"  no  matter  whether  the  delay  went  beyond  six 
hours.  There  is  no  way  out  of  this,  and  the  Government concedes  it.  Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  33  ("Congress  never  needed 
(c); (c) in the [G]overnment's view was always superfluous"). The Government's reading is  thus at  odds  with  one of the 
most  basic  interpretive  canons,  that  " `[a]  statute  should be  construed  so  that  effect  is  given  to  all  its  provisions,  so 
that  no  part  will  be  inoperative  or  superfluous,  void  or insignificant . . .  .' "

Opinion of the Court 
The Government attempts to mitigate its problem by rewrit-ing  (c)  into  a  clarifying,  if  not  strictly  necessary,  provision: 

although Congress wrote that a confession "shall not be inad-missible  solely  because  of  delay"  if  the  confession  is  "made 
voluntarily and . . . within six hours [of arrest]," the Govern-ment tells us that Congress actually meant that a confession 
"shall not be [involuntary] solely because of delay" if the con-fession  is  "[otherwise  voluntary]  and  . . . [made]  within  six 
hours  [of  arrest]."  Thus  rewritten, (c)  would  coexist  peace-fully  (albeit  inelegantly)  with  (a),  with  (c)  simply  specifying 
a bright-line rule applying (a) to cases of delay: it would tell courts  that  delay  alone  does  not  make  a  confession  involun-
tary unless the delay exceeds six hours. To this proposal, " `[t]he short answer is that Congress did 
not write the statute that way.' "  Russello v.  United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983) (quoting 

United States v.  Naftalin, 441 U. S.  768,  773  (1979)).  The  Government  may  say  that  we 

can  sensibly  read  "inadmissible"  as  "involuntary"  because the  words  are  "virtually  synonymous  .  .  .  in  this  statutory 
context,"  Brief  for  United  States  23,  but  this  is  simply  not so.  To  begin  with,  Congress  used  both  terms  in  (c)  itself, 
and  "[w]e  would  not  presume  to  ascribe  this  difference  to  a simple  mistake  in  draftsmanship." 

Russello,  supra,  at  23. And  there  is,  in  fact,  every  reason  to  believe  that  Congress 

used  the  distinct  terms  very  deliberately.  Subsection  (c) specifies  two  criteria  that  must  be  satisfied  to  prevent  a 
confession from being "inadmissible solely because of delay": the  confession  must  be  "[1]  made  voluntarily  and  .  .  .  [2] 
within six hours [of arrest]."  Because voluntariness is thus only one of several criteria for admissibility under (c), "invol-
untary"  and  "inadmissible"  plainly  cannot  be  synonymous. 
in context."  FDA v.  Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,  529 U. S. 120, 
132  (2000).  When  subsection  (a)  is  read  in  context,  there  is  no  avoiding 
the question, "What could Congress have been getting at with both (a) and 
(c)?"  The better answer is that Congress meant to do just what Members 
explicitly said in the legislative record.  See infra, at 318-320.

316  CORLEY  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
What  is  more,  the  Government's  argument  ignores  the  fact that  under  the 

McNabb-Mallory  rule,  which  we  presume 
Congress  was  aware  of,  Cannon  v.  University  of  Chicago, 441  U. S.  677,  699  (1979),  "inadmissible"  and  "involuntary" 

mean  different  things.  As  we  explained  before  and  as  the Government  concedes, 

McNabb-Mallory  makes  even  volun-
tary  confessions  inadmissible  if  given  after  an  unreasonable 
delay  in  presentment,  Upshaw,  335  U. S.,  at  413;  Tr.  of  Oral Arg.  33  ("[I]t  was  well  understood  that 

McNabb-Mallory 
.  .  .  excluded  totally  voluntary  confessions").  So  we  cannot accept  the  Government's  attempt  to  confuse  the  critically 

distinct  terms  "involuntary"  and  "inadmissible"  by  rewrit-
ing  (c)  into  a  bright-line  rule  doing  nothing  more  than 
applying (a). 

Corley's  position,  in  contrast,  gives  effect  to  both  (c)  and 
(a), by reading  (a) as overruling  Miranda and (c)  as qualify-
ing  McNabb-Mallory.  The  Government  answers,  however, 
that accepting Corley's argument would result in a different 
problem: it  would create a  conflict between (c) and  (a), since 
(a)  provides  that  all  voluntary  confessions  are  admissible 
while  Corley's  reading  of  (c)  leaves  some  voluntary  confes-
sions inadmissible.  But the Government's counterargument 
falls  short  for  two  reasons.  First,  even  if  (a)  is  read  to  be 
at  odds  with  (c),  the  conflict  is  resolved  by  recognizing  that 
(a)  is  a  broad  directive  while  (c)  aims  only  at  McNabbMallory,  and  "a  more  specific  statute  will  be  given  prece-
dence over a more general one . . . ."  Busic v.  United States, 
446  U. S.  398,  406  (1980).  Second,  and  more  fundamentally, 
(a) cannot prudently be read to create a conflict with (c), not 
only because it would make (c) superfluous, as explained, but 
simply  because  reading  (a)  that  way  would  create  conflicts 
with so many other rules that the subsection cannot possibly 
be given its literal scope.  Subsection (a) provides that "[i]n 
any criminal prosecution  brought by the United States . . . , 
a confession . . . shall be admissible in evidence if it is volun-
tarily given," and $ 3501(e) defines  "confession"  as "any con-

Opinion of the Court 
fession  of  guilt  of  any  criminal  offense  or  any  self-incriminating statement made or given orally or in writing." 

Thus,  if  the  Government  seriously  urged  a  literal  reading, (a)  would  mean  that  "[i]n  any  criminal  prosecution  brought 
by the United States . . . , [`any self-incriminating statement' with respect to `any criminal offense'] . . . shall be admissible 
in  evidence  if  it  is  voluntarily  given."  Thus  would  many  a Rule of Evidence be overridden in case after case: a defend-
ant's self-incriminating statement to his lawyer would be ad-missible despite his insistence on attorney-client privilege; a 
fourth-hand hearsay statement the defendant allegedly made would  come  in;  and  a  defendant's  confession  to  an  entirely 
unrelated crime committed years earlier would be admissible without  more.  These  are  some of  the absurdities  of literal-
ism that show that Congress could not  have been  writing in a literalistic frame of mind.

6 

B 
As it  turns out,  there is  more than  reductio ad  absurdum and the antisuperfluousness canon to confirm that subsection 

(a) leaves McNabb-Mallory alone, for that is what legislative history says.  In fact, the Government concedes that subsec-
tions  (a)  and  (b)  were  aimed  at  Miranda,  while  subsection (c)  was  meant  to  modify  the  presentment  exclusionary  rule. 

6 The  dissent  seeks  to  avoid  these  absurd  results  by  claiming  that 
"$ 3501(a)  does  not  supersede  ordinary  evidence  Rules,"  post,  at  331,  but 
its only argument for this conclusion is that "there is no reason to suppose 
that Congress meant any such thing," ibid.  The dissent is certainly cor-
rect  that  there  is  no  reason  to  suppose  that  Congress  meant  any  such 
thing;  that  is  what  our  reductio  ad  absurdum  shows.  But  that  leaves 
the  dissent  saying,  "$ 3501(a)  must  be  read  literally"  (rendering  $ 3501(c) 
superfluous), "but not too literally" (so that it would override other Rules 
of Evidence).  The dissent cannot have it both ways.  If it means to pro-
fess literalism it will have to take the absurdity that literalism brings with 
it;  "credo  quia  absurdum"  (as  Tertullian  may  have  said).  If  it  will  not 
take  the  absurd,  then  its  literalism  is  no  alternative  to  our  reading  of 
the statute.

318  CORLEY  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
Tr.  of  Oral  Arg.  38  ("I  will  concede  to  you  .  .  .  that  section (a)  was  considered  to  overrule 

Miranda[,]  and  subsection 
(c)  was addressed to McNabb-Mallory").  The concession  is unavoidable.  The Senate, where $ 3501 originated, split the 

provision  into  two  parts:  division  1  contained  subsections (a)  and  (b),  and  division  2  contained  subsection  (c).  114 
Cong.  Rec.  14171  (1968).  In  the  debate  on  the  Senate  floor 
immediately before voting on these  proposals, several Sena-tors,  including  the  section's  prime  sponsor,  Senator  McClel-

lan,  explained  that  division  1  "has  to  do  with  the  Miranda decision,"  while  division  2  related  to 

Mallory.  114  Cong. 
Rec. 14171-14172.  This distinct intent was confirmed by the 
separate Senate votes adopting the two measures, division 1 
by  55  to  29  and  division  2  by  58  to  26,  id.,  at  14171-14172, 
14174-14175;  if  (a)  did  abrogate  McNabb-Mallory,  as  the 
Government  claims,  then  voting  for  division  2  would  have 
been  entirely  superfluous,  for  the  division  1  vote  would  al-
ready have done the job.  That aside, a sponsor's statement 
to  the  full  Senate  carries  considerable  weight,  and  Senator 
McClellan's  explanation  that  division  1  was  specifically  ad-
dressed  to  Miranda  confirms  that  (a)  and  (b)  were  never 
meant to reach far enough to abrogate other background evi-
dentiary rules including McNabb-Mallory. 

Further  legislative  history  not  only  drives  that  point 
home,  but  conclusively  shows  an  intent  that  subsection 
(c)  limit  McNabb-Mallory,  not  replace  it.  In  its  original 
draft,  subsection  (c)  would  indeed  have  done  away  with 
McNabb-Mallory  completely,  for  the  bill  as  first  written 
would  have  provided  that  "[i]n  any  criminal  prosecution  by 
the  United  States . . .  , a  confession  made  or  given  by  a 
person who is a defendant therein . . . shall not be inadmissi-
ble  solely  because  of  delay  in  bringing  such  person  before  a 
[magistrate judge] if such confession is . . . made voluntarily." 
S.  917,  90th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.,  44-45  (1968)  (as  reported  by 
Senate  Committee  on  the  Judiciary);  114  Cong.  Rec.  14172. 
The provision so conceived was resisted, however, by a num-

Opinion of the Court 
ber  of  Senators  worried  about  allowing  indefinite  present-ment  delays.  See,  e. g.,  id.,  at  11740,  13990  (Sen.  Tydings) 

(the provision would "permit Federal criminal suspects to be questioned  indefinitely  before  they  are  presented  to  a  com-
mitting magistrate"); id., at 12290 (Sen. Fong) (the provision "would  open  the  doors  to  such  practices  as  holding  suspects 
incommunicado  for  an  indefinite  period").  After  Senator Tydings proposed striking (c) from the bill altogether, 

id., at 13651  (Amendment  No.  788),  Senator  Scott  introduced  the 

compromise  of  qualifying  (c)  with  the  words:  " `and  if  such confession  was  made  or  given  by  such  person  within  six 
hours  following  his  arrest  or  other  detention,' "  id.,  at 14184-14185  (Amendment  No.  805).

7  The  amendment  was 

intended  to  confine  McNabb-Mallory  to  excluding  only  con-fessions  given  after  more  than  six  hours  of  delay,  see  114 

Cong.  Rec.  14184  (remarks  of  Sen.  Scott)  ("My  amendment provides  that  the  period  during  which  confessions  may  be 
received  .  .  .  shall  in  no  case  exceed  6  hours"),  and  it  was explicitly modeled on the provision Congress had passed just 
months  earlier  to  govern  presentment  practice  in  the  Dis-trict of Columbia, Title III of An Act Relating to Crime and 
Criminal Procedure in the District of Columbia (D. C. Crime Act),  $ 301(b),  81  Stat.  735-736,  see, 

e. g.,  114  Cong.  Rec. 14184 (remarks of Sen. Scott) ("My amendment is an attempt 

to conform, as nearly as practicable, to title III  of [the  D. C. Crime  Act]").  By  the  terms  of  that  Act,  "[a]ny  statement, 
admission,  or  confession  made  by  an  arrested  person  within three hours immediately following his arrest shall not be ex-
cluded from evidence  in  the  courts of the  District  of Colum-bia  solely  because  of  delay  in  presentment."  $ 301(b),  81

320  CORLEY  v.  UNITED  STATES 

Opinion of the Court 
(1967), using it as a model plainly shows how Congress meant as much but no more in $ 3501(c). 

In  sum,  the  legislative  history  strongly  favors  Corley's reading.  The  Government  points  to  nothing  in  this  history 
supporting  its  view  that  (c)  created  a  bright-line  rule  for applying (a) in cases with a presentment issue. 

C 
It  also  counts  heavily  against  the  position  of  the  United States  that  it  would  leave  the  Rule  5  presentment  require-

ment  without  any  teeth,  for  as  the  Government  again  is forced  to  admit,  if  there  is  no 

McNabb-Mallory  there  is  no apparent remedy for delay in presentment.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 

25.  One might not care if the prompt presentment require-ment  were  just  some  administrative  nicety,  but  in  fact  the 
rule  has  always  mattered  in  very  practical  ways  and  still does.  As we said, it stretches back to the common law, when 
it  was  "one  of  the  most  important"  protections  "against  un-lawful arrest."  McLaughlin, 500 U. S., at 60-61 (

erson, 530 U. S., at 435, and there is mounting empirical evi-dence  that  these  pressures  can  induce  a  frighteningly  high 

percentage  of  people  to  confess  to  crimes  they  never  com-mitted, see, e. g., Drizin & Leo, The Problem of False Confes-
sions  in the  Post-DNA  World,  82  N. C.  L.  Rev. 891,  906-907 (2004). 

Justice Frankfurter's point in McNabb is as fresh as ever: "The  history  of  liberty  has  largely  been  the  history  of  ob-
servance  of  procedural  safeguards."  318  U. S.,  at  347. 
McNabb-Mallory  is  one  of  them,  and  neither  the  text  nor the  history  of  $ 3501  makes  out  a  case  that  Congress  meant 

to do away with it.  III 

The Government's fallback claim is that even if $ 3501 pre-served  a  limited  version  of  McNabb-Mallory,  Congress  cut 
out the rule altogether by enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 402  in  1975.  Act  of  Jan.  2,  Pub.  L.  93-595,  88  Stat.  1926. 
So  far  as  it  might  matter  here,  that  rule  provides  that  "[a]ll relevant  evidence  is  admissible,  except  as  otherwise  pro-
vided  by  the  Constitution  of  the  United  States,  by  Act  of Congress,  by  these  rules,  or  by  other  rules  prescribed  by 
the  Supreme  Court  pursuant  to  statutory  authority."  Id., at  1931.  The  Government  says  that 

McNabb-Mallory  ex-cludes  relevant  evidence  in  a  way  not  "otherwise  provided 

by"  any  of  these  four  authorities,  and  so  has  fallen  to  the scythe. 

The  Government  never  raised  this  argument  in  the  Third Circuit  or  the  District  Court,  which  would  justify  refusing 
to  consider  it  here,  but  in  any  event  it  has  no  merit.  The Advisory Committee's Notes on Rule 402, which were before 
Congress  when  it  enacted  the  Rules  of  Evidence  and  which we have relied on in the past to interpret the rules, Tome  v. 
United  States,  513  U. S.  150,  160  (1995)  (plurality  opinion), expressly  identified 

McNabb-Mallory  as  a  statutorily  au-thorized  rule  that  would  survive  Rule  402:  "The  Rules  of 

Civil  and  Criminal  Procedure  in  some  instances  require  the

exclusion  of  relevant  evidence.  For  example,  .  .  .  the  effec-
tive  enforcement  of  .  .  .  Rule  5(a)  .  .  .  is  held  to  require  the 
exclusion of statements elicited during detention in violation 
thereof."  28  U. S. C.  App.,  pp. 325-326  (citing  Mallory,  354 
U. S.  449, and  18  U. S. C. $ 3501(c));  see  also  Mallory,  supra, 
at  451  ("Th[is]  case  calls  for  the  proper  application  of  Rule 
5(a) of the  Federal Rules  of Criminal Procedure . . . ").  In-
deed,  the  Government  has  previously  conceded  before  this 
Court  that  Rule  402  preserved  McNabb-Mallory.  Brief 
for  United  States  in  United  States  v.  Payner,  O.  T.  1979, 
No.  78-1729,  p.  32,  and  n.  13  (saying  that  Rule  402  "left  to 
the courts . . . questions  concerning the propriety  of exclud-
ing relevant evidence as a method of implementing the Con-
stitution, a federal statute, or a statutorily authorized rule," 
and  citing  McNabb-Mallory  as  an  example).  The  Govern-
ment  was  right  the  first  time,  and  it  would  be  bizarre  to 
hold that Congress adopted Rule 402 with a purpose exactly 
opposite  to  what  the  Advisory  Committee  Notes  said  the 
rule would do. 

IV 

We  hold  that  $ 3501  modified  McNabb-Mallory  without 
supplanting it.  Under the rule as revised by $ 3501(c), a dis-
trict  court  with  a  suppression  claim  must  find  whether 

the  defendant  confessed  within  six  hours  of  arrest  (unless 
a  longer  delay  was  "reasonable  considering  the  means  of 
transportation  and  the  distance  to  be  traveled  to  the  near-
est  available  [magistrate  judge]").  If  the  confession  came 
within that period, it is admissible, subject to the other Rules 
of  Evidence,  so  long  as  it  was  "made  voluntarily  and . . .  
the  weight  to  be  given  [it]  is  left  to  the  jury."  Ibid.  If 

the  confession  occurred  before  presentment  and  beyond 
six  hours,  however,  the  court  must decide  whether delaying 

that  long  was  unreasonable  or  unnecessary  under  the 
McNabb-Mallory  cases,  and  if  it  was,  the  confession  is  to 
be suppressed.

sale to Canada.  And neither the Cubic Judgment nor the sale proceeds 
it  represents  were  blocked  assets  at  the  time  of  the  Court  of  Appeals' 
2007  decision.  In  a  1981  order,  the  Treasury  Department  unblocked 
transactions involving property in which Iran's interest arose after Jan-
uary  19,  1981.  Iran's  interest  in  the  Cubic  Judgment  itself  arose  on 
December  7,  1998,  when  the  District  Court  confirmed  the  arbitration 
award.  And  Iran's  interest  in  the  property  underlying  the  judgment 
arose,  as  the  arbitrators  ruled,  when  Cubic  completed  its  sale  of  the 
air  combat  system  in  October  1982.  Thus,  whether  Iran's  "interest  in 
property"  is  considered  to  be  its  interest  in  the  Cubic  Judgment  itself 
or its underlying interest in the sale proceeds, the interest falls within 
the  terms  of  the  Treasury  Department's  general  unblocking  order. 
Even  assuming  (as  the  Ninth  Circuit  held)  that  the  relevant  asset  was 
Iran's pre-1981 interest in the training system itself, that asset still was 
not "blocked" at the time of the decision below.  Such an interest would 
fall  directly  within  the  scope  of  Executive  Order  No.  12281,  which  re-
quired that property owned by Iran be transferred "as directed . . . by 
the  Government  of  Iran."  No  authority supports  the contrary  conclu-
sion.  Pp. 375-379. 

2. Elahi cannot attach the Cubic Judgment because he has waived his 
right to do so.  Section 2002 of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence 
Protection Act of 2000 (VPA) offers compensation to individuals holding 
terrorism-related  judgments  against  Iran.  It  requires those  receiving 
payment to relinquish "all rights to . . . attach property that is at issue 
in  claims  against  the  United  States  before  an  international  tribunal." 

$ 2002(a)(2)(D).  In  2003,  the  U.  S.  Government  paid  Elahi  $2.3  million 
under  the  VPA  as  partial  compensation  for  his  judgment  against  Iran, 
and  he  signed  a  waiver  form  that  mirrors  the  statutory  language.  A 
review of the record in Iran-U. S. Claims Tribunal Case No. B61 demon-
strates that the Cubic Judgment falls within the terms of Elahi's waiver. 
Iran  filed  that  case  in  1982,  claiming  that  between  1979  and  1981  the 
United  States  had  wrongly  barred  the  transfer  of  the  Cubic  training 
system and other military equipment to Iran.  Iran asked the Tribunal 
to  order  the  United  States,  among  other  things,  to  pay  Iran  damages. 
The  United  States  answered  that  the  Tribunal  should  set  off  the  $2.8 
million  represented  by  the  Cubic  Judgment  against  any  award.  Iran 
argued  that  the  Tribunal  should  not  set  off  the  $2.8  million  insofar  as 
third  parties  have  attached  the  judgment.  In  the  terms  of  Elahi's 
waiver, therefore, the Cubic Judgment is "property," and Case No. B61 
itself is a "clai[m] against the United States before an international tri-
bunal."  And  there  remains  a  significant  dispute  about  whether  the 
Cubic  Judgment  can  be  used  by  the  Tribunal  as  a  setoff,  placing  the

The  problem  for  the  Government,  however,  is  that  Iran does not agree that  the  relevant parts of its Ministry of De-

fense  fall  within  the  scope  of  the  State  Department's  desig-nation.  Thus  the  matter  is  in  dispute.  The  lower  courts 
have  not  considered  that  dispute.  The  relevant  arguments have not been set forth in detail here.  And in such circum-
stances we  normally would remand the  case, permitting the lower  courts  to  decide  the  issue  in  the  first  instance.  See,

Opinion of the Court 
The  upshot  is  a  dispute  about  the  Cubic  Judgment.  The United  States  argues  (and  argued  before  the  Tribunal)  that 

the  Tribunal  should  set  off  the  $2.8  million  that  the  Cubic Judgment  represents  against  any  award  that  the  Tribunal 
may make against the United States in Case No. B/61.  Iran argues  (and  argued  before  the  Tribunal)  that  the  Tribunal 
should  not  set  off  the  $2.8  million  insofar  as  third  parties 
have attached the Judgment. To  put  the  matter  in  terms  of  the  language  of  Elahi's 

waiver,  one  can  say  for  certain  that  the  Cubic  Judgment  is "property."  And  Case  No.  B/61  itself  is  a  "clai[m]  against 
the United States before an international tribunal."  We can 
also be reasonably certain that how the Tribunal should use 
that  property  is  also  under  dispute  or  in  question  in  that 
claim.  Moreover,  since  several  parties  other  than  Elahi 
have  already  attached  the  Cubic  Judgment,  see  Brief  for

In  respondent  Sanders'  case,  the  VA  denied  disability  benefits  on 
the  ground  that  Sanders'  disability,  blindness  in  his  right  eye,  was 
not  related  to  his  military  service.  Sanders  argued  to  the  Veterans 
Court  that  the  VA  had  made  notice  errors  Type  Two  and  Type  Three 
when  it  informed  him  what  further  information  was  necessary,  but 
failed to tell him which portions of that information the Secretary would 
provide  and  which  portions  he  would  have  to  provide.  The  Veterans 
Court  held  these  notice  errors  harmless,  but  the  Federal  Circuit  re-
versed,  ruling  that  the  VA  had  not  made  the  necessary  claimant-
knowledge or benefits-ineligibility showing required by the Federal Cir-
cuit's framework. 

The VA also denied benefits in respondent Simmons' case after finding 
that  her  left-ear  hearing  loss,  while  service  connected,  was  not  severe 
enough  to  warrant  compensation.  Simmons  argued  to  the  Veterans

A  specific  statute  requires  the  Veterans  Court  to  "take due  account  of  the  rule  of  prejudicial  error."  $ 7261(b)(2). 
In applying this statutory provision, the Veterans Court has developed  its  own  special  framework  for  notice  errors. 
Under  this  framework,  a  claimant  who  argues  that  the  VA failed  to  give  proper  notice  must  explain  precisely  how  the 
notice was defective.  Then the reviewing judge  will decide what  "type" of  notice  error  the  VA  committed.  The  Veter-

Opinion of the Court 
lative history confirms that  Congress intended the  Veterans Court  "prejudicial  error"  statute  to  "incorporate  a  refer-

ence"  to  the  APA's  approach.  S.  Rep.  No.  100-418,  p.  61 (1988).  We  have  no  indication  of  any  relevant  distinction 
between  the  manner  in  which  reviewing  courts  treat  civil and administrative cases.  Consequently, we assess the law-
fulness of the Federal Circuit's approach in light of our gen-eral  case  law  governing  application  of  the  harmless-error 
standard.  B 

Three related features of the Federal Circuit's framework, taken  together, convince  us that  it mandates  an approach to 
harmless  error  that  differs  significantly  from  the  approach courts  normally  take  in  ordinary  civil  cases.  First,  the 
framework is complex, rigid, and mandatory.  In every case involving a notice error (of no matter which kind) the Veter-
ans  Court must

found  the  notice  error  harmless.  And  after  reviewing  the record,  we  conclude  that  finding  is  lawful.  The  VA  told 

Sanders what further evidence would be needed to substan-tiate his claim.  It failed to specify what portion of any addi-
tional  evidence  the  Secretary  would  provide  (we  imagine none)  and  what  portion  Sanders  would  have  to  provide  (we 
imagine all). How  could  the  VA's  failure  to  specify  this  (or  any  other) 
division  of  labor  have  mattered?  Sanders  has  pursued  his 
claim for over six decades; he has had numerous medical ex-aminations;  and  he  should  be  aware  of  the  respect  in  which 

his  benefits  claim  is  deficient  (namely,  his  inability  to  show 
that his disability is connected to his World War II service).

sive  is  the  State's  alternative  argument  that  federal  review  is  barred 
because  the  Brady  claim  was properly  dismissed  by  the  state  postcon-
viction  courts  as  waived.  Those  courts  held  only  that  the  claim  had 
been previously determined, and this Court will not second-guess their 
judgment.  Because  the  claim  was  properly  preserved  and  exhausted 
in state court, it is not defaulted.  Pp. 464-469. 

2.  The lower federal courts failed to adequately consider whether the 
withheld documents were material to Cone's sentence.  Both the quan-
tity and quality of the suppressed evidence lend support to Cone's trial 
position  that  he  habitually  used  excessive  amounts  of  drugs,  that  his 
addiction affected his behavior during the murders, and that the State's 
contrary  arguments  were  false  and  misleading.  Nevertheless,  even 
when viewed in the light most favorable to Cone, the evidence does not 
sustain his insanity defense: His behavior before, during, and after the 
crimes  was  inconsistent  with  the  contention  that  he  lacked  substantial 
capacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to con-
form  it  to  the  requirements  of  law.  Because  the  likelihood  that  the 
suppressed evidence would have affected the jury's verdict on the insan-
ity issue is remote, the Sixth Circuit did not err by denying habeas relief 
on  the  ground  that  such  evidence  was  immaterial  to  the  jury's  guilt 
finding.  The same cannot be said of that court's summary treatment of 
Cone's  claim  that  the  suppressed  evidence  would  have  influenced  the 
jury's  sentencing  recommendation.  Because  the  suppressed  evidence 
might have been material to the jury's assessment of the proper punish-
ment,  a  full  review  of  that  evidence  and  its  effect  on  the  sentencing 
verdict is warranted.  Pp. 469-475.

Opinion of the Court 
denied him a hearing on the ground that his Brady claim had been "previously determined," id., at 753 (majority opinion), 

either  on  direct  appeal  from  his  conviction  or  in  earlier  col-lateral proceedings.  On application for a writ of habeas cor-
pus pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, the Federal District Court concluded that the state courts' disposition rested on an ade-
quate  and  independent  state  ground  that  barred  further  re-view in federal court, and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth 
Circuit  agreed.  Doubt  concerning  the  correctness  of  that holding, coupled with conflicting decisions from other Courts 
of Appeals, prompted our  grant  of certiorari.  554 U. S. 916 (2008). 

After  a  complete  review  of  the  trial  and  postconviction proceedings,  we  conclude  that  the  Tennessee  courts'  rejec-
tion  of  petitioner's  Brady  claim  does  not  rest  on  a  ground that  bars  federal  review.  Furthermore,  although  the  Dis-
trict  Court  and  the  Court  of  Appeals  passed  briefly  on  the merits of Cone's claim, neither court distinguished the mate-
riality  of  the  suppressed  evidence  with  respect  to  Cone's guilt from the materiality of the evidence with respect to his 
punishment.  While  we  agree  that  the  withheld  documents were  not  material  to  the  question  whether  Cone  committed 
murder  with  the  requisite  mental  state,  the  lower  courts failed  to  adequately  consider  whether  that  same  evidence 
was  material  to  Cone's  sentence.  Therefore,  we  vacate  the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the 
District  Court  to  determine  in  the  first  instance  whether there  is  a  reasonable  probability  that  the  withheld  evidence 
would  have  altered  at  least  one  juror's  assessment  of  the appropriate penalty for Cone's crimes.

On  the  afternoon  of  Saturday,  August  10,  1980,  Cone robbed  a  jewelry  store  in  downtown  Memphis,  Tennessee. 

Fleeing the scene by car, he led police on a high-speed chase

Opinion of the Court 
into  a  residential  neighborhood.  Once  there,  he  abandoned his  vehicle  and  shot  a  police  officer.

1  When  a  bystander 

tried to impede his escape, Cone shot him, too, before escap-ing on foot. 

A  short  time  later,  Cone  tried  to  hijack  a  nearby  car. When that attempt failed (because the driver refused to sur-
render  his  keys),  Cone  tried  to  shoot  the  driver  and  a  hov-ering  police  helicopter  before  realizing  he  had  run  out  of 
ammunition.  He  then  fled  the  scene.  Although  police  con-ducted a thorough search, Cone was nowhere to be found. 

Early  the  next  morning,  Cone  reappeared  in  the  same neighborhood at the door of an elderly woman.  He asked to 
use  her  telephone,  and  when  she  refused,  he  drew  a  gun. Before  he  was  able  to  gain  entry,  the  woman  slammed  the 
door  and  called  the  police.  By  the  time  officers  arrived, however, Cone had once again disappeared. 

That afternoon, Cone gained entry to the home of 93-year-old  Shipley  Todd  and  his  wife,  79-year-old  Cleopatra  Todd. 
Cone  beat  the  couple  to  death  with  a  blunt  instrument  and ransacked the first floor of their home.  Later, he shaved his 
beard  and  escaped  to  the  airport  without  being  caught. Cone  then  traveled  to  Florida,  where  he  was  arrested  sev-
eral days later after robbing a drugstore in Pompano Beach. A  Tennessee grand  jury charged  Cone with  two counts  of 
first-degree  murder,  two  counts  of  murder  in  the  perpetra-tion of a burglary, three counts of assault with intent to mur-
der, and one count of robbery by use of deadly force.  At his jury  trial  in  1982,  Cone did  not  challenge  the  overwhelming 
physical  and  testimonial  evidence  supporting  the  charges against him.  His sole defense was that he was not guilty by 
reason of insanity. 

1 From  the  abandoned  vehicle,  police  recovered  stolen  jewelry,  large 
quantities  of  illegal  and  prescription  drugs,  and  approximately  $2,400  in 
cash.  Much  of  the  cash  was  later  connected  to  a  grocery  store  robbery 
that had occurred on the previous day.

454  CONE  v.  BELL 

Opinion of the Court 
Cone's  counsel  portrayed  his  client  as  suffering  from  se-vere drug addiction attributable to trauma Cone had experi-

enced  in  Vietnam.  Counsel  argued  that  Cone  had  com-mitted his crimes while suffering from chronic amphetamine 
psychosis, a disorder brought about by his drug abuse.  That defense was  supported  by the  testimony  of three witnesses. 
First was Cone's mother, who described her son as an honor-
ably discharged Vietnam veteran who had changed following his return from service.  She recalled Cone describing "how 

terrible"  it  had  been  to  handle  the  bodies  of  dead  soldiers, and  she  explained  that  Cone  slept  restlessly  and  sometimes 
"holler[ed]"  in  his  sleep.  Tr.  1643-1645  (Apr.  20,  1982). 
She  also  described  one  occasion,  following  Cone's  return 
from  service,  when  a  package  was  shipped  to  him  that  con-
tained  marijuana.  Before  the  war,  she  asserted,  Cone  had 
not used drugs of any kind. 

Two  expert  witnesses  testified  on  Cone's  behalf.  Mat-
thew Jaremko, a clinical psychologist, testified that Cone suf-
fered  from  substance  abuse  and  posttraumatic  stress  disor-
ders  related  to  his  military  service  in  Vietnam.  Jaremko 
testified  that  Cone  had  expressed  remorse  for  the  murders, 
and he opined that Cone's mental disorder rendered him sub-
stantially  incapable  of  conforming  his  conduct  to  the  law. 
Jonathan  Lipman,  a  neuropharmacologist,  recounted  at 
length  Cone's  history  of  illicit  drug  use,  which  began  after 
Cone joined the Army and escalated to the point where Cone 
was  consuming  "rather  horrific"  quantities  of  drugs  daily. 
App.  100.  According  to Lipman, Cone's drug abuse  had led 
to  chronic  amphetamine  psychosis,  a  disorder  manifested 
through  hallucinations  and  ongoing  paranoia  that  prevented 
Cone  from  obeying  the  law  and  appreciating  the  wrongful-
ness of his actions. 

In  rebutting  Cone's  insanity  defense  the  State's  strategy 
throughout trial was to present Cone as a calculating, intelli-
gent  criminal  who  was  fully  in  control  of  his  decisions  and 
actions at the time of the crimes.  A key component of that

Opinion of the Court 
strategy  involved  discrediting  Cone's  claims  of  drug  use.2 
Through  cross-examination,  the  State  established  that  both 
defense experts' opinions were based solely on Cone's repre-
sentations  to  them  about  his  drug  use  rather  than  on  any 
independently corroborated sources, such as medical records 
or  interviews  with  family  or  friends.  The  prosecution  also 
adduced expert and lay testimony to establish that Cone was 
not addicted to drugs and had acted rationally and intention-
ally before, during, and after the Todd murders. 

Particularly  damaging  to  Cone's  defense  was  the  testi-
mony  of  rebuttal  witness  Ilene  Blankman,  who  had  spent 
time  with  Cone  several  months  before  the  murders  and  at 
whose  home  Cone  had  stayed  in  the  days  leading  up  to  his 
arrest  in  Florida.  Blankman  admitted  to  being  a  former 
heroin addict but testified that she no longer used drugs and 
tried  to  stay  away  from  people  who  did.  She  testified  that 
she  had  never  seen  Cone  use  drugs,  had  never  observed 
track  marks  on  his  body,  and  had  never  seen  him  exhibit 
signs of paranoia. 

Emphasizing  the  State's  position  with  respect  to  Cone's 
alleged addiction, the prosecutor told the jury during closing 
argument,  "[Y]ou're  not  dealing  with  a  crazy  person,  an  in-
sane  man.  A  man  .  .  .  out  of  his  mind.  You're  dealing, 
I  submit  to  you,  with  a  premeditated,  cool,  deliberate--and 
even cowardly, really--murderer."  Tr. 2084 (Apr. 22, 1982). 
Pointing  to  the  quantity  of  drugs  found  in  Cone's  car,  the 
prosecutor suggested that far from being a drug addict, Cone 
was actually a drug dealer.  The prosecutor argued, "I'm not 
trying  to  be  absurd,  but  he  says  he's  a  drug  addict.  I  say 

2 The State also cast doubt on Cone's defense by eliciting testimony that 
Cone  had  enrolled  in  college  following  his  return  from  Vietnam  and  had 
graduated  with  high  honors.  Later,  after  serving  time  in  prison  for  an

School.  The State suggested that Cone's academic success provided fur-
ther proof that he was not impaired following his return from war.

The  jury  rejected  Cone's  insanity  defense  and  found  him guilty on all counts.  At the penalty hearing, the prosecution 

asked the jury to find  that Cone's  crime met the criteria  for four  different  statutory  aggravating  factors,  any  one  of 
which  would  render  him  eligible  for  a  capital  sentence.4 Cone's counsel called no witnesses but instead rested on the 
evidence  adduced  during  the  guilt  phase  proceedings.  Ac-knowledging that the prosecution's experts had disputed the 
existence  of  Cone's  alleged  mental  disorder,  counsel  never-theless  urged  the  jury  to  consider  Cone's  drug  addiction 
when weighing the aggravating and mitigating factors in the case.

5  The jury found all four aggravating factors and unan-

imously returned a sentence of death.6 

3 In his closing rebuttal argument, the prosecutor continued to press the 
point, asserting: "There aren't any charges for drug sales, but that doesn't 
mean that you can't look and question in deciding whether or not this man 
was,  in  fact,  a  drug  user,  or  why  he  had  those  drugs.  Did  he  just  have 
those  drugs,  or  did  he  have  those  drugs  and  thousands  of  dollars  in  that 
car?  Among those drugs are there only the drugs he used?  How do we 
know  if  he  used  drugs?  The  only  thing  that  we  ever  had  that  he  used 
drugs,  period,  is  the  fact  that  those  drugs  were  in  the  car  and  what  he 
told  people.  What  he  told  people.  But  according  to  even  what  he  told 
people,  there  are  drugs  in  there  he  didn't  even  use."  Tr.  2068  (Apr.  22, 
1982). 

4 The jury could impose a capital sentence only if it unanimously deter-

mined  that  one  or  more  statutory  aggravating  circumstances  had  been 
proved  by  the  State  beyond  a  reasonable  doubt,  and  that  the  mitigating 
circumstances of the case did not outweigh any statutory aggravating fac-
tors.  Tenn. Code Ann. $ 39-2-203(g) (1982). 

5 As  defense  counsel  emphasized  to  the  jury,  one  of  the  statutory  miti-

gating  factors  it  was  required  to  consider  was  whether  "[t]he  capacity  of 
the defendant to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform 
his  conduct to  the requirements of the law was  substantially impaired as 
a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication which was insufficient 
to  establish  a  defense  to  the  crime  but  which  substantially  affected  his 
judgment."  $ 39-2-203(j)(8). 

6 Specifically, the jury found Cone had committed one or more prior fel-

onies involving the use or threat of violence, see $ 39-2-203(i)(2); the mur-

Opinion of the Court 

II 
On  direct  appeal  Cone  raised  numerous  challenges  to  his conviction and sentence.  Among those was a claim that the 

prosecution  violated  state  law  by  failing  to  disclose  a  tape-recorded  statement  and  police  reports  relating  to  several 
trial  witnesses.  See  id.,  at  114-117.  The  Tennessee  Su-preme Court rejected each of Cone's claims, and affirmed his 
conviction  and  sentence.  State  v.  Cone,  665  S.  W.  2d  87 
(1984).7  Cone  then  filed  a  petition  for  postconviction  relief, primarily raising claims that his  trial counsel had been inef-

fective;  the  Tennessee  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  affirmed 
the  denial of  that petition  in 1987.  Cone  v.  State,  747  S. W. 2d 353. 

In  1989,  Cone,  acting  pro  se,  filed  a  second  petition  for postconviction relief, raising myriad claims of error.  Among 
these  was  a  claim  that  the  State  had  failed  to  disclose  evi-dence in violation of his rights under the United States Con-

ders had been committed for the purpose of avoiding, interfering with, or 
preventing  Cone's  lawful  arrest  or  prosecution,  see  $ 39-2-203(i)(6);  the 
murders were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that they involved 
torture  and  depravity  of  mind,  see  $ 39-2-203(i)(5);  and  Cone  had  know-
ingly created a risk of death to two or more persons, other than the victim 
murdered, during his act of murder, see $ 39-2-203(i)(3).  The Tennessee 
Supreme  Court  later  observed  that  by  finding  Cone  guilty  of  murder  in 
the first degree during the perpetration of  a burglary,  the jury implicitly 
found the existence of an additional statutory aggravating factor: that the 
murders occurred while Cone was committing a burglary, $ 39-2-203(i)(7). 
State v.  Cone, 665 S. W. 2d 87, 94 (1984). 

7 In  summarizing  the  trial  proceedings  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court 

observed: "The only defense interposed on [Cone's] behalf was that of in-
sanity, or lack of mental capacity, due to drug abuse and to stress arising 
out of his previous service in the Vietnamese war, some eleven years prior 
to the events involved in this case.  This proved to be a tenuous defense, 
at  best,  since  neither  of  the  expert  witnesses  who  testified  on  his  behalf 
had ever seen or heard of  him until a few weeks prior to the trial.  Nei-
ther  was  a  medical  doctor  or  psychiatrist,  and  neither  had  purported  to 
treat  him  as  a  patient.  Their  testimony  that  he  lacked  mental  capacity 
was  based  purely  upon  his  personal  recitation  to  them  of  his  history  of 
military service and drug abuse."  Id., at 90.

stitution.  At  the  State's  behest,  the  postconviction  court summarily denied the petition, concluding that all the claims 

raised  in  it  had  either  been  "previously  determined"  or "waived."  Order  Dismissing  Petition  for  Post-Conviction 
Relief  in  Cone  v.  State,  No.  P-06874  (Crim.  Ct.  Shelby  Cty., Tenn., Jan. 2, 1990).

8  At that time, the court did not specify 

which claims fell into which category. Cone  appealed  the  denial  of  his  petition  to  the  Tennessee 

Court of Criminal Appeals, asserting that the postconviction court  had  erred  by  dismissing  13  claims--his 

Brady  claim among  them--as  previously  determined  when,  in  fact,  they 

had  not  been  "previously  addressed  or  determined  by  any court."  Brief  for  Petitioner-Appellant  in  No.  P-06874, 
pp.  23-24,  and  n.  11.  In  addition  Cone  urged  the  court  to remand the case to allow him, with the assistance of counsel, 
to  rebut  the  presumption  that  he  had  waived  any  of  his claims  by  not  raising  them  at  an  earlier  stage  in  the  litiga-
tion.  Id.,  at  24.9  The  court  agreed and  remanded the  case for further proceedings. 

On  remand  counsel  was  appointed,  and  an  amended  peti-tion  was  filed.  The  State  once  again  urged  the  postconvic-

entitled to collateral relief if his conviction or sentence violated "any right 
guaranteed  by  the  constitution  of  [Tennessee]  or  the  Constitution  of  the 
United  States."  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  $ 40-30-105  (1982);  see  also  $ 40-30- 
102.  Any hearing on a petition for postconviction relief was limited, how-
ever, to claims that had not been "waived or previously determined."  See 

$ 40-30-111.  A ground for relief was "previously determined" if "a court 
of  competent  jurisdiction  ha[d]  ruled  on  the  merits  [of  the  claim]  after 
a  full  and  fair  hearing."  $ 40-30-112(a).  The  claim  was  waived  "if  the 
petitioner knowingly and understandingly failed to present it for determi-
nation in any proceeding before a court of competent jurisdiction in which 
the ground could have been presented."  $ 40-30-112(b)(1).

Opinion of the Court 
tion court to dismiss Cone's petition.  Apparently conflating the  state-law  disclosure  claim  Cone  had  raised  on  direct  ap-

peal with his newly filed Brady claim, the State represented that  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  had  already  decided  the 
Brady issue and that Cone was therefore barred from reliti-gating it.  See App. 15-16. 

While  that  petition  remained  pending  before  the  postcon-v
iction  court,  the  Tennessee  Court  of  Appeals  held  for  the first time that the State's Public Records Act allowed a crim-

inal  defendant  to  review  the  prosecutor's  file  in  his  case. See 

Capital Case Resource Center of Tenn., Inc. v.  Woodall, 
No.  01-A-019104CH00150,  1992  WL  12217  (Jan.  29,  1992). 
Based on  that holding, Cone obtained access  to the  prosecu-
tor's  files,  in  which  he  found  proof  that  evidence  had  indeed 
been  withheld  from  him  at  trial.  Among  the  undisclosed 
documents Cone discovered were statements from witnesses 
who had seen him several days before and several days after 
the  murders.  The  witnesses  described  Cone's  appearance 
as  "wild  eyed,"  App.  50,  and  his  behavior  as  "real  weird," 
id., at 49.  One witness affirmed that Cone had appeared "to 
be  drunk  or  high."  Ibid.  The  file  also  contained  a  police 
report describing Cone's arrest in Florida following the mur-
ders.  In that report, a police officer described Cone looking 
around "in a frenzied manner," and "walking in [an] agitated 
manner" prior to his apprehension.  Id., at 53.  Multiple po-
lice bulletins describing Cone as a "drug user" and a "heavy 
drug  user"  were  also  among  the  undisclosed  evidence.  See 
id., at 55-59. 

With  the  newly  discovered  evidence  in  hand,  Cone 
amended  his  postconviction  petition  once  again  in  October 
1993,  expanding  his  Brady  claim  to  allege  more  specifically 
that  the  State  had  withheld  exculpatory  evidence  demon-
strating that he "did in fact suffer drug problems and/or drug 
withdrawal  or  psychosis  both  at  the  time  of  the  offense  and 
in  the  past."  App.  20.  Cone  pointed  to  specific  examples 
of  evidence  that  had  been  withheld,  alleging  the  evidence

Opinion of the Court 
was  "exculpatory  to  both  the  jury's  determination  of  peti-tioner's  guilt  and  its  consideration  of  the  proper  sentence," 

and  that  there  was  "a  reasonable  probability  that,  had  the evidence  not  been  withheld,  the  jurors  would  not  have  con-
victed  [him]  and  would  not  have  sentenced  him  to  death." 
Id.,  at  20-21.10  In  a  lengthy  affidavit  submitted  with  his amended petition, Cone explained that he had not raised his 

Brady  claim  in  earlier  proceedings  because  the  facts  under-lying it "ha[d] been revealed through disclosure of the State's 
files,  which  occurred  after  the  first  post-conviction  proceed-ing."  App. 18. 

After  denying  Cone's  request  for  an  evidentiary  hearing, the  postconviction  court  denied  relief  on  each  claim  pre-
sented  in  the  amended  petition.  Many  of  the  claims  were dismissed  on  the  ground  that  they  had  been  waived  by 
Cone's failure to raise them in earlier proceedings; however, consistent  with  the  position  urged  by  the  State,  the  court 
dismissed  many  others,  including  the  Brady  claim,  as  mere "re-statements  of  previous  grounds  heretofore  determined 
and  denied  by  the  Tennessee  Supreme  Court  upon  Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon the First Peti-
tion."  App. 22. Noting  that  "the  findings  of  the  trial  court  in  post-
conviction  hearings  are  conclusive  on  appeal  unless  the  evi-dence  preponderates  against  the  judgment,"  the  Tennessee 
Court  of  Criminal  Appeals  affirmed.  Cone  v.  State,  927 S. W. 2d 579, 581-582 (1995).  The court concluded that Cone 
had  "failed  to  rebut  the  presumption  of  waiver  as  to  all claims raised in  his second petition for post-conviction relief 
which  had  not  been  previously  determined."  Id.,  at  582 (emphasis  added).  Cone  unsuccessfully  petitioned  for  re-

view in the Tennessee Supreme Court, and we denied certio-
rari.  Cone  v.  Tennessee, 519 U. S. 934 (1996). 

III 
In  1997,  Cone  filed  a  petition  for  a  federal  writ  of  habeas 
corpus.  Without  disclosing  to  the  District  Court  the  con-
trary  position  it  had  taken  in  the  state-court  proceedings, 
the  State  acknowledged  that  Cone's  Brady  claim  had  not 
been  raised  prior  to  the  filing  of  his  second  postconviction 
petition.  However,  wrenching  out  of  context  the  state  ap-
pellate court's holding  that Cone had "waived `all claims . . . 
which had not  been  previously  determined,' " the  State now 
asserted  the  Brady  claim  had  been  waived.  App.  39  (quot-
ing Cone, 927 S. W. 2d, at 582). 

In May 1998, the District Court denied Cone's request for 
an evidentiary hearing on his Brady claim.  Lamenting that 
its consideration of Cone's claims had been "made more diffi-
cult" by the parties' failure to articulate the state procedural 
rules  under  which  each  of  Cone's  claims  had  allegedly  been 
defaulted, App. to Pet. for Cert. 98a, the District Court nev-
ertheless held that the Brady claim was procedurally barred. 
After  parsing the  claim into 11 separate subclaims  based on 
11  pieces  of  withheld  evidence  identified  in  the  habeas  peti-
tion, the District Court concluded that Cone had waived each 
subclaim  by  failing  to  present  or  adequately  develop  it  in 
state  court.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  112a-113a.  Moreover, 
the  court  concluded  that  even  if  Cone  had  not  defaulted  his 
Brady  claim,  it  would  fail  on  its  merits  because  none  of  the 
withheld  evidence  would  have  cast  doubt  on  Cone's  guilt. 
App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  116a-119a.  Throughout  its  opinion 
the  District  Court  repeatedly  referenced  factual  allegations 
contained in early versions of Cone's second petition for post-
conviction relief rather than the amended version of the peti-
tion  upon  which  the  state  court's  decision  had  rested.  See, 
e. g., id., at 112a.

462  CONE  v.  BELL 

Opinion of the Court 
After the District Court dismissed the remainder of Cone's 
federal  claims,  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Sixth  Circuit 
granted  him  permission  to  appeal  several  issues,  including 
the  alleged  suppression  of  Brady  material.  Before  the 
Court  of  Appeals,  the  State  shifted  its  procedural  default 
argument  once  more,  this  time  contending  that  Cone  had 
"simply never  raised" his Brady claim in the state court be-
cause  he  failed  to  make  adequate  factual  allegations  to  sup-
port  that  claim  in  his  second  petition  for  postconviction 
relief.  App.  41.  Repeating  the  District  Court's  error,  the 
State  directed  the  Court  of  Appeals'  attention  to  Cone's 
pro se petition and to the petition Cone's counsel filed before 
he gained access to the prosecution's case file.  Id., at 41-42, 
and n. 7.  In other words, instead of citing the October 1993 
amended  petition  on  which  the  state  court's  decision  had 
been  based  and  to  which  its  order  explicitly  referred,  the 
State pointed the court to earlier, less developed versions of 
the same claim. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  concluded  that  Cone  had  procedur-
ally  defaulted  his  Brady  claim  and  had  failed  to  show  cause 
and  prejudice  to  overcome  the  default.  Cone  v.  Bell,  243 
F.  3d  961,  968  (2001).  The  court  acknowledged  that  Cone 
had  raised  his  Brady  claim.  243  F.  3d,  at  969.  Neverthe-
less,  the  court  considered  itself  barred  from  reaching  the 
merits  of  the  claim  because  the  Tennessee  courts  had  con-
cluded  the  claim  was  "previously  determined  or  waived 
under Tenn. Code Ann. $ 40-30-112."  Ibid. 

Briefly  mentioning  several  isolated  pieces  of  suppressed 
evidence, the  court summarily concluded that even if Cone's 
Brady claim had not been defaulted, the suppressed evidence 
would  not  undermine  confidence  in  the  verdict  (and  hence 
was  not  Brady  material)  "because  of  the  overwhelming  evi-
dence  of  Cone's  guilt."  243  F.  3d,  at  968,  969.  The  court 
did not discuss whether any of the undisclosed evidence was 
material with respect to Cone's sentencing proceedings.

Opinion of the Court 
Although  the  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  Cone's  Brady claim, it held that he was entitled to have his death sentence 

vacated because of his counsel's ineffective assistance at sen-tencing.  See 243 F. 3d, at 975.  In 2002, this Court reversed 
that  holding  after  concluding  that  the  Tennessee  courts'  re-jection  of  Cone's  ineffective-assistance-of-counsel  claim  was 
not  "objectively  unreasonable"  within  the  meaning  of  the 
Antiterrorism  and  Effective  Death  Penalty  Act  of  1996 (AEDPA).  See 

Bell v.  Cone, 535 U. S. 685, 699. 
In 2004, following our remand, the Court of Appeals again entered  judgment  ordering  a  new  sentencing  hearing,  this 

time based on the purported invalidity of an aggravating cir-cumstance  found  by  the  jury. 

Cone  v.  Bell,  359  F.  3d  785. 
Again we granted certiorari and reversed, relying in part on the  deferential  standard  that  governs  our  review  of  state-

court  decisions  under  AEDPA.  See  Bell  v.  Cone,  543  U. S. 447, 452-458 (2005) 

(per curiam). 
Following our second remand, the Court of Appeals revis-
ited  Cone's  Brady  claim.  This  time,  the  court  divided  the 
claim  into  four  separate  subclaims:  "(1)  evidence  regarding 
[Cone's] drug use; (2) evidence that might have been useful to 
impeach the testimony and credibility of prosecution witness 
Sergeant  Ralph  Roby;  (3)  FBI  reports;[11]  and  (4)  evidence 
showing  that  prosecution  witness  Ilene  Blankman  was  un-
truthful and biased."  492 F. 3d, at 753.  Noting that it had 
previously  found  all  four  subclaims  to  be  procedurally  de-
faulted,  the  court  declined  to  reconsider  its  earlier  decision. 
See  ibid.  (citing  Cone,  243  F.  3d,  at  968-970).  At  the  same 
time, the court reiterated that the withheld evidence "would

to  files  from  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  where  he  found  addi-
tional previously undisclosed evidence not contained in the state prosecu-
tor's  case  file.  The suppressed  FBI  documents make repeated reference 
to  Cone's  drug  use  and  corroborate  his  expert's  representation  that  he 
had  used  drugs  during  his  prior  incarceration  for  armed  robbery.  See 
App. 26-28.

not  have  overcome  the  overwhelming  evidence  of  Cone's guilt  in  committing  a  brutal  double  murder  and  the  persua-

sive  testimony  that  Cone  was  not  under  the  influence  of drugs."  492  F.  3d,  at  756.  Summarily  discounting  Cone's 
contention that the withheld evidence was material with re-spect to his sentence, the  court concluded that the introduc-
tion  of  the  suppressed  evidence  would  not  have  altered  the jurors'  finding  that  Cone's  alleged  drug  use  did  not  "vitiate 
his specific intent to murder his victims and did not mitigate his  culpability  sufficient  to  avoid  the  death  sentence." 

Id., at 757. 

Judge  Merritt  dissented.  He  castigated  the  State  not only  for  withholding  documents  relevant  to  Cone's  sole  de-
fense and plea for mitigation, but also for its "falsification of the  procedural  record  .  .  .  concerning  the  State's  procedural 
default defense to the Brady claim."  Id., at 760.  Over the dissent of seven judges, Cone's petition for rehearing en banc 
was denied.  505 F. 3d 610 (2007). We  granted  certiorari  to  answer  the  question  whether  a 
federal habeas claim is " `procedurally defaulted' " when it is twice presented to the state courts.  Pet. for Cert. i. 

IV 
During the state and federal proceedings below, the State of  Tennessee  offered  two different  justifications  for  denying 

review  of  the  merits  of  Cone's  Brady  claim.  First,  in  con-nection  with  Cone's  amended  petition  for  state  postconvic-
tion relief, the State argued that the Brady claim was barred because it had been decided on direct appeal.  See App. 15- 
16.  Then, in connection with Cone's federal habeas petition, the  State  argued  that  Cone's  claim  was  waived  because  it 
had never been properly raised before the state courts.  See 
id.,  at  39.  The  District  Court  and  the  Court  of  Appeals agreed  that  Cone's  claim  was  procedurally  barred,  but  for 

different  reasons.  The  District  Court  held  that  the  claim

Opinion of the Court 
had been waived, App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a, while the Court 
of  Appeals  held  that  the  claim  had  been  either  waived  or 
previously  determined,  Cone,  243  F.  3d,  at  969.  We  now 
conclude  that  neither  prior  determination  nor  waiver  pro-
vides an independent and adequate state ground for denying 
Cone review of his federal claim. 

It  is  well  established  that  federal  courts  will  not  review 
questions of federal law presented in a habeas petition when 
the state court's decision rests upon a state-law ground that 
"is independent of the federal question and adequate to sup-
port  the  judgment."  Coleman  v.  Thompson,  501  U. S.  722, 
729  (1991);  Lee  v.  Kemna,  534  U. S.  362,  375  (2002).  In  the 
context  of  federal  habeas  proceedings,  the  independent  and 
adequate state ground doctrine is designed to "ensur[e] that 
the  States'  interest  in  correcting  their  own  mistakes  is  re-
spected in all federal habeas cases."  Coleman, 501 U. S., at 
732.  When  a  petitioner  fails  to  properly  raise  his  federal 
claims  in  state  court,  he  deprives  the  State  of  "an  opportu-
nity  to  address  those  claims  in  the  first  instance"  and  frus-
trates  the  State's  ability  to  honor  his  constitutional  rights. 
Id., at 732, 748.  Therefore, consistent with the longstanding 
requirement  that  habeas  petitioners  must  exhaust  available 
state remedies before seeking relief in federal court, we have 
held  that  when  a  petitioner  fails  to  raise  his  federal  claims 
in compliance with relevant state procedural rules, the state 
court's refusal  to adjudicate  the  claim ordinarily  qualifies as 
an  independent  and  adequate  state  ground  for  denying  fed-
eral review.  See id., at 731. 

That  does  not  mean,  however,  that  federal  habeas  review 
is barred every  time a state court invokes a procedural rule 
to limit its review of a state prisoner's claims.  We have rec-
ognized that " `[t]he adequacy of state procedural bars to the 
assertion  of  federal  questions' . . . is  not  within  the  State's 
prerogative finally to decide; rather, adequacy `is itself a fed-
eral  question.' "  Lee,  534  U. S.,  at  375  (quoting  Douglas  v.

Opinion of the Court 
Alabama,  380  U. S.  415,  422  (1965));  see  also  Coleman,  501 U. S.,  at  736  ("[F]ederal  habeas  courts  must  ascertain  for 

themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on independent and adequate state 
grounds").  The  question  before  us  now  is  whether  federal review  of  Cone's 

Brady  claim  is  procedurally  barred  either 
because the claim was twice presented to the state courts or 
because it was waived, and thus not presented at all. First, we address the contention that the repeated presen-

tation  of  a  claim  in  state  court  bars  later  federal  review. The  Tennessee  postconviction  court  denied  Cone's 

Brady 
claim after concluding it had been previously determined fol-
lowing a full and fair hearing in state court.  See Tenn. Code 
Ann.  $ 40-30-112(a).  That  conclusion  rested  on  a  false 
premise: Contrary to the  state  courts'  finding, Cone had not 
presented his Brady claim in earlier proceedings, and, conse-
quently,  the  state  courts  had  not  passed  on  it.  The  Sixth 
Circuit recognized that Cone's Brady claim had not been de-
cided  on  direct  appeal,  see  Cone,  243  F.  3d,  at  969,  but  felt 
constrained by the state courts' refusal to reach the merits of 
that  claim  on  postconviction  review.  The  Court  of  Appeals 
concluded  that  because  the  state  postconviction  courts  had 
applied  a  state  procedural  law  to  avoid  reaching  the  merits 
of Cone's Brady claim, "an  `independent and adequate' state 
ground"  barred  federal  habeas  review.  243  F.  3d,  at  969. 
In  this  Court  the  State  does  not  defend  that  aspect  of  the 
Court of Appeals' holding, and rightly so. 

When a state court declines to review the merits of a peti-
tioner's  claim  on  the  ground  that  it  has  done  so  already,  it 
creates no bar to federal habeas review.  In Ylst v.  Nunnem-
aker,  501  U. S.  797,  804,  n.  3  (1991),  we  observed  in  passing 
that  when  a  state  court  declines  to  revisit  a  claim  it  has  al-
ready  adjudicated,  the  effect  of  the  later  decision  upon  the 
availability  of  federal  habeas  is  "nil"  because  "a  later  state 
decision based upon ineligibility for further state review nei-
ther  rests  upon  procedural  default  nor  lifts  a  pre-existing

Opinion of the Court 
procedural  default." 12  When  a  state  court  refuses  to  read-judicate  a  claim  on  the  ground  that  it  has  been  previously 

determined,  the  court's  decision  does  not  indicate  that  the claim  has  been  procedurally  defaulted.  To  the  contrary,  it 
provides  strong  evidence  that  the  claim  has  already  been given  full  consideration  by  the  state  courts  and  thus  is 

ripe for federal adjudication.  See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A) (per-

mitting  issuance  of  a  writ  of  habeas  corpus  only  after  "the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts 
of the State"). A claim is procedurally barred when it has not been fairly 
presented to the state courts for their initial consideration-- not when the claim has been presented more than once.  Ac-
cordingly,  insofar  as  the  Court  of  Appeals  rejected  Cone's Brady claim as procedurally defaulted because the claim had 
been  twice  presented  to  the  Tennessee  courts,  its  decision 
was erroneous. As  an  alternative  (and  contradictory)  ground  for  barring 

review  of  Cone's  Brady  claim,  the  State  has  argued  that Cone's claim was properly dismissed by the state postconvic-
tion  court  on  the  ground  it  had  been  waived.  We  are  not persuaded.  The state appellate court affirmed the denial of 
Cone's Brady claim on the same mistaken ground offered by the  lower  court--that  the  claim  had  been  previously  deter-
mined.13  Contrary  to  the  State's  assertion,  the  Tennessee 

12 With the exception of the Sixth Circuit, all Courts of Appeals to have 
directly confronted the question both before and after Ylst, 501 U. S. 797, 
have  agreed  that  a  state  court's  successive  rejection  of  a  federal  claim 
does  not  bar  federal  habeas  review.  See,  e. g.,  Page  v.  Frank,  343  F.  3d 
901,  907  (CA7  2003);  Brecheen  v.  Reynolds,  41  F.  3d  1343,  1358  (CA10 
1994);  Bennett  v.  Whitley,  41  F.  3d  1581,  1582  (CA5  1994);  Silverstein  v. 
Henderson, 706 F. 2d 361, 368 (CA2 1983).  See also Lambright v. Stewart, 
241 F. 3d 1201, 1206 (CA9 2001). 

13 As  recounted  earlier,  Cone's  state  postconviction  petition  contained 

numerous claims of error.  The state postconviction court dismissed some 
of those claims as waived and others, including the Brady claim, as having 
been  previously  determined.  In  affirming  the  denial  of  Cone's  petition

Opinion of the Court 
appellate  court  did  not  hold  that  Cone's  Brady  claim  was waived. 

When  a  state  court  declines  to  find  that  a  claim  has  been waived by a petitioner's alleged failure to comply with state 
procedural  rules,  our  respect  for  the  state-court  judgment counsels us to do the same.  Although we have an independ-
ent  duty to  scrutinize the  application  of state  rules that  bar our  review  of  federal  claims, 

Lee,  534  U. S.,  at  375,  we  have no  concomitant  duty  to  apply  state  procedural  bars  where 

the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals summarily stated that Cone had 
"failed  to  rebut  the  presumption  of  waiver  as  to  all  claims  raised  in  his 
second  petition  for  post-conviction  relief  which  had  not  been  previously 
determined."  Cone  v.  State,  927  S.  W.  2d  579,  582  (1995).  Pointing  to 
that  language,  the  State  asserts  that  the  Tennessee  Court  of  Criminal 
Appeals  denied  Cone's  Brady  claim  not  because  it  had  been  previously 
determined,  but  because  it  was  waived  in  the  postconviction  court  pro-
ceedings.  Not  so.  Without  questioning  the  trial  court's  finding  that 
Cone's Brady claim  had been previously determined, the Court of Crimi-
nal  Appeals  affirmed  the  denial  of  Cone's  postconviction  petition  in  its 
entirety.  Nothing  in  that  decision  suggests  the  appellate  court  believed 
the Brady claim had been waived in the court below. 

Similarly,  while  Justice

Opinion of the Court 
state courts have themselves declined to do so.  The Tennes-see  courts  did  not  hold  that  Cone  waived  his  Brady  claim, 

and we will not second-guess their judgment.14 The  State's procedural  objections  to  federal  review  of  the 
merits  of  Cone's  claim  have  resulted  in  a  significant  delay in  bringing  this  unusually  protracted  case  to  a  conclusion. 
Ultimately, however, they provide no obstacle to judicial re-view.  Cone  properly  preserved  and  exhausted  his 

Brady claim  in  the  state  court;  therefore,  it  is  not  defaulted.  We 

turn now to the merits of that claim. 

V 
Although  the  State  is  obliged  to  "prosecute  with  earnest-ness and vigor," it  "is  as much [its] duty  to refrain  from im-

proper methods calculated to  produce  a wrongful  conviction as  it  is  to  use  every  legitimate  means  to  bring  about  a  just 
one."  Berger,  295  U. S.,  at  88.  Accordingly,  we  have  held that when the State withholds from a criminal defendant evi-
dence  that is  material to  his  guilt or  punishment,  it  violates his right to due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth 
Amendment.  See Brady, 373 U. S., at 87.  In United States v.  Bagley, 473  U. S. 667, 682 (1985) (opinion of Blackmun, J.), 

we explained that evidence is "material" within the meaning 

14 Setting aside the state courts' mistaken belief that Cone's Brady claim 
had been previously determined, there are many reasons the state courts 
might have rejected the State's waiver argument.  The record establishes 
that the suppressed documents which form the basis for Cone's claim were 
not  available  to  him  until  the  Tennessee  Court  of  Appeals'  1992  decision 
interpreting  the State's  Public  Records Act  as  authorizing  the  disclosure 
of prosecutorial  records.  Soon after obtaining  access to  the prosecutor's 
file and discovering within it documents that had not been disclosed prior 
to  trial,  Cone  amended  his  petition  for  postconviction  relief,  adding  de-
tailed  allegations  regarding  the  suppressed  evidence  recovered  from  the 
file,  along  with  an  affidavit  explaining  the  reason  why  his  claim  had  not 
been filed sooner.  See App. 13, 18.  The State did not oppose the amend-
ment of Cone's petition on the ground that it was untimely, and it appears 
undisputed that there would have been no basis under state law for doing 
so.  See Brief for Petitioner 7, n. 1.

of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence  been  disclosed,  the  result  of  the  proceeding  would 

have  been  different.  In  other  words,  favorable  evidence  is subject  to  constitutionally  mandated  disclosure  when  it 
"could  reasonably  be  taken  to  put  the  whole  case  in  such  a different  light  as  to  undermine  confidence  in  the  verdict."

The  documents  suppressed  by the  State  vary  in  kind,  but they  share  a  common  feature:  Each  strengthens  the  infer-

ence that Cone was impaired by his use of drugs around the time  his  crimes  were  committed.  The  suppressed  evidence 
includes  statements  by  witnesses  acknowledging  that  Cone appeared to be "drunk or high," App. 49, "acted real weird," 
ibid., and "looked wild eyed," id., at 50, in the two days pre-ceding the murders.

16  It also includes documents that could 

15 Although  the  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  as 
interpreted by Brady, only mandates  the disclosure of  material evidence, 
the obligation to disclose evidence favorable to the defense may arise more 
broadly under a prosecutor's ethical or statutory obligations.  See Kyles, 
514 U. S., at 437 ("[T]he rule in Bagley (and, hence, in Brady) requires less 
of the prosecution than the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice . . . .  See 
. . . Prosecution  Function and  Defense Function  3-3.11(a) (3d ed. 1993)"). 
See  also  ABA  Model  Rule  of  Professional  Conduct  3.8(d)  (2008)  ("The 
prosecutor in a criminal case shall" "make timely disclosure to the defense 
of all evidence or information known to the prosecutor that tends to negate 
the  guilt  of  the  accused  or  mitigates  the  offense,  and,  in  connection  with 
sentencing,  disclose  to  the  defense  and  to  the  tribunal  all  unprivileged 
mitigating information known to the prosecutor, except when the prosecu-
tor is relieved of this responsibility by a protective order of the tribunal"). 
As we have often observed, the prudent prosecutor will err on the side of 
transparency,  resolving  doubtful  questions  in  favor  of  disclosure.  See

Opinion of the Court 
have  been  used  to  impeach  witnesses  whose  trial  testimony 
cast doubt on Cone's drug addiction.  For example, Memphis 
police  officer  Ralph  Roby  testified  at  trial  that  Cone  had  no 
needle  marks  on  his  body  when  he  was  arrested--an  obser-
vation  that  bolstered  the  State's  argument  that  Cone  was 
not a drug user.  The suppressed evidence reveals, however, 
that  Roby authorized  multiple teletypes  to law  enforcement 
agencies  in  the  days  following  the  murders  in  which  he  de-
scribed Cone as a "drug user" and a "heavy drug user."  See 
id.,  at  55-58.17  A  suppressed  statement  made  by  the  chief 
of police of Cone's hometown also describes Cone as a serious 
drug  user.  See  Cone,  243  F.  3d,  at  968.  And  undisclosed 
notes  of  a  police  interview  with  Ilene  Blankman  conducted 
several days after the murders reveal discrepancies between 
her  initial  statement  and  her  trial  testimony  relevant  to 
Cone's  alleged  drug  use.  App.  72-73.  In  sum,  both  the 
quantity  and  the  quality  of  the  suppressed  evidence  lends 
support  to  Cone's  position  at  trial  that  he  habitually  used 
excessive  amounts  of  drugs,  that  his  addiction  affected  his 
behavior  during  his  crime  spree,  and  that  the  State's  argu-
ments to the contrary were false and misleading. 

Brief for Respondent 46.  Although a jury would have been free to infer 
that Cone's behavior was attributable to his criminal activity, the evidence 
is also consistent with Cone's assertion that he was suffering from chronic 
amphetamine psychosis at the time of the crimes. 

17 As the dissent points out, Roby did not testify directly that Cone was 

not a drug user, and FBI Agent Eugene Flynn testified that, at the time of 
Cone's arrest in Pompano Beach, Cone reported that he had used cocaine, 
Dilaudid, and Demerol and was suffering from " `slight withdrawal symp-
toms.' "  See  post,  at  492-493,  496  (opinion  of  Thomas,

Opinion of the Court 
Thus, the federal question that must be decided is whether the suppression of that probative evidence deprived Cone of 

his  right  to  a  fair  trial.  See  Agurs,  427  U. S.,  at  108.  Be-cause the Tennessee courts did not reach the merits of Cone's 
Brady claim, federal habeas review is not subject to the def-erential  standard  that  applies  under  AEDPA  to  "any  claim 
that  was  adjudicated  on  the  merits  in  State  court  proceed-ings."  28 U. S. C. $ 2254(d).  Instead, the  claim is  reviewed 
de  novo.  See,  e. g.,  Rompilla  v.  Beard,  545  U. S.  374,  390 (2005) (

de novo review where state courts did not reach prej-udice  prong  under  Strickland  v.  Washington,  466  U. S.  668 

(1984));  Wiggins  v.  Smith,  539  U. S.  510,  534  (2003)  (same). Contending  that  the  Federal  District  Court  and  Court  of 
Appeals adequately and correctly resolved the merits of that claim, the  State  urges us  to  affirm the  Sixth  Circuit's  denial 
of  habeas  relief.  In  assessing  the  materiality  of  the  evi-dence  suppressed  by  the  State,  the  Court  of  Appeals  sug-
gested  that  two  facts  outweighed  the  potential  force  of  the suppressed  evidence.  First,  the  evidence  of  Cone's  guilt 
was overwhelming.  Second, the evidence of Cone's drug use was  cumulative  because  the  jury  had  heard  evidence  of 
Cone's  alleged  addiction  from  witnesses  and  from  officers who  interviewed  Cone  and  recovered  drugs  from  his  vehi-
cle.18  The  Court  of  Appeals  did  not  thoroughly  review  the suppressed  evidence  or  consider  what  its  cumulative  effect 
on the jury would have  been.  Moreover, in  concluding that the  suppressed  evidence  was  not  material  within  the  mean-
ing of Brady, the court did not distinguish between the mate-riality of the evidence with respect to guilt and the material-
ity of the evidence with respect to punishment--an omission we find significant. 

18 In pointing to the trial evidence of Cone's drug use, the Court of Ap-
peals made no mention of the fact that the State had discredited the testi-
mony of  Cone's  experts on  the  ground that no  independent  evidence cor-
roborated Cone's alleged addiction and that the State had argued that the 
drugs in Cone's car were intended for resale, rather than personal use.

Opinion of the Court 
Evidence  that  is  material  to  guilt  will  often  be  material for  sentencing  purposes  as  well;  the  converse  is  not  always 

true, however, as Brady itself demonstrates.  In our seminal case  on  the  disclosure  of  prosecutorial  evidence,  defendant 
John  Brady  was  indicted  for  robbery  and  capital  murder. At  trial,  Brady  took  the  stand  and  confessed  to  robbing  the 
victim and being present at the murder but testified that his 
accomplice had actually strangled the victim.  Brady v. 
State,  226  Md.  422,  425,  174  A.  2d  167,  168  (1961).  After 
Brady  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to  death  he  discovered that  the  State  had  suppressed  the  confession  of  his  accom-

plice,  which  included  incriminating  statements  consistent 
with  Brady's  version  of  events.  Id.,  at  426,  174  A.  2d,  at 
169.  The Maryland Court of Appeals concluded that Brady's 
due  process  rights  were  violated  by  the  suppression  of  the 
accomplice's  confession  but  declined  to  order  a  new  trial  on 
guilt.  Observing that nothing in the accomplice's confession 
"could have reduced . . . Brady's offense below murder in the 
first degree," the state court ordered a new trial on the ques-
tion of punishment only.  Id., at 430, 174 A. 2d,  at 171.  We 
granted certiorari and affirmed, rejecting Brady's contention 
that  the  state  court's  limited  remand  violated  his  constitu-
tional rights.  373 U. S., at 88. 

As in Brady, the distinction between the materiality of the 
suppressed evidence with respect to guilt and punishment is 
significant  in  this  case.  During  the  guilt  phase  of  Cone's 
trial,  the  only  dispute  was  whether  Cone  was  "sane  under 
the  law,"  Tr.  2040  (Apr.  22,  1982),  as  his  counsel  described 
the  issue,  or  "criminally  responsible"  for  his  conduct,  App. 
110,  as  the  prosecutor  argued.  Under  Tennessee  law,  Cone 
could  not  be  held  criminally  responsible  for  the  murders  if, 
"at the time  of [his] conduct as a result of mental disease or 
defect  he  lack[ed]  substantial  capacity  either  to  appreciate 
the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to 
the  requirements  of  law."  Graham  v.  State,  547  S.  W.  2d 
531,  543  (Tenn.  1977).  Although  we  take  exception  to  the

474  CONE  v.  BELL 

Opinion of the Court 
Court  of  Appeals'  failure  to  assess  the  effect  of  the  sup-pressed  evidence  "collectively"  rather  than  "item  by  item," 

see Kyles, 514 U. S., at 436, we nevertheless agree that even when  viewed  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  Cone,  the  evi-
dence  falls  short  of  being  sufficient  to  sustain  his  insanity defense. 

Cone's  experts  testified  that  his  drug  addiction  and  post-traumatic 

stress  disorder  originated  during  his  service  in Vietnam,  more  than  13  years  before  the  Todds  were  mur-

dered.  During  those  years,  despite  Cone's  drug  use  and mental disorder, he managed to successfully complete his ed-
ucation,  travel,  and  (when  not  incarcerated)  function  in  civil 
society.  The  suppressed  evidence  may  have  strengthened 
the inference that Cone was on drugs or suffering from with-
drawal  at  the  time  of  the  murders,  but  his  behavior  before, 
during,  and  after  the  crimes  was  inconsistent  with  the  con-
tention that he lacked substantial capacity either to appreci-
ate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct 
to  the  requirements  of  law.  See  Graham,  547  S.  W.  2d,  at 
543.  The  likelihood  that  the  suppressed  evidence  would 
have  affected  the  jury's  verdict  on  the  issue  of  insanity  is 
therefore  remote.  Accordingly,  we  conclude  that  the  Sixth 
Circuit  did  not  err  by  denying  habeas  relief  on  the  ground 
that  the  suppressed  evidence  was  immaterial  to  the  jury's 
finding of guilt. 

The same cannot be said of the Court of Appeals' summary 
treatment  of  Cone's  claim  that  the  suppressed  evidence  in-
fluenced  the  jury's  sentencing  recommendation.  There  is  a 
critical  difference  between  the  high  standard  Cone  was  re-
quired to satisfy to establish insanity as a matter of Tennes-
see  law  and  the  far  lesser  standard  that  a  defendant  must 
satisfy to qualify evidence as mitigating in a penalty hearing 
in  a  capital  case.  See  Bell,  535  U. S.,  at  712  (Stevens,

Opinion of the Court 
honorable service in the military").  As defense counsel em-
phasized in his brief opening statement during penalty phase 
proceedings,  the  jury  was  statutorily  required  to  consider 
whether Cone's "capacity . . . to  appreciate the wrongfulness 
of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements 
of  the  law  was  substantially  impaired  as  a  result  of  mental 
disease  or  defect  or  intoxication  which  was  insufficient  to 
establish  a  defense  to  the  crime  but  which  substantially  af-
fected  his  judgment."  Tenn.  Code  Ann.  $ 39-2-203( j)(8). 
It  is  possible  that  the  suppressed  evidence,  viewed  cumula-
tively, may have persuaded the jury that Cone had a far more 
serious  drug  problem  than  the  prosecution  was  prepared  to 
acknowledge,  and  that  Cone's  drug  use  played  a  mitigating, 
though  not  exculpating,  role  in  the  crimes  he  committed.19 
The  evidence  might  also  have  rebutted  the  State's  sugges-
tion  that  Cone  had  manipulated  his  expert  witnesses  into 
falsely  believing  he  was  a  drug  addict  when  in  fact  he  did 
not struggle with substance abuse. 

Neither  the  Court of Appeals  nor the  District Court  fully 
considered  whether  the  suppressed  evidence  might  have 
persuaded  one  or  more  jurors  that  Cone's  drug  addiction-- 
especially  if  attributable  to  honorable  service  of  his  country 
in  Vietnam--was  sufficiently  serious  to  justify  a  decision  to 
imprison  him  for  life  rather  than  sentence  him  to  death. 
Because  the  evidence  suppressed  at  Cone's  trial  may  well 
have  been  material  to  the  jury's  assessment  of  the  proper 
punishment  in  this  case,  we  conclude  that  a  full  review  of 

the suppressed evidence and its effect is warranted. 

19 We  agree  with  the  dissent  that  the  standard  to  be  applied  by  the 
District Court in evaluating the merits of Cone's Brady claim on remand 
is whether there is a reasonable probability that, had the suppressed evi-
dence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been differ-
ent.  See post, at 491.  Because neither the District Court nor the Court 
of Appeals considered the merits of Cone's claim with respect to the effect 
of the withheld evidence on his sentence, it is appropriate for the District 
Court, rather than this Court, to do so in the first instance.

rescissions  of  prior  action  differently  for  purposes  of  the standard  of  review  makes  good  sense,  and  has  basis  in  the 

text of the statute, which likewise treats the two separately. It  instructs  a  reviewing  court  to  "compel  agency  action 
unlawfully  withheld  or  unreasonably  delayed,"  5  U. S. C. $ 706(1),  and  to  "hold  unlawful  and  set  aside  agency  action, 
findings, and conclusions found to be [among other things] . . . arbitrary [or] capricious," $ 706(2)(A).  The statute makes no 
distinction,  however,  between  initial  agency  action  and  sub-sequent agency action undoing or revising that action. 

To  be  sure,  the  requirement  that  an  agency  provide  rea-soned  explanation  for  its  action  would  ordinarily  demand 
that  it  display  awareness  that  it  is

not modify "is discharged," which appears in a separate subsection and 
in  a  different  voice  than  the  principal  paragraph.  "[I]n  relation  to"  is 
most  naturally  read  to  modify  only  the  nearby  verbs  "uses"  and  "car-
ries."  This  reading  will  not  lead  to  the  absurd  results  posited  by 
Dean.  Pp. 572-574. 

(b)  Dean  argues  that  subsection  (iii)  must  be  limited  to  intentional 
discharges in order to give effect to the statute's progression of harsher 
penalties for increasingly culpable  conduct.  While it is unusual  to  im-
pose criminal punishment for the consequences of purely accidental con-
duct,  it  is  not  unusual  to  punish  individuals  for  the  unintended  conse-
quences  of  their  unlawful

a  jury  found  him  guilty  on  both  the  robbery  and  firearm counts.  The District Court sentenced Dean to a mandatory 

minimum  term  of  10  years  in  prison  on  the  firearm  count, because  the  firearm  "discharged"  during  the  robbery. 

$ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii); App. 136. Dean appealed, contending that the discharge was acciden-
tal, and that the sentencing enhancement in $ 924(c)(1)(A)(iii) requires  proof  that  the  defendant  intended  to  discharge  the 
firearm.  The Court  of Appeals  affirmed,  holding  that sepa-rate  proof  of  intent  was  not  required.  517  F.  3d  1224,  1229 
(CA11  2008).  That  decision  created  a  conflict  among  the Circuits  over  whether  the  accidental  discharge  of  a  firearm 
during the specified crimes gives rise to the 10-year manda-tory  minimum.  See

not, however, separately define "discharge" to include an in-tent  requirement.  "[W]here  Congress  includes  particular

This  case  does  not  involve, therefore,  the  prevention  of a constitutional  violation,  but  rather  the  scope  of  the  remedy 

for  a  violation  that  has  already  occurred.  Our  precedents make  clear  that  the  game  of  excluding  tainted  evidence  for 
impeachment  purposes  is  not  worth  the  candle.  The  inter-ests  safeguarded  by  such  exclusion  are  "outweighed  by  the 
need  to  prevent  perjury  and  to  assure  the  integrity  of  the trial  process."

Opinion of the Court 
Although B&B  undertook some efforts  at remediation,  by 
1989  it  had  become  insolvent  and  ceased  all  operations. 
That same year, the Arvin facility was added to the National 
Priority  List,  see  54  Fed.  Reg.  41027,  and  subsequently, 
DTSC  and  EPA  (Governments)  exercised  their  authority 
under  42  U. S. C.  $ 9604  to  undertake  cleanup  efforts  at  the 
site.  By 1998, the Governments had spent more than $8 mil-
lion  responding  to  the  site  contamination;  their  costs  have 
continued to accrue. 

In  1991,  EPA  issued  an  administrative  order  to  the  Rail-
roads directing them, as owners of a portion of the property 
on  which  the  Arvin  facility  was  located,  to  perform  certain 
remedial  tasks  in  connection  with  the  site.  The  Railroads 
did  so,  incurring  expenses  of  more  than  $3  million  in  the 
process.  Seeking  to  recover  at  least  a  portion  of  their 
response  costs,  in  1992  the  Railroads  brought  suit  against 
B&B  in  the  United  States  District  Court  for  the  Eastern 
District  of  California.  In  1996,  that  lawsuit  was  consoli-
dated with two recovery actions brought by DTSC and EPA 
against Shell and the Railroads. 

The District Court conducted a 6-week bench trial in 1999 
and four years later entered a judgment in favor of the Gov-
ernments.  In  a  lengthy  order  supported  by  507  separate 
findings  of  fact  and  conclusions  of  law,  the  court  held  that 
both  the  Railroads  and  Shell  were  potentially  responsible 
parties (PRPs) under CERCLA--the Railroads because they 
were  owners  of  a  portion  of  the  facility,  see  42  U. S. C. 

$$ 9607(a)(1)-(2), and Shell because it had "arranged for" the 
disposal  of  hazardous  substances  through  its  sale  and  deliv-
ery of D-D, see $ 9607(a)(3). 

below ground.  Although  the B-zone  is  not currently  used  as  a  source  of 
drinking water, it has the potential to serve as such a source.  No contam-
ination has yet been found in that zone.  The C-zone is an aquifer located 
200  feet  below  ground.  It  is  the  sole  current  source  of  drinking  water 
and, thus far, has suffered no contamination from the Arvin site.

Opinion of the Court 
with  the  apportionment  principles  outlined  above,  we  re-verse the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the Railroads are 

subject  to  joint  and  several  liability  for  all  response  costs arising out of the contamination of the Arvin facility. 

IV 
For  the  foregoing  reasons,  we  conclude  that  the  Court  of Appeals  erred  by  holding  Shell  liable  as  an  arranger  under 

CERCLA  for  the  costs  of  remediating  environmental  con-tamination  at  the  Arvin,  California,  facility.  Furthermore, 
we  conclude  that  the  District  Court  reasonably  apportioned the  Railroads'  share  of  the  site  remediation  costs  at  9%. 
The  judgment  is  reversed,  and  the  cases  are  remanded  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

a denial into something other than "[a]n order . . . refusing a stay of any action under section 3."  9 U. S. C. $ 16(a). 

Respondents argue that this reading of $ 16(a) will produce a long parade of horribles, enmeshing courts in fact-intensive 
jurisdictional  inquiries  and  permitting  frivolous  interlocu-tory  appeals.  Even  if  these  objections  could  surmount  the 
plain  language  of  the  statute,  we  would  not  be  persuaded. Determination  of  whether  $ 3  was  invoked  in  a  denied  stay 
request  is  immeasurably  more  simple  and  less  factbound than the threshold determination respondents would replace 
it with:  whether  the litigant  was a  party to the  contract  (an especially  difficult  question  when  the  written  agreement  is 
not  signed).  It  is  more  appropriate  to  grapple  with  that merits  question  after  the  court  has  accepted  jurisdiction 
over  the  case.  Second,  there  are  ways  of  minimizing  the impact of abusive appeals.  Appellate courts can streamline 
the  disposition  of  meritless  claims  and  even  authorize  the district  court's  retention  of  jurisdiction  when  an  appeal  is 
certified  as  frivolous.  See  Behrens,

employment,  Flores  gave  his  employer  a  false  name,  birth date,  and  Social  Security  number,  along  with  a  counterfeit 

alien registration card.  The Social Security number and the number  on  the  alien  registration  card  were  not  those  of  a 
real  person.  In  2006,  Flores  presented  his  employer  with new counterfeit Social Security and alien registration cards; 
these  cards  (unlike  Flores'  old  alien  registration  card)  used 
his  real  name.  But  this  time  the  numbers  on  both  cards were in fact numbers assigned to other people. 

Flores'  employer  reported  his  request  to  U.  S.  Immigra-tion  and  Customs  Enforcement.  Customs  discovered  that 
the  numbers  on  Flores'  new  documents  belonged  to  other 
people.  The  United  States  then  charged  Flores  with  two 
predicate crimes, namely, entering the United States without 
inspection,  8  U. S. C.  $ 1325(a),  and  misusing  immigration 
documents,  18  U. S. C.  $ 1546(a).  And  it  charged  him  with 
aggravated identity theft, 18 U. S. C. $ 1028A(a)(1), the crime 
at issue here. 

Flores  moved  for  a  judgment  of  acquittal  on  the  "aggra-
vated  identity  theft"  counts.  He  claimed  that  the  Govern-
ment could not prove that  he knew

trine so long as the order "turns  on an issue  of law."  Mitchell v.  For-
syth,  472  U. S.  511,  530.  The  doctrine's  applicability  in  this  context  is 
well  established;  an  order  rejecting  qualified  immunity  at  the  motion-
to-dismiss  stage  is  a  "final  decision"  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 1291,  which 
vests  courts  of  appeals  with  "jurisdiction  of  appeals  from  all  final  de-

cisions of  the district courts."  Behrens v.  Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 307. 
Pp. 671-672. 

(b)  Under  these  principles,  the  Court  of  Appeals  had,  and  this 
Court  has,  jurisdiction  over  the  District  Court's  order.  Because  the 
order  turned  on  an  issue  of  law  and  rejected  the  qualified-immunity 
defense, it was a final decision "subject to immediate appeal."  Behrens, 
supra, at 307.  Pp. 672-675. 

2.  Iqbal's  complaint  fails  to  plead  sufficient  facts  to  state  a  claim  for 
purposeful and unlawful discrimination.  Pp. 675-687. 

(a)  This Court assumes, without deciding, that Iqbal's First Amend-
ment claim is actionable in a Bivens action, see Hartman v.  Moore, 547 
U. S. 250, 254, n. 2.  Because vicarious liability is inapplicable to Bivens 
and  $ 1983  suits,  see,  e. g.,  Monell  v.  New  York  City  Dept.  of  Social 
Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691, the plaintiff in a suit such as the present one 
must  plead  that  each  Government-official  defendant,  through  his  own 
individual  actions,  has  violated  the  Constitution.  Purposeful  discrim-
ination  requires  more  than  "intent  as  volition  or  intent  as  aware-
ness  of  consequences";  it  involves  a  decisionmaker's  undertaking  a 
course of action " `because of,' not merely `in spite of,' [the action's] ad-
verse effects upon an identifiable group."  Personnel Administrator of 
Mass. v.  Feeney, 442 U. S. 256, 279.  Iqbal must plead sufficient factual 
matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention 
policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason, but for the pur-
pose  of  discriminating  on  account  of  race,  religion,  or  national  origin. 
Pp. 675-677. 

(b)  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a complaint must 
contain  a  "short  and  plain  statement  of  the  claim  showing  that  the 
pleader  is  entitled  to  relief."  "[D]etailed  factual  allegations"  are  not 
required,  Twombly,  550  U. S.,  at  555,  but  the  Rule  does  call  for  suffi-
cient factual matter, accepted as true, to "state a claim to relief that is 
plausible  on  its  face,"  id.,  at  570.  A  claim  has  facial  plausibility  when 
the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable in-
ference that the defendant is liable  for the misconduct alleged.  Id., at 
556.  Two working principles underlie Twombly.  First, the tenet that 
a  court  must  accept  a  complaint's  allegations  as  true  is  inapplicable  to 
threadbare  recitals  of  a  cause  of  action's  elements,  supported  by  mere 
conclusory  statements.  Id.,  at  555.  Second,  determining  whether 
a  complaint  states  a  plausible  claim  is  context  specific,  requiring  the

Syllabus 
reviewing  court  to  draw  on  its  experience  and  common  sense.  Id.,  at 
556.  A court considering a motion to dismiss may begin by identifying 
allegations that, because  they are  mere conclusions, are  not  entitled to 
the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can provide the com-
plaint's  framework,  they  must  be  supported  by  factual  allegations. 
When there are well-pleaded factual allegations, a court should assume 
their  veracity  and  then  determine  whether  they  plausibly  give  rise  to 
an entitlement to relief.  Pp. 677-680. 

(c)  Iqbal's  pleadings  do  not  comply  with  Rule  8  under  Twombly. 
Several  of  his  allegations--that  petitioners  agreed  to  subject  him  to 
harsh conditions as a matter of policy, solely on account of discriminatory 
factors and for no legitimate penological interest; that Ashcroft was that 
policy's "principal architect"; and that Mueller was "instrumental" in its 
adoption and execution--are conclusory and not entitled to be assumed 
true.  Moreover,  the  factual  allegations  that  the  FBI,  under  Mueller, 
arrested and detained thousands of Arab Muslim men, and that he and 
Ashcroft  approved  the  detention  policy,  do  not  plausibly  suggest  that 
petitioners  purposefully  discriminated  on  prohibited  grounds.  Given 
that the September 11 attacks were perpetrated by Arab Muslims, it is 
not surprising that a legitimate policy directing law enforcement to ar-
rest and detain individuals because of their suspected link to the attacks 
would  produce  a  disparate,  incidental  impact  on  Arab  Muslims,  even 
though  the  policy's  purpose  was  to  target  neither  Arabs  nor  Muslims. 
Even if the complaint's well-pleaded facts gave rise to a plausible infer-
ence  that  Iqbal's  arrest  was  the  result  of  unconstitutional  discrimina-
tion,  that  inference  alone  would  not  entitle  him  to  relief:  His  claims 
against  petitioners  rest  solely  on  their  ostensible  policy  of  holding  de-
tainees  categorized  as  "of  high  interest,"  but  the  complaint  does  not 
contain facts plausibly showing that their policy was based on discrimi-
natory factors.  Pp. 680-684. 

(d)  Three of Iqbal's arguments are rejected.  Pp. 684-687. 

(i)  His claim that Twombly should be limited to its antitrust con-
text  is  not  supported  by  that  case  or  the  Federal  Rules.  Because 
Twombly  interpreted  and  applied  Rule  8,  which  in  turn  governs  the 
pleading standard "in all civil actions," Rule 1, the case applies to anti-
trust and discrimination  suits  alike, see 550 U. S., at  555-556, and n. 3. 
P. 684. 

(ii) Rule 8's pleading requirements need not be relaxed based on 
the Second Circuit's instruction that the District Court cabin discovery 
to  preserve  petitioners'  qualified-immunity  defense  in  anticipation  of  a 
summary  judgment  motion.  The  question  presented  by  a  motion  to 
dismiss for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls placed on 
the  discovery  process.  Twombly,  supra,  at  559.  And  because  Iqbal's

Syllabus 
complaint is deficient under Rule 8, he is not entitled to discovery, cab-
ined or otherwise.  Pp. 684-686. 

(iii) Rule 9(b)--which requires particularity when pleading "fraud 
or  mistake"  but  allows  "other  conditions  of  a  person's  mind  [to]  be  al-
leged generally"--does not require courts to credit a complaint's conclu-
sory statements without reference to its factual context.  Rule 9 merely 
excuses a  party  from  pleading  discriminatory intent  under  an elevated 
pleading standard.  It does  not give him license to  evade  Rule 8's less 
rigid, though still operative, strictures.  Pp. 686-687. 

(e)  The  Second  Circuit  should  decide  in  the  first  instance  whether 
to  remand  to  the  District  Court  to  allow  Iqbal  to  seek  leave  to  amend 
his deficient complaint.  P. 687.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
Following  the  2001  attacks,  the  FBI  and  other  entities within  the  Department  of  Justice  began  an  investigation  of 

vast  reach  to  identify  the  assailants  and  prevent  them  from attacking anew.  The FBI dedicated more than 4,000 special 
agents  and  3,000  support  personnel  to  the  endeavor.  By September  18  "the  FBI  had  received  more  than  96,000  tips 
or  potential  leads  from  the  public."  Dept.  of  Justice,  Office of  Inspector  General,  The  September  11  Detainees:  A  Re-
view  of  the  Treatment  of  Aliens  Held  on  Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the Septem-
ber 11 Attacks 1, 11-12 (Apr. 2003), http://www.usdoj.gov/oig/ special/0306/full.pdf ?bcsi_scan_61073EC0F74759AD=0& 
bcsi_scan_filename=full.pdf  (as  visited  May  14,  2009,  and available in Clerk of Court's case file). 

In the ensuing months the FBI questioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the attacks in particular or to 
terrorism  in  general.  Id.,  at  1.  Of  those  individuals,  some 762  were  held  on  immigration  charges;  and  a  184-member 
subset of that group was deemed to be "of `high interest' " to the  investigation.  Id.,  at  111.  The  high-interest  detainees 
were  held  under  restrictive  conditions  designed  to  prevent them from communicating with the general prison population 
or the outside world.  Id., at 112-113. Respondent  was  one  of  the  detainees.  According  to  his 
complaint,  in  November  2001  agents  of  the  FBI  and  Immi-
gration  and  Naturalization  Service  arrested  him  on  charges of  fraud  in  relation  to  identification  documents  and  conspir-

acy to defraud the  United States.  Iqbal v.  Hasty, 490  F. 3d 143, 147-148 (CA2 2007).  Pending trial for those crimes, re-
spondent  was  housed  at  the  Metropolitan  Detention  Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York.  Respondent was designated 
a person "of high interest" to the September 11 investigation 
and  in  January  2002  was  placed  in  a  section  of  the  MDC known as the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit

(ADMAX  SHU).  Id.,  at  148.  As  the  facility's  name  indi-cates, the ADMAX SHU incorporates the maximum security 

conditions  allowable  under  Federal  Bureau  of  Prisons  regu-lations. 

Ibid.  ADMAX  SHU  detainees  were  kept  in  lock-
down  23  hours  a  day,  spending  the  remaining  hour  outside their cells  in handcuffs and leg  irons accompanied by  a four-

officer escort.  Ibid. Respondent pleaded guilty to the criminal charges, served 
a term of imprisonment, and was removed to his native Paki-
stan.  Id.,  at  149.  He  then  filed  a  Bivens  action  in  the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New 

York  against  34  current  and  former  federal  officials  and  19 
"John  Doe"  federal  corrections  officers.  See  Bivens  v.  Six 
Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,  403 U. S. 388 (1971).  The 
defendants  range  from  the  correctional  officers  who  had 
day-to-day  contact  with  respondent  during  the  term  of  his 
confinement, to the wardens of the MDC facility, all the way 
to petitioners--officials who  were at the highest level  of the 
federal  law  enforcement  hierarchy.  First  Amended  Com-
plaint in No. 04-CV-1809 (JG)(JA), |||| 10-11, App. to Pet. for 
Cert. 157a (hereinafter Complaint). 

The  21-cause-of-action  complaint  does  not  challenge  re-
spondent's  arrest  or  his  confinement  in  the  MDC's  general 
prison population.  Rather, it concentrates on his treatment 
while  confined  to  the  ADMAX  SHU.  The  complaint  sets 
forth  various  claims  against  defendants  who  are  not  before 
us.  For  instance,  the  complaint  alleges  that  respondent's 
jailors "kicked him in  the stomach, punched him in the face, 
and  dragged  him  across"  his  cell  without  justification,  id., 
|| 113,  at  176a;  subjected  him  to  serial  strip  and  body-cavity 
searches  when  he  posed  no  safety  risk  to  himself  or  others, 
id.,  |||| 143-145,  at  182a;  and  refused  to  let  him  and  other 
Muslims  pray  because  there  would  be  "[n]o  prayers  for  ter-
rorists," id., || 154, at 184a. 

The allegations  against petitioners are  the  only ones  rele-
vant  here.  The  complaint  contends  that  petitioners  desig-

Opinion of the Court 
nated respondent a person of high interest on account of his race, religion, or national origin, in contravention of the First 

and  Fifth  Amendments  to  the  Constitution.  The  complaint alleges  that  "the  [FBI],  under  the  direction  of  Defendant 
MUELLER,  arrested and  detained thousands  of Arab  Mus-lim  men . . . as  part of its  investigation of the events of Sep-
tember 11."  Id., || 47, at 164a.  It further alleges that "[t]he 
policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly re-strictive  conditions  of  confinement  until  they  were  `cleared' 

by  the  FBI  was  approved  by  Defendants  ASHCROFT  and MUELLER in discussions in the weeks after September 11, 
2001."  Id.,  || 69,  at  168a.  Lastly,  the  complaint  posits  that 
petitioners  "each  knew  of,  condoned,  and  willfully  and  mali-
ciously  agreed to  subject"  respondent to  harsh conditions  of 
confinement  "as  a  matter  of  policy,  solely  on  account  of [his] 
religion,  race,  and/or  national  origin  and  for  no  legitimate 
penological interest."  Id., || 96, at 172a-173a.  The pleading 
names Ashcroft as the "principal architect" of the policy, id., 
|| 10,  at  157a,  and  identifies  Mueller  as  "instrumental  in  [its] 
adoption,  promulgation,  and  implementation,"  id.,  || 11,  at 
157a. 

Petitioners  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint  for  failure  to 
state sufficient allegations to show their own involvement in 
clearly  established  unconstitutional  conduct.  The  District 
Court  denied  their  motion.  Accepting  all  of  the  allegations 
in respondent's complaint as true, the court held that "it can-
not  be  said  that  there  [is] no  set  of  facts  on  which  [respond-
ent]  would  be  entitled  to  relief  as  against"  petitioners.  Id., 
at  136a-137a  (relying  on  Conley  v.  Gibson,  355  U. S.  41 
(1957)).  Invoking  the  collateral-order  doctrine  petitioners 
filed  an  interlocutory  appeal  in  the  United  States  Court  of 
Appeals  for  the  Second  Circuit.  While  that  appeal  was 
pending, this Court decided Bell Atlantic Corp. v.  Twombly, 
550 U. S. 544 (2007), which discussed the standard for evalu-
ating  whether  a  complaint  is  sufficient  to  survive  a  motion 
to dismiss.

670  ASHCROFT  v.  IQBAL 

Opinion of the Court 
The  Court  of  Appeals  considered  Twombly's  applicability 
to this case.  Acknowledging that Twombly retired the Con-
ley no-set-of-facts test relied upon by the District Court, the 
Court  of  Appeals'  opinion  discussed  at  length  how  to  apply 
this  Court's  "standard  for  assessing  the  adequacy  of  plead-
ings."  490 F. 3d, at 155.  It concluded that Twombly called 
for a "flexible `plausibility standard,' which obliges a pleader 
to amplify a claim with some factual allegations in those con-
texts where such amplification is needed to render the claim 
plausible."  Id., at 157-158.  The court found that petition-
ers' appeal did not present one of "those contexts" requiring 
amplification.  As a consequence, it held respondent's plead-
ing  adequate  to  allege  petitioners'  personal  involvement  in 
discriminatory  decisions  which,  if  true,  violated  clearly  es-
tablished constitutional law.  Id., at 174. 

Judge Cabranes concurred.  He agreed that the majority's 
"discussion of the relevant pleading standards reflect[ed] the 
uneasy  compromise .  . .  between  a  qualified immunity  privi-
lege rooted in the need to preserve the effectiveness of gov-
ernment as contemplated by our constitutional structure and 
the  pleading  requirements of Rule  8(a) of the Federal  Rules 
of  Civil  Procedure."  Id.,  at  178  (internal  quotation  marks 
and  citations  omitted).  Judge  Cabranes  nonetheless  ex-
pressed  concern  at  the  prospect  of  subjecting  high-ranking 
Government officials--entitled to assert the defense of quali-
fied  immunity  and  charged  with  responding  to  "a  national 
and  international  security  emergency  unprecedented  in  the 
history of the American Republic"--to the burdens of discov-
ery on the basis of a complaint as nonspecific as respondent's. 
Id., at 179.  Reluctant to vindicate that concern as a member 
of  the  Court  of  Appeals,  ibid.,  Judge  Cabranes  urged  this 
Court  to  address  the  appropriate  pleading  standard  "at  the 
earliest opportunity," id., at 178.  We granted certiorari, 554 

U. S. 902 (2008), and now reverse.

Opinion of the Court 

II 
We  first  address  whether  the  Court  of  Appeals  had subject-matter  jurisdiction  to  affirm  the  District  Court's 

order  denying  petitioners'  motion  to  dismiss.  Respondent disputed subject-matter jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals, 

but the court hardly discussed the issue.  We are not free to pretermit  the  question.  Subject-matter  jurisdiction  cannot 
be forfeited or waived  and should be considered when fairly in doubt. 

Arbaugh v.  Y & H Corp.,  546 U. S. 500, 514 (2006) (citing 
United  States  v.  Cotton,  535  U. S.  625,  630  (2002)). According to respondent, the District Court's order denying 

petitioners'  motion  to  dismiss  is  not  appealable  under  the collateral-order doctrine.  We disagree. 

A 
With  exceptions  inapplicable  here,  Congress  has  vested the  courts  of  appeals  with  "jurisdiction  of  appeals  from  all 

final  decisions  of  the  district  courts  of  the  United  States." 28 U. S. C. $ 1291.  Though the statute's finality requirement 
ensures that "interlocutory appeals--appeals before the end of  district  court  proceedings--are  the  exception,  not  the 
rule," Johnson v.  Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 309 (1995), it does not prevent "review of all prejudgment orders," 

Behrens v.  Pel-letier, 516  U. S.  299,  305  (1996).  Under  the  collateral-order 

doctrine  a  limited  set  of  district-court  orders  are reviewable  "though  short  of  final  judgment."  Ibid.  The 

orders within this narrow category "are immediately appeal-able because they `finally determine claims of right separable 
from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action,  too im-portant to be denied review and too independent of the cause 
itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the  whole  case  is  adjudicated.' " 

Ibid.  (quoting  Cohen  v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337  U. S. 541, 546 (1949)). 

A  district-court  decision  denying  a  Government  officer's claim  of  qualified  immunity  can  fall  within  the  narrow  class

672  ASHCROFT  v.  IQBAL 

Opinion of the Court 
of  appealable  orders  despite  "the  absence  of  a  final  judg-ment."  Mitchell v.  Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 530 (1985).  This 

is so because qualified immunity--which shields Government officials "from liability for civil damages insofar as their con-
duct does not violate clearly established statutory or consti-tutional  rights," 

Harlow  v.  Fitzgerald,  457  U. S.  800,  818 (1982)--is  both  a  defense  to  liability  and  a  limited  "entitle-

ment  not  to  stand  trial  or  face  the  other  burdens  of  litiga-tion."  Mitchell,  472  U. S.,  at  526.  Provided  it  "turns  on 
an  issue  of  law,"  id.,  at  530,  a  district-court  order  denying qualified immunity " `conclusively determine[s]' " that the de-
fendant must bear the burdens of discovery; is "conceptually distinct  from  the  merits  of  the  plaintiff 's  claim";  and  would 
prove "effectively unreviewable  on appeal from  a final  judg-ment," 

id.,  at  527-528  (citing  Cohen,  supra,  at  546).  As  a general  matter,  the  collateral-order  doctrine  may  have  ex-

panded  beyond  the  limits  dictated  by  its  internal  logic  and the  strict  application  of  the  criteria  set  out  in  Cohen.  But 
the  applicability  of  the  doctrine  in  the  context  of  qualified-immunity claims is well established; and this Court has been 
careful to say that a district court's order rejecting qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage of a proceeding is a 
"final  decision"  within  the  meaning  of  $ 1291.  Behrens,  516 U. S., at 307. 

B 
Applying  these  principles,  we  conclude  that  the  Court  of Appeals  had  jurisdiction  to  hear  petitioners'  appeal.  The 

District Court's order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss turned  on  an  issue  of  law  and  rejected  the  defense  of  quali-
fied  immunity.  It  was  therefore  a  final  decision  "subject  to immediate  appeal." 

Ibid.  Respondent  says  that  "a  quali-fied  immunity  appeal  based  solely  on  the  complaint's  failure 

to  state  a  claim,  and  not  on  the  ultimate  issues  relevant  to the qualified immunity defense itself, is not a proper subject 
of  interlocutory  jurisdiction."  Brief  for  Respondent  Iqbal 15  (hereinafter  Iqbal  Brief).  In  other  words,  respondent

Opinion of the Court 
contends the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to determine whether  his  complaint  avers  a  clearly  established  constitu-

tional  violation but  that  it  lacked  jurisdiction to  pass  on  the sufficiency  of  his  pleadings.  Our  opinions,  however,  make 
clear that appellate jurisdiction is not so strictly confined. In 

Hartman  v.  Moore,  547  U. S.  250  (2006),  the  Court  re-
viewed  an  interlocutory  decision  denying  qualified  im-
munity.  The legal issue decided  in  Hartman  concerned the elements  a  plaintiff  "must  plead  and  prove  in  order  to  win" 

a  First  Amendment  retaliation  claim.  Id.,  at  257,  n.  5. Similarly, two Terms ago in 

Wilkie v.  Robbins, 551 U. S. 537 
(2007),  the  Court  considered  another  interlocutory  order 
denying  qualified  immunity.  The  legal  issue  there  was 
whether a Bivens action can be employed to challenge inter-
ference with property rights.  551 U. S., at 549, n. 4.  These 
cases cannot be squared with respondent's argument that the 
collateral-order  doctrine  restricts  appellate  jurisdiction  to 
the "ultimate issu[e]" whether the legal wrong asserted was 
a  violation  of  clearly  established  law  while  excluding  the 
question whether the facts pleaded establish such a violation. 
Iqbal  Brief  15.  Indeed,  the  latter  question  is  even  more 
clearly  within  the  category  of  appealable  decisions  than  the 
questions presented in Hartman and Wilkie, since whether a 
particular complaint sufficiently alleges a clearly established 
violation of law cannot be decided in isolation from the facts 
pleaded.  In that sense the sufficiency of respondent's plead-
ings is both "inextricably intertwined with," Swint v.  Cham-
bers  County  Comm'n,  514  U. S.  35,  51  (1995),  and  "directly 
implicated  by,"  Hartman,  supra,  at  257,  n.  5,  the  qualified-
immunity defense. 

Respondent  counters  that  our  holding  in  Johnson,  515 
U. S.  304,  confirms  the  want  of  subject-matter  jurisdiction 
here.  That  is  incorrect.  The  allegation  in  Johnson  was 
that  five  defendants,  all  of  them  police  officers,  unlawfully 
beat the plaintiff.  Johnson considered "the appealability of 
a  portion  of "  the  District  Court's  summary  judgment  order

674  ASHCROFT  v.  IQBAL 

Opinion of the Court 
that,  "though  entered  in  a  `qualified  immunity'  case,  deter-mine[d] only" that there was a genuine issue of material fact 

that  three  of  the  defendants  participated  in  the  beating. 
Id., at 313. 

In finding that order not  a  "final decision"  for  purposes of $ 1291, the 

Johnson Court  cited  Mitchell  for  the  proposition 
that only decisions turning " `on an issue of law' " are subject 
to  immediate  appeal.  515  U. S.,  at  313.  Though  determin-ing whether there is a genuine issue of material fact at sum-

mary judgment is a question of law, it is a legal question that sits  near  the  law-fact  divide.  Or  as  we  said  in 

Johnson,  it 
is  a  "fact-related"  legal  inquiry.  Id., at  314.  To  conduct  it, a court of appeals may be required to consult a "vast pretrial 

record, with numerous conflicting affidavits, depositions, and other  discovery materials." 

Id.,  at 316.  That  process gen-
erally involves matters more within a district court's ken and 
may replicate inefficiently questions that will arise on appeal following  final  judgment. 

Ibid.  Finding  those  concerns 
predominant, Johnson held that the collateral orders that are "final"  under 

Mitchell  turn  on "abstract,"  rather  than  "fact-
based," issues of law.  515 U. S., at 317. The  concerns  that  animated  the  decision  in 

Johnson  are 
absent  when  an  appellate  court  considers  the  disposition  of 
a  motion  to  dismiss  a  complaint  for  insufficient  pleadings. 
True,  the  categories  of  "fact-based"  and  "abstract"  legal 
questions  used  to  guide  the  Court's  decision  in  Johnson  are 
not  well  defined.  Here,  however,  the  order  denying  peti-
tioners'  motion  to  dismiss  falls  well  within  the  latter  class. 
Reviewing that order, the Court  of Appeals  considered only 
the allegations contained within the four corners of respond-
ent's complaint; resort to a "vast pretrial record" on petition-
ers'  motion  to  dismiss  was  unnecessary.  Id.,  at  316.  And 
determining  whether  respondent's  complaint  has  the  "heft" 
to state a claim is a task well within an appellate court's core 
competency.  Twombly,  550  U. S.,  at  557.  Evaluating  the 
sufficiency  of  a  complaint  is  not  a  "fact-based"  question  of 
law,  so  the  problem  the  Court  sought  to  avoid  in  Johnson

Opinion of the Court 
is  not  implicated  here.  The  District  Court's  order  denying petitioners'  motion  to  dismiss  is  a  final  decision  under  the 

collateral-order  doctrine  over  which  the  Court  of  Appeals had,  and  this  Court  has,  jurisdiction.  We  proceed  to  con-
sider the merits of petitioners' appeal. 

III 
In  Twombly,  supra,  at  553-554,  the  Court  found  it  neces-sary first to discuss the antitrust principles implicated by the 

complaint.  Here  too  we  begin  by  taking  note  of  the  ele-ments  a  plaintiff  must  plead  to  state  a  claim  of  unconstitu-
tional  discrimination  against  officials  entitled  to  assert  the defense of qualified immunity. 

In Bivens--proceeding on the theory that a right suggests a  remedy--this  Court  "recognized  for  the  first  time  an  im-
plied  private  action  for  damages  against  federal  officers  al-leged  to  have  violated  a  citizen's  constitutional  rights." 
Correctional  Services  Corp.  v.  Malesko,  534  U. S.  61,  66 (2001).  Because implied causes of action are disfavored, the 
Court  has  been  reluctant  to  extend  Bivens  liability  "to  any new  context  or  new  category  of  defendants."  534  U. S., 
at  68.  See  also  Wilkie,  551  U. S.,  at  549-550.  That  reluc-tance might well have disposed of respondent's First Amend-
ment  claim  of  religious  discrimination.  For  while  we  have allowed  a 

Bivens  action  to  redress  a  violation  of  the  equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth 

Amendment, see Davis v.  Passman, 442 U. S. 228 (1979), we have  not  found  an  implied  damages  remedy  under  the  Free 
Exercise Clause.  Indeed, we have declined to extend 
Bivens to a claim sounding in the First Amendment.  Bush v.  Lucas, 462  U. S. 367 (1983).  Petitioners do  not press this 

argument,  however,  so  we  assume,  without  deciding,  that respondent's  First  Amendment  claim  is  actionable  under 
Bivens. In  the  limited  settings  where 

Bivens  does  apply,  the  im-plied  cause  of  action  is  the  "federal  analog  to  suits  brought 

against  state  officials  under  Rev.  Stat.  $ 1979,  42  U. S. C.

$ 1983."  Hartman,  547  U. S.,  at  254,  n.  2.  Cf.  Wilson  v. 
Layne,  526  U. S.  603,  609  (1999).  Based  on  the  rules  our 
precedents  establish,  respondent  correctly  concedes  that Government officials may not be held liable for the unconsti-

tutional  conduct  of  their  subordinates  under  a  theory  of  re-
spondeat  superior.  Iqbal  Brief  46  ("[I]t  is  undisputed  that 
supervisory  Bivens  liability  cannot  be  established  solely  on 
a theory of respondeat superior").  See Monell v.  New York 
City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 691 (1978) (finding 
no  vicarious  liability  for  a  municipal  "person"  under  42 U. S. C.  $ 1983);  see  also 

Dunlop  v.  Munroe,  7  Cranch  242, 
269  (1812)  (a  federal  official's  liability  "will  only  result  from 
his  own  neglect  in  not  properly  superintending  the  dis-
charge" of his subordinates' duties); Robertson v.  Sichel, 127 
U. S.  507,  515-516  (1888)  ("A  public  officer  or  agent  is  not 
responsible  for  the  misfeasances  or  positive  wrongs,  or  for 
the nonfeasances, or negligences, or omissions of duty, of the 
subagents  or  servants  or  other  persons  properly  employed 
by or under him, in the discharge of his official duties").  Be-
cause  vicarious  liability  is  inapplicable  to  Bivens  and  $ 1983 
suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official de-
fendant, through the official's own individual actions, has vio-
lated the Constitution. 

The  factors  necessary  to  establish  a  Bivens  violation  will 
vary  with  the  constitutional  provision  at  issue.  Where  the 
claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First 
and  Fifth  Amendments,  our  decisions  make  clear  that  the 
plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with 
discriminatory  purpose.  Church  of  Lukumi  Babalu  Aye,

Opinion of the Court 
ing  a  course  of  action  " `because  of,'  not  merely  `in  spite  of,' [the  action's]  adverse  effects  upon  an  identifiable  group." 

Ibid.  It follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a  clearly  established  right,  respondent  must  plead  sufficient 
factual  matter  to  show  that  petitioners  adopted  and  imple-mented  the  detention  policies  at  issue  not  for  a  neutral,  in-
vestigative  reason  but  for  the  purpose  of  discriminating  on account of race, religion, or national origin. 

Respondent disagrees.  He argues that, under a theory of "supervisory  liability,"  petitioners  can  be  liable  for  "knowl-
edge  and  acquiescence  in  their  subordinates'  use  of  dis-criminatory  criteria  to  make  classification  decisions  among 
detainees."  Iqbal  Brief  45-46.  That  is  to  say,  respondent believes  a  supervisor's  mere  knowledge  of  his  subordinate's 
discriminatory purpose amounts to the supervisor's violating the  Constitution.  We  reject  this  argument.  Respondent's 
conception  of  "supervisory  liability"  is  inconsistent  with  his accurate  stipulation  that  petitioners  may  not  be  held  ac-
countable  for  the  misdeeds  of their  agents.  In  a  $ 1983 suit or  a  Bivens  action--where  masters  do  not  answer  for  the 
torts of their  servants--the term "supervisory liability" is  a misnomer.  Absent  vicarious  liability,  each  Government  of-
ficial, his or her title notwithstanding, is only liable for his or her own misconduct.  In the context of determining whether 
there  is  a  violation  of  a  clearly  established  right  to  over-come  qualified  immunity,  purpose  rather  than  knowledge 
is  required  to  impose  Bivens  liability  on  the  subordinate for  unconstitutional  discrimination;  the  same  holds  true  for 
an  official  charged  with  violations  arising  from  his  or  her superintendent responsibilities. 

IV 

A 

We  turn  to  respondent's  complaint.  Under  Federal  Rule of  Civil  Procedure  8(a)(2),  a  pleading  must  contain  a  "short 

and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is

Opinion of the Court 
entitled to relief."  As the Court held in Twombly, 550 U. S. 
544, the pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require 
"detailed  factual  allegations,"  but  it  demands  more  than  an 
unadorned,  the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation. 
Id.,  at  555  (citing  Papasan  v.  Allain,  478  U. S.  265,  286 
(1986)).  A  pleading  that  offers  "labels  and  conclusions"  or 
"a  formulaic  recitation  of  the  elements  of  a  cause  of  action 
will not do."  550 U. S., at 555.  Nor does a complaint suffice 
if  it  tenders  "naked  assertion[s]"  devoid  of  "further  factual 
enhancement."  Id., at 557. 

To  survive  a  motion  to  dismiss,  a  complaint  must  contain 
sufficient  factual  matter,  accepted  as  true,  to  "state  a  claim 
to  relief  that  is  plausible  on  its  face."  Id.,  at  570.  A  claim 
has  facial  plausibility  when  the  plaintiff  pleads  factual  con-
tent  that  allows  the  court  to  draw  the  reasonable  inference 
that the  defendant is liable for  the misconduct alleged.  Id., 
at 556.  The plausibility standard is not akin to a "probabil-
ity requirement,"  but it  asks for more than  a  sheer possibil-
ity  that  a  defendant  has  acted  unlawfully.  Ibid.  Where  a 
complaint  pleads  facts  that  are  "merely  consistent  with"  a 
defendant's liability, it "stops short of the line between possi-
bility  and plausibility  of  `entitlement  to relief.' "  Id.,  at  557 
(brackets omitted). 

Two working principles underlie our decision in Twombly. 
First,  the  tenet  that  a  court  must  accept  as  true  all  of  the 
allegations  contained  in  a  complaint  is  inapplicable  to  legal 
conclusions.  Threadbare recitals of the  elements of a  cause 
of  action,  supported  by  mere  conclusory  statements,  do  not 
suffice.  Id.,  at  555  (Although  for  the  purposes  of  a  motion 
to  dismiss  we  must  take  all  of  the  factual  allegations  in  the 
complaint as true, we "are not bound to accept as true a legal 
conclusion  couched  as  a  factual  allegation"  (internal  quota-
tion marks omitted)).  Rule 8 marks a notable and generous 
departure  from  the  hypertechnical,  code-pleading  regime  of 
a prior era, but it does not unlock the doors of discovery for 

556US2 Unit: $U56 [03-25-14 14:30:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court 
a  plaintiff  armed  with  nothing more  than  conclusions.  Sec-
ond,  only  a  complaint  that  states  a  plausible  claim  for  relief 
survives  a  motion  to  dismiss.  Id.,  at  556.  Determining 
whether  a  complaint  states  a  plausible  claim  for  relief  will, 
as the  Court of Appeals  observed, be a context-specific task 
that requires the  reviewing court to draw on  its judicial ex-
perience  and  common  sense.  490  F.  3d,  at  157-158.  But 
where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer 
more than  the  mere possibility of  misconduct, the  complaint 
has  alleged--but  it  has  not  "show[n]"--"that  the  pleader  is 
entitled to relief."  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(a)(2). 

In keeping with these principles a court considering a mo-
tion  to  dismiss  can  choose  to  begin  by  identifying  pleadings 
that, because they are no more than conclusions, are not enti-
tled to the assumption of truth.  While legal conclusions can 
provide  the  framework  of  a  complaint,  they  must  be  sup-
ported by factual allegations.  When there are well-pleaded 
factual allegations, a court should assume their veracity and 
then  determine  whether  they  plausibly  give  rise  to  an  enti-
tlement to relief. 

Our  decision  in  Twombly  illustrates  the  two-pronged  ap-
proach.  There, we considered the sufficiency of a complaint 
alleging  that  incumbent  telecommunications  providers  had 
entered  an  agreement  not  to  compete  and  to  forestall  com-
petitive  entry,  in  violation  of  the  Sherman  Act,  15  U. S. C. 

$ 1.  Recognizing  that  $ 1  enjoins  only  anticompetitive  con-
duct  "effected  by  a  contract,  combination,  or  conspiracy," 
Copperweld Corp. v.  Independence Tube Corp., 467 U. S. 752, 
775  (1984),  the  plaintiffs  in  Twombly  flatly  pleaded  that 
the  defendants  "ha[d]  entered  into  a  contract,  combination 
or  conspiracy  to  prevent  competitive  entry  .  .  .  and  ha[d] 
agreed  not  to  compete  with one  another."  550  U. S.,  at  551 
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  The  complaint  also  al-
leged that  the  defendants'  "parallel  course  of  conduct . .  . to 
prevent competition" and inflate prices was indicative of the

Opinion of the Court 
unlawful agreement alleged.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted). 

The  Court  held  the  plaintiffs'  complaint  deficient  under Rule  8.  In  doing  so  it  first  noted  that  the  plaintiffs'  asser-
tion of an unlawful agreement was a " `legal conclusion' " and, as  such,  was  not  entitled  to  the  assumption  of  truth. 

Id., at  555.  Had  the  Court  simply  credited  the  allegation  of  a 

conspiracy, the plaintiffs would have stated a claim for relief and  been  entitled  to  proceed  perforce.  The  Court  next 

addressed  the  "nub"  of  the  plaintiffs'  complaint--the  well-pleaded,  nonconclusory  factual  allegation  of  parallel  behav-
ior--to  determine  whether  it  gave  rise  to  a  "plausible  sug-gestion  of  conspiracy."  Id.,  at  565-566.  Acknowledging 
that parallel conduct was consistent with an unlawful agree-ment, the Court nevertheless concluded that it did not plausi-
bly suggest an illicit accord because it was not only compati-ble  with,  but  indeed  was  more  likely  explained  by,  lawful, 
unchoreographed  free-market  behavior.  Id.,  at  567.  Be-cause  the  well-pleaded  fact  of  parallel  conduct,  accepted  as 
true,  did  not  plausibly  suggest  an  unlawful  agreement,  the Court held  the plaintiffs' complaint must be dismissed. 

Id., at 570. 

B 
Under Twombly's construction of Rule 8, we conclude that respondent's complaint has not "nudged [his] claims" of invid-

ious discrimination "across the line from conceivable to plau-sible." 

Ibid. We begin our analysis by identifying the allegations in the 

complaint  that  are  not  entitled  to  the  assumption  of  truth. Respondent pleads  that petitioners "knew of, condoned, and 
willfully  and  maliciously  agreed  to  subject  [him]"  to  harsh conditions  of  confinement  "as  a  matter  of  policy,  solely  on 
account  of  [his]  religion,  race,  and/or  national  origin  and  for no legitimate penological interest."  Complaint || 96, App. to 
Pet.  for  Cert.  173a-174a.  The  complaint  alleges  that  Ash-croft  was  the  "principal  architect"  of  this  invidious  policy,

Opinion of the Court 
id.,  || 10,  at  157a,  and  that  Mueller  was  "instrumental"  in 
adopting and executing it, id., || 11, at 157a.  These bare as-
sertions,  much  like  the  pleading  of  conspiracy  in  Twombly, 
amount  to  nothing  more  than  a  "formulaic  recitation  of  the 
elements"  of  a  constitutional  discrimination  claim,  550  U. S., 
at  555,  namely,  that  petitioners  adopted  a  policy  " `because 
of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identi-
fiable group," Feeney, 442 U. S., at 279.  As such, the allega-
tions  are  conclusory  and  not  entitled  to  be  assumed  true. 
Twombly,  550  U. S.,  at  554-555.  To  be  clear,  we  do  not  re-
ject these bald allegations on the ground that they are unre-
alistic  or  nonsensical.  We  do  not  so  characterize  them  any 
more than the  Court in  Twombly rejected  the plaintiffs' ex-
press allegation of a " `contract, combination or conspiracy to 
prevent  competitive  entry,' "  id.,  at  551,  because  it  thought 
that  claim  too  chimerical  to  be  maintained.  It  is  the  con-
clusory  nature  of  respondent's  allegations,  rather  than  their 
extravagantly  fanciful  nature,  that  disentitles  them  to  the 
presumption of truth. 

We  next  consider  the  factual  allegations  in  respondent's 
complaint  to  determine  if  they  plausibly  suggest  an  entitle-
ment to relief.  The complaint alleges that "the [FBI], under 
the  direction  of  Defendant  MUELLER,  arrested  and  de-
tained thousands of Arab Muslim men . . . as part of its  inves-
tigation  of  the  events  of  September  11."  Complaint  || 47, 
App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  164a.  It  further  claims  that  "[t]he 
policy of holding post-September-11th detainees in highly re-
strictive  conditions  of  confinement  until  they  were  `cleared' 
by  the  FBI  was  approved  by  Defendants  ASHCROFT  and

2001."  Id.,  || 69,  at  168a.  Taken  as  true,  these  allegations 
are consistent with petitioners' purposefully designating de-
tainees  "of  high  interest"  because  of  their  race,  religion,  or 
national origin.  But given more likely explanations, they do 
not plausibly establish this purpose.

682  ASHCROFT  v.  IQBAL 

Opinion of the Court 
The  September  11  attacks  were  perpetrated  by  19  Arab Muslim  hijackers who  counted  themselves  members  in  good 

standing  of  al  Qaeda,  an  Islamic  fundamentalist  group.  Al Qaeda  was  headed  by  another  Arab  Muslim--Osama  bin 
Laden--and composed in large part of his Arab Muslim disci-ples.  It should come as no surprise that a legitimate policy 
directing  law  enforcement  to  arrest  and  detain  individuals 
because of their suspected link to the attacks would produce a disparate, incidental impact on Arab Muslims, even though 

the  purpose  of  the  policy  was  to  target  neither  Arabs  nor Muslims.  On the facts respondent alleges the arrests Muel-
ler  oversaw  were  likely  lawful  and  justified  by  his  nondis-
criminatory  intent  to  detain  aliens  who  were  illegally  pres-
ent  in  the  United  States  and  who  had  potential  connections 
to  those  who  committed  terrorist  acts.  As  between  that 
"obvious  alternative  explanation"  for  the  arrests,  Twombly, 
supra,  at  567,  and  the  purposeful,  invidious  discrimination 
respondent asks us to infer, discrimination is  not a plausible 
conclusion. 

But  even  if  the  complaint's  well-pleaded  facts  give  rise  to 
a  plausible  inference  that  respondent's  arrest  was  the  re-
sult  of  unconstitutional  discrimination,  that  inference  alone 
would  not  entitle  respondent  to  relief.  It  is  important  to 
recall that respondent's complaint challenges neither the con-
stitutionality  of  his  arrest  nor  his  initial  detention  in  the 
MDC.  Respondent's  constitutional  claims  against  petition-
ers  rest  solely  on  their  ostensible  "policy  of  holding  post-
September-11th  detainees"  in  the  ADMAX  SHU  once  they 
were  categorized  as  "of  high  interest."  Complaint  || 69, 
App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  168a.  To  prevail  on  that  theory, 
the complaint must contain facts plausibly showing that peti-
tioners  purposefully  adopted  a  policy  of  classifying  post-
September-11 detainees as "of high interest" because of their 
race, religion, or national origin. 

This the complaint fails to do.  Though respondent alleges 
that  various  other  defendants,  who  are  not  before  us,  may

Opinion of the Court 
have labeled him a person "of high interest" for impermissi-ble reasons, his only factual allegation against petitioners ac-

cuses  them  of  adopting  a  policy  approving  "restrictive conditions  of  confinement"  for  post-September-11  detainees 
until  they  were  " `cleared'  by  the  FBI."  Ibid.  Accepting the  truth of  that allegation,  the  complaint does  not  show,  or 
even  intimate,  that  petitioners  purposefully  housed  detain-
ees  in  the  ADMAX  SHU  due  to  their  race,  religion,  or  na-tional  origin.  All  it  plausibly  suggests  is  that  the  Nation's 

top law enforcement officers, in the aftermath of a devastat-ing  terrorist  attack,  sought  to  keep  suspected  terrorists  in 
the most secure conditions available until the suspects could 
be cleared of terrorist activity.  Respondent does not argue, 
nor can he, that such a motive would violate petitioners' con-
stitutional  obligations.  He  would  need  to  allege  more  by 
way  of  factual  content  to  "nudg[e]"  his  claim  of  purposeful 
discrimination  "across  the  line  from  conceivable  to  plausi-
ble."  Twombly, 550 U. S., at 570. 

To  be  sure,  respondent  can  attempt  to  draw  certain  con-
trasts between the pleadings the Court considered in Twom-
bly  and  the  pleadings  at  issue  here.  In  Twombly,  the 
complaint  alleged  general  wrongdoing  that  extended  over 
a  period  of  years,  id.,  at  551,  whereas  here  the  complaint 
alleges  discrete  wrongs--for  instance,  beatings--by  lower 
level  Government actors.  The allegations  here, if true, and 
if condoned by petitioners, could be the basis for some infer-
ence  of  wrongful  intent  on  petitioners'  part.  Despite  these 
distinctions,  respondent's  pleadings  do  not  suffice  to  state  a 
claim.  Unlike  in  Twombly,  where  the  doctrine  of  respon-
deat  superior  could  bind  the  corporate  defendant,  here,  as 
we  have  noted,  petitioners  cannot  be  held  liable  unless  they 
themselves  acted  on  account  of  a  constitutionally  protected 
characteristic.  Yet respondent's complaint does not contain 
any factual allegation sufficient to plausibly suggest petition-
ers' discriminatory state of mind.  His pleadings thus do not 
meet the standard necessary to comply with Rule 8.

Opinion of the Court 
It is important to note, however, that we express no opin-ion  concerning  the  sufficiency  of  respondent's  complaint 

against the defendants who are not before us.  Respondent's account  of  his  prison  ordeal  alleges  serious  official  miscon-
duct that we need not address here.  Our decision is limited to  the  determination  that  respondent's  complaint  does  not 
entitle him to relief from petitioners. 

C 
Respondent offers three arguments that bear on our dispo-sition of his case, but none is persuasive. 

1 
Respondent first says that our decision in Twombly should be  limited  to  pleadings  made  in  the  context  of  an  antitrust 

dispute.  Iqbal  Brief  37-38.  This  argument  is  not  sup-ported  by  Twombly  and  is  incompatible  with  the  Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure.  Though Twombly determined the sufficiency  of a  complaint sounding  in  antitrust,  the  decision 
was  based  on  our  interpretation  and  application  of  Rule  8. 550  U. S.,  at  554.  That  Rule  in  turn  governs  the  pleading 
standard  "in  all  civil  actions  and  proceedings  in  the  United States  district  courts."  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  1.  Our  deci-
sion  in  Twombly  expounded  the  pleading  standard  for  "all civil actions," 

ibid., and it applies to antitrust and discrimina-tion suits alike, see 550 U. S., at 555-556, and n. 3. 

2 
Respondent  next  implies  that  our  construction  of  Rule  8 should be tempered where, as here, the Court of Appeals has 

"instructed  the  district  court  to  cabin  discovery  in  such  a way  as  to  preserve"  petitioners'  defense  of  qualified  immu-
nity "as much as possible in anticipation of a summary judg-ment  motion."  Iqbal  Brief  27.  We  have  held,  however, 
that  the  question  presented  by  a  motion  to  dismiss  a  com-plaint for insufficient pleadings does not turn on the controls

Opinion of the Court 
placed upon the discovery process.  Twombly, supra, at 559 ("It  is  no  answer  to  say  that  a  claim  just  shy  of  a  plausible 

entitlement  to  relief  can,  if  groundless,  be  weeded  out  early in  the  discovery  process  through  careful  case  management 
given the common lament that the success of judicial supervi-sion  in  checking  discovery  abuse  has  been  on  the  modest 
side" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Our rejection  of the  careful-case-management approach  is 
especially  important  in  suits  where  Government-official  de-
fendants are entitled to assert the defense of qualified immu-nity.  The basic thrust  of the  qualified-immunity doctrine  is 

to  free  officials  from  the  concerns  of  litigation,  including 
"avoidance  of  disruptive  discovery."  Siegert  v.  Gilley,  500 
U. S. 226, 236  (1991) (Kennedy,

556US2 Unit: $U56 [03-25-14 14:30:08] PAGES PGT: OPIN
686  ASHCROFT  v.  IQBAL 

Opinion of the Court 
if  petitioners  are  not  yet  themselves  subject  to  discovery orders,  then,  they  would  not  be  free  from  the  burdens  of 

discovery. We  decline  respondent's  invitation  to  relax  the  pleading 
requirements on the ground that the Court of Appeals prom-ises  petitioners  minimally  intrusive  discovery.  That  prom-
ise provides especially cold comfort in this pleading context, where we are impelled to give real content to the concept of 
qualified  immunity  for  high-level  officials  who  must  be  nei-ther  deterred  nor  detracted  from  the  vigorous  performance 
of  their  duties.  Because  respondent's  complaint  is  deficient under  Rule  8,  he  is  not  entitled  to  discovery,  cabined  or 
otherwise.  3 

Respondent  finally  maintains  that  the  Federal  Rules  ex-pressly allow him to allege petitioners' discriminatory intent 
"generally,"  which  he  equates  with  a  conclusory  allegation. Iqbal  Brief  32  (citing  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  9).  It  follows, 
respondent  says,  that  his  complaint  is  sufficiently  well pleaded  because  it  claims  that  petitioners  discriminated 
against him "on account of [his] religion, race, and/or national origin  and  for  no  legitimate  penological  interest."  Com-
plaint  || 96,  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  172a-173a.  Were  we required  to  accept  this  allegation  as  true,  respondent's 
complaint would survive petitioners' motion to dismiss.  But the  Federal  Rules  do  not  require  courts  to  credit  a  com-
plaint's  conclusory  statements  without  reference  to  its  fac-tual context. 

It is true that Rule 9(b) requires particularity when plead-ing  "fraud  or  mistake,"  while  allowing  "[m]alice,  intent, 
knowledge,  and  other  conditions  of  a  person's  mind  [to]  be alleged  generally."  But  "generally"  is  a  relative  term.  In 
the context of Rule 9, it is to be compared to the particularity requirement  applicable  to  fraud  or  mistake.  Rule  9  merely 
excuses  a  party  from  pleading  discriminatory  intent  under an elevated pleading standard.  It does not give him license

Syllabus 
(a)  AT&T's benefit calculation rule is protected by $ 703(h), which pro-
vides:  "[I]t  shall  not  be  an  unlawful  employment  practice  for  an  em-
ployer  to  apply  different  standards  of  compensation  .  .  .  pursuant  to  a 
bona  fide  seniority . . .  system  .  .  .  provided  that  such  differences  are 
not  the  result  of  an  intention  to  discriminate  because  of  .  .  .  sex."  In 
Teamsters  v.  United  States,  431  U. S.  324,  356,  the  Court  held  that  a 
pre-Title  VII  seniority  system  that  disproportionately  advantaged 
white,  as  against  minority,  employees  nevertheless  exemplified  a  bona 
fide system without any discriminatory terms under $ 703(h), where the 
discrimination resulted from the employer's hiring practices and job as-
signments.  Because AT&T's system must also be viewed as bona fide, 
i. e.,  as  a  system  having  no  discriminatory  terms,  $ 703(h)  controls  the 
result here, just as it did in Teamsters.  This Court held in Gilbert that 
an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit for time taken for pregnancy 
leave did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex.  As a matter 
of law, at that time, "an exclusion of pregnancy from a disability-benefits 
plan providing general coverage [was] not a gender-based discrimination 
at all."  429 U. S., at 136.  The only way to conclude that $ 703(h) does 
not protect AT&T's system would be to read the PDA as applying retro-
actively to recharacterize AT&T's acts as having been illegal when done. 
This  is  not  a  serious  possibility.  Generally,  there  is  "a  presumption 
against  retroactivity  [unless]  Congress  itself  has  affirmatively  consid-
ered the potential unfairness  of retroactive application and determined 
that  it  is  an  acceptable  price  to  pay  for  the  countervailing  benefits." 
Landgraf  v.  USI  Film  Products,  511  U. S.  244,  272-273.  There  is  no 
such  clear  intent  here.  Section  706(e)(2)--which  details  when  "an  un-
lawful  employment  practice  occurs,  with  respect  to  a  seniority  system 
that has been adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose"--has 
no  application  because  Gilbert  unquestionably  held  that  the  feature  of 
AT&T's  seniority  system  at  issue  here  was  not  discriminatory  when 
adopted,  let  alone intentionally so.  Nor  can it  be argued  that because 
AT&T could have chosen to give post-PDA credit to pre-PDA pregnancy 
leave when Hulteen retired, its failure to do so was facially discrimina-
tory  at  that  time.  If  a  choice  to  rely  on  a  favorable  statute  turned 
every  past  differentiation  into  contemporary  discrimination,  $ 703(h) 
would  never  apply.  Finally,  Bazemore  v.  Friday,  478  U. S.  385--in 
which  a  pre-Title  VII  compensation  plan  giving  black  employees  less 
pay  than  whites  was  held  to  violate  Title  VII  on  its  effective  date--is 
inapplicable because the Bazemore plan did not involve a seniority sys-
tem  subject  to  $ 703(h)  and  the  employer  there  failed  to  eliminate  the 
discriminatory practice when Title VII became law.  Pp. 707-715.

inatory compensation decision or other practice."  Pp. 715-716.

as  the  period  of  service  at  the  company  minus  uncredited leave time.

2 

In  the  1960s  and  early  to  mid-1970s,  AT&T  employees  on "disability" leave got full service credit for the entire periods 

of  absence,  but  those  who  took  "personal"  leaves  of  absence received  maximum  service  credit  of  30  days.  Leave  for 
pregnancy was treated as personal, not disability.  AT&T al-tered  this  practice  in  1977  by  adopting  its  Maternity  Pay-
ment Plan (MPP), entitling pregnant employees to disability benefits  and  service  credit  for  up  to  six  weeks  of  leave.  If 
the absence went beyond six weeks, however, it was treated as personal leave, with no further benefits or credit, whereas 
employees  out  on  disability  unrelated  to  pregnancy  contin-ued to receive full service credit for the duration of absence. 
This  differential  treatment  of  pregnancy  leave,  under  both the pre-1977 plan and the MPP, was lawful: in General Elec. 
Co.  v.  Gilbert,  429  U. S.  125  (1976),  this  Court  concluded that  a  disability-benefits  plan  excluding  disabilities  related 
to  pregnancy  was  not  sex-based  discrimination  within  the meaning of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 
253, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e et seq. In 1978, Congress amended Title VII by passing the PDA, 
92  Stat.  2076,  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000e(k),  which  superseded  Gil-bert so as to make it  "clear that  it is  discriminatory to treat 
pregnancy-related conditions less favorably than other medi-cal  conditions."  Newport  News  Shipbuilding  &  Dry  Dock 
Co.  v.  EEOC,  462  U. S.  669,  684  (1983).  On  April  29,  1979, the effective date of the PDA, AT&T adopted its Anticipated 
Disability Plan which replaced the MPP and provided service credit  for  pregnancy  leave  on  the  same  basis  as  leave  taken 
for  other  temporary  disabilities.  AT&T  did  not,  however, 

2 AT&T's  calculation  of  a  term  of  employment  is  a  more  complicated 
endeavor,  requiring  the  creation  and  maintenance  of  an  individual  "start 
date"  for  each  employee,  which  is  adjusted  based  on  the  relevant  leave 
policy.

Opinion of the Court 
make any retroactive adjustments to the service credit calcu-lations of women who had been subject to the pre-PDA per-

sonnel policies. Four  of  those  women  are  named  respondents  in  this  case. 
Each of them received less service credit for pregnancy leave than she would have accrued on the same leave for disability: 
seven months  less for Noreen Hulteen; about six months  for 
Eleanora  Collet;  and  about  two  for  Elizabeth  Snyder  and Linda  Porter.  Respondents  Hulteen,  Collet,  and  Snyder 

have  retired  from  AT&T;  respondent  Porter  has  yet  to.  If her  total  term  of  employment  had  not  been  decreased  due 
to  her  pregnancy  leave,  each  would  be  entitled  to  a  greater 
pension benefit. 

Eventually,  each  of  the  individual  respondents  and  re-
spondent  Communications  Workers  of  America  (CWA),  the 
collective-bargaining  representative  for  the  majority  of 
AT&T's nonmanagement employees, filed charges of discrim-
ination  with  the  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Commis-
sion (EEOC), alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and 
pregnancy  in  violation  of  Title  VII.  In  1998,  the  EEOC  is-
sued  a  Letter  of  Determination  finding  reasonable  cause  to 
believe  that  AT&T  had  discriminated  against  respondent 
Hulteen  and  "a  class  of  other  similarly-situated  female  em-
ployees whose  adjusted [commencement of service] date has 
been  used  to  determine  eligibility  for  a  service  or  disability 
pension,  the  amount  of  pension  benefits,  and  eligibility  for 
certain  other  benefits  and  programs,  including  early  retire-
ment  offerings."  App.  54-55.  The  EEOC  issued  a  notice 
of right to sue to each named respondent and the CWA (col-
lectively,  Hulteen),  and  Hulteen  filed  suit  in  the  United 
States District Court for the Northern District of California. 

On  dueling  motions  for  summary  judgment,  the  District 
Court  held  itself  bound  by  a  prior  Ninth  Circuit  decision, 
Pallas  v.  Pacific  Bell,  940  F.  2d  1324  (1991),  which  found 
a  Title  VII  violation  where  post-PDA  retirement  eligibility 
calculations  incorporated  pre-PDA  accrual  rules  that  differ-

Opinion of the Court 
entiated  on  the  basis  of  pregnancy.  See  App.  to  Pet.  for Cert.  121a-122a.  The  Circuit,  en  banc,  affirmed  and  held 

that Pallas's conclusion that "calculation of service credit ex-cluding  time  spent  on  pregnancy  leave  violates  Title  VII 
was, and is, correct."  498 F. 3d 1001, 1003 (2007). The  Ninth  Circuit's  decision  directly  conflicts  with  the 
holdings of the Sixth and Seventh Circuits that reliance on a pre-PDA differential accrual rule to determine pension bene-
fits does not constitute a current violation of Title VII.  See 
Ameritech Benefit Plan Comm. v.  Communication Workers of Am., 220 F. 3d 814 (CA7 2000) (finding no actionable Title 

VII violation given the existence of a bona fide seniority sys-tem);  Leffman  v.  Sprint  Corp.,  481  F.  3d  428  (CA6  2007) 
(characterizing claim as challenging the continuing effects of past  discrimination  rather  than  alleging  a  current  Title  VII 
violation).  We  granted  certiorari  in  order  to  resolve  this split,  554  U. S.  916  (2008),  and  now  reverse  the  judgment  of 
the Ninth Circuit.  II 

Title  VII makes  it  an  "unlawful  employment  practice"  for an employer "to discriminate against any individual with re-
spect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,  because  of  such  individual's  .  .  .  sex."  42 
U. S. C.  $ 2000e-2(a)(1).  Generally,  a  claim  under  Title  VII must be filed "within one hundred and eighty days after the 
alleged  unlawful  employment  practice  occurred,"  $ 2000e- 5(e)(1).  In  this  case,  Hulteen  has  identified  the  challenged 
practice  as  applying  the  terms  of  AT&T's  seniority  system to  calculate  and  pay  pension  benefits  to  women  who  took 
pregnancy leaves before April 29, 1979.  She says the claim is timely because the old service credit differential for preg-
nancy leave was carried forward through the system's calcu-lations so as to produce an effect in the amount of the benefit 
when payments began. There  is no  question that the payment  of pension benefits 
in this case is a function of a seniority system, given the fact

Opinion of the Court 
that  calculating  benefits  under  the  pension  plan  depends  in 
part  on  an  employee's  term  of  employment.  As  we  have 
said, "[a] `seniority system' is a scheme that, alone or in tan-
dem  with  non-`seniority'  criteria,  allots  to  employees  ever 
improving  employment  rights  and  benefits  as  their  relative 
lengths of pertinent employment increase."  Cali fornia 
Brewers Assn. v.  Bryant, 444 U. S. 598, 605-606 (1980) (foot-
note omitted).  Hulteen is also undoubtedly correct that 
AT&T's personnel policies affecting the calculation of any 
employee's  start  date  should  be  considered  "ancillary  rules" 
and elements of the system, necessary for it to operate at all, 
being  rules  that  "define  which  passages  of  time  will  `count' 
towards  the  accrual  of  seniority  and  which  will  not."  Id., 
at 607. 

But  contrary  to  Hulteen's  position,  establishing  the  conti-
nuity  of  a seniority  system  whose  results  depend  in  part  on 
obsolete  rules  entailing  disadvantage  to  once-pregnant  em-
ployees does not resolve this case.  Although adopting a 
service  credit  rule  unfavorable  to  those  out  on  pregnancy 
leave would violate  Title VII today, a  seniority system does 
not  necessarily  violate  the  statute  when  it  gives  current  ef-
fect to such rules that operated before the PDA.  "[S]enior-
ity systems are afforded special treatment under Title VII," 
Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.  Hardison, 432 U. S. 63,  81 
(1977), reflecting Congress's understanding that their stabil-
ity is valuable in its own right.  Hence, $ 703(h): 

"Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchap-
ter,  it  shall  not  be an  unlawful  employment  practice  for 
an  employer  to  apply  different  standards  of  compensa-
tion,  or  different  terms,  conditions,  or  privileges  of  em-
ployment  pursuant  to  a  bona  fide  seniority  .  .  .  system 
.  .  .  provided  that  such  differences  are  not  the  result 
of  an  intention  to  discriminate  because  of  race,  color, 
religion,  sex,  or  national  origin  .  .  .  ."  42  U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court 
Benefit differentials produced by a bona fide seniority-based pension plan are permitted unless they are "the result of an 

intention to discriminate."  Ibid.3 In  Teamsters  v.  United  States,  431  U. S.  324  (1977),  ad-
vantages  of  a  seniority  system  flowed  disproportionately  to white, as against minority, employees, because of an employ-
er's prior discrimination in job assignments.  We recognized that  this  "disproportionate  distribution  of  advantages  does 
in a very real sense operate to freeze the status quo of prior 

3 Section  701(k)  of  Title  VII  provides  that  "women  affected  by  preg-
nancy . . . shall be treated the same for all employment-related purposes, 
including  receipt  of  benefits  under  fringe benefit  programs, as  other  per-
sons  not  so  affected  but  similar  in  their  ability  or  inability  to  work,  and 
nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted to permit other-
wise."  42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(k).  Hulteen contends that, in light of this lan-
guage, $ 703(h) does not apply at all to claims of fringe-benefit discrimina-
tion  under  the  PDA.  We  cannot  agree.  Hulteen's  reading  would  result 
in the odd scenario that pregnancy discrimination, alone among all catego-
ries  of  discrimination  (race,  color,  religion,  other  sex-based  claims,  and 
national  origin),  would  receive  dispensation  from  the  general  application 
of subsection (h). 

A better explanation is that $ 701(k) refers only to the final sentence of 

$ 703(h), which reads that "[i]t shall not be an unlawful employment prac-
tice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis 
of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to 
be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized 
by  the  provisions  of  section  206(d)  of  title  29."  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000e-2(h). 
This  final  sentence  of  subsection  (h),  referred  to  as  the  Bennett  Amend-
ment, served to reconcile the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 77 Stat. 56, 29 U. S. C. 

$ 206(d), with Title VII.  See County of Washington v.  Gunther, 452 U. S. 
161, 194 (1981) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  In General Elec. Co. v.  Gilbert, 
429 U. S. 125 (1976), this Court had concluded that the amendment permit-
ted wage discrimination based on pregnancy.  Id., at 144-145.  By adding 
the language, "nothing in section [703(h)] of this title shall be interpreted 
to permit otherwise," to the PDA, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000e(k), Congress wanted 
to  ensure  that,  in  addition  to  replacing  Gilbert  with  a  rule  that  discrim-
ination  on  the  basis  of  pregnancy  is  sex  discrimination,  it  foreclosed  the 
possibility  that  this  Court's  interpretation  of  the  Bennett  Amendment 
could  be  construed,  going  forward,  to  permit  wage  discrimination  based 
on pregnancy.

Opinion of the Court 
discriminatory  employment  practices[,  b]ut  both  the  literal terms of $ 703(h) and the legislative history of Title VII dem-

onstrate  that  Congress  considered  this  very  effect  of  many seniority  systems  and  extended  a  measure  of  immunity 
to  them."  Id.,  at  350  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted). "[T]he  unmistakable  purpose  of  $ 703(h)  was  to  make  clear 
that  the  routine  application  of  a  bona  fide  seniority  system would  not  be  unlawful  under  Title  VII." 

Id.,  at  352.  The seniority system in Teamsters exemplified a bona fide system 

without any discriminatory terms (the discrimination having occurred in executive action hiring employees and assigning 
jobs),  so that  the  Court  could  conclude  that  the  system  "did not  have  its  genesis  in . . .  discrimination,  and  .  .  .  has  been 
maintained free from any illegal purpose."  Id., at 356. AT&T's  system  must  also  be  viewed  as  bona  fide,  that  is, 
as a system that has no discriminatory terms, with the conse-quence that subsection (h) controls the result here, just as in 
Teamsters.  It  is  true  that  in  this  case  the  pre-April  29, 1979,  rule  of  differential  treatment  was  an  element  of  the 
seniority system itself; but it did not taint the system under the  terms  of  subsection  (h),  because  this  Court  held  in 

Gil-bert that an accrual rule limiting the seniority credit for time 

taken for pregnancy leave did not unlawfully discriminate on the basis of sex.  As a matter of law, at that time, "an exclu-
sion  of  pregnancy  from  a  disability-benefits  plan  providing general coverage [was] not  a gender-based discrimination at 
all."  429  U. S.,  at  136.4  Although  the  PDA  would  have 

4 Gilbert recognized that differential  treatment could still represent in-
tentionally  discriminatory  treatment  if  pretextual,  429  U. S.,  at  136,  and 
that  a  forbidden  discriminatory  effect  could  result  if  a  disability-benefits 
plan produced overall preferential treatment for one sex, id., at 138.  Nei-
ther theory is advanced here. 

In  Nashville  Gas  Co.  v.  Satty,  434  U. S.  136  (1977),  we  reaffirmed  our 
holding  in  Gilbert  that  Title  VII  "did  not  require  that  greater  economic 
benefits be paid to one sex or the other `because of their differing roles in 
"the  scheme  of  human  existence." ' "  Id.,  at  142  (quoting  Gilbert,  supra, 
at 139, n. 17).  But we noted that Gilbert's holding did not extend to "per-

Opinion of the Court 
made it discriminatory to continue the accrual policies of the old rule, AT&T amended that rule as of the effective date of 

the Act, April 29, 1979; the new one, treating pregnancy and other temporary disabilities the same way, remains a part of 
AT&T's seniority system today. This  account  of  litigation,  legislation,  and  the  evolution  of 
the system's terms is the answer to Hulteen's argument that 
Teamsters  supports  her  position.  She  correctly  points  out that a  "seniority system that perpetuates  the effects of preAct discrimination cannot be bona fide if an intent to discrim-inate entered into its very adoption," 431 U. S., at 346, n. 28, 
and  she  would  characterize  AT&T's  seniority  system  as  in-tentionally  discriminatory,  on  the  theory  that  the  accrual 
rule for pregnancy leave was facially discriminatory from the start.  She  claims  further  support  from 

Automobile  Work-ers  v.  Johnson  Controls,  Inc.,  499  U. S.  187  (1991),  in  which 

we  said  that  "explicit  facial  discrimination  does  not  depend on why the employer discriminates but rather on the explicit 
terms of the discrimination," and that such facial discrimina-tion  is  intentional  discrimination  even  if  not  based  on  any 
underlying  malevolence.  Id.,  at  199.  Hulteen  accordingly claims that the superseded differential affecting current ben-
efits  was,  and  remains,  "discriminatory  in  precisely  the  way the PDA prohibits," Brief for Respondents 18. 

But  Automobile  Workers  is  not  on  point.  The  policy  in that case, prohibiting women from working in jobs with lead 
exposure  unless  they  could  show  themselves  incapable  of childbearing, was put in place after the PDA became law and 
under  its  terms  was  facially  discriminatory.  In  this  case, however,  AT&T's  intent  when  it  adopted  the  pregnancy 
leave  rule  (before  the  PDA)  was  to  give  differential  treat-
mit an employer to burden female employees in such a way as to deprive 
them of employment opportunities because of their different role."  Satty, 
supra, at 142.  Cancellation of benefits previously accrued, therefore, was 
considered  facially  violative  at  the  time,  but  such  a  situation  is  not  pre-
sented here.

Opinion of the Court 
ment  that  as  a  matter  of  law,  as  Gilbert  held,  was  not gender-based discrimination.  Because AT&T's differen-

tial  accrual  rule  was  therefore  a  permissible  differentiation given the law at the time, there was nothing in the seniority 
system  at  odds  with  the  subsection  (h)  bona  fide  require-ment.  The  consequence  is  that  subsection  (h)  is  as  applica-
ble here as it was in Teamsters, and the calculations of cred-
ited  service  that  determine  pensions  are  the  results  of  a permissibly different standard under subsection (h) today.

5 

The  only  way  to  conclude  here  that  the  subsection  would not  support  the  application  of  AT&T's  system  would  be  to 

read the PDA as applying retroactively to recharacterize the acts as having been illegal when done, contra 

Gilbert.6  But 
this is not a serious possibility.  As we have said: 

"Because  it  accords  with  widely  held  intuitions  about 
how  statutes  ordinarily  operate,  a  presumption  against retroactivity will generally coincide with legislative and 

public  expectations.  Requiring  clear  intent  assures that Congress itself has affirmatively considered the po-
tential  unfairness  of  retroactive  application  and  deter-mined that it is an acceptable price to pay for the coun-

5 Although  certain  Courts  of  Appeals  had  previously  concluded  that 
treating pregnancy leave less favorably than other disability leave consti-
tuted  sex  discrimination  under  Title  VII,  this  Court  in  Gilbert  clearly 
rejected that conclusion, 429 U. S., at 147 (Brennan, J., dissenting); see also

tervailing  benefits."  Landgraf  v.  USI  Film  Products, 511 U. S. 244, 272-273 (1994). 

There  is  no  such  clear  intent  here,  indeed,  no  indication  at all  that  Congress  had  retroactive  application  in  mind;  the 
evidence  points  the  other  way.  Congress  provided  for  the PDA  to  take  effect  on  the  date  of  enactment,  except  in  its 
application to certain benefit programs, as to which effective-ness  was  held  back  180  days.  Act  of  Oct.  31,  1978,  $ 2(b), 
92  Stat.  2076,  note  following  42  U. S. C.  $ 2000e(k)  (1976  ed., Supp.  III).  The  House  Report  adverted  to  these  benefit 
schemes: 

"As  the  Gilbert  decision  permits  employers  to  exclude pregnancy-related coverage from employee benefit 

plans,  [the  bill]  provides  for  [a]  transition  period  of  180 days to allow employees 

[sic] to comply with the explicit provisions of this amendment.  It is the committee's in-

tention  to  provide  for  an  orderly  and  equitable  transi-tion,  with  the  least  disruption  for  employers  and  em-
ployees, consistent with the purposes of the bill."  H. R. Rep. No. 95-948, p. 8 (1978). 

This  is the  language of prospective  intent, not retrospective revision. 

Hulteen  argues  that  she  nonetheless  has  a  challenge  to AT&T's current payment of pension benefits under $ 706(e)(2) 
of Title VII, believing (again mistakenly) that this subsection affects  the  validity  of  any  arrangement  predating  the  PDA 
that  would  be  facially  discriminatory  if  instituted  today. Brief  for  Respondents  27-29.  Section  706(e)(2)  provides 
that 

"an  unlawful  employment  practice  occurs,  with  respect to a seniority system that has been adopted for an inten-

tionally  discriminatory  purpose  in  violation  of  this  sub-chapter  (whether  or  not  that  discriminatory  purpose  is 
apparent  on  the  face  of  the  seniority  provision),  when

Opinion of the Court 
the  seniority  system  is  adopted,  when  an  individual  be-comes subject to the seniority system, or when a person 

aggrieved  is  injured  by  the  application  of  the  senior-ity  system  or  provision  of  the  system."  42  U. S. C. 

$ 2000e-5(e)(2). 
But, as the text makes clear, this subsection determines the moments at which a seniority system violates Title VII only 

if it is a system "adopted for an intentionally discriminatory purpose  in  violation of this subchapter. "  As discussed 
above, the Court has unquestionably held that the feature of AT&T's  seniority  system  at  issue  was  not  discriminatory 
when  adopted,  let  alone  intentionally  so  in  violation  of  this subchapter.  That  leaves  $ 706(e)(2)  without  any  application 
here. It  is  equally  unsound  for  Hulteen  to  argue  that  when  she 
retired  AT&T  could  have  chosen  to give  post-PDA  credit  to pre-PDA pregnancy leave, making its failure to do so facially 
discriminatory  at  that time.7  If  a  choice  to  rely on  a  favor-able statute turned every past differentiation into contempo-
rary discrimination, subsection (h) would never apply. Hulteen's remaining argument (as of the time the case was 
submitted to us) is that our decision  in Bazemore v.  Friday, 478  U. S.  385  (1986) 

(per  curiam),  is  on  her  side.  In  Baze-
more,  black  employees  of  the  North  Carolina  Agricultural Extension  Service,  who  received  less  pay  than  comparable 

whites  under  a  differential  compensation  plan  extending 
back to pre-Title VII segregation, brought suit in 1971 claim-ing that pay disparities persisted. 

Id., at 389-391 (Brennan, 
J.,  concurring  in  part).  We  concluded  that  "[a]  pattern  or practice that would have constituted a violation of Title VII, 

but for the fact that the statute had not yet become effective, 

7 To  the  extent  Hulteen  means  to  claim,  as  a  factual  matter,  that  the 
accrual  rule  was  merely  advisory,  requiring  a  fresh  choice  to  apply  it  in 
the  benefit  context,  she  points  to  nothing  in  the  record  supporting  such 
a proposition.

Opinion of the Court 
became a violation upon Title VII's effective date, and to the 
extent an  employer  continued to  engage in that  act  or prac-
tice, it is liable under that statute."  Id., at 395. 

Bazemore  has  nothing  to  say  here.  To  begin  with,  it  did 
not  involve  a  seniority  system  subject  to  subsection  (h); 
rather,  the  employer  in  Bazemore  had  a  racially  based  pay 
structure  under  which  black  employees  were  paid  less  than 
white  employees.  Further, after  Title  VII  became  law,  the 
employer  failed  to  eliminate  the  discriminatory  practice, 
even  though  the  new  statute  had  turned  what  once  was 
legally permissible into something unlawful.  Bazemore 
would be on point only if, after the PDA, AT&T continued to 
apply  an  unfavorable  credit  differential  for  pregnancy  leave 
simply  because  it  had  begun  to  do  that  before  the  PDA. 
AT&T's  system,  by  contrast,  provides  future  benefits  based 
on  past,  completed  events,  that  were  entirely  lawful  at  the 
time they occurred.

We  have  accepted  supplemental  briefing  after  the  argu-

dealing specifically with discrimination in compensation: 

"For purposes of this section, an unlawful employment

pensation in violation of this title, when a discriminatory 
compensation decision or other practice is adopted, when 
an  individual  becomes  subject  to  a  discriminatory  com-
pensation decision or other practice, or when an individ-
ual  is  affected  by  application  of  a  discriminatory  com-
pensation decision or other practice, including each time

tion  of  a  criminal  defendant  once  he  has  requested  counsel at an arraignment or similar proceeding. 

I 
Petitioner  Jesse  Montejo  was  arrested  on  September  6, 2002,  in  connection  with  the  robbery  and  murder  of  Lewis 

Ferrari,  who  had  been  found  dead  in  his  own  home  one  day earlier.  Suspicion  quickly  focused  on  Jerry  Moore,  a  dis-
gruntled former employee of Ferrari's dry cleaning business. Police sought to question Montejo, who was a known associ-
ate of Moore. Montejo waived his rights under

"facilitating"  to  cause  that  12-fold  quantum  leap  in  punish-ment for simple drug possessors.

3 

The Government suggests that this background usage and the 1970 choice to reduce culpability for possession is beside 

the  point  because  Congress  sometimes  incorporates  aggra-vating  factors  into  the  Criminal  Code,  and  the  phone  use 
here  is  just  one  of  them;  the  Government  mentions  posses-
sion  by  a  prior  drug  offender,  a  felony  punishable  by  up  to two years' imprisonment.  And, for perspective, the Govern-

ment  points  to  unauthorized  possession  of  flunitrazepam,  a drug  used  to  incapacitate  rape  victims,  which  is  punishable 
by imprisonment up to three years.  Brief for United States 20.  It would not be strange, the Government says, for Con-
gress  to  "decid[e]  to  treat  the  use  of  a  communication  fa-cility  in  a  drug  transaction  as  a  significant  act  warranting 
additional  punishment"  because  "[t]oday's  communication facilities . . .  make  illicit  drug  transactions  easier  and  more 
efficient  . . . [and]  greatly  reduce  the  risk  that  the  partici-
pants will be detected while negotiating a transaction."  Id.,

from  trying  Ashe  for  robbing  a  poker  player  because  he  had  already

Shortly thereafter, the United States Court of Appeals for the  District  of  Columbia  Circuit  had  occasion  to  consider 
whether that Presidential action had the  effect of rendering inapplicable to Iraq the terrorism exception to foreign sover-
eign immunity.  The court concluded in a divided panel deci-sion  that  the  President's  EWSAA  authority  did  not  permit 
him to waive $ 1605(a)(7), and thereby restore sovereign im-munity  to  Iraq,  for  claims  arising  from  acts  it  had  taken

cause  he  received  a  salary  supplement  for  performing  judicial  duties 
that was funded from the fines assessed, he received a supplement only 
upon  a  conviction;  and  sums  from  the  fines  were  deposited  to  the  vil-
lage's general treasury fund for village improvements and repairs.  Dis-
qualification  was  required  under  the  principle  that  "[e]very  procedure 
which would offer a possible temptation to the average man as a judge 
to forget the burden of proof required to convict the defendant, or which 
might lead him not to hold the balance nice, clear and true between the 
State and the accused, denies the latter due process of law."  273 U. S., 
at  532.  In  Ward  v.  Monroeville,  409  U. S.  57,  a  conviction  in  another 
mayor's court was invalidated even though the fines assessed went only 
to the town's general fisc, because the mayor faced a " `possible tempta-
tion' "  created  by  his  "executive  responsibilities  for  village  finances." 
Id.,  at  60.  Recusal  was  also  required  where  an  Alabama  Supreme 
Court Justice cast the deciding vote upholding a punitive damages award 
while he was the lead plaintiff in a nearly identical suit pending in Ala-
bama's lower courts.  Aetna Life Ins. Co.  v.  Lavoie, 475 U. S. 813.  The 
proper constitutional inquiry was not "whether in fact [the justice] was 
influenced," id.,  at  825,  but  "whether  sitting on  [that]  case  . . .  ` "would 
offer a possible temptation to the average . . .  judge to . . . lead him not 
to hold the balance nice, clear and true," ' " ibid.  While the "degree or 
kind  of  interest  .  .  .  sufficient  to  disqualify  a  judge  .  .  .  `[could  not]  be 
defined with precision,' " id., at 822, the test did have an objective com-
ponent.  Pp. 877-879. 

(2)  The second instance emerged in the criminal contempt context, 
where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but had determined 
in  an  earlier  proceeding  whether  criminal  charges  should  be  brought 
and  then  proceeded  to  try  and  convict  the  petitioners.  In  re  Murchi-
son,  349  U. S.  133.  Finding  that  "no  man  can  be  a  judge  in  his  own 
case,"  and  "no  man  is  permitted  to  try  cases  where  he  has  an  interest 
in  the  outcome,"  id.,  at  136,  the  Court  noted  that  the  circumstances  of 
the case and the prior relationship required recusal.  The judge's prior 
relationship  with  the  defendant,  as  well  as  the  information  acquired 
from  the  prior  proceeding,  was  critical.  In  reiterating  that  the  rule 
that  "a  defendant  in  criminal  contempt  proceedings  should  be  [tried] 
before a judge other than the one reviled by the contemnor," Mayberry 
v.  Pennsylvania,  400  U. S.  455,  466,  rests  on  the  relationship  between 
the judge and the defendant, id., at 465, the Court noted that the objec-
tive  inquiry  is  not  whether  the  judge  is  actually  biased,  but  whether 
the  average  judge  in  his  position  is  likely  to  be  neutral  or  there  is  an 
unconstitutional " `potential for bias,' " id., at 466.  Pp. 880-881. 

(b)  Because  the  objective  standards  implementing  the  Due  Process 
Clause do not require proof of actual bias, this Court does not question 
Justice Benjamin's subjective findings of impartiality and propriety and

Syllabus 
need  not  determine whether  there  was  actual bias.  Rather,  the  ques-
tion is whether, "under a realistic appraisal of psychological tendencies 
and human  weakness," the interest "poses such a  risk of actual bias or 
prejudgment  that  the  practice  must  be  forbidden  if  the  guarantee  of 
due  process  is  to  be  adequately  implemented."  Withrow,  421  U. S., 
at 47.  There is a serious risk of actual bias when a person with a per-
sonal  stake  in  a  particular  case  had  a  significant  and  disproportionate 
influence in placing the judge on the  case by raising funds or directing 
the judge's election campaign when the case was pending or imminent. 
The proper inquiry centers on the contribution's relative size in compari-
son  to  the  total  amount  contributed  to  the  campaign,  the  total  amount 
spent  in  the  election,  and  the  apparent  effect  of  the  contribution  on 
the outcome.  It is not whether the contributions were a necessary and 
sufficient cause of Benjamin's victory.  In an election decided by fewer 
than  50,000  votes,  Blankenship's  campaign  contributions--compared  to 
the  total  amount  contributed  to  the  campaign,  as  well  as  the  total 
amount  spent  in  the  election--had  a  significant  and  disproportionate 
influence  on  the  outcome.  And  the  risk  that  Blankenship's  influence 
engendered actual bias is sufficiently substantial that it "must be forbid-
den  if  the  guarantee  of  due  process  is  to  be  adequately  implemented." 
Ibid.  The  temporal  relationship  between  the  campaign  contributions, 
the justice's election, and the pendency of the case is also critical, for it 
was  reasonably  foreseeable  that  the  pending  case  would  be  before  the 
newly  elected justice.  There  is  no  allegation of  a quid  pro quo  agree-
ment,  but  the  extraordinary  contributions  were  made  at  a  time  when 
Blankenship  had a  vested  stake  in  the  outcome.  Just  as  no  man is  al-
lowed  to  be  a  judge  in  his  own  cause,  similar  fears  of  bias  can  arise 
when--without  the other parties'  consent--a man chooses the judge  in 
his own cause.  Applying this principle to the judicial election process, 
there  was  here  a  serious,  objective  risk  of  actual  bias  that  required 
Justice Benjamin's recusal.  Pp. 881-887. 

(c)  Massey and its amici err in predicting that this decision will lead 
to adverse consequences ranging from a flood of recusal motions to un-
necessary  interference  with  judicial  elections.  They  point  to  no  other 
instance  involving  judicial  campaign  contributions  that  presents  a  po-
tential  for  bias  comparable  to  the  circumstances  in  this  case,  which 
are extreme by any measure.  And because the States may have codes 
of  conduct  with  more  rigorous  recusal  standards  than  due  process  re-
quires,  most  recusal  disputes  will  be  resolved  without  resort  to  the 
Constitution, making the constitutional standard's application rare.

Opinion of the Court 
Don  Blankenship  is  Massey's  chairman,  chief  executive officer,  and  president.  After  the  verdict  but  before  the  ap-

peal,  West  Virginia  held  its  2004  judicial  elections.  Know-ing  the  Supreme  Court  of  Appeals  of  West  Virginia  would 
consider the  appeal in  the case, Blankenship decided to sup-port  an  attorney  who  sought  to  replace  Justice  McGraw. 
Justice  McGraw  was  a  candidate  for  reelection  to  that 
court.  The  attorney  who  sought  to  replace  him  was  Brent Benjamin. 

In addition to contributing the  $1,000  statutory maximum to Benjamin's campaign  committee, Blankenship donated al-
most $2.5 million to "And For The Sake Of The Kids," a polit-
ical  organization  formed  under  26  U. S. C.  $ 527.  The  $ 527 
organization  opposed  McGraw  and  supported  Benjamin. 
223  W.  Va.  624,  700,  679  S.  E.  2d  223,  299  (2008)  (Benjamin, 
Acting C.  J., concurring).  Blankenship's donations  ac-
counted for more than two-thirds of the total funds it raised. 
App.  150a.  This  was  not  all.  Blankenship  spent,  in  addi-
tion,  just  over  $500,000  on  independent  expenditures--for 
direct  mailings  and  letters  soliciting  donations  as  well  as 
television  and  newspaper  advertisements--" `to  support  .  .  . 
Brent  Benjamin.' "  Id.,  at  184a,  186a,  200a  (quoting  Blank-
enship's state campaign financial disclosure filings; bold type-
face omitted). 

To  provide  some  perspective,  Blankenship's  $3  million  in 
contributions  were  more  than  the  total  amount  spent  by  all 
other  Benjamin  supporters  and  three  times  the  amount 
spent  by  Benjamin's  own  committee.  Id.,  at  288a.  Caper-
ton  contends  that  Blankenship  spent  $1  million  more  than 
the  total  amount  spent  by the  campaign  committees  of  both 
candidates combined.  Brief for Petitioners 28. 

Benjamin  won.  He  received  382,036  votes  (53.3%),  and 
McGraw received 334,301 votes (46.7%).  223 W. Va., at 702,

in West Virginia's highest court, Caperton moved to disqual-

Opinion of the Court 
ify now-Justice Benjamin under the Due Process Clause and the  West  Virginia  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct,  based  on  the 

conflict  caused  by  Blankenship's  campaign  involvement. Justice Benjamin denied the motion in April 2006.  He indi-
cated that he "carefully considered the bases and accompany-ing  exhibits  proffered  by  the  movants."  But  he  found  "no 
objective information . . . to show that this Justice has a bias 
for  or  against  any  litigant,  that  this  Justice  has  prejudged the  matters  which  comprise  this  litigation,  or  that  this  Jus-

tice  will  be  anything  but  fair  and  impartial."  App.  336a- 337a.  In December 2006 Massey filed its petition for appeal 
to  challenge  the  adverse  jury  verdict.  The  West  Virginia 
Supreme Court of Appeals granted review. 

In November 2007 that court reversed the $50 million ver-
dict  against  Massey.  The  majority  opinion,  authored  by 
then-Chief  Justice  Davis  and  joined  by  Justices  Benjamin 
and  Maynard,  found  that  "Massey's  conduct  warranted  the 
type  of  judgment  rendered  in  this  case."  Id.,  at  357a.  It 
reversed, nevertheless, based on two independent grounds-- 
first, that a forum-selection clause contained in a contract to 
which  Massey  was  not  a  party  barred  the  suit  in  West  Vir-
ginia, and, second, that res judicata barred the suit due to an 
out-of-state judgment to which Massey was not a party.  Id., 
at 345a.  Justice Starcher dissented, stating that the "major-
ity's  opinion  is  morally  and  legally  wrong."  Id.,  at  420a- 
422a.  Justice Albright also dissented, accusing the majority 
of "misapplying  the law  and introducing  sweeping  `new law' 
into our jurisprudence that may well come back to haunt us." 
Id., at 430a-431a. 

Caperton sought rehearing, and the parties moved for dis-
qualification  of  three  of  the  five  justices  who  decided  the 
appeal.  Photos  had  surfaced  of  Justice  Maynard  vacation-
ing  with  Blankenship  in  the  French  Riviera  while  the  case 
was  pending.  Id.,  at  440a-441a,  456a.  Justice  Maynard 
granted  Caperton's  recusal  motion.  On  the  other  side  Jus-
tice  Starcher  granted  Massey's  recusal  motion,  apparently

Opinion of the Court 
based on his public criticism of Blankenship's role in the 2004 elections.  In  his  recusal  memorandum  Justice  Starcher 

urged Justice Benjamin to recuse himself as well.  He noted that "Blankenship's bestowal of his personal wealth, political 
tactics, and `friendship' have created a cancer in the affairs of this  Court." 

Id.,  at  459a-460a.  Justice  Benjamin  declined 
Justice  Starcher's  suggestion  and  denied  Caperton's  recusal 
motion. The  court  granted  rehearing.  Justice  Benjamin,  now  in 

the capacity of acting chief justice, selected Judges Cookman and Fox to replace the recused justices.  Caperton moved a 
third time for disqualification, arguing that Justice Benjamin 
had failed to apply the correct standard under West Virginia 
law--i. e., whether "a reasonable and prudent person, know-
ing these objective facts, would harbor doubts about Justice 
Benjamin's ability to be fair and impartial."  Id., at 466a, || 8. 
Caperton  also  included  the  results  of  a  public  opinion  poll, 
which  indicated  that  over  67%  of  West  Virginians  doubted 
Justice Benjamin would be fair and impartial.  Justice Ben-
jamin again refused to withdraw, noting that the "push poll" 
was "neither credible nor sufficiently reliable to serve as the 
basis  for  an  elected  judge's  disqualification."  Id.,  at  483a. 

In April 2008 a divided court again reversed the jury ver-
dict,  and  again  it  was  a  3-to-2  decision.  Justice  Davis  filed 
a  modified  version  of  her  prior  opinion,  repeating  the  two 
earlier  holdings.  She  was  joined  by  Justice  Benjamin  and 
Judge Fox.  Justice Albright, joined by Judge Cookman, dis-
sented: "Not only is the majority opinion unsupported by the 
facts  and  existing  case  law,  but  it  is  also  fundamentally  un-
fair.  Sadly,  justice  was  neither  honored  nor  served  by  the 
majority."  223  W.  Va.,  at  685,  679  S.  E.  2d,  at  284.  The 
dissent also  noted  "genuine  due process  implications  arising 
under federal law" with respect to Justice Benjamin's failure 
to recuse himself.  Id., at 686, n. 16, 679 S. E. 2d, at 285, n. 16

Opinion of the Court 
Four  months  later--a  month  after  the  petition  for  writ  of certiorari  was  filed  in  this  Court--Justice  Benjamin  filed  a 

concurring opinion.  He defended the merits of the majority opinion  as  well  as  his  decision  not  to  recuse.  He  rejected 
Caperton's  challenge  to  his  participation  in  the  case  under both the Due Process Clause and West Virginia law.  Justice 
Benjamin  reiterated  that  he  had  no  " `direct,  personal,  sub-stantial, pecuniary interest' in this case."  223 W. Va., at 702, 
679 S. E. 2d, at 301 (quoting Lavoie, supra, at 822).  Adopt-ing  "a  standard  merely  of  `appearances,' "  he  concluded, 
"seems little more than an invitation to subject West Virgin-ia's  justice  system  to  the  vagaries  of  the  day--a  framework 
in  which  predictability  and  stability  yield  to  supposition, innuendo, half-truths, and partisan manipulations."  223 
W. Va., at 707, 679 S. E. 2d, at 306. We granted certiorari.  555 U. S. 1028 (2008).

It is axiomatic that "[a] fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement  of  due  process." 

Murchison,  supra,  at  136. As the  Court has  recognized,  however, "most  matters  relat-

ing to judicial disqualification [do] not rise to a constitutional level." 

FTC  v.  Cement  Institute,  333  U. S.  683,  702  (1948). The early and leading case on the  subject is  Tumey v.  Ohio, 

273 U. S. 510 (1927).  There, the Court stated that "matters of kinship, personal bias, state policy, remoteness of interest, 
would seem generally to be matters merely of legislative dis-cretion."  Id., at 523. 

The  Tumey  Court  concluded that  the  Due  Process  Clause incorporated the  common-law  rule  that  a judge  must recuse 
himself when he has  "a direct, personal,  substantial,  pecuni-ary interest" in a case.  Ibid.  This rule reflects the maxim 
that  "[n]o  man  is  allowed  to  be  a  judge  in  his  own  cause; because his interest  would certainly  bias his judgment,  and, 
not improbably,  corrupt his integrity. "  The Federalist No. 10, p. 59 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison); see Frank, Dis-

qualification of Judges, 56 Yale L.  J. 605, 611-612  (1947). Under  this  rule,  "disqualification  for  bias  or  prejudice  was 

not permitted"; those matters were left to statutes and judi-cial  codes.  Lavoie,  supra,  at  820;  see  also  Part  IV,  infra 
(discussing judicial codes).  Personal bias or pre judice "alone  would  not  be  sufficient  basis  for  imposing  a  constitu-
tional requirement under the Due Process Clause."  Lavoie, 
supra, at 820. As  new  problems  have  emerged  that  were  not  discussed 

at common law, however, the  Court has identified additional instances  which,  as  an  objective  matter,  require  recusal. 
These  are  circumstances  "in  which  experience  teaches  that the  probability  of  actual  bias  on  the  part  of  the  judge  or 
decisionmaker  is  too  high  to  be  constitutionally  tolerable." Withrow,  421  U. S.,  at  47.  To  place  the  present  case  in 
proper context, two instances where the Court has required recusal merit further discussion. 

A 
The  first  involved  the  emergence  of  local  tribunals  where a  judge  had  a  financial  interest  in  the  outcome  of  a  case, 

although  the  interest  was  less  than  what  would  have  been considered personal or direct at common law. 

This  was  the  problem  addressed  in  Tumey.  There,  the mayor  of  a  village  had  the  authority  to  sit  as  a  judge  (with 
no jury) to try those accused of violating a state law prohibit-ing  the  possession  of  alcoholic  beverages.  Inherent  in  this 
structure were two potential conflicts.  First, the mayor re-ceived  a  salary  supplement  for  performing  judicial  duties, 
and  the  funds  for  that  compensation  derived  from  the  fines assessed  in  a  case.  No  fines  were  assessed  upon  acquittal. 
The  mayor-judge  thus  received  a  salary  supplement  only if  he  convicted  the  defendant.  273  U. S.,  at  520.  Second, 
sums  from  the  criminal  fines  were deposited  to  the  village's general treasury fund for  village improvements and repairs.

878  CAPERTON  v.  A.  T.  MASSEY  COAL  CO. 

Opinion of the Court 
The Court held that the Due Process Clause required dis-qualification  "both  because  of  [the  mayor-judge's]  direct  pe-

cuniary  interest  in  the  outcome,  and  because  of  his  official motive to  convict and to graduate  the  fine to help  the  finan-
cial  needs  of  the  village."  Id.,  at  535.  It  so  held  despite observing that "[t]here are doubtless mayors who would not 
allow such a consideration as $12 costs in each case to affect 
their  judgment  in  it."  Id.,  at  532.  The  Court  articulated the controlling principle: 

"Every  procedure  which  would  offer  a  possible  tempta-
tion to the average man as a judge to forget the burden of  proof  required  to  convict  the  defendant,  or  which 

might  lead  him  not  to  hold  the  balance  nice,  clear  and 
true  between  the  State  and the  accused,  denies  the  lat-ter due process of law." 

Ibid. 

The  Court  was  thus  concerned  with  more  than  the  tradi-
tional  common-law  prohibition  on  direct  pecuniary  interest. It  was  also  concerned  with  a  more  general concept  of  inter-

ests that tempt adjudicators to disregard neutrality. 

This  concern  with  conflicts  resulting  from  financial  incen-tives  was  elaborated  in 

Ward  v.  Monroeville,  409  U. S.  57 
(1972),  which  invalidated  a  conviction  in  another  mayor's court.  In 

Monroeville, unlike in Tumey, the mayor received 
no money; instead, the fines the mayor assessed went to the town's general fisc.  The Court held that "[t]he fact that the 

mayor  [in  Tumey]  shared  directly  in  the  fees  and  costs  did not define the limits of the principle."  409 U. S., at 60.  The 
principle, instead, turned on  the " `possible  temptation' "  the mayor might face; the mayor's "executive responsibilities for 
village finances may make him partisan to maintain the high 
level  of  contribution  [to  those  finances]  from  the  mayor's 
court."  Ibid.  As the Court reiterated in another case that 
Term,  "the  [ judge's]  financial  stake  need  not  be  as  direct  or 
positive  as  it  appeared  to  be  in  Tumey."  Gibson  v.  Berry-
hill,  411  U. S.  564,  579  (1973)  (an  administrative  board  com-

Opinion of the Court 
posed  of  optometrists  had  a  pecuniary  interest  of  "sufficient substance" so that it could not preside over a hearing against 

competing optometrists). The Court in 

Lavoie further clarified the reach of the Due 
Process  Clause  regarding  a  judge's  financial  interest  in  a case.  There, a justice had cast the deciding vote on the Ala-

bama  Supreme  Court  to  uphold  a  punitive  damages  award 
against  an  insurance  company  for  bad-faith  refusal  to  pay  a claim.  At the time of his vote, the justice was the lead plain-

tiff  in  a  nearly  identical  lawsuit  pending  in  Alabama's  lower courts.  His  deciding  vote,  this  Court  surmised,  "undoubt-
edly  `raised  the  stakes' "  for  the  insurance  defendant  in  the 
justice's suit.  475 U. S., at 823-824. 

The  Court  stressed  that  it  was  "not  required  to  decide 
whether  in  fact  [the  justice]  was  influenced."  Id.,  at  825. 
The  proper  constitutional  inquiry  is  "whether  sitting  on  the 
case  then  before  the  Supreme  Court  of  Alabama  ` "would 
offer  a  possible  temptation  to  the  average  .  .  .  judge  to  .  .  . 
lead  him  not  to  hold  the  balance  nice,  clear  and  true." ' " 
Ibid.  (quoting  Monroeville,  supra,  at  60,  in  turn  quoting 
Tumey,  supra,  at  532).  The  Court  underscored  that  "what 
degree  or  kind  of  interest  is  sufficient  to  disqualify  a  judge 
from  sitting  `cannot  be  defined  with  precision.' "  475  U. S., 
at 822 (quoting Murchison, 349 U. S., at 136).  In the Court's 
view, however, it was important that the test have an objec-
tive component. 

The Lavoie Court proceeded to distinguish the state-court 
justice's particular interest in the case, which required recu-
sal,  from  interests  that  were  not  a  constitutional  concern. 
For  instance,  "while  [the  other]  justices  might  conceivably 
have  had  a  slight  pecuniary  interest"  due  to  their  potential 
membership in a class-action suit against their own insurance 
companies, that interest is " `too remote and insubstantial to 
violate  the  constitutional  constraints.' "  475  U. S.,  at  825- 
826  (quoting  Marshall  v.  Jerrico,  Inc.,  446  U. S.  238,  243 
(1980)).

Opinion of the Court 

B 
The  second  instance  requiring  recusal  that  was  not  dis-cussed at common law emerged in the criminal contempt con-

text, where a judge had no pecuniary interest in the case but was challenged because of a conflict arising from his partici-
pation  in  an  earlier  proceeding.  This  Court  characterized that  first  proceeding  (perhaps  pejoratively)  as  a  " `one-man 
grand jury.' "  Murchison, 349 U. S., at 133. In  that  first  proceeding,  and  as  provided  by  state  law,  a 
judge  examined  witnesses  to  determine  whether  criminal charges  should  be  brought.  The  judge  called  the  two  peti-
tioners before him.  One petitioner answered questions, but the  judge  found  him  untruthful  and  charged  him  with  per-
jury.  The second  declined  to  answer on  the  ground  that  he did not have counsel with him, as state law seemed to permit. 
The  judge  charged  him  with  contempt.  The  judge  pro-ceeded  to  try  and  convict  both  petitioners.  Id.,  at  134-135. 

This  Court  set  aside  the  convictions  on  grounds  that  the judge  had  a  conflict  of  interest  at  the  trial  stage  because  of 
his  earlier  participation  followed  by  his  decision  to  charge them.  The  Due  Process  Clause  required  disqualification. 
The  Court  recited  the  general  rule  that  "no  man  can  be  a judge in  his  own case," adding  that  "no  man is  permitted to 
try  cases where  he  has  an  interest  in  the  outcome."  Id.,  at 136.  It  noted  that  the  disqualifying  criteria  "cannot  be  de-
fined with precision.  Circumstances and relationships must be  considered." 

Ibid.  These  circumstances  and  the  prior relationship  required  recusal:  "Having  been  a  part  of  [the 

one-man  grand  jury]  process  a  judge  cannot  be,  in  the  very nature  of  things,  wholly  disinterested  in  the  conviction  or 
acquittal  of  those  accused."  Id.,  at  137.  That  is  because "[a]s  a  practical  matter  it  is  difficult  if  not  impossible  for  a 
judge  to  free  himself  from  the  influence  of  what  took  place in his `grand-jury' secret session." 

Id., at 138. The  Murchison  Court  was  careful  to  distinguish  the  cir-

cumstances  and  the  relationship  from  those  where  the  Con-

Opinion of the Court 
stitution  would  not  require  recusal.  It  noted  that  the single-judge  grand  jury  is  "more  a  part  of  the  accusatory 

process than an ordinary lay  grand juror," and that "adjudi-cation by a trial judge of a contempt committed in [a judge's] 
presence in open  court cannot be likened to the  proceedings here." 

Id.,  at  137.  The  judge's  prior  relationship  with  the defendant, as well as the information acquired from the prior 

proceeding, was of critical import. Following Murchison the Court held in Mayberry v.  Penn-
sylvania,  400  U. S.  455,  466  (1971),  "that  by  reason  of  the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment a defend-
ant in criminal contempt proceedings should be given a pub-lic  trial  before  a  judge  other  than  the  one  reviled  by  the 
contemnor."  The  Court  reiterated  that  this  rule  rests  on the  relationship  between  the  judge  and  the  defendant:  "[A] 
judge,  vilified  as  was  this  Pennsylvania  judge,  necessarily becomes embroiled in a running, bitter controversy.  No one 
so  cruelly  slandered  is  likely  to  maintain  that  calm  detach-ment necessary for fair adjudication." 

Id., at 465. Again,  the  Court  considered  the  specific  circumstances 

presented by the case.  It noted that "not every attack on a judge . . .  disqualifies  him  from  sitting."  Ibid.  The  Court 
distinguished  the  case  from  Ungar  v.  Sarafite,  376  U. S.  575 (1964),  in  which  the  Court  had  "ruled  that  a  lawyer's  chal-
lenge, though `disruptive, recalcitrant and disagreeable com-mentary,' was still not `an insulting attack upon the integrity 
of  the  judge  carrying  such  potential  for  bias  as  to  require disqualification.' " 

Mayberry,  supra,  at  465-466  (quoting Ungar,  supra,  at  584).  The  inquiry  is  an  objective  one. 

The  Court  asks  not  whether  the  judge  is  actually,  subjec-tively  biased,  but  whether  the  average  judge  in  his  position 
is  "likely"  to  be  neutral,  or  whether  there  is  an  unconstitu-tional "potential for bias."

882  CAPERTON  v.  A.  T.  MASSEY  COAL  CO. 

Opinion of the Court 
of judicial elections, a framework not presented in the prece-dents we have reviewed and discussed. 

Caperton  contends  that  Blankenship's  pivotal  role  in  get-ting  Justice  Benjamin  elected  created  a  constitutionally  in-
tolerable  probability  of  actual  bias.  Though  not  a  bribe  or criminal influence, Justice Benjamin would nevertheless feel 
a  debt  of  gratitude  to  Blankenship  for  his  extraordinary  ef-
forts to get him elected.  That temptation, Caperton claims, is as strong and inherent in human nature as was the conflict 

the  Court  confronted  in  Tumey  and  Monroeville  when  a mayor-judge  (or  the  city)  benefited  financially  from  a  de-
fendant's  conviction,  as  well  as  the  conflict  identified  in 
Murchison  and  Mayberry when  a  judge  was  the object  of  a 
defendant's contempt. 

Justice  Benjamin  was  careful  to  address  the  recusal  mo-
tions  and  explain  his  reasons  why,  on  his  view  of  the  con-
trolling standard,  disqualification  was  not  in  order.  In  four 
separate opinions  issued  during  the  course of the  appeal, he 
explained  why  no  actual  bias  had  been  established.  He 
found no basis for recusal because Caperton failed to provide 
"objective  evidence"  or  "objective  information,"  but  merely 
"subjective  belief "  of  bias.  App.  336a,  337a-338a,  444a- 
445a.  Nor  could anyone "point to any actual conduct or ac-
tivity on [his] part which could be termed `improper.' "  223 
W.  Va.,  at  694,  679  S.  E.  2d,  at  293.  In  other  words,  based 
on  the  facts  presented  by  Caperton,  Justice  Benjamin  con-
ducted  a  probing  search  into  his  actual  motives  and  inclina-
tions;  and  he  found  none  to  be  improper.  We  do  not  ques-
tion  his  subjective  findings  of  impartiality  and  propriety. 
Nor do we determine whether there was actual bias. 

Following  accepted  principles  of  our  legal  tradition  re-
specting the proper performance of judicial functions, judges 
often  inquire  into  their  subjective  motives  and  purposes  in 
the  ordinary  course of deciding  a case.  This  does not  mean 
the  inquiry  is  a  simple  one.  "The  work  of  deciding  cases 
goes on every day in hundreds of courts throughout the land.

Opinion of the Court 
Any judge, one might suppose, would find it easy to describe the  process  which  he  had  followed  a  thousand  times  and 

more.  Nothing  could  be  farther  from  the  truth."  B.  Car-dozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 9 (1921). 

The judge inquires into reasons that seem to be leading to a particular result.  Precedent and 

stare decisis and the text 
and purpose of the law and the Constitution; logic and schol-
arship  and  experience  and  common  sense;  and  fairness  and disinterest  and  neutrality  are  among  the  factors  at  work. 

To  bring  coherence  to  the  process,  and  to  seek  respect  for the resulting judgment, judges often explain the reasons for 
their conclusions and rulings.  There are instances when the 
introspection that often attends this process may reveal that 
what  the  judge  had  assumed  to be  a  proper,  controlling  fac-
tor  is  not  the  real  one  at  work.  If  the  judge  discovers  that 
some  personal  bias  or  improper  consideration  seems  to  be 
the  actuating  cause  of  the  decision  or  to  be  an  influence  so 
difficult to dispel that there is a real possibility of undermin-
ing  neutrality,  the  judge  may  think  it  necessary  to  consider 
withdrawing from the case. 

The  difficulties  of  inquiring  into  actual  bias,  and  the  fact 
that  the  inquiry  is  often  a  private  one,  simply  underscore 
the  need  for  objective  rules.  Otherwise  there  may  be  no 
adequate protection against a judge who simply misreads or 
misapprehends the real motives at work in deciding the case. 
The judge's own inquiry into actual bias, then, is not one that 
the law can easily superintend or review, though actual bias, 
if disclosed, no doubt would be grounds for appropriate relief. 
In  lieu  of  exclusive  reliance  on  that  personal  inquiry,  or  on 
appellate review of the  judge's determination  respecting ac-
tual  bias,  the  Due  Process  Clause  has  been  implemented  by 
objective  standards  that  do  not  require  proof  of  actual  bias. 
See  Tumey,  273  U. S.,  at  532;  Mayberry,  supra,  at  465-466; 
Lavoie,  475  U. S.,  at  825.  In  defining  these  standards  the 
Court has asked whether, "under a realistic appraisal of psy-
chological  tendencies  and  human  weakness,"  the  interest

"poses  such  a  risk  of  actual  bias  or  prejudgment  that  the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is 

to  be  adequately  implemented."  Withrow,  421  U. S.,  at  47. We  turn  to  the  influence  at  issue  in  this  case.  Not  every 
campaign  contribution  by  a  litigant  or  attorney  creates  a probability of bias that requires a judge's recusal, but this is 
an exceptional case.  Cf. Mayberry, 400 U. S., at 465 ("It is, of 
course, not every attack on a judge that disqualifies him from sitting"); 

Lavoie,  supra,  at  825-826  (some  pecuniary  inter-
ests  are  " `too  remote  and  insubstantial' ").  We  conclude that there is a serious risk of actual bias--based on objective 

and  reasonable perceptions--when  a  person with  a  personal 
stake in a particular case had a significant and disproportion-
ate influence in placing the judge on the case by raising funds 
or directing the judge's election campaign when the case was 
pending  or imminent.  The inquiry centers  on the  contribu-
tion's  relative  size  in  comparison  to  the  total  amount  of 
money  contributed  to  the  campaign,  the  total  amount  spent 
in the election, and the apparent effect such contribution had 
on the outcome of the election. 

Applying  this  principle,  we  conclude  that  Blankenship's 
campaign  efforts  had  a  significant  and  disproportionate  in-
fluence  in  placing  Justice  Benjamin  on  the  case.  Blan-
kenship contributed some $3 million to unseat the incumbent 
and replace him with  Benjamin.  His contributions  eclipsed 
the  total  amount  spent  by  all  other  Benjamin  supporters 
and exceeded by 300% the amount spent by Benjamin's cam-
paign committee.  App. 288a.  Caperton claims Blankenship 
spent  $1  million  more  than  the  total  amount  spent  by  the 
campaign  committees  of  both  candidates  combined.  Brief 
for Petitioners 28. 

Massey  responds  that  Blankenship's  support,  while  sig-
nificant,  did  not  cause  Benjamin's  victory.  In  the  end  the 
people  of  West  Virginia  elected  him,  and  they  did  so  based 
on  many  reasons  other  than  Blankenship's  efforts.  Massey 
points  out  that  every  major  state  newspaper,  but  one,  en-

Opinion of the Court 
dorsed  Benjamin.  Brief  for  Respondents  54.  It  also  con-tends that then-Justice McGraw cost himself the election by 

giving a speech during the campaign, a speech the opposition seized upon for its own advantage. 

Ibid. 
Justice  Benjamin  raised  similar  arguments.  He  asserted that  "the  outcome  of the  2004  election  was  due primarily  to 

[his own]  campaign's message," as well as McGraw's "devas-
tat[ing]"  speech  in  which  he  "made  a  number  of  controver-sial claims which became a matter of statewide discussion in 

the  media,  on  the  internet,  and  elsewhere."  223  W.  Va.,  at 701,  and  n.  29,  679  S.  E.  2d,  at  300,  and  n.  29;  see  also

nn. 35-39. 

Whether  Blankenship's  campaign  contributions  were  a 
necessary  and  sufficient  cause  of  Benjamin's  victory  is  not 
the proper inquiry.  Much like determining whether a judge 
is  actually  biased,  proving  what  ultimately  drives  the  elec-
torate to choose a particular candidate is a difficult endeavor, 
not  likely to lend  itself to a  certain conclusion.  This  is  par-
ticularly true where, as here, there is no procedure for judi-
cial  factfinding  and  the  sole  trier  of  fact  is  the  one  accused 
of  bias.  Due  process  requires  an  objective  inquiry  into 
whether the contributor's influence on the election under all 
the  circumstances  "would  offer  a  possible  temptation  to  the 
average  .  .  .  judge  to . . .  lead  him  not  to  hold  the  balance 
nice, clear and true."  Tumey, supra, at 532.  In an election 
decided  by  fewer  than  50,000  votes  (382,036  to  334,301),  see 
223  W.  Va.,  at  702,  679  S.  E.  2d,  at  301,  Blankenship's  cam-
paign contributions--in comparison to the total amount con-
tributed  to  the  campaign,  as  well  as  the  total  amount  spent 
in  the election--had a significant  and disproportionate influ-
ence  on  the  electoral  outcome.  And  the  risk  that  Blank-
enship's  influence  engendered  actual  bias  is  sufficiently 
substantial  that  it  "must  be  forbidden  if  the  guarantee  of 
due  process  is  to  be  adequately  implemented."  Withrow,

886  CAPERTON  v.  A.  T.  MASSEY  COAL  CO. 

Opinion of the Court 
The temporal relationship between the campaign contribu-tions,  the  justice's  election,  and  the  pendency  of  the  case  is 

also  critical.  It  was  reasonably  foreseeable,  when  the  cam-paign contributions were made, that the pending case would 
be before the newly elected justice.  The $50 million adverse jury  verdict  had  been  entered  before  the  election,  and  the 
Supreme Court of Appeals was  the next step  once the state 
trial  court  dealt  with  post-trial  motions.  So  it  became  at once  apparent  that,  absent  recusal,  Justice  Benjamin  would 

review a judgment that cost his biggest donor's company $50 million.  Although  there  is  no  allegation  of  a 

quid  pro  quo 
agreement,  the  fact  remains  that  Blankenship's  extraordi-
nary  contributions  were  made  at  a  time  when  he  had  a 
vested  stake  in  the  outcome.  Just  as  no  man  is  allowed  to 
be  a  judge  in  his  own  cause,  similar  fears  of  bias  can  arise 
when--without  the  consent  of  the  other  parties--a  man 
chooses the judge in his own cause.  And applying this prin-
ciple  to  the  judicial  election  process,  there  was  here  a  seri-
ous, objective risk of actual bias that required Justice Benja-
min's recusal. 

Justice  Benjamin  did  undertake  an  extensive  search  for 
actual bias.  But, as we have indicated, that is just one step 
in  the judicial process;  objective standards  may also  require 
recusal  whether  or  not  actual  bias  exists  or  can  be  proved. 
Due  process  "may  sometimes  bar  trial  by  judges  who  have 
no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the 
scales of justice equally between contending parties."  Mur-

standards requiring recusal is not consistent with the imper-
atives of due process.  We find that Blankenship's significant 
and  disproportionate  influence--coupled  with  the  temporal 
relationship  between  the  election  and  the  pending  case--

Opinion of the Court 
treme facts the probability of actual bias rises to an unconsti-tutional level. 

IV 
Our  decision  today  addresses  an  extraordinary  situation where  the  Constitution  requires  recusal.  Massey  and  its 

amici predict  that  various  adverse  consequences  will  follow from  recognizing  a  constitutional  violation  here--ranging 
from  a  flood  of  recusal  motions  to  unnecessary  interference with judicial elections.  We disagree.  The facts now before 
us  are  extreme  by  any  measure.  The  parties  point  to  no other instance involving judicial campaign contributions that 
presents a potential for bias comparable to the circumstances in this case. 

It  is  true  that  extreme  cases  often  test  the  bounds  of  es-tablished  legal  principles,  and  sometimes  no  administrable 
standard  may  be  available  to  address  the  perceived  wrong. But it is also true that extreme cases are more likely to cross 
constitutional limits, requiring this  Court's intervention and formulation of objective standards.  This is particularly true 
when  due  process  is  violated.  See,  e. g.,  County  of  Sacra-
mento v.  Lewis, 523 U. S. 833, 846-847 (1998) (reiterating the due  process  prohibition  on  "executive  abuse  of  power  .  .  . 

which shocks the conscience"); id., at 858 (Kennedy,

Opinion of the Court 
see  also  Part  II,  supra.  In  this  case  we  do  nothing  more than what the Court has done before. 

As  such,  it  is  worth  noting  the  effects,  or  lack  thereof,  of the Court's prior decisions.  Even though the standards an-
nounced in those cases raised questions similar to those that might  be  asked  after  our  decision  today,  the  Court  was  not 
flooded  with  Monroeville  or  Murchison  motions.  That  is 
perhaps  due  in  part  to  the  extreme  facts  those  standards sought to address.  Courts proved quite capable of applying 

the standards to less extreme situations. One  must  also  take  into  account  the  judicial  reforms  the 
States  have  implemented  to  eliminate  even  the  appearance 
of  partiality.  Almost  every  State--West  Virginia  in-
cluded--has  adopted  the  American  Bar  Association's  objec-
tive  standard:  "A  judge  shall  avoid  impropriety  and  the  ap-
pearance  of  impropriety."  ABA  Annotated  Model  Code  of 
Judicial Conduct, Canon 2 (2004); see Brief for American Bar 
Association  as  Amicus  Curiae  14,  and  n.  29.  The  ABA 
Model Code's test for appearance of impropriety is "whether 
the  conduct  would  create  in  reasonable  minds  a  perception 
that  the  judge's  ability  to  carry  out  judicial  responsibilities 
with  integrity,  impartiality  and  competence  is  impaired." 
Canon  2A,  Commentary;  see  also  W.  Va.  Code  of  Judicial 
Conduct, Canon 2A, and Commentary (2009) (same). 

The  West  Virginia  Code  of  Judicial  Conduct  also  requires 
a  judge  to  "disqualify  himself  or  herself  in  a  proceeding  in 
which  the  judge's  impartiality  might  reasonably  be  ques-
tioned."  Canon 3E(1); see also 28 U. S. C. $ 455(a) ("Any jus-
tice,  judge,  or  magistrate  judge  of  the  United  States  shall 
disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality 
might  reasonably  be  questioned").  Under  Canon  3E(1), 
" `[t]he question of disqualification focuses on whether an ob-
jective assessment of the judge's conduct produces a reason-
able  question  about  impartiality,  not  on  the  judge's  subjec-
tive  perception  of  the  ability  to  act  fairly.' "  State  ex  rel.

tions," 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a)--a court's power to issue any form of relief, 
extraordinary or otherwise, is contingent on its subject-matter jurisdic-
tion  over  the  case  or  controversy.  Such  jurisdiction  is  determined  by 
Congress.  Bowles  v.  Russell,  551  U. S.  205,  212.  Thus,  to  issue  re-
spondent a writ of coram nobis on remand, the NMCCA must have had 
statutory  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  respondent's  original  judg-
ment of conviction.  Pp. 910-913. 

(b)  Pursuant  to  the  UCMJ,  the  NMCCA  and  the  CAAF  have 
subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  this  case.  The  NMCCA  has  jurisdic-
tion to entertain respondent's coram nobis request under UCMJ Article 
66,  which  provides:  "For  the  purpose  of  reviewing  court-martial  cases, 
the [NMCCA] may sit . . . ."   10 U.  S.  C.  $  866(a).  Because respondent's 
coram nobis request is simply a further "step in [his] criminal" appeal, 
United States v.  Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 505, n. 4, the NMCCA's jurisdic-
tion  to  issue  the  writ  derives  from  the  earlier  jurisdiction  it  exercised 
under  $ 866(a) to hear  and determine the conviction's validity on direct 
review.  Respondent's  coram  nobis  request  is  not  barred  by  the  re-
quirement  that the NMCCA  "act only with respect  to the findings and 
sentence  as  approved  by  the  convening  authority."  $ 866(c).  An  al-
leged error in the original judgment predicated on ineffective assistance 
of  counsel  challenges  the  conviction's  validity,  see  Knowles  v.  Mirzay-
ance, ante, at 115, so respondent's Sixth Amendment claim is "with re-
spect  to"  the  special  court-martial's  "findings"  of  guilty.  Because  the 
NMCCA  has  jurisdiction,  the  CAAF  has  jurisdiction  to  review  the 
NMCCA's denial of respondent's petition challenging the validity of his 
original conviction.  That the CAAF's authority is confined "to matters 
of  law"  connected  to  "the  findings  and  sentence  as  approved  by  the 
convening  authority  and  as  affirmed  or  set  aside  .  .  .  by  the  Court  of 
Criminal Appeals," $ 867(c), poses no obstacle to respondent's requested 
review.  His Sixth Amendment claim presents a "matte[r] of law" "with 
respect  to  the  [guilty]  findings . . . as  approved  by  the  [special  court-
martial] and as affirmed . . . by"  the  NMCCA.  Pp. 913-915. 

(c)  The  Government's  argument  that  UCMJ  Article  76  affirma-
tively  prohibits  the  type  of  collateral  review  respondent  seeks  errs  in 
"conflating  the  jurisdictional  question  with  the  merits"  of  respondent's 
petition,  Arthur  Andersen  LLP  v.  Carlisle,  ante,  at  628.  Article  76 
provides  for  the  finality  of  judgments  in  military  cases.  Just  as  the 
finality principle did not jurisdictionally bar the court in Morgan, supra, 
from  examining  its  earlier  judgment,  neither  does  it  bar  the  NMCCA 
from  doing  so  here.  The  Government's  contention  that  coram  nobis 
permits a court to correct its own errors, not those of an inferior court, 
is disposed of on similar grounds.  Pp. 915-917. 
66 M. J. 114, affirmed and remanded.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
Respondent  Jacob  Denedo  came  to  the  United  States  in 1984  from  his  native  Nigeria.  He  enlisted  in  the  Navy  in 

1989  and  became  a  lawful  permanent  resident  in  1990.  In 1998,  military  authorities  charged  him  with  conspiracy,  lar-
ceny,  and  forgery--in  contravention  of  Articles  81,  121,  and 123  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ),  10 
U. S. C.  $$ 881,  921,  923--all  for  his  role  in  a  scheme  to  de-fraud a community college.  With the assistance of both mili-
tary and civilian counsel, respondent made a plea bargain to plead  guilty  to  reduced  charges.  In  exchange  for  his  plea 
the convening authority referred respondent's case to a spe-cial court-martial, $ 819, which, at that time, could not impose 
a sentence greater than six months' confinement. The  special  court-martial,  consisting  of  a  single  military 
judge,  accepted  respondent's  guilty  plea  after  determining that  it  was  both  knowing  and  voluntary.  The  court  con-
victed  respondent  of  conspiracy  and  larceny.  It  sentenced him  to  three  months'  confinement,  a  bad-conduct  discharge, 
and a reduction to the lowest enlisted pay grade.  Respond-ent  appealed  on  the  ground  that  his  sentence  was  unduly 
severe.  The NMCCA affirmed.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a- 67a.  Respondent did not seek further review in the CAAF, 
and he was discharged from the Navy on May 30, 2000. In 2006, the Department of Homeland Security commenced 
removal proceedings against respondent based upon his spe-cial  court-martial  conviction.  To  avoid  deportation,  re-
spondent  decided  to  challenge  his  conviction  once  more, though  at  this  point  it  had  been  final  for  eight  years.  He 
maintained, in a petition for a writ of coram nobis filed with the NMCCA, that the conviction it had earlier affirmed must 
be  deemed  void  because  his  guilty  plea  was  the  result  of ineffective  assistance  of  counsel.  Respondent  alleged  that 
he  informed  his  civilian  attorney  during  plea  negotiations that  " `his  primary  concern  and objective' "  was  to  avoid  de-
portation and that he was willing to " `risk . . . going to jail' "

Opinion of the Court 
to avert separation from his family.  66 M. J. 114, 118 (CAAF 2008).  On  respondent's  account,  his  attorney--an  alcoholic 

who  was  not  sober  during  the  course  of  the  special  court-martial  proceeding--erroneously  assured  him  that  " `if  he 
agreed  to  plead  guilty  at  a  special-court-martial  he  would avoid any risk of deportation.' " 

Ibid.  Respondent argued 
that the NMCCA could set aside its earlier decision by issu-
ing  a  writ  of  coram  nobis  under  the  authority  of  the  All Writs Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a). 

The Government filed a motion to dismiss for want of juris-diction.  It  contended  that  the  NMCCA  had  no  authority 
to  conduct  postconviction  proceedings.  In  a  terse,  four-
sentence  order,  the  NMCCA  summarily  denied  both  the 
Government's  motion and respondent's petition for  a writ  of 
coram  nobis.  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  63a.  Respondent  ap-
pealed  and  the  CAAF,  dividing  3  to  2,  affirmed  in  part  and 
reversed in part.  The CAAF agreed with the NMCCA that 
standing military courts have jurisdiction to conduct "collat-
eral review under the All Writs Act."  66 M. J., at 119.  This 
is so, the CAAF explained, because "when a petitioner seeks 
collateral  relief  to  modify  an  action  that  was  taken  within 
the subject matter jurisdiction of the military justice system 
. . . a writ  that  is  necessary  or  appropriate  may  be  issued 
under the  All Writs Act `in  aid of ' the  court's existing juris-
diction."  Id., at 120 (citing 28 U. S. C. $ 1651(a)). 

Satisfied  that  it  had  jurisdiction,  the  CAAF  next  turned 
to  whether  the  writ  of  coram  nobis  should  issue.  It  held 
that a nondefaulted, ineffective-assistance claim that was yet 
to  receive  a  full  and  fair  review  "within  the  military  justice 
system"  could  justify  issuance  of the  writ.  66  M.  J.,  at  125. 
Finding  that  respondent's  ineffective-assistance  claim  satis-
fied  "the  threshold  criteria  for  coram  nobis  review,"  the 
CAAF remanded to the NMCCA so it could ascertain in the 
first  instance  "whether  the  merits  of  [respondent's]  petition 
can  be  resolved  on  the  basis  of  the  written  submissions,  or 
whether a factfinding hearing is required."  Id., at 126, 130.

Opinion of the Court 
Judge  Stucky  filed  a  dissenting  opinion.  Assuming  that 
the  majority  had  correctly  determined  its  jurisdiction  to 
grant  the  requested  relief,  he  concluded  that  respondent's 
ineffective-assistance claim lacked merit.  Id., at 131. 
Judge  Ryan  also  dissented.  Reasoning  that  the  majority 
had misapplied this Court's holding in Clinton v.  Goldsmith, 
526  U. S.  529  (1999),  she  concluded  that  the  UCMJ  does  not 
confer  jurisdiction  upon  military  tribunals  to  conduct  "post-
finality  collateral  review."  66  M.  J.,  at  136.  We  granted 
certiorari, 555 U. S. 1041 (2008), and now affirm. 

II 
Before we address another court's subject-matter jurisdic-
tion  we  must  first  determine  our  own.  See  Ashcroft  v. 
Iqbal, ante, at 671 ("Subject-matter jurisdiction . . .  should be 
considered  when  fairly  in  doubt").  The  Government,  upon 
which the burden to demonstrate subject-matter jurisdiction 
lies,  DaimlerChrysler  Corp.  v.  Cuno,  547  U. S.  332,  342 
(2006), claims that our power to hear this appeal rests on 28 
U. S. C.  $ 1259(4).  That  jurisdictional  provision  permits  us 
to review CAAF decisions in "[c]ases . . . in  which  the  Court 
of Appeals for the Armed Forces granted relief."  Respond-
ent  maintains  that  we  lack  jurisdiction  because  the  CAAF 
did  not  " `grant  relief ' ";  "all  it  did  was  remand"  to  the 
NMCCA.  Brief for Respondent 6-7 (brackets omitted). 

Respondent's  parsimonious  construction  of  the  word  "re-
lief " need not detain us long.  Though $ 1259 does not define 
the  term,  its  familiar  meaning  encompasses  any  "redress  or 
benefit"  provided  by  a  court.  Black's  Law  Dictionary  1317 
(8th  ed.  2004).  The  CA AF's  judgment  reversing  the 
NMCCA  satisfies  that  definition.  The  NMCCA  denied  re-
spondent's  petition  for  a  writ  of  coram  nobis,  while  the 
CA AF's  decision  reversed  and  remanded  so  that  the 
NMCCA  could  determine  anew  if  the  writ  should  issue. 
That decision conferred a palpable benefit on respondent; for

Opinion of the Court 
a chance of success on the merits, however slight, is superior 
to no possibility at all. 

To  be  sure,  respondent  would  have  preferred  the  CAAF 
to issue a writ of coram nobis or to direct the NMCCA to do 
so rather than remanding for the NMCCA to conduct further 
proceedings.  We  have  jurisdiction,  however,  to  review  any 
decision granting "relief," not just those providing "ultimate 
relief "  or  "complete  relief."  Indeed,  appellate  courts  re-
verse  and  remand  lower  court  judgments--rather  than  is-
suing  complete  relief--with  regularity.  See,  e. g.,  FCC  v. 
Fox  Television  Stations,  Inc.,  ante,  at  513.  There  is  no 
merit  to  the  view  that  a  decision  granting  partial  relief 
should be construed as granting no relief at all. 

Because  the  CAAF  "granted  relief "  to  respondent,  the 
text  of  $ 1259  is  satisfied  here.  We  have  jurisdiction  to  de-
termine  whether  the  CAAF  was  correct  in  ruling  that  the 
NMCCA had authority to entertain the petition for a writ of 
coram nobis. 

III  

A  

The writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law remedy 
designed "to  correct  errors of  fact."  United  States  v.  Mor-
gan,  346  U. S.  502,  507  (1954).  In  American  jurisprudence 
the precise contours of coram nobis have not been "well de-
fined," Bronson v.  Schulten, 104 U. S. 410, 416 (1882), but the 
writ  traces its  origins  to  the  King's  Bench  and  the  Court of 
Common  Pleas.  United  States  v.  Plumer,  27  F.  Cas.  561, 

573  (No.  16,056)  (CC  Mass.  1859)  (opinion  for  the  court  by 
Clifford, Circuit Justice); see also Morgan, supra, at 507, n. 9 
(citing  2  W.  Tidd,  Practice  of  Courts  of  King's  Bench  and 
Common Pleas 1136 (4th Am. ed. 1856)).  In English practice 
the office of the writ was to foster respect for judicial rulings 
by  enabling  the  same  court  "where  the  action  was  com-
menced and where the judgment was rendered" to avoid the 
rigid  strictures  of  judgment  finality  by  correcting  technical

Opinion of the Court 
errors "such as happened through the fault of the clerk in the record of the  proceedings prior to the  judgment." 

Plumer, 
supra, at 572-573. Any  rationale  confining  the  writ  to  technical  errors,  how-

ever, has been superseded; for in its modern iteration coram 
nobis  is  broader  than  its  common-law  predecessor.  This  is 
confirmed by our opinion in Morgan.  In that case we found 
that a writ of coram nobis can issue to redress a fundamental error, there a deprivation of counsel in violation of the Sixth 

Amendment, as opposed to mere technical errors.  346 U. S., at  513.  The  potential  universe  of  cases  that  range  from 
technical  errors  to  fundamental  ones  perhaps  illustrates,  in 
the  case  of  coram  nobis,  the  "tendency  of  a  principle  to  ex-
pand itself to the limit of its logic."  B. Cardozo, The Nature 
of  the  Judicial  Process  51  (1921).  To  confine  the  use  of 
coram nobis so that finality is not  at risk in a great number 
of cases, we were careful in  Morgan to limit  the availability 
of  the  writ  to  "extraordinary"  cases  presenting  circum-
stances compelling its use "to achieve justice."  346 U. S., at 
511.  Another limit, of course, is that an extraordinary rem-
edy may not issue when alternative remedies, such as habeas 
corpus, are available.  See id., at 510-511. 

In  federal  courts  the  authority  to  grant  a  writ  of  coram 
nobis  is  conferred  by  the  All  Writs  Act,  which  permits 
"courts  established  by  Act  of  Congress"  to  issue  "all  writs 
necessary  or  appropriate  in  aid  of  their  respective  jurisdic-
tions."  28  U. S. C.  $ 1651(a).  Though  military  courts,  like 
Article  III  tribunals,  are  empowered  to  issue  extraordinary 
writs  under  the  All  Writs  Act,  Noyd  v.  Bond,  395  U. S.  683, 
695,  n.  7  (1969),  that  authority  does  not  determine  the 
anterior  question  whether  military  courts  have  jurisdiction 
to  entertain  a  petition  for  coram  nobis.  As  the  text  of 

the  All  Writs  Act  recognizes,  a  court's  power  to  issue  any 
form  of  relief--extraordinary  or  otherwise--is  contingent 
on  that  court's  subject-matter  jurisdiction  over  the  case  or

912  UNITED  STATES  v.  DENEDO 

Opinion of the Court 
Assuming  no  constraints  or  limitations  grounded  in  the Constitution  are  implicated,  it  is  for  Congress  to  determine 

the  subject-matter  jurisdiction  of federal  courts.  Bowles  v. 
Russell,  551  U. S.  205,  212  (2007)  ("Within  constitutional 
bounds, Congress decides what cases the federal courts have jurisdiction  to  consider").  This  rule  applies  with  added 

force to Article I tribunals, such as the NMCCA and CAAF, 
which  owe  their  existence  to  Congress'  authority  to  enact legislation  pursuant  to  Article  I,  $ 8,  of  the  Constitution. 

Goldsmith, 526 U. S., at 533-534. Our  decision  in 

Goldsmith  demonstrates  these  teachings. 
There  an  Air  Force  officer,  James  Goldsmith,  was  convicted 
of various crimes  by general  court-martial and sentenced to 
six  years'  confinement.  Id.,  at  531.  Following  his  convic-
tion,  Congress  enacted  a  statute  authorizing  the  President 
to drop convicted officers from the rolls of the Armed Forces. 
When  the  Air  Force  notified  Goldsmith  that  he  would  be 
dropped  from  the  rolls,  he  lodged  a  petition  before  the  Air 
Force Court of Criminal Appeals (AFCCA) claiming that the 
proposed action contravened the Ex Post Facto Clause of the 
Constitution.  Id., at 532-533.  Goldsmith sought extraordi-
nary  relief  as  authorized  by  the  All  Writs  Act  to  enjoin  the 
President  from  removing  him  from  the  rolls.  The  AFCCA 
denied relief, but the CAAF granted it. 

Concluding  that  the  UCMJ  does  not  authorize  military 
courts  to  review  executive  action--including  a  decision  to 
drop an officer from the rolls--we held that the AFCCA and 
the CAAF lacked jurisdiction over Goldsmith's case.  Id., at 
535.  This  was  so,  we  unequivocally  found,  irrespective  of 
the  military  court's  authority  to  issue  extraordinary  relief 
pursuant  to  the  All  Writs  Act  and  its  previous  jurisdiction 
over  Goldsmith's  criminal  proceeding.  The  power  to  issue 
relief  depends  upon, rather  than  enlarges, a  court's jurisdic-
tion.  Id., at 536-537. 

That  principle  does  not  control  the  question  before  us. 
Because coram nobis is  but an extraordinary tool to correct

Opinion of the Court 
a legal or factual error, an application for the writ is properly viewed  as  a  belated  extension  of  the  original  proceeding 

during  which  the  error  allegedly  transpired.  See  Morgan, supra,  at  505,  n.  4  (coram  nobis  is  "a  step  in  the  criminal 
case  and  not,  like  habeas  corpus  where  relief  is  sought  in  a separate  case  and  record,  the  beginning  of  a  separate  civil 
proceeding");  see  also  United  States  v.  Beggerly,  524  U. S. 38,  46  (1998)  (noting  that  an  "independent  action"--which, 
like coram nobis, is an equitable means to obtain relief from a  judgment--" `may  be  regarded  as  ancillary  to  the  [prior] 
suit,  so  that  the  relief  asked  may  be  granted  by  the  court which made the decree in that suit . . . .   The  bill,  though an 
original bill in the chancery sense of the word, is a continua-tion of the former suit, on the question of the jurisdiction of 
the  [court]' "  (quoting  Pacific  R.  Co.  of  Mo.  v.  Missouri  Pa-cific  R.  Co.,  111  U. S.  505,  522  (1884))).  It  follows  that  to 
issue  respondent  a  writ  of  coram  nobis  on  remand,  the NMCCA  must  have  had  statutory  subject-matter  jurisdic-
tion over respondent's original judgment of conviction. 

B 
In the critical part of its opinion discussing the jurisdiction and authority of the NMCCA to issue a writ of coram nobis 

in an appropriate case, the CAAF describes respondent's re-quest for review as one "under the All Writs Act."  66 M. J., 
at  119.  This  is  correct,  of  course,  if  it  simply  confirms  that the  Act  authorizes  federal  courts  to  issue  writs  "in  aid  of " 
their  jurisdiction;  but  it  does  not  advance  the  inquiry  into whether jurisdiction exists. 

And  there are  limits to the use  of coram  nobis to alter or interpret  earlier  judgments.  As 

Goldsmith  makes  plain, the  All  Writs  Act  and  the  extraordinary  relief  the  statute 

authorizes  are  not  a  source  of  subject-matter  jurisdiction. 526  U. S., at 534-535.  Statutes which  address the  power  of 
a court to use certain writs or remedies or to decree certain forms of relief, for instance to award damages in some speci-

Opinion of the Court 
fied measure, in some circumstances might be construed also as a grant of jurisdiction to hear and determine the underly-

ing cause  of action.  Cf. Marbury v.  Madison, 1  Cranch 137 (1803).  We have long held, however, that the All Writs Act 
should not be interpreted in this way.  Goldsmith, supra, at 536; 

Plumer,  27  F.  Cas.,  at  574  ( jurisdiction  cannot  be  ac-
quired "by  means of the  writ  to be issued").  The authority 
to issue a writ under the All Writs Act is not a font of juris-diction.  See 

Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. v.  Henson,  537 
U. S. 28, 31 (2002). Quite  apart  from  the  All  Writs  Act,  we  conclude  that  the 

NMCCA  has  jurisdiction  to  entertain  respondent's  request 
for a writ  of  coram nobis.  Article 66 of the UCMJ provides: 
"For  the  purpose  of  reviewing  court-martial  cases,  the 
[Court  of  Criminal  Appeals]  may  sit  .  .  .  ."  10  U. S. C. 

$ 866(a).  Because  respondent's  request  for  coram  nobis  is 
simply a further "step in [his] criminal" appeal, Morgan, 346 
U. S., at 505, n. 4, the NMCCA's jurisdiction to issue the writ 
derives from the earlier jurisdiction it exercised to hear and 
determine  the  validity  of  the  conviction  on  direct  review. 
As  even  the  Government  concedes,  the  textual  authority 
under  the  UCMJ  to  " `revie[w]  court-martial  cases' "  pro-
vided the NMCCA with jurisdiction to hear an appeal of re-
spondent's  judgment  of  conviction.  See  Brief  for  United 
States  17-18.  That  jurisdiction  is  sufficient  to  permit  the 
NMCCA to entertain  respondent's petition  for coram nobis. 
See  also  Cts.  Crim.  App.  Rule  Prac.  &  Proc.  2(b),  44  M.  J. 
LXV (1996) (recognizing NMCCA discretionary authority to 
entertain petitions for extraordinary writs). 

It  is  true  that  when  exercising  its  jurisdiction  under 

$ 866(a), the NMCCA "may act only with respect to the find-
ings  and  sentence  as  approved  by  the  convening  authority." 

$ 866(c).  That  limitation  does  not  bar  respondent's  request 
for  a  writ  of  coram  nobis.  An  alleged  error  in  the  original 
judgment  predicated  on  ineffective  assistance  of  counsel 
challenges  the  validity  of  a  conviction,  see  Knowles  v.  Mir-

Opinion of the Court 
zayance,  ante,  at  115,  so  respondent's  Sixth  Amendment claim is "with respect to" the special court-martial's "findings 

of  guilty,"  10  U. S. C.  $ 866(c).  Pursuant  to  the  UCMJ,  the NMCCA has subject-matter jurisdiction to hear respondent's 
request for extraordinary relief. Because  the  NMCCA  had  jurisdiction  over  respondent's 
petition  for  coram  nobis,  the  CAAF  had  jurisdiction  to  en-tertain  respondent's  appeal  from  the  NMCCA's  judgment. 
When  exercising  its  jurisdiction,  the  CAAF's  authority  is confined  "to  matters  of  law"  connected  to  "the  findings  and 
sentence  as  approved  by  the  convening  authority  and  as  af-firmed  or  set  aside  .  .  .  by  the  Court  of  Criminal  Appeals," 

$ 867(c),  but  these  limitations  pose  no  obstacle  to  respond-ent's requested review of the NMCCA's decision.  Respond-
ent's  Sixth  Amendment  claim  presents  a  "matte[r]  of  law" "with respect to the [guilty] findings . . . as approved by the 
[special  court-martial]  and  as  affirmed  .  .  .  by  the  Court  of Criminal  Appeals."  Ibid.  The  CAAF  had  subject-matter 
jurisdiction  to  review  the  NMCCA's  denial  of  respondent's petition challenging the validity of his original conviction. 

C 
The Government counters that Article 76 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 876, "affirmatively prohibit[s] the type  of collateral 

review  sought  by  respondent."  Brief  for  United  States  18. That is incorrect.  The Government's argument commits the 
error of "conflating the jurisdictional question with the mer-its"  of  respondent's  petition.  Arthur  Andersen  LLP,  ante, 
at 628.  Article 76 states in relevant part: 

"The  appellate  review  of  records  of  trial  provided  by this chapter, the proceedings, findings, and sentences of 

courts-martial as approved, reviewed, or affirmed as re-quired by this chapter, and all dismissals and discharges 
carried into execution under sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or affirmation as required by 
this  chapter,  are  final  and  conclusive.  Orders  publish-

ing  the  proceedings  of  courts-martial  and  all  action taken  pursuant  to  those  proceedings  are  binding  upon 

all  departments,  courts,  agencies,  and  officers  of  the United States . . . ."   10 U.  S.  C. $  876. 

Article  76  codifies  the  common-law  rule  that  respects  the finality of judgments.  Schlesinger v.  Councilman, 420 U. S. 
738, 749 (1975).  Just as the rules of finality did not jurisdic-tionally  bar  the  court  in  Morgan  from  examining  its  ear-
lier  judgment,  neither  does  the  principle  of  finality  bar  the NMCCA from doing so here. 

The  Government  may  ultimately  be correct  that  the  facts of  respondent's  case  are  insufficient  to  set  aside  the  final 
judgment  that  Article  76  makes  binding.  No  doubt,  judg-ment  finality  is  not  to  be lightly  cast aside;  and  courts must 
be cautious so that the extraordinary remedy of coram nobis issues  only  in  extreme  cases.  But  the  long-recognized  au-
thority of a court to protect the integrity of its earlier judg-ments  impels  the  conclusion  that  the  finality  rule  is  not  so 
inflexible that it trumps each and every competing consider-ation.  Our holding allows military  courts to protect the  in-
tegrity of their dispositions and processes by granting relief from final judgments in extraordinary cases when it is shown 
that there were fundamental flaws in the proceedings leading to  their  issuance.  The  Government  remains  free  to  argue 
that  respondent's  is  a  merely  ordinary  case  that  is  not  enti-tled  to  extraordinary  relief.  But  respondent's  entitlement 
to relief is a merits question outside the scope of the jurisdic-tional question presented. 

The  Government's  contention  that  coram  nobis  permits  a court "to correct its  own errors,  not . . . those of an inferior 
court," Brief for United States 36, can be disposed of on simi-lar  grounds.  Just  as  respondent's  request  for  coram  nobis 
does  not  confer  subject-matter  jurisdiction,  the  Govern-ment's  argument  that  the  relief  should  not  issue  "in  light 
of  the  writ's  traditional  scope"  does  not  undermine  it,  ibid. (emphasis  deleted).  In  sum,  the  Government's  argument

Opinion of the Court 
speaks  to  the  scope  of  the  writ,  not  the  NMCCA's  jurisdic-tion  to  issue  it.  The  CAAF  rejected  the  former  argument. 

Only the latter one is before us. We hold that Article I military courts have jurisdiction to 
entertain  coram  nobis  petitions  to  consider  allegations  that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamen-
tal  respect.  That  conclusion  is  consistent  with  our  holding that  Article  III  courts  have  a  like  authority. 

Morgan,  346 U. S., at 508.  The result we reach today is of central impor-

tance for military courts.  The military justice system relies upon courts that must take all appropriate means, consistent 
with their statutory jurisdiction, to ensure the neutrality and integrity of their judgments.  Under the premises and stat-
utes  we  have  relied  upon  here,  the  jurisdiction  and  the  re-sponsibility  of  military  courts  to  reexamine  judgments  in 
rare  cases  where  a  fundamental  flaw  is  alleged  and  other judicial  processes  for  correction  are  unavailable  are  consist-
ent  with  the  powers  Congress  has  granted  those  courts under Article I and with the system Congress has designed. 

* * * 
We  do  not  prejudge  the  merits  of  respondent's  petition. To be sure, the writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary 

writ;  and  "an  extraordinary  remedy  .  .  .  should  not  be granted in the ordinary case."

where, as here, it has declined to bring the action or intervene.  Second, 
the  Government's  right  to  receive pleadings  and deposition  transcripts 
when  it  declines  to  intervene,  see  $ 3730(c)(3),  does  not  support,  but 
weighs against, petitioner's argument: If the United States were a party 
to every FCA suit, it would already be entitled to such materials under 
Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  5.  Third,  the  fact  that  the  United 
States  is  bound  by  the  judgment  in  all  FCA  actions  regardless  of 
its  participation  in  the  case  is  not  a  legitimate  basis  for  disregarding 

the  statute's  intervention  scheme.  Finally,  given  that  Rule  4(a)(1)(B) 
hinges  its  60-day  time  limit  on  the  United  States'  "party"  status,  peti-
tioner's  contention  that  the  limit's  underlying  purpose  would  be  best 
served by applying it in every FCA case is unavailing.  Pp. 934-937.

was  untimely  under  the  30-day  limit  because  the  United States  is  not  a  party  to  an  FCA  action  absent  formal  inter-
vention or other meaningful participation. The  Court  of  Appeals  agreed  with  respondents  that  the 
30-day  limit  applied  and  dismissed  the  appeal  as  untimely. See  540  F.  3d  94  (CA2  2008).  We  granted  certiorari,  555

A party has 60 days to file a notice of appeal if "the United States  or  an  officer  or  agency  thereof  is  a  party"  to  the  ac-

tion.  See  $ 2107(b)  ("In  any  such  [civil]  action,  suit  or  pro-ceeding  in  which  the  United  States  or  an  officer  or  agency 
thereof  is  a  party,  the  time  as  to  all  parties  shall  be  sixty days  from  such  entry  [of  judgment]");  Fed.  Rule  App.  Proc.

within  60  days  after  the  judgment  or  order  appealed  from is  entered").  Although  the  United  States  is  aware  of  and 
minimally  involved  in  every  FCA  action,  we  hold  that  it  is not a "party" to an FCA action for purposes of the appellate 
filing  deadline  unless  it  has  exercised  its  right  to  intervene in the case.

I 
A 

The  evidence  at  petitioner's  trial  was  sufficient  to  prove the  following:  Petitioner  and  others  participated  in  a  series 

of bank thefts in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin during the 1990's.  The participants in these crimes included 
a  core  group,  along  with  others  who  were  recruited  from time  to  time.  Although  the  participants  sometimes  at-
tempted bank-vault burglaries and bank robberies, the group usually  targeted  cash-laden  night-deposit  boxes,  which  are 
often found in banks in retail areas. Each theft was typically carried out by a group of partici-
pants  who  met  beforehand  to  plan  the  crime,  gather  tools (such  as  crowbars,  fishing  gaffs,  and  walkie-talkies),  and 
assign  the  roles  that  each  participant  would  play  (such  as lookout  and  driver).  The  participants  generally  split  the 
proceeds from the thefts.  The group was loosely and infor-mally  organized.  It  does  not  appear  to  have  had  a  leader 
or  hierarchy;  nor  does  it  appear  that  the  participants  ever formulated any long-term master plan or agreement. 

From  1991  to  1994,  the  core  group  was  responsible  for more  than  30  night-deposit-box  thefts.  By  1994,  petitioner 
had joined the group, and over the next five years, he partici-pated in numerous attempted night-deposit-box thefts and at 
least two attempted bank-vault burglaries. In  2003,  petitioner  was  indicted  for  participation  in  the 
conduct  of  the  affairs  of  an  enterprise  through  a  pattern  of racketeering activity, in violation of 18 U. S. C. $ 1962(c); con-
spiracy  to commit  that  offense, in  violation  of $ 1962(d);  con-spiracy  to  commit  bank  burglary,  in  violation  of  $ 371;  and

Opinion of the Court 
The  breadth  of  the  "enterprise"  concept  in  RICO  is  high-
lighted by comparing the statute with other federal statutes 
that  target  organized  criminal  groups.  For  example,  18 
U. S. C. $ 1955(b), which was enacted together with RICO as 
part  of  the  Organized  Crime  Control  Act  of  1970,  Pub. 
L. 91-452, 84 Stat. 922, defines an "illegal gambling business" 
as  one  that  "involves  five  or  more  persons  who  conduct,  fi-
nance,  manage,  supervise,  direct,  or  own  all  or  part  of  such 
business."  A "continuing criminal enterprise," as defined in 
21 U. S. C. $ 848(c), must involve more than five persons who 
act  in  concert  and  must  have  an  "organizer,"  supervisor,  or 
other  manager.  Congress  included  no  such  requirements 
in RICO. 

III  

A  

Contrary  to  petitioner's  claims,  rejection  of  his  argument 
regarding  these structural characteristics does not  lead to a 
merger  of the  crime  proscribed  by  18  U. S. C. $ 1962(c)  (par-
ticipating  in  the  affairs  of  an  enterprise  through  a  pattern 
of  racketeering  activity)  and  any  of  the  following  offenses: 
operating  a  gambling  business,  $ 1955;  conspiring  to  com-
mit  one  or  more  crimes  that  are  listed  as  RICO  predicate 
offenses,  $ 371;  or  conspiring  to  violate  the  RICO  statute, 

$ 1962(d). 

Proof that a defendant violated $ 1955 does not necessarily 
establish  that  the  defendant  conspired  to  participate  in  the 
affairs  of  a  gambling  enterprise  through  a  pattern  of  rack-
eteering  activity.  In  order  to  prove  the  latter  offense,  the 
prosecution must prove either that the defendant committed 
a  pattern  of  $ 1955  violations  or  a  pattern  of  state-law  gam-
bling crimes.  See $ 1961(1).  No such proof is needed to es-
tablish a simple violation of $ 1955. 

Likewise,  proof  that  a  defendant  conspired  to  commit  a 
RICO  predicate  offense--for  example,  arson--does  not  nec-
essarily  establish  that  the  defendant  participated  in  the  af-

sound  bankruptcy  policy.  For  one  thing,  the  hypothetical  test may  prevent  debtors-in-possession  from  continuing  to  exercise 
their  rights  under  nonassignable  contracts,  such  as  patent  and copyright  licenses.  Without  these  contracts,  some  debtors-in-
possession  may  be  unable  to  effect  the  successful  reorganization that  Chapter  11  was  designed  to  promote.  For  another  thing, 
the  hypothetical  test  provides  a  windfall  to  nondebtor  parties  to valuable  executory  contracts:  If  the  debtor  is  outside  of  bank-
ruptcy,  then  the  nondebtor  does  not have  the  option  to  renege  on its agreement; but if the debtor seeks bankruptcy protection, then 
the  nondebtor  obtains  the  power  to  reclaim--and  resell  at  the prevailing,  potentially  higher  market  rate--the  rights  it  sold  to 
the  debtor. To  prevent  $ 365(c)  from  engendering  unwise  policy,  one  Court 
of Appeals, and a  number  of Bankruptcy Courts,  reject the  hypo-thetical  test  in  favor  of  an  "actual  test,"  under  which  a  Chapter 
11  debtor-in-possession  may  assume  an  executory  contract  pro-vided  it  has  no  actual  intent  to  assign  the  contract  to  a  third 
party.  See  Institut

told  his  wife  how  he  intended  to  kill  her,  i. e.,  with  a  gun,  knife, bare  hands,  etc.  After  petitioner  was  arrested,  his  car  was 
searched,  and  the  officer  found,  among  other  things,  a  loaded  re-volver  and  drugs.  This  case  thus  appears  to  present  an  impor-
tant question regarding the meaning and specificity of the reason-able  suspicion requirement  in  Gant.  Because of the  ambiguity  of 
the  new  Gant  test  and  the  frequency  of  roadside  arrests,  I  would grant  certiorari  in  this  case  to  provide  much  needed  clarification.

Rev.  Stat.  $ 574.115  (Supp.  2008)  (making  a  terroristic  threat).* If  an  arrest  for  making  a  terroristic  threat  would  have  been  law-
ful,  this  case  presents  the  question  whether,  when  a  defendant  is arrested pursuant to a warrant, a Gant evidence-gathering search 
may  be  conducted  only  when  there  is  reason  to  believe  that  the vehicle  contains  evidence  of  the  offense  for  which  the  warrant 
was  issued  or  whether  it  is  also  permissible  to  search  the  vehicle for evidence of other offenses for which a warrantless arrest could 
have  been  made.  This  question  may  be  of  some  importance  be-cause,  prior  to  Gant,  an  officer  who  made  an  arrest  pursuant  to 
a  warrant  had  little  reason  to  inventory  the  applicable  criminal code  at  the  scene  of  the  arrest  in  order  to  determine  whether  a 
warrantless  arrest  for  another  offense  would  also  be  justified. In  this  case,  however,  uncertainty  as  to  whether  the  officers 
had probable cause to arrest under $ 574.115 makes review at this time  premature.

Opinion in Chambers 
spond.  According  to  the  applicants,  a  stay  is  now  in  order because  the  Court's  invitation  to  the  Solicitor  General--a 

step  taken  in  only  a  small  fraction  of  cases--establishes  a "reasonable probability" that certiorari will be granted. 

Our request for the Solicitor General's view, although rele-vant  to  the  "reasonable  probability"  analysis,  is  hardly  dis-
positive of an application to block implementation of a Court of  Appeals'  judgment.  CVSG'd  petitions,  it  is  true,  are 
granted  at  a  far  higher  rate  than  other  petitions.  But  it  is also true that the Court denies certiorari in such cases more 
often than not.  Consideration of the guiding criteria in the context of the particular case remains appropriate. 

A  "reasonable  probability"  of  a  grant  is  only  one  of  the hurdles an applicant must clear.  Relief is not warranted un-
less  the  other  factors  also  counsel  in  favor  of  a  stay.  The Court's invitation to the Solicitor General does not lead me to 
depart from my previous assessment of those factors.  With respect to irreparable harm, the applicants urge that, should 
they prevail  in  this  Court,  they may  have  trouble recouping any  funds  they  disburse  to  beneficiaries.  But  they  do  not 
establish  that  recoupment  will  be  impossible;  nor  do  they suggest  that  the  outlays at  issue will  place the  plan  itself in 
jeopardy.  Cf.  Sampson

Federal  appeals--Timeliness--Extension  of  filing  period.--Because 
United States declined to intervene in this privately initiated False Claims 
Act  action,  it  was  not  a  "party"  to  litigation  for  purposes  of  either  28 
U. S. C.  $ 2107  or  Federal  Rule  of  Appellate  Procedure  4;  therefore,  peti-
tioner's notice of appeal was untimely, as it should have been filed within 
Rule's 30-day period, not extended 60-day period when United States is a

I.  Double  Jeopardy. 

Capital murder--Execution of mentally retarded offender--Mental ca-
pacity  hearing.--Double  Jeopardy  Clause  does  not  bar  Ohio  courts  from 
conducting a full hearing on whether Bies qualifies as a mentally retarded 
offender who cannot be executed under Atkins v.  Virginia, 536 U. S. 304, 
because of their earlier determination, under pre-Atkins standard, that his 
mental retardation qualified as a mitigating factor.  Bobby v. Bies, p. 825. 

II.  Due  Process. 

1.  Campaign contributions to State Supreme Court justice--Requiring 
recusal  in  contributor's  case.--Where  West  Virginia  Supreme  Court  of 
Appeals reversed  a $50 million verdict, due process required recusal  of a 
justice  who  had  received  campaign  contributions  in  an  extraordinary 
amount  from  board  chairman  and  principal  officer  of  corporation  found 
liable for damages.  Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., p. 868. 

2.  Jury  selection--Peremptory  challenge.--Provided  that  all  jurors 
seated  in  a criminal  case  are  qualified  and  unbiased,  Due  Process  Clause 
does not require automatic reversal of a conviction because of trial court's 
good-faith  error  in  denying  defendant's  peremptory  challenge  to  a  juror. 
Rivera v. Illinois, p. 148. 

III.  Right  to  Counsel. 

1.  Incriminating  statement  to  informant--Admission  for  impeach-
ment  purposes.--Respondent's  incriminating  statement  to  an  informant 
planted  in  his  jail  cell,  concededly  elicited  in  violation  of  Sixth  Amend-
ment, was admissible to impeach his inconsistent testimony at trial.  Kan-
sas v. Ventris, p. 586. 

2.  Ineffective  assistance--Standard  of  review.--Whether  California 
Court  of  Appeal's  decision  rejecting  Mirzayance's  ineffective-assistance-
of-counsel  claim  is  reviewed  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254(d)(1)  or  de  novo,  he 
has  failed  to  establish  that  his  counsel's  performance  was  ineffective. 
Knowles v. Mirzayance, p. 111. 

3.  Police  interrogation.--Michigan  v.  Jackson,  475  U. S.  625,  which 
forbade  police  to  initiate  interrogation  of  a  criminal  defendant  once  he 
invoked his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at an arraignment or simi-
lar proceeding, is overruled.  Montejo v. Louisiana, p. 778. 

IV.  Right  to  Speedy  Trial. 

Balancing  test--Delays caused  by assigned  counsel.--In  applying  bal-
ancing test of Barker v.  Wingo, 407 U. S. 514, 530, which weighs prosecu-
tion's  conduct  against defense's  in resolving  speedy  trial  issues, Vermont 
Supreme  Court  erred  in  ranking  assigned  counsel  essentially  as  state

actors,  attributing  delays  they  caused  to  State  rather  than  to  defendant.  
Vermont v. Brillon, p. 81.  

V.  Searches  and  Seizures. 

Vehicle  search  incident  to  arrest.--Under  Fourth  Amendment,  police 
may  search  a  vehicle's  passenger  compartment  incident  to  a  recent  occu-
pant's arrest only if  it is reasonable to believe that arrestee might  access 
vehicle  at  time  of  search  or  that  vehicle  contains  evidence  of  offense  of 
arrest.  Arizona v. Gant, p. 332. 

VI.  Supremacy  Clause. 

Federal-State  relations--State  court's  jurisdiction  over  42  U. S. C. 

$ 1983  claims.--A  New York law  that divests State's  general  jurisdiction 
courts of their jurisdiction to hear $ 1983 damages suits filed by prisoners 
against state correction officers violates Supremacy Clause.  Haywood v.

5.  Plea agreement violation--Forfeited claim--Federal Rules of Crim-
inal Procedure--Plain-error test.--Rule 52(b)'s plain-error test applies to 
a  forfeited  claim,  like  Puckett's,  that  Government  failed  to  meet  its  obli-
gations  under  a  plea  agreement,  and  that  test  applies  in  usual  fashion.

language,"  18  U. S. C.  $ 1464,  sometimes  applies  to  indecent  expletives 
even  when  offensive  words  are  not  repeated  is  neither  "arbitrary"  nor

HABEAS  CORPUS. 

1.  Capital  murder--Suppression  of  evidence.--Tennessee  courts'  pro-
cedural rejection of Cone's claim of unlawful suppression of evidence does 
not bar federal habeas review of that claim's merits; although suppressed 
evidence was not material to Cone's first-degree murder conviction, lower

with respect to Cone's capital sentence.  Cone v. Bell, p. 449.

tal  jurisdiction.--A  federal  district  court's  order  remanding  a  case  to 
state  court  after  declining  to  exercise  supplemental  jurisdiction  over 
state-law claims is not a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for

bad Technology, Inc. v. HIF Bio, Inc., p. 635. 

2.  Subject-matter jurisdiction--Petition to compel arbitration.--A 
federal  court  may  "look  through"  a  petition  to  compel  arbitration  filed 
under  Federal  Arbitration  Act  $ 4  to  determine  whether  it  is  predicated 
on  a  controversy  that  "arises  under"  federal  law;  in  keeping  with  well-

for  pregnancy  leave.--An  employer  does  not  necessarily  violate  PDA 
when  it  pays  pension  benefits  calculated  in  part  under  an  accrual  rule, 
applied only prior to PDA, that gave less retirement credit for pregnancy 
leave than for medical leave generally; because AT&T's pension payments 
accord with a bona fide seniority system's terms, they are insulated from 
challenge  under  $ 703(h)  of Title VII  of Civil  Rights  Act  of 1964.  AT&T
