CASES ADJUDGED

IN THE

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

AT
OCTOBER TERM, 1996

UNITED STATES v. GONZALES et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 95-1605. Argued December 11, 1996--Decided March 3, 1997
All three respondents were convicted in New Mexico courts and sentenced

to prison terms on state charges arising from the use of guns by two of
them to hold up undercover officers during a drug sting operation.
After they began to serve their state sentences, respondents were convicted on various drug and related federal charges connected to the
sting operation, and of using firearms during those crimes in violation of
18 U. S. C. $ 924(c). In ordering their imprisonment, the District Court
directed that the portion of their federal sentences attributable to the
drug convictions run concurrently with their state sentences, with the
remaining 60-month sentences required by $ 924(c) to run consecutively
to both. Among other rulings, the Tenth Circuit vacated the firearms
sentences on the ground that they should have run concurrently with
the state prison terms. The court found $ 924(c)'s language to be ambiguous, resorted to the legislative history, and held that a $ 924(c) sentence may run concurrently with a previously imposed, already operational state sentence, but not with another federal sentence.

Held: Section $ 924(c)'s plain language--i. e., "the sentence . . . under this

subsection [shall not] run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment" (emphasis added)--forbids a federal district court to direct that
the section's mandatory 5-year firearms sentence run concurrently with
any other prison term, whether state or federal. Read naturally, the
section's word "any" has an expansive meaning that is not limited to
federal sentences, and so must be interpreted as referring to all "term[s]

2 UNITED STATES v. GONZALES

Opinion of the Court
of imprisonment," including those imposed by state courts. Cf., e. g.,
United States v. Alvarez-Sanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 358. Unlike the Tenth
Circuit, this Court sees nothing remarkable (much less ambiguous)
about Congress' decision, in drafting $ 924(c), to prohibit concurrent
sentences instead of simply mandating consecutive ones. Moreover,
given the straightforward statutory command, there is no reason to
resort to legislative history. Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503

the Tenth Circuit only muddies the waters. Contrary to that court's
interpretation, $ 924(c)'s prohibition applies only to the section's mandatory firearms sentence, and does not limit a district court's normal
authority under $ 3584(a) to order that other federal sentences run concurrently with or consecutively to other state or federal prison terms.

Respondents were arrested in a drug sting operationduring which two of them pulled guns on undercover police

officers. All three were convicted in New Mexico courtson charges arising from the holdup. The state courts sentenced them to prison terms ranging from 13 to 17 years.After they began to serve their state sentences, respondents
were convicted in federal court of committing various drugoffenses connected to the sting operation, and conspiring to
do so, in violation of 21 U. S. C. $$ 841 and 846. They werealso convicted of using firearms during and in relation to
those drug trafficking crimes, in violation of 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c). Respondents received sentences ranging from 120
to 147 months in prison, of which 60 months reflected themandatory sentence required for their firearms convictions.
Pursuant to $ 924(c), the District Court ordered that the por-tion of respondents' federal sentences attributable to the
drug convictions run concurrently with their state sentences,with the remaining 60 months due to the firearms offenses
to run consecutively to both.The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated respondents' sentences for the firearms violations, on theground that the $ 924(c) sentences should have run concurrently with the state prison terms. 65 F. 3d 814 (1995).(The court also vacated respondents' substantive drug convictions and dealt with various other sentencing issues notbefore us.) Although the Court of Appeals recognized that
other Circuits had uniformly "held that $ 924(c)'s plain lan-guage prohibits sentences imposed under that statute from
running concurrently with state sentences," it neverthelessthought that "a literal reading of the statutory language
would produce an absurd result." Id., at 819. Feeling

though the narcotics sentences normally would have run con-currently with the state sentences, since they all arose out
of the same criminal activity. 65 F. 3d, at 821. To avoidthis irrational result, the court held that "$ 924(c)'s mandatory five-year sentence may run concurrently with a pre-viously imposed

Our analysis begins, as always, with the statutory text.Section 924(c)(1) provides:

"Whoever, during and in relation to any . . . drug traf-ficking crime . . . for which he may be prosecuted in a
court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm,shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such
crime . . . , be sentenced to imprisonment for five years. . . . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the
court shall not place on probation or suspend the sen-tence of any person convicted of a violation of this subsection, nor shall the term of imprisonment imposedunder this subsection run concurrently with

any otherterm of imprisonment including that imposed for the . . .

drug trafficking crime in which the firearm was used orcarried." 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c)(1) (emphasis added).

Opinion of the Court
The question we face is whether the phrase "any other termof imprisonment" "means what it says, or whether it should

be limited to some subset" of prison sentences, Maine v.
Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1, 4 (1980)--namely, only federal sentences. Read naturally, the word "any" has an expansive
meaning, that is, "one or some indiscriminately of what-ever kind." Webster's Third New International Dictionary

97 (1976). Congress did not add any language limitingthe breadth of that word, and so we must read $ 924(c) as
referring to all "term[s] of imprisonment," including thoseimposed by state courts. Cf.

United States v. AlvarezSanchez, 511 U. S. 350, 358 (1994) (noting that statute referring to "any law enforcement officer" includes "federal, state,
or local" officers); Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1, 15 (1871)
(stating "it is quite clear" that a statute prohibiting the filing
of suit "in any court" "includes the State courts as well as the
Federal courts," because "there is not a word in the [statute]
tending to show that the words `in any court' are not used
in their ordinary sense"). There is no basis in the text for
limiting $ 924(c) to federal sentences.

In his dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens suggests that
the word "any" as used in the first sentence of $ 924(c) "unquestionably has the meaning `any federal.' " Post, at 14.
In that first sentence, however, Congress explicitly limited
the scope of the phrase "any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime" to those "for which [a defendant] may be prosecuted in a court of the United States." Given that Congress expressly limited the phrase "any crime" to only
federal crimes, we find it significant that no similar restriction modifies the phrase "any other term of imprisonment,"
which appears only two sentences later and is at issue in this
case. See Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23 (1983)
(" `Where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same
Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion' ").

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals also found ambiguity in Congress'decision, in drafting $ 924(c), to prohibit concurrent sentences instead of simply mandating consecutive sentences.65 F. 3d, at 820. Unlike the lower court, however, we see
nothing remarkable (much less ambiguous) about Congress'
choice of words. Because consecutive and concurrent sen-tences are exact opposites, Congress implicitly required one

when it prohibited the other. This "ambiguity" is, in anyevent, beside the point because this phraseology has no bearing on whether Congress meant $ 924(c) sentences to run con-secutively only to other federal terms of imprisonment.

Given the straightforward statutory command, there isno reason to resort to legislative history.

Connecticut Nat.
Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249, 254 (1992). Indeed, far
from clarifying the statute, the legislative history only mud-dies the waters. The excerpt from the Senate Report accompanying the 1984 amendment to $ 924(c), relied upon bythe Court of Appeals, reads:

"[T]he Committee intends that the mandatory sentenceunder the revised subsection 924(c) be served prior to
the start of the sentence for the underlying or any otheroffense." S. Rep., at 313-314.

This snippet of legislative history injects into $ 924(c) an
entirely new idea--that a defendant must serve the 5-year
prison term for his firearms conviction before any other sen-tences. This added requirement, however, is "in no way anchored in the text of the statute." Shannon v. United
States, 512 U. S. 573, 583 (1994).

The Court of Appeals was troubled that this rule might
lead to irrational results. Normally, a district court has authority to decide whether federal prison terms should run
concurrently with or consecutively to other prison sentences.

Opinion of the Court

$ 5G1.3 (Nov. 1995) (USSG) (guiding court's discretion under$ 3584(a)). If the prison terms for respondents' other federal sentences could not begin until after their $ 924(c) termswere completed, however, the District Court would effectively be stripped of its statutory power to decide whether
the sentences for the underlying narcotics offenses shouldrun concurrently with respondents' state terms of imprisonment. 65 F. 3d, at 822. The court observed that such a rulecould lead to dramatically higher sentences, particularly for
the respondents in this case. Perez, for example, is alreadyserving a 17-year state prison term for his role in the holdup.
Normally, his 7.25-year federal sentence for narcotics possession would run concurrently with that state term under
USSG $ 5G1.3(b); his 5-year firearm sentence under $ 924(c)
would follow both, for a total of 22 years in prison. If he
must serve his federal narcotics sentence after his 5-year
firearms sentence, however, he would face a total of 29.25
years in prison. 65 F. 3d, at 821.

Seeking to avoid this conflict between $ 924(c) (as reinterpreted in light of its legislative history) and $ 3584(a), the
Court of Appeals held that $ 924(c) only prohibited running
federal terms of imprisonment concurrently. Ibid. It also
reasoned that such a narrow reading was necessary because
"there is no way in which a later-sentencing federal court
can cause the mandatory 5-year $ 924(c) sentence to be
served before a state sentence that is already being
served." Ibid.

We see three flaws in this reasoning. First, the statutory
texts of $$ 924(c) and 3584(a), unvarnished by legislative
history, are entirely consistent. Section 924(c) specifies
only that a court must not run a firearms sentence concurrently with other prison terms. It leaves plenty of room
for a court to run other sentences--whether for state or federal offenses--concurrently with one another pursuant to

$ 3584(a) and USSG $ 5G1.3. The statutes clash only if we
engraft onto $ 924(c) a requirement found only in a single

520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN
8 UNITED STATES v. GONZALES

Opinion of the Court
sentence buried in the legislative history: that the firearmssentence must run first. We therefore follow the text,

rather than the legislative history, of $ 924(c). By disregard-ing the suggestion that a district court must specify that
a sentence for a firearms conviction be served before other
sentences, we give full meaning to the texts of both $$ 924(c)and 3584(a). See

United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat.
76, 95-96 (1820) (Marshall, C. J.) ("Where there is no ambigu-ity in the words, there is no room for construction. The

case must be a strong one indeed, which would justify acourt in departing from the plain meaning of words . . . in
search of an intention which the words themselves did not
suggest").

Second, even if we ignored the plain language of $ 924(c)
and required courts to list the order in which a defendant
must serve the sentences for different convictions, we would
thereby create a rule that is superfluous in light of $ 3584(c).
That statute instructs the Bureau of Prisons to treat multiple terms of imprisonment, whether imposed concurrently or
consecutively, "for administrative purposes as a single, aggregate term of imprisonment." Ibid. As a practical matter, then, it makes no difference whether a court specifies
the sequence in which each portion of an aggregate sentence
must be served. We will not impose on sentencing courts
new duties that, in view of other statutory commands, will
be effectively meaningless.

Third, the Court of Appeals' solution--to allow $ 924(c)
prison terms to run concurrently with state sentences--does
not eliminate any anomaly that arises when a firearms sentence must run "first." Although it is clear that a prison
term under $ 924(c) cannot possibly run before an earlier imposed state prison term, the same holds true when a prisoner
is already serving a federal sentence. See $ 3585(a) (providing that a federal prison term commences when the defendant is received into custody or voluntarily arrives to begin
serving the sentence). Because it is impossible to start a

9Cite as: 520 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

$ 924(c) sentence before any prison term that the prisoner isalready serving, whether imposed by a state or federal court,

limiting the phrase "any other term of imprisonment" tostate sentences does not get rid of the problem. Thus, we
think that the Court of Appeals both invented the problem
and devised the wrong solution.

Justice Breyer questions, in dissent, whether Congress
wanted to impose a $ 924(c) sentence on a defendant who isalready serving a prison term pursuant to a virtually identical state sentencing enhancement statute. Post, at 15. Afederal court could not (for double jeopardy reasons) sentence a person to two consecutive federal prison terms for a
single violation of a federal criminal statute, such as $ 924(c).
If Congress cannot impose two consecutive federal $ 924(c)
sentences, the dissent argues, it is unlikely that Congress
would have wanted to stack a $ 924(c) sentence onto a prison
term under a virtually identical state firearms enhancement.
Ibid.

As we have already observed, however, the straightforward language of $ 924(c) leaves no room to speculate
about congressional intent. See supra, at 4-5. The statute
speaks of "any term of imprisonment" without limitation,
and there is no intimation that Congress meant $ 924(c)
sentences to run consecutively only to certain types of
prison terms. District courts have some discretion under
the Sentencing Guidelines, of course, in cases where related
offenses are prosecuted in multiple proceedings, to establish
sentences "with an eye toward having such punishments approximate the total penalty that would have been imposed
had the sentences for the different offenses been imposed at
the same time . . . ." Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389,
404 (1995) (discussing USSG $ 5G1.3). See post, at 14-15
(Breyer, J., dissenting). When Congress enacted $ 924(c)'s
consecutive-sentencing provision, however, it cabined the
sentencing discretion of district courts in a single circumstance: When a defendant violates $ 924(c), his sentencing en520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
hancement under that statute must run consecutively to all
other prison terms. Given this clear legislative directive, it
is not for the courts to carve out statutory exceptions based
on judicial perceptions of good sentencing policy.

Other language in $ 924(c) reinforces our conclusion. In
1984, Congress amended $ 924(c) so that its sentencing enhancement would apply regardless of whether the underlying felony statute "provides for an enhanced punishment if
committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or
device." Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub. L.
98-473, $ 1005(a), 98 Stat. 2138-2139. Congress thus repudiated the result we reached in Busic v. United States, 446
U. S. 398 (1980), in which we held that "prosecution and enhanced sentencing under $ 924(c) is simply not permissible
where the predicate felony statute contains its own enhancement provision," irrespective of whether the Government
had actually sought an enhancement under that predicate
statute. Id., at 404; see also Simpson v. United States, 435
U. S. 6, 15 (1978) (holding that a federal court may not impose sentences under both $ 924(c) and the weapon enhancement under the armed bank robbery statute, 18 U. S. C.

$ 2113, based on a single criminal transaction). Our holdings
in these cases were based on our conclusion that the unamended text of $ 924(c) left us with little "more than a
guess" as to how Congress meant to mesh that statute with
the sentencing enhancement provisions scattered throughout
the federal criminal code. Simpson, supra, at 15; Busic,
supra, at 405. The 1984 amendment, however, eliminated
these ambiguities. At that point, Congress made clear its
desire to run $ 924(c) enhancements consecutively to all other
prison terms, regardless of whether they were imposed
under firearms enhancement statutes similar to $ 924(c). We
therefore cannot agree with Justice Breyer's contention
that our interpretation of $ 924(c) distinguishes between
"those subject to undischarged state, and those subject to

520US1 Unit: $U31 [09-10-99 14:11:10] PAGES PGT: OPIN

11Cite as: 520 U. S. 1 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
undischarged federal, sentences." Post, at 16. Both sorts
of defendants face sentences for their other convictions that
run concurrently with or consecutively to each other according to normal sentencing principles, plus an enhancement
under $ 924(c). In short, in light of the 1984 amendment, we
think that Congress has foreclosed the dissent's argument
that $ 924(c) covers only federal sentences.

Finally, we pause to comment on Justice Stevens' concern over how today's decision might affect other cases
where "the state trial follows the federal trial and the state
judge imposes a concurrent sentence" that might be viewed
as inconsistent with $ 924(c). Post, at 12. That, of course,
was not the sequence in which the respondents were sentenced in this case, and so we have no occasion to decide
whether a later sentencing state court is bound to order its
sentence to run consecutively to the $ 924(c) term of imprisonment. See ibid. All that is before us today is the authority of a later sentencing federal court to impose a consecutive
sentence under $ 924(c). We are hesitant to reach beyond
the facts of this case to decide a question that is not squarely
presented for our review.

III

In sum, we hold that the plain language of 18 U. S. C.

$ 924(c) forbids a federal district court to direct that a term
of imprisonment under that statute run concurrently with
any other term of imprisonment, whether state or federal.
The statute does not, however, limit the court's authority
to order that other federal sentences run concurrently with
or consecutively to other prison terms--state or federal--
under $ 3584.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the
case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

12 UNITED STATES v. GONZALES

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Breyer joins,dissenting.

This case arose out of a criminal enterprise that violatedboth New Mexico law and federal law and gave rise to both
state and federal prosecutions. It raises a narrow butimportant question concerning the scope of the prohibition
against concurrent sentences contained in 18 U. S. C.$ 924(c)(1). As the Government reads that provision, it prohibits the $ 924(c) sentence from running concurrently witha state sentence that has already been imposed, but permits
concurrent state and federal sentences when the federalprosecution precedes the state prosecution.

1 Thus, the

length of the total term of imprisonment--including both thestate sentence and the federal sentence--is determined, in

part, by the happenstance of which case is tried first.Read literally, however, the text of $ 924(c)(1) would avoid
this anomalous result. Because the text broadly prohibitsthe $ 924(c) sentence from running "concurrently with any
other term of imprisonment" regardless of whether thatother term is imposed before or after the federal sentence,
if the statute is read literally, it would require state judgesto make any state term of imprisonment run consecutively
to the $ 924(c) sentence. Alternatively, if the state trial fol-lows the federal trial and the state judge imposes a concurrent sentence (because she does not read $ 924(c) as havingany applicability to state sentences), the literal text would
require the federal authorities to suspend the $ 924(c) sen-tence until the state sentence has been served.

By relying so heavily on pure textual analysis, the Court's
opinion would appear to dictate this result. Like the Gov-ernment, however, I do not think the statute can reasonably

be interpreted as containing any command to state sentencing judges or as requiring the suspension of any federal sen-tences when concurrent state sentences are later imposed.

Thus, common sense requires us to reject a purely literalreading of the text. The question that then arises is which

is the better of two plausible nonliteral readings. Shouldthe term "any other term of imprisonment" be narrowed by
reading it to cover only "any other term of imprisonment
that has already been imposed," as the Government argues,or "any other federal term of imprisonment," as respondents contend?For three reasons, I think it more likely that Congress
intended the latter interpretation. First, it borders on theirrational to assume that Congress would actually intend the
severity of the defendant's punishment in a case of this kindto turn on the happenstance of whether the state or the federal prosecution was concluded first. Respondents' readingof the statute avoids that anomaly. Second, when $ 924(c)
was amended in 1970 to prohibit concurrent sentences, seeTitle II, Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970, 84 Stat. 1889,
this prohibition applied only to the federal sentence imposedfor the underlying offense. When Congress amended the
statute in 1984 to broaden the prohibition beyond the under-lying offense, it said nothing about state sentences; if Congress had intended the amendment to apply to state as wellas federal sentences, I think there would have been some
mention of this important change in the legislative history.2Furthermore, the 1984 amendment was part of a general
revision of sentencing laws that sought to achieve moreuniformity and predictability in federal sentencing. See
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, 98 Stat. 1987, 18 U. S. C.$ 3551 et seq. The anomaly that the Government's reading of $ 924(c) authorizes is inconsistent with the basic uni-formity theme of the 1984 legislation. Finally, the context

in which the relevant language appears is concerned entirelywith federal sentencing. Indeed, the word "any" as used

earlier in the section unquestionably has the meaning "anyfederal."

3

Given the Government's recognition of the fact that a com-pletely literal reading of $ 924(c)(1) is untenable, and the

further fact that the Court offers nothing more than the dic-tionary definition of the word "any" to support its result, I
think the wiser course is to interpret that word in the prohi-bition against concurrent sentences as having the same
meaning as when the same word is first used in the statute.Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.
I believe that Justice Stevens is right. Section 924(c)
concerns federal, not state, sentences. Hence Congress in-tended the words "other term of imprisonment" to refer to

other federal, not other state, "terms." With respect to un-discharged state sentences, therefore, 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c) is
permissive, not mandatory. That is, it permits the federalsentencing judge to make a $ 924(c) sentence and an undischarged state sentence concurrent.

Quite often, it will make little difference that, in this state/federal circumstance, the consecutive/concurrent decision is

permissive, not mandatory. That is because federal sentenc-ing judges, understanding that $ 924 requires consecutive
sentencing where undischarged federal sentences are atissue, would normally treat undischarged state sentences the
same way. They would make the $ 924(c) sentence consecu3 In the first sentence of $ 924(c)(1) the word "any" is expressly confined
to federal prosecutions. When the word is used a second time to describe
"any other provision of law," it is again quite obvious that it embraces
only other provisions of federal law even though that limitation is implicit
rather than explicit. Nowhere in $ 924(c) is there any explicit reference
to state law or state sentences.

tive to undischarged state sentences (even though $ 924(c)would not force that result) in order to avoid treating similarly situated offenders differently. United States Sen-tencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 5G1.3 (Nov. 1995).
Ordinarily, the fact that the State, rather than the Federal
Government, imposed an undischarged sentence is irrelevantin terms of any sentencing objective.

In at least one circumstance, however, federal sentencingjudges would probably not treat an undischarged state sentence as if it were federal. That is where the undischargedstate sentence is a sentence under a state statute that itself
simply mimics $ 924(c). Such a situation cannot arise
where the initial undischarged sentence is federal. Indeed,
the Constitution would forbid any effort to apply $ 924(c)
twice to a single instance of gun possession. Brown v. Ohio,
432 U. S. 161, 165 (1977). But a State might have its own
version of $ 924(c), and a federal $ 924(c) offender could be
subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment imposed
under such a statute. To run a $ 924(c) sentence consecutively in such an instance (even if constitutionally permissible, cf. Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187 (1959); Heath v.
Alabama, 474 U. S. 82 (1985)) would treat the state offender
differently, and far more harshly, than any possible federal
counterpart.

I am not inventing a purely hypothetical possibility. The
State, in the very case before us, has punished respondents,
in part, pursuant to a mandatory state sentence enhancement statute that has no counterpart in federal law but
for $ 924(c) itself, which the state statute, N. M. Stat. Ann.

$ 31-18-16(A) (Supp. 1994), very much resembles. But cf.
Witte v. United States, 515 U. S. 389, 398-404 (1995). I understand that Congress wanted to guarantee that $ 924(c)'s
sentence would amount to an additional sentence. But I do
not see why Congress would have wanted to pile Pelion on
Ossa in this way, adding the $ 924(c) sentence to another sentence that does the identical thing. Nor do I believe that

Congress would have intended potentially to create this kindof harsh distinction between those subject to undischarged

state, and those subject to undischarged federal, sentences--a likely practical result of the majority's holding. See id.,
at 404-406.This reason, along with those that

WARNER-JENKINSON CO., INC. v. HILTON DAVIS

CHEMICAL CO.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe federal circuit

No. 95-728. Argued October 15, 1996--Decided March 3, 1997
Petitioner and respondent both manufacture dyes from which impurities

must be removed. Respondent's " '746 patent," which issued in 1985,
discloses an improved purification process involving the "ultrafiltration"
of dye through a porous membrane at pH levels between 6.0 and 9.0.
The inventors so limited their claim's pH element during patent prosecution after the patent examiner objected because of a perceived overlap
with the earlier "Booth" patent, which disclosed an ultrafiltration process operating at a pH above 9.0. In 1986, petitioner developed its own
ultrafiltration process, which operated at a pH level of 5.0. Respondent
sued for infringement of the '746 patent, relying solely on the "doctrine
of equivalents," under which a product or process that does not literally
infringe upon the express terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be
found to infringe if there is "equivalence" between the elements of the
accused product or process and the claimed elements of the patented
invention. Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U. S.
605, 609. Over petitioner's objections that this is an equitable doctrine
and is to be applied by the court, the equivalence issue was included
among those sent to the jury, which found, inter alia, that petitioner
infringed upon the '746 patent. The District Court, among its rulings,
entered a permanent injunction against petitioner. The en banc Federal Circuit affirmed, holding that the doctrine of equivalents continues
to exist, that the question of equivalence is for the jury to decide, and
that the jury had substantial evidence from which to conclude that petitioner's process was not substantially different from the process disclosed in the '746 patent.

Held:

1. The Court adheres to the doctrine of equivalents. Pp. 24-30.

(a) In Graver Tank, supra, at 609, the Court, inter alia, described
some of the considerations that go into applying the doctrine, such as
the patent's context, the prior art, and the particular circumstances of
the case, including the purpose for which an ingredient is used in the
patent, the qualities it has when combined with the other ingredients,
the function it is intended to perform, and whether persons reasonably

skilled in the art would have known of the interchangeability of an
ingredient not contained in the patent with one that was. Pp. 24-25.

(b) This Court rejects petitioner's primary argument, that the doctrine of equivalents, as set out in Graver Tank in 1950, is inconsistent
with, and thus did not survive, particular aspects of Congress' 1952 revision of the Patent Act, 35 U. S. C. $ 100 et seq. Petitioner's first three
arguments in this regard--that the doctrine (1) is inconsistent with

$ 112's requirement that a patentee specifically "claim" the covered invention, (2) circumvents the patent reissue process under $$ 251-252,
and (3) is inconsistent with the primacy of the Patent and Trademark
Office (PTO) in setting a patent's scope--were made in Graver Tank,
supra, at 613-615, and n. 3, in the context of the 1870 Patent Act, and
failed to command a majority. The 1952 Act is not materially different
from the 1870 Act with regard to these matters. Also unpersuasive is
petitioner's fourth argument, that the doctrine of equivalents was implicitly rejected as a general matter by Congress' specific and limited
inclusion of it in $ 112, || 6. This new provision was enacted as a targeted cure in response to Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v.
Walker, 329 U. S. 1, 8, and thereby to allow so-called "means" claims
describing an element of an invention by the result accomplished or the
function served. Moreover, the statutory reference to "equivalents"
appears to be no more than a prophylactic against potential side effects
of that cure, i. e., an attempt to limit the application of the broad literal
language of "means" claims to those means that are "equivalent" to the
actual means shown in the patent specification. Pp. 25-28.

(c) The determination of equivalence should be applied as an objective inquiry on an element-by-element basis. The Court is concerned
that the doctrine, as it has come to be broadly applied since Graver
Tank, conflicts with the Court's numerous holdings that a patent may
not be enlarged beyond the scope of its claims. The way to reconcile
the two lines of authority is to apply the doctrine to each of the individual elements of a claim, rather than to the accused product or process
as a whole. Doing so will preserve some meaning for each of a claim's
elements, all of which are deemed material to defining the invention's
scope. So long as the doctrine does not encroach beyond these limits,
or beyond related limits discussed in the Court's opinion, infra, at 30-34,
39, n. 8, and 39-40, it will not vitiate the central functions of patent
claims to define the invention and to notify the public of the patent's
scope. Pp. 28-30.

(d) Petitioner is correct that Graver Tank did not supersede the
well-established limitation on the doctrine of equivalents known as
"prosecution history estoppel," whereby a surrender of subject matter
during patent prosecution may preclude recapturing any part of that

520US1 Unit: $U32 [09-10-99 14:21:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

19Cite as: 520 U. S. 17 (1997)
Syllabus
subject matter, even if it is equivalent to the matter expressly claimed.
But petitioner reaches too far in arguing that any such surrender establishes a bright line beyond which no equivalents may be claimed, and
that the reason for an amendment during patent prosecution is therefore
irrelevant to any subsequent estoppel. There are a variety of reasons
why the PTO may request a change in claim language, and if the patent
holder demonstrates that an amendment had a purpose unrelated to
patentability, a court must consider that purpose in order to decide
whether an estoppel is precluded. Where the patent holder is unable
to establish such a purpose, the court should presume that the purpose
behind the required amendment is such that prosecution history estoppel would apply. Here, it is undisputed that the upper limit of 9.0 pH
was added to the '746 patent in order to distinguish the Booth patent,
but the record before this Court does not reveal the reason for adding
the lower 6.0 pH limit. It is therefore impossible to tell whether the
latter reason could properly avoid an estoppel. Pp. 30-34.

(e) The Court rejects petitioner's argument that Graver Tank requires judicial exploration of the intent of the alleged infringer or a
case's other equities before allowing application of the doctrine of equivalents. Although Graver Tank certainly leaves room for the inclusion
of intent-based elements in the doctrine, the Court does not read the
case as requiring proof of intent. The better view, and the one consistent with Graver Tank's predecessors, see, e. g., Winans v. Denmead, 15
How. 330, 343, and the objective approach to infringement, is that intent
plays no role in the doctrine's application. Pp. 34-36.

(f) The Court also rejects petitioner's proposal that in order to minimize conflict with the notice function of patent claims, the doctrine of
equivalents should be limited to equivalents that are disclosed within
the patent itself. Insofar as the question under the doctrine is whether
an accused element is equivalent to a claimed element, the proper time
for evaluating equivalency--and knowledge of interchangeability between elements--is at the time of infringement, not at the time the
patent was issued. P. 37.

(g) The Court declines to consider whether application of the doctrine of equivalents is a task for the judge or for the jury, since resolution of that question is not necessary to answer the question here
presented. Pp. 37-39.

(h) In the Court's view, the particular linguistic framework used to
determine "equivalence," whether the so-called "triple identity" test
or the "insubstantial differences" test, is less important than whether

the test is probative of the essential inquiry: Does the accused product
or process contain elements identical or equivalent to each claimed
element of the patented invention? Different linguistic frameworks

may be more suitable to different cases, depending on their particular
facts. The Court leaves it to the Federal Circuit's sound judgment
in this area of its special expertise to refine the formulation of the test
for equivalence in the orderly course of case-by-case determinations.
Pp. 39-40.

2. Because the Federal Circuit did not consider all of the requirements of the doctrine of equivalents as described by the Court in this
case, particularly as related to prosecution history estoppel and the
preservation of some meaning for each element in a claim, further proceedings are necessary. Pp. 40-41.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.
Nearly 50 years ago, this Court in Graver Tank & Mfg.
Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., 339 U. S. 605 (1950), set outthe modern contours of what is known in patent law as the

"doctrine of equivalents." Under this doctrine, a product orprocess that does not literally infringe upon the express
terms of a patent claim may nonetheless be found to infringeif there is "equivalence" between the elements of the accused
product or process and the claimed elements of the patentedinvention.

Id., at 609. Petitioner, which was found to haveinfringed upon respondent's patent under the doctrine of

equivalents, invites us to speak the death of that doctrine.We decline that invitation. The significant disagreement
within the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concern-ing the application of

Graver Tank suggests, however, thatthe doctrine is not free from confusion. We therefore will

endeavor to clarify the proper scope of the doctrine.

Opinion of the Court

pressures and pH levels,1 resulting in a high purity dye
product.

The '746 patent issued in 1985. As relevant to this case,
the patent claims as its invention an improvement in the ultrafiltration process as follows:

"In a process for the purification of a dye . . . the improvement which comprises: subjecting an aqueous solution . . . to ultrafiltration through a membrane having a
nominal pore diameter of 5-15 Angstroms under a hydrostatic pressure of approximately 200 to 400 p.s.i.g.,
at a pH from approximately 6.0 to 9.0, to thereby cause
separation of said impurities from said dye . . . ." App.
36-37 (emphasis added).

The inventors added the phrase "at a pH from approximately
6.0 to 9.0" during patent prosecution. At a minimum, this
phrase was added to distinguish a previous patent (the
"Booth" patent) that disclosed an ultrafiltration process operating at a pH above 9.0. The parties disagree as to why the
low-end pH limit of 6.0 was included as part of the claim.2

1 The pH, or power (exponent) of Hydrogen, of a solution is a measure
of its acidity or alkalinity. A pH of 7.0 is neutral; a pH below 7.0 is acidic;
and a pH above 7.0 is alkaline. Although measurement of pH is on a
logarithmic scale, with each whole number difference representing a tenfold difference in acidity, the practical significance of any such difference
will often depend on the context. Pure water, for example, has a neutral
pH of 7.0, whereas carbonated water has an acidic pH of 3.0, and concentrated hydrochloric acid has a pH approaching 0.0. On the other end of
the scale, milk of magnesia has a pH of 10.0, whereas household ammonia
has a pH of 11.9. 21 Encyclopedia Americana 844 (Int'l ed. 1990).

2 Petitioner contends that the lower limit was added because below a pH

of 6.0 the patented process created "foaming" problems in the plant and
because the process was not shown to work below that pH level. Brief
for Petitioner 4, n. 5, 37, n. 28. Respondent counters that the process was
successfully tested to pH levels as low as 2.2 with no effect on the process
because of foaming, but offers no particular explanation as to why the
lower level of 6.0 pH was selected. Brief for Respondent 34, n. 34.

Opinion of the Court
In 1986, Warner-Jenkinson developed an ultrafiltrationprocess that operated with membrane pore diameters assumed to be 5-15 Angstroms, at pressures of 200 to nearly500 p. s. i. g., and at a pH of 5.0. Warner-Jenkinson did not
learn of the '746 patent until after it had begun commercial
use of its ultrafiltration process. Hilton Davis eventuallylearned of Warner-Jenkinson's use of ultrafiltration and, in

1991, sued Warner-Jenkinson for patent infringement.As trial approached, Hilton Davis conceded that there was
no literal infringement, and relied solely on the doctrine ofequivalents. Over Warner-Jenkinson's objection that the
doctrine of equivalents was an equitable doctrine to be applied by the court, the issue of equivalence was included
among those sent to the jury. The jury found that the '746
patent was not invalid and that Warner-Jenkinson infringed
upon the patent under the doctrine of equivalents. The jury
also found, however, that Warner-Jenkinson had not intentionally infringed, and therefore awarded only 20% of the
damages sought by Hilton Davis. The District Court denied
Warner-Jenkinson's post-trial motions, and entered a permanent injunction prohibiting Warner-Jenkinson from practicing ultrafiltration below 500 p. s. i. g. and below 9.01 pH. A
fractured en banc Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
affirmed. 62 F. 3d 1512 (1995).

The majority below held that the doctrine of equivalents
continues to exist and that its touchstone is whether substantial differences exist between the accused process and the
patented process. Id., at 1521-1522. The court also held
that the question of equivalence is for the jury to decide and
that the jury in this case had substantial evidence from
which it could conclude that the Warner-Jenkinson process
was not substantially different from the ultrafiltration process disclosed in the '746 patent. Id., at 1525.

There were three separate dissents, commanding a total
of 5 of 12 judges. Four of the five dissenting judges viewed
the doctrine of equivalents as allowing an improper expan520US1 Unit: $U32 [09-10-99 14:21:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sion of claim scope, contrary to this Court's numerous holdings that it is the claim that defines the invention and gives
notice to the public of the limits of the patent monopoly. Id.,
at 1537-1538 (opinion of Plager, J.). The fifth dissenter, the
late Judge Nies, was able to reconcile the prohibition against
enlarging the scope of claims and the doctrine of equivalents
by applying the doctrine to each element of a claim, rather
than to the accused product or process "overall." Id., at
1574. As she explained it: "The `scope' is not enlarged if
courts do not go beyond the substitution of equivalent elements." Ibid. All of the dissenters, however, would have
found that a much narrowed doctrine of equivalents may be
applied in whole or in part by the court. Id., at 1540-1542
(opinion of Plager, J.); id., at 1579 (opinion of Nies, J.).

We granted certiorari, 516 U. S. 1145 (1996), and now
reverse and remand.

II

In Graver Tank we considered the application of the doctrine of equivalents to an accused chemical composition for
use in welding that differed from the patented welding material by the substitution of one chemical element. 339 U. S.,
at 610. The substituted element did not fall within the literal terms of the patent claim, but the Court nonetheless
found that the "question which thus emerges is whether the
substitution [of one element for the other] . . . is a change of
such substance as to make the doctrine of equivalents inapplicable; or conversely, whether under the circumstances the
change was so insubstantial that the trial court's invocation
of the doctrine of equivalents was justified." Ibid. The
Court also described some of the considerations that go into
applying the doctrine of equivalents:

"What constitutes equivalency must be determined
against the context of the patent, the prior art, and the
particular circumstances of the case. Equivalence, in
the patent law, is not the prisoner of a formula and is

520US1 Unit: $U32 [09-10-99 14:21:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

25Cite as: 520 U. S. 17 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
not an absolute to be considered in a vacuum. It doesnot require complete identity for every purpose and

in every respect. In determining equivalents, thingsequal to the same thing may not be equal to each other
and, by the same token, things for most purposes different may sometimes be equivalents. Consideration mustbe given to the purpose for which an ingredient is used

in a patent, the qualities it has when combined with theother ingredients, and the function which it is intended
to perform. An important factor is whether personsreasonably skilled in the art would have known of the
interchangeability of an ingredient not contained in thepatent with one that was."

Id., at 609.

Considering those factors, the Court viewed the differencebetween the chemical element claimed in the patent and the

substitute element to be "colorable only," and concluded thatthe trial court's judgment of infringement under the doctrine
of equivalents was proper. Id., at 612.

A
Petitioner's primary argument in this Court is that the
doctrine of equivalents, as set out in Graver Tank in 1950,did not survive the 1952 revision of the Patent Act, 35

U. S. C. $ 100 et seq., because it is inconsistent with severalaspects of that Act. In particular, petitioner argues: (1) The
doctrine of equivalents is inconsistent with the statutory requirement that a patentee specifically "claim" the inventioncovered by a patent, $ 112; (2) the doctrine circumvents the

patent reissue process--designed to correct mistakes in draft-ing or the like--and avoids the express limitations on that
process, $$ 251-252; (3) the doctrine is inconsistent with theprimacy of the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) in setting
the scope of a patent through the patent prosecution process;
and (4) the doctrine was implicitly rejected as a general matter by Congress' specific and limited inclusion of the doctrine

in one section regarding "means" claiming, $ 112, || 6. All
but one of these arguments were made in Graver Tank in
the context of the 1870 Patent Act, and failed to command
a majority.3

The 1952 Patent Act is not materially different from the
1870 Act with regard to claiming, reissue, and the role of
the PTO. Compare, e. g., 35 U. S. C. $ 112 ("The specification
shall conclude with one or more claims particularly pointing
out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention") with the Consolidated Patent Act of 1870, ch. 230, $ 26, 16 Stat. 198, 201 (the applicant
"shall particularly point out and distinctly claim the part,
improvement, or combination which he claims as his invention or discovery"). Such minor differences as exist between those provisions in the 1870 and the 1952 Acts have
no bearing on the result reached in Graver Tank, and thus
provide no basis for our overruling it. In the context of infringement, we have already held that pre-1952 precedent
survived the passage of the 1952 Act. See Aro Mfg. Co. v.
Convertible Top Replacement Co., 365 U. S. 336, 342 (1961)
(new section defining infringement "left intact the entire

3 Graver Tank was decided over a vigorous dissent. In that dissent,
Justice Black raised the first three of petitioner's four arguments against
the doctrine of equivalents. See 339 U. S., at 613-614 (doctrine inconsistent with statutory requirement to "distinctly claim" the invention); id., at
614-615 (patent reissue process available to correct mistakes); id., at 615,
n. 3 (duty lies with the Patent Office to examine claims and to conform
them to the scope of the invention; inventors may appeal Patent Office
determinations if they disagree with result).

Indeed, petitioner's first argument was not new even in 1950. Nearly
100 years before Graver Tank, this Court approved of the doctrine of
equivalents in Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330 (1854). The dissent in
Winans unsuccessfully argued that the majority result was inconsistent
with the requirement in the 1836 Patent Act that the applicant "particularly `specify and point' out what he claims as his invention," and that the
patent protected nothing more. Id., at 347 (opinion of Campbell, J.).

body of case law on direct infringement"). We see no reasonto reach a different result here.

Petitioner's fourth argument for an implied congressionalnegation of the doctrine of equivalents turns on the reference

to "equivalents" in the "means" claiming provision of the1952 Act. Section 112, || 6, a provision not contained in the
1870 Act, states:

"An element in a claim for a combination may be ex-pressed as a means or step for performing a specified

function without the recital of structure, material, oracts in support thereof, and such claim shall be construed to cover the corresponding structure, material,or acts described in the specification and equivalents
thereof." (Emphasis added.)
Thus, under this new provision, an applicant can describe anelement of his invention by the result accomplished or the

function served, rather than describing the item or elementto be used (

e. g., "a means of connecting Part A to Part B,"rather than "a two-penny nail"). Congress enacted $ 112,

|| 6, in response to Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. v.
Walker, 329 U. S. 1 (1946), which rejected claims that "donot describe the invention but use `conveniently functional

language at the exact point of novelty.' " Id., at 8 (citation

4 Petitioner argues that the evolution in patent practice from "central"
claiming (describing the core principles of the invention) to "peripheral"
claiming (describing the outer boundaries of the invention) requires that
we treat Graver Tank as an aberration and abandon the doctrine of equivalents. Brief for Petitioner 43-45. We disagree. The suggested change
in claiming practice predates Graver Tank, is not of statutory origin, and
seems merely to reflect narrower inventions in more crowded arts. Also,
judicial recognition of so-called "pioneer" patents suggests that the abandonment of "central" claiming may be overstated. That a claim describing a limited improvement in a crowded field will have a limited range of
permissible equivalents does not negate the availability of the doctrine
vel non.

$ 8.04[2], pp. 63-64 (1996) (discussing 1954 commentary ofthen-Chief Patent Examiner P. J. Federico). Section 112,
|| 6, now expressly allows so-called "means" claims, with theproviso that application of the broad literal language of such
claims must be limited to only those means that are "equiva-len[t]" to the actual means shown in the patent specification.
This is an application of the doctrine of equivalents in a re-strictive role, narrowing the application of broad literal claim
elements. We recognized this type of role for the doctrineof equivalents in Graver Tank itself. 339 U. S., at 608-609.
The added provision, however, is silent on the doctrine ofequivalents as applied where there is no literal infringement.

Because $ 112, || 6, was enacted as a targeted cure to aspecific problem, and because the reference in that provision
to "equivalents" appears to be no more than a prophylacticagainst potential side effects of that cure, such limited congressional action should not be overread for negative impli-cations. Congress in 1952 could easily have responded to
Graver Tank as it did to the Halliburton decision. But itdid not. Absent something more compelling than the dubious negative inference offered by petitioner, the lengthy his-tory of the doctrine of equivalents strongly supports adherence to our refusal in Graver Tank to find that the PatentAct conflicts with that doctrine. Congress can legislate the
doctrine of equivalents out of existence any time it chooses.The various policy arguments now made by both sides are
thus best addressed to Congress, not this Court.

B
We do, however, share the concern of the dissenters belowthat the doctrine of equivalents, as it has come to be applied

since Graver Tank, has taken on a life of its own, unbounded

Opinion of the Court
by the patent claims. There can be no denying that the doc-trine of equivalents, when applied broadly, conflicts with the

definitional and public-notice functions of the statutoryclaiming requirement. Judge Nies identified one means of
avoiding this conflict:

"[A] distinction can be drawn that is not too esotericbetween substitution of an equivalent for a component

in an invention and enlarging the metes and bounds ofthe invention beyond what is claimed.

. . . . .
"Where a claim to an invention is expressed as a com-bination of elements, as here, `equivalents' in the sobriquet `Doctrine of Equivalents' refers to the equivalencyof an

element or part of the invention with one that issubstituted in the accused product or process.

. . . . .
"This view that the accused device or process must bemore than `equivalent'

overall reconciles the SupremeCourt's position on infringement by equivalents with its

concurrent statements that `the courts have no right toenlarge a patent beyond the scope of its claims as allowed by the Patent Office.' [Citations omitted.] The`scope' is not enlarged if courts do not go beyond the
substitution of equivalent elements." 62 F. 3d, at 1573-1574 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original).

We concur with this apt reconciliation of our two lines ofprecedent. Each element contained in a patent claim is
deemed material to defining the scope of the patented inven-tion, and thus the doctrine of equivalents must be applied to
individual elements of the claim, not to the invention as awhole. It is important to ensure that the application of the
doctrine, even as to an individual element, is not allowedsuch broad play as to effectively eliminate that element in
its entirety. So long as the doctrine of equivalents does notencroach beyond the limits just described, or beyond related

limits to be discussed infra this page and 31-34, 39, n. 8, and39-40, we are confident that the doctrine will not vitiate the

central functions of the patent claims themselves.

III
Understandably reluctant to assume this Court wouldoverrule

Graver Tank, petitioner has offered alternative ar-guments in favor of a more restricted doctrine of equivalents

than it feels was applied in this case. We address each inturn.

A
Petitioner first argues that Graver Tank never purportedto supersede a well-established limit on nonliteral infringement, known variously as "prosecution history estoppel" and"file wrapper estoppel." See Bayer Aktiengesellschaft v.
Duphar Int'l Research B. V., 738 F. 2d 1237, 1238 (CA Fed.1984). According to petitioner, any surrender of subject
matter during patent prosecution, regardless of the reasonfor such surrender, precludes recapturing any part of that
subject matter, even if it is equivalent to the matter ex-pressly claimed. Because, during patent prosecution, respondent limited the pH element of its claim to pH levelsbetween 6.0 and 9.0, petitioner would have those limits form
bright lines beyond which no equivalents may be claimed.Any inquiry into the reasons for a surrender, petitioner
claims, would undermine the public's right to clear notice ofthe scope of the patent as embodied in the patent file.

We can readily agree with petitioner that Graver Tank didnot dispose of prosecution history estoppel as a legal limitation on the doctrine of equivalents. But petitioner reachestoo far in arguing that the reason for an amendment during
patent prosecution is irrelevant to any subsequent estoppel.In each of our cases cited by petitioner and by the dissent
below, prosecution history estoppel was tied to amendmentsmade to avoid the prior art, or otherwise to address a specific
concern--such as obviousness--that arguably would have

Opinion of the Court
rendered the claimed subject matter unpatentable. Thus, inExhibit Supply Co. v. Ace Patents Corp., 315 U. S. 126 (1942),

Chief Justice Stone distinguished inclusion of a limitingphrase in an original patent claim from the "very different"
situation in which "the applicant, in order to meet objectionsin the Patent Office,

based on references to the prior art,adopted the phrase as a substitute for the broader one" previously used. Id., at 136 (emphasis added). Similarly, inKeystone Driller Co. v. Northwest Engineering Corp., 294
U. S. 42 (1935), estoppel was applied where the initial claimswere "rejected on the prior art," id., at 48, n. 6, and where
the allegedly infringing equivalent element was outside ofthe revised claims and within the prior art that formed the
basis for the rejection of the earlier claims, id., at 48.5It is telling that in each case this Court probed the reasoning behind the Patent Office's insistence upon a changein the claims. In each instance, a change was demanded
because the claim as otherwise written was viewed as notdescribing a patentable invention at all--typically because
what it described was encompassed within the prior art.But, as the United States informs us, there are a variety of
other reasons why the PTO may request a change in claimlanguage. Brief for United States as

not of his invention"); cf. Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 383
U. S. 1, 33 (1966) (noting, in a validity determination, that "claims that
have been narrowed in order to obtain the issuance of a patent by distinguishing the prior art cannot be sustained to cover that which was previously by limitation eliminated from the patent").

Opinion of the Court

(counsel for the PTO also appearing on the brief). And if
the PTO has been requesting changes in claim language
without the intent to limit equivalents or, indeed, with the
expectation that language it required would in many cases
allow for a range of equivalents, we should be extremely reluctant to upset the basic assumptions of the PTO without
substantial reason for doing so. Our prior cases have consistently applied prosecution history estoppel only where
claims have been amended for a limited set of reasons, and
we see no substantial cause for requiring a more rigid rule
invoking an estoppel regardless of the reasons for a change.6

In this case, the patent examiner objected to the patent
claim due to a perceived overlap with the Booth patent,
which revealed an ultrafiltration process operating at a pH
above 9.0. In response to this objection, the phrase "at a
pH from approximately 6.0 to 9.0" was added to the claim.
While it is undisputed that the upper limit of 9.0 was added
in order to distinguish the Booth patent, the reason for adding the lower limit of 6.0 is unclear. The lower limit certainly did not serve to distinguish the Booth patent, which
said nothing about pH levels below 6.0. Thus, while a lower
limit of 6.0, by its mere inclusion, became a material element
of the claim, that did not necessarily preclude the application
of the doctrine of equivalents as to that element. See Hubbell v. United States, 179 U. S. 77, 82 (1900) (" `[A]ll [specified
elements] must be regarded as material,' " though it remains
an open " `question whether an omitted part is supplied by
an equivalent device or instrumentality' " (citation omitted)).

6 That petitioner's rule might provide a brighter line for determining
whether a patentee is estopped under certain circumstances is not a sufficient reason for adopting such a rule. This is especially true where, as
here, the PTO may have relied upon a flexible rule of estoppel when deciding whether to ask for a change in the first place. To change so substantially the rules of the game now could very well subvert the various balances the PTO sought to strike when issuing the numerous patents which
have not yet expired and which would be affected by our decision.

33Cite as: 520 U. S. 17 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Where the reason for the change was not related to avoidingthe prior art, the change may introduce a new element, but

it does not necessarily preclude infringement by equivalentsof that element.

7

We are left with the problem, however, of what to do in acase like the one at bar, where the record seems not to reveal

the reason for including the lower pH limit of 6.0. In ourview, holding that certain reasons for a claim amendment
may avoid the application of prosecution history estoppel isnot tantamount to holding that the

absence of a reason foran amendment may similarly avoid such an estoppel. Mindful that claims do indeed serve both a definitional and a no-tice function, we think the better rule is to place the burden
on the patent holder to establish the reason for an amend-ment required during patent prosecution. The court then
would decide whether that reason is sufficient to overcomeprosecution history estoppel as a bar to application of the
doctrine of equivalents to the element added by that amend-ment. Where no explanation is established, however, the
court should presume that the patent applicant had a sub-stantial reason related to patentability for including the
limiting element added by amendment. In those circum-stances, prosecution history estoppel would bar the application of the doctrine of equivalents as to that element. Thepresumption we have described, one subject to rebuttal if an
appropriate reason for a required amendment is established,gives proper deference to the role of claims in defining an
invention and providing public notice, and to the primacy of

7 We do not suggest that, where a change is made to overcome an objection based on the prior art, a court is free to review the correctness of
that objection when deciding whether to apply prosecution history estoppel. As petitioner rightly notes, such concerns are properly addressed on
direct appeal from the denial of a patent, and will not be revisited in an
infringement action. Smith v. Magic City Kennel Club, Inc., supra, at
789-790. What is permissible for a court to explore is the reason (right
or wrong) for the objection and the manner in which the amendment addressed and avoided the objection.

Opinion of the Court

the PTO in ensuring that the claims allowed cover only sub-ject matter that is properly patentable in a proffered patent

application. Applied in this fashion, prosecution historyestoppel places reasonable limits on the doctrine of equivalents, and further insulates the doctrine from any feared con-flict with the Patent Act.

Because respondent has not proffered in this Court a rea-son for the addition of a lower pH limit, it is impossible to
tell whether the reason for that addition could properly avoidan estoppel. Whether a reason in fact exists, but simply
was not adequately developed, we cannot say. On remand,the Federal Circuit can consider whether reasons for that
portion of the amendment were offered or not and whetherfurther opportunity to establish such reasons would be
proper. B

Petitioner next argues that even if Graver Tank remainsgood law, the case held only that the absence of substantial
differences was a necessary element for infringement underthe doctrine of equivalents, not that it was sufficient for such
a result. Brief for Petitioner 32. Relying on GraverTank's references to the problem of an "unscrupulous copyist" and "piracy," 339 U. S., at 607, petitioner would requirejudicial exploration of the equities of a case before allowing
application of the doctrine of equivalents. To be sure,
Graver Tank refers to the prevention of copying and piracywhen describing the benefits of the doctrine of equivalents.

That the doctrine produces such benefits, however, does notmean that its application is limited only to cases where those
particular benefits are obtained.

Elsewhere in Graver Tank the doctrine is described inmore neutral terms. And the history of the doctrine as relied upon by Graver Tank reflects a basis for the doctrinenot so limited as petitioner would have it. In

Winans v.
Denmead, 15 How. 330, 343 (1854), we described the doctrine

520US1 Unit: $U32 [09-10-99 14:21:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

35Cite as: 520 U. S. 17 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
of equivalents as growing out of a legally implied term ineach patent claim that "the claim extends to the thing patented, however its form or proportions may be varied."Under that view, application of the doctrine of equivalents
involves determining whether a particular accused product
or process infringes upon the patent claim, where the claimtakes the form--half express, half implied--of "X and its

equivalents."

Machine Co. v. Murphy, 97 U. S. 120, 125 (1878), on which
Graver Tank also relied, offers a similarly intent-neutralview of the doctrine of equivalents:

"[T]he substantial equivalent of a thing, in the sense ofthe patent law, is the same as the thing itself; so that if
two devices do the same work in substantially the sameway, and accomplish substantially the same result, they
are the same, even though they differ in name, form,or shape."

If the essential predicate of the doctrine of equivalents isthe notion of identity between a patented invention and its
equivalent, there is no basis for treating an infringing equivalent any differently from a device that infringes the express
terms of the patent. Application of the doctrine of equivalents, therefore, is akin to determining literal infringement,
and neither requires proof of intent.

Petitioner also points to Graver Tank's seeming reliance
on the absence of independent experimentation by the alleged infringer as supporting an equitable defense to the doctrine of equivalents. The Federal Circuit explained this factor by suggesting that an alleged infringer's behavior, be it
copying, designing around a patent, or independent experimentation, indirectly reflects the substantiality of the differences between the patented invention and the accused device
or process. According to the Federal Circuit, a person aiming to copy or aiming to avoid a patent is imagined to be at

CHEMICAL CO.

Opinion of the Court

least marginally skilled at copying or avoidance, and thusintentional copying raises an inference--rebuttable by proof

of independent development--of having only insubstantialdifferences, and intentionally designing around a patent
claim raises an inference of substantial differences. This explanation leaves much to be desired. At a minimum, onewonders how ever to distinguish between the intentional

copyist making minor changes to lower the risk of legal ac-tion and the incremental innovator designing around the
claims, yet seeking to capture as much as is permissible ofthe patented advance.

But another explanation is available that does not require
a divergence from generally objective principles of patent
infringement. In both instances in Graver Tank where we
referred to independent research or experiments, we were
discussing the known interchangeability between the chemical compound claimed in the patent and the compound substituted by the alleged infringer. The need for independent experimentation thus could reflect knowledge--or lack
thereof--of interchangeability possessed by one presumably
skilled in the art. The known interchangeability of substitutes for an element of a patent is one of the express objective factors noted by Graver Tank as bearing upon whether
the accused device is substantially the same as the patented
invention. Independent experimentation by the alleged infringer would not always reflect upon the objective question
whether a person skilled in the art would have known of the
interchangeability between two elements, but in many cases
it would likely be probative of such knowledge.

Although Graver Tank certainly leaves room for petitioner's suggested inclusion of intent-based elements in the doctrine of equivalents, we do not read it as requiring them.
The better view, and the one consistent with Graver Tank's
predecessors and the objective approach to infringement, is
that intent plays no role in the application of the doctrine
of equivalents.

Opinion of the Court

C
Finally, petitioner proposes that in order to minimize con-flict with the notice function of patent claims, the doctrine of

equivalents should be limited to equivalents that are dis-closed within the patent itself. A milder version of this argument, which found favor with the dissenters below, is thatthe doctrine should be limited to equivalents that were
known at the time the patent was issued, and should notextend to after-arising equivalents.

As we have noted, supra, at 36, with regard to the objec-tive nature of the doctrine, a skilled practitioner's knowledge
of the interchangeability between claimed and accused ele-ments is not relevant for its own sake, but rather for what it
tells the factfinder about the similarities or differences be-tween those elements. Much as the perspective of the hypothetical "reasonable person" gives content to concepts suchas "negligent" behavior, the perspective of a skilled practitioner provides content to, and limits on, the concept of"equivalence." Insofar as the question under the doctrine
of equivalents is whether an accused element is equivalentto a claimed element, the proper time for evaluating equivalency--and thus knowledge of interchangeability between el-ements--is at the time of infringement, not at the time the
patent was issued. And rejecting the milder version of peti-tioner's argument necessarily rejects the more severe proposition that equivalents must not only be known, but mustalso be actually disclosed in the patent in order for such
equivalents to infringe upon the patent.

The various opinions below, respondents, and amici devoteconsiderable attention to whether application of the doctrine

of equivalents is a task for the judge or for the jury. How-ever, despite petitioner's argument below that the doctrine
should be applied by the judge, in this Court petitionermakes only passing reference to this issue. See Brief for

Petitioner 22, n. 15 ("If this Court were to hold in Markmanv.

Westview Instruments, Inc., No. 95-26 (argued Jan. 8,
1996), that judges rather than juries are to construe patentclaims, so as to provide a uniform definition of the scope of

the legally protected monopoly, it would seem at crosspurposes to say that juries may nonetheless expand theclaims by resort to a broad notion of `equivalents' "); Reply

Brief for Petitioner 20 (whether judge or jury should applythe doctrine of equivalents depends on how the Court views
the nature of the inquiry under the doctrine of equivalents).Petitioner's comments go more to the alleged inconsistency between the doctrine of equivalents and the claiming
requirement than to the role of the jury in applying the
doctrine as properly understood. Because resolution of
whether, or how much of, the application of the doctrine of
equivalents can be resolved by the court is not necessary for
us to answer the question presented, we decline to take it
up. The Federal Circuit held that it was for the jury to
decide whether the accused process was equivalent to the
claimed process. There was ample support in our prior
cases for that holding. See, e. g., Machine Co. v. Murphy, 97
U. S., at 125 ("[I]n determining the question of infringement,
the court or jury, as the case may be, . . . are to look at the
machines or their several devices or elements in the light of
what they do, or what office or function they perform, and
how they perform it, and to find that one thing is substantially the same as another, if it performs substantially the
same function in substantially the same way to obtain the
same result"); Winans v. Denmead, 15 How., at 344 ("[It] is
a question for the jury" whether the accused device was "the
same in kind, and effected by the employment of [the patentee's] mode of operation in substance"). Nothing in our recent decision in Markman v. Westview Instruments, Inc.,
517 U. S. 370 (1996), necessitates a different result than that
reached by the Federal Circuit. Indeed, Markman cites
with considerable favor, when discussing the role of judge

and jury, the seminal Winans decision. 517 U. S., at 384-385. Whether, if the issue were squarely presented to us,

we would reach a different conclusion than did the FederalCircuit is not a question we need decide today.

All that remains is to address the debate regarding thelinguistic framework under which "equivalence" is determined. Both the parties and the Federal Circuit spend con-siderable time arguing whether the so-called "triple identity" test--focusing on the function served by a particularclaim element, the

way that element serves that function,and the
result thus obtained by that element--is a suitablemethod for determining equivalence, or whether an "insubstantial differences" approach is better. There seems to besubstantial agreement that, while the triple identity test
may be suitable for analyzing mechanical devices, it often

8 With regard to the concern over unreviewability due to black-box jury
verdicts, we offer only guidance, not a specific mandate. Where the evidence is such that no reasonable jury could determine two elements to be
equivalent, district courts are obliged to grant partial or complete summary judgment. See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56; Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,
477 U. S. 317, 322-323 (1986). If there has been a reluctance to do so by
some courts due to unfamiliarity with the subject matter, we are confident
that the Federal Circuit can remedy the problem. Of course, the various
legal limitations on the application of the doctrine of equivalents are to be
determined by the court, either on a pretrial motion for partial summary
judgment or on a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of
the evidence and after the jury verdict. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56; Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 50. Thus, under the particular facts of a case, if prosecution history estoppel would apply or if a theory of equivalence would entirely vitiate a particular claim element, partial or complete judgment
should be rendered by the court, as there would be no further material
issue for the jury to resolve. Finally, in cases that reach the jury, a special verdict and/or interrogatories on each claim element could be very
useful in facilitating review, uniformity, and possibly postverdict judgments as a matter of law. See Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 49 and 50. We leave
it to the Federal Circuit how best to implement procedural improvements
to promote certainty, consistency, and reviewability to this area of the law.

Opinion of the Court

provides a poor framework for analyzing other products orprocesses. On the other hand, the insubstantial differences

test offers little additional guidance as to what might renderany given difference "insubstantial."

In our view, the particular linguistic framework used isless important than whether the test is probative of the essential inquiry: Does the accused product or process containelements identical or equivalent to each claimed element of
the patented invention? Different linguistic frameworksmay be more suitable to different cases, depending on their
particular facts. A focus on individual elements and a spe-cial vigilance against allowing the concept of equivalence to
eliminate completely any such elements should reduce con-siderably the imprecision of whatever language is used. An
analysis of the role played by each element in the context ofthe specific patent claim will thus inform the inquiry as to
whether a substitute element matches the function, way, andresult of the claimed element, or whether the substitute element plays a role substantially different from the claimedelement. With these limiting principles as a backdrop, we
see no purpose in going further and micromanaging the Fed-eral Circuit's particular word choice for analyzing equivalence. We expect that the Federal Circuit will refine theformulation of the test for equivalence in the orderly course
of case-by-case determinations, and we leave such refine-ment to that court's sound judgment in this area of its special expertise. VI

Today we adhere to the doctrine of equivalents. The determination of equivalence should be applied as an objective inquiry on an element-by-element basis. Prosecutionhistory estoppel continues to be available as a defense to

infringement, but if the patent holder demonstrates that anamendment required during prosecution had a purpose unrelated to patentability, a court must consider that purpose in

order to decide whether an estoppel is precluded. Where
the patent holder is unable to establish such a purpose, a
court should presume that the purpose behind the required
amendment is such that prosecution history estoppel would
apply. Because the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
did not consider all of the requirements as described by us
today, particularly as related to prosecution history estoppel
and the preservation of some meaning for each element in a
claim, we reverse its judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,
concurring.

I join the opinion of the Court and write separately to add
a cautionary note on the rebuttable presumption the Court
announces regarding prosecution history estoppel. I address in particular the application of the presumption in this
case and others in which patent prosecution has already been
completed. The new presumption, if applied woodenly,
might in some instances unfairly discount the expectations
of a patentee who had no notice at the time of patent prosecution that such a presumption would apply. Such a patentee would have had little incentive to insist that the reasons for all modifications be memorialized in the file wrapper
as they were made. Years after the fact, the patentee may
find it difficult to establish an evidentiary basis that would
overcome the new presumption. The Court's opinion is sensitive to this problem, noting that "the PTO may have relied
upon a flexible rule of estoppel when deciding whether to ask
for a change" during patent prosecution. Ante, at 32, n. 6.

Because respondent has not presented to this Court any
explanation for the addition of the lower pH limit, I concur
in the decision to remand the matter to the Federal Circuit.

ARIZONANS FOR OFFICIAL ENGLISH et al. v.

ARIZONA et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-974. Argued December 4, 1996--Decided March 3, 1997
Maria-Kelly F. Yniguez, an Arizona state employee at the time, sued the

State and its Governor, Attorney General, and Director of the Department of Administration under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, alleging that State
Constitution Article XXVIII--key provisions of which declare English
"the official language of the State," require the State to "act in English
and in no other language," and authorize state residents and businesses
"to bring [state-court] suit[s] to enforce th[e] Article"--violated, inter
alia, the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Yniguez used
both English and Spanish in her work and feared that Article XXVIII,
if read broadly, would require her to face discharge or other discipline
if she did not refrain from speaking Spanish while serving the State.
She requested injunctive and declaratory relief, counsel fees, and "all
other relief that the Court deems just and proper." During the early
phases of the suit, the State Attorney General released an opinion expressing his view that Article XXVIII is constitutional in that, although
it requires the expression of "official acts" in English, it allows government employees to use other languages to facilitate the delivery of governmental services. The Federal District Court heard testimony and,
among its rulings, determined that only the Governor, in her official
capacity, was a proper defendant. The court, at the same time, dismissed the State because of its Eleventh Amendment immunity, the
State Attorney General because he had no authority to enforce Article
XXVIII against state employees, and the Director because there was
no showing that she had undertaken or threatened any action adverse
to Yniguez; rejected the Attorney General's interpretation of the Article
on the ground that it conflicted with the measure's plain language; declared the Article fatally overbroad after reading it to impose a sweeping ban on the use of any language other than English by all of Arizona
officialdom; and declined to allow the Arizona courts the initial opportunity to determine the scope of Article XXVIII. Following the Governor's announcement that she would not appeal, the District Court
denied the State Attorney General's request to certify the pivotal statelaw question--the Article's correct construction--to the Arizona Supreme Court. The District Court also denied the State Attorney Gen520US1 Unit: $U33 [09-10-99 14:35:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

eral's motion to intervene on behalf of the State, under 28 U. S. C.

$ 2403(b), to contest on appeal the court's holding that the Article is
unconstitutional. In addition, the court denied the motion of newcomers Arizonans for Official English Committee (AOE) and its Chairman
Park, sponsors of the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII, to
intervene to support the Article's constitutionality. The day after
AOE, Park, and the State Attorney General filed their notices of appeal,
Yniguez resigned from state employment to accept a job in the private
sector. The Ninth Circuit then concluded that AOE and Park met
standing requirements under Article III of the Federal Constitution and
could proceed as party appellants, and that the Attorney General, having successfully obtained dismissal below, could not reenter as a party,
but could present an argument, pursuant to $ 2403(b), regarding the constitutionality of Article XXVIII. Thereafter, the State Attorney General informed the Ninth Circuit of Yniguez's resignation and suggested
that, for lack of a viable plaintiff, the case was moot. The court disagreed, holding that a plea for nominal damages could be read into the
complaint's "all other relief " clause to save the case. The en banc Ninth
Circuit ultimately affirmed the District Court's ruling that Article
XXVIII was unconstitutional, and announced that Yniguez was entitled
to nominal damages from the State. Finding the Article's "plain language" dispositive, and noting that the State Attorney General had
never conceded that the Article would be unconstitutional if construed
as Yniguez asserted it should be, the Court of Appeals also rejected the
Attorney General's limiting construction of the Article and declined to
certify the matter to the State Supreme Court. Finally, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged a state-court challenge to Article XXVIII's constitutionality, Ruiz v. State, but found that litigation no cause to stay the
federal proceedings.

Held: Because the case was moot and should not have been retained for

adjudication on the merits, the Court vacates the Ninth Circuit's judgment and remands the case with directions that the action be dismissed
by the District Court. This Court expresses no view on the correct
interpretation of Article XXVIII or on the measure's constitutionality.

law to represent the State's interests, see Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72,

U. S. 1077. Their assertion of representational or associational standing is also problematic, absent the concrete injury that would confer
standing upon AOE members in their own right, see, e. g., Food and
Commercial Workers v. Brown Group, Inc., 517 U. S. 544, 551-553, and
absent anything in Article XXVIII's state-court citizen-suit provision
that could support standing for Arizona residents in general, or AOE
in particular, to defend the Article's constitutionality in federal court.
Nevertheless, this Court need not definitively resolve the standing of
AOE and Park to proceed as they did, but assumes such standing arguendo in order to analyze the question of mootness occasioned by originating plaintiff Yniguez's departure from state employment. See, e. g.,
Burke v. Barnes, 479 U. S. 361, 363, 364, n. Pp. 64-67.

(b) Because Yniguez no longer satisfies the case-or-controversy requirement, this case is moot. To qualify as a case fit for federal-court
adjudication, an actual controversy must be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed. E. g., Preiser v.
Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401. Although Yniguez had a viable claim at
the outset of this litigation, her resignation from public sector employment to pursue work in the private sector, where her speech was not
governed by Article XXVIII, mooted the case stated in her complaint.
Cf. Boyle v. Landry, 401 U. S. 77, 78, 80-81. Contrary to the Ninth
Circuit's ruling, her implied plea for nominal damages, which the Ninth
Circuit approved as against the State of Arizona, could not revive the
case, as $ 1983 actions do not lie against a State, Will v. Michigan Dept.
of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71; Arizona was permitted to participate in
the appeal only as an intervenor, through its Attorney General, not as
a party subject to an obligation to pay damages; and the State's cooperation with Yniguez in waiving Eleventh Amendment immunity did not
recreate a live case or controversy fit for federal-court adjudication,
cf., e. g., United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 302, 304. Pp. 67-71.

(c) When a civil case becomes moot pending appellate adjudication,
the established practice in the federal system is to reverse or vacate the
judgment below and remand with a direction to dismiss. United States
v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39. This Court is not disarmed from
that course by the State Attorney General's failure to petition for certiorari. The Court has an obligation to inquire not only into its own

Syllabus
authority to decide the questions presented, but to consider also the
authority of the lower courts to proceed, even though the parties are
prepared to concede it. E. g., Bender v. Williamsport Area School
Dist., 475 U. S. 534, 541. Because the Ninth Circuit refused to stop the
adjudication when it learned of the mooting event--Yniguez's departure
from public employment--its unwarranted en banc judgment must be
set aside. Nor is the District Court's judgment saved by its entry before the occurrence of the mooting event or by the Governor's refusal
to appeal from it. AOE and Park had an arguable basis for seeking
appellate review; moreover, the State Attorney General's renewed certification plea and his motion to intervene in this litigation demonstrate
that he was pursuing his $ 2403(b) right to defend Article XXVIII's constitutionality when the mooting event occurred. His disclosure of that
event to the Ninth Circuit warranted a mootness disposition, which
would have stopped his $ 2403(b) endeavor and justified vacation of the
District Court's judgment. The extraordinary course of this litigation
and the federalism concern next considered lead to the conclusion that
vacatur down the line is the equitable solution. Pp. 71-75.

(d) Taking into account the novelty of the question of Article
XXVIII's meaning, its potential importance to the conduct of Arizona's
business, the State Attorney General's views on the subject, and the
at-least-partial agreement with those views by the Article's sponsors,
more respectful consideration should have been given to the Attorney
General's requests to seek, through certification, an authoritative construction of the Article from the State Supreme Court. When anticipatory relief is sought in federal court against a state statute, respect for
the place of the States in our federal system calls for close consideration
of the question whether conflict is avoidable. Federal courts are not
well equipped to rule on a state statute's constitutionality without a
controlling interpretation of the statute's meaning and effect by the
state courts. See, e. g., Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 526 (Harlan, J.,
dissenting). Certification saves time, energy, and resources and helps
build a cooperative judicial federalism. See, e. g., Lehman Brothers v.
Schein, 416 U. S. 386, 391. Contrary to the Ninth Circuit's suggestion,
this Court's decisions do not require as a condition precedent to certification a concession by the Attorney General that Article XXVIII would
be unconstitutional if construed as Yniguez contended it should be.
Moreover, that court improperly blended abstention with certification
when it found that "unique circumstances," rather than simply a novel
or unsettled state-law question, are necessary before federal courts may
employ certification. The Arizona Supreme Court has before it, in
Ruiz v. State, the question: What does Article XXVIII mean? Once
that court has spoken, adjudication of any remaining federal constitu520US1 Unit: $U33 [09-10-99 14:35:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
Federal courts lack competence to rule definitively on themeaning of state legislation, see,

e. g., Reetz v. Bozanich, 397U. S. 82, 86-87 (1970), nor may they adjudicate challenges

to state measures absent a showing of actual impact on thechallenger, see, e. g., Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U. S. 103, 110
(1969). The Ninth Circuit, in the case at hand, lost sightof these limitations. The initiating plaintiff, Maria-Kelly F.
Yniguez, sought federal-court resolution of a novel question:
the compatibility with the Federal Constitution of a 1988amendment to Arizona's Constitution declaring English "the

official language of the State of Arizona"--"the language of. . . all government functions and actions." Ariz. Const.,
Art. XXVIII, $$ 1(1), 1(2). Participants in the federal litiga-tion, proceeding without benefit of the views of the Arizona
Supreme Court, expressed diverse opinions on the meaning
of the amendment.Yniguez commenced and maintained her suit as an individual, not as a class representative. A state employee at thetime she filed her complaint, Yniguez voluntarily left the
State's employ in 1990 and did not allege she would seek toreturn to a public post. Her departure for a position in the
private sector made her claim for prospective relief moot.Nevertheless, the Ninth Circuit held that a plea for nominal
damages could be read into Yniguez's complaint to save the
case, and therefore pressed on to an ultimate decision. Athree-judge panel of the Court of Appeals declared Article

XXVIII unconstitutional in 1994, and a divided en banccourt, in 1995, adhered to the panel's position.

The Ninth Circuit had no warrant to proceed as it did.The case had lost the essential elements of a justiciable controversy and should not have been retained for adjudica-tion on the merits by the Court of Appeals. We therefore

eral Preston, Irving L. Gornstein, and Anthony J. Steinmeyer filed a brief
for the United States as amicus curiae.

Opinion of the Court
vacate the Ninth Circuit's judgment, and remand the case
to that court with directions that the action be dismissed
by the District Court. We express no view on the correct
interpretation of Article XXVIII or on the measure's
constitutionality.

I

A 1988 Arizona ballot initiative established English as the
official language of the State. Passed on November 8, 1988,
by a margin of one percentage point,1 the measure became
effective on December 5 as Arizona State Constitution Article XXVIII. Among key provisions, the Article declares
that, with specified exceptions, the State "shall act in English and in no other language." Ariz. Const., Art. XXVIII,

$ 3(1)(a). The enumerated exceptions concern compliance
with federal laws, participation in certain educational programs, protection of the rights of criminal defendants and
crime victims, and protection of public health or safety. Id.,

$ 3(2). In a final provision, Article XXVIII grants standing
to any person residing or doing business in the State "to
bring suit to enforce th[e] Article" in state court, under such
"reasonable limitations" as "[t]he Legislature may enact."
Id., $ 4.2

Federal-court litigation challenging the constitutionality
of Article XXVIII commenced two days after the ballot
initiative passed. On November 10, 1988, Maria-Kelly F.
Yniguez, then an insurance claims manager in the Arizona
Department of Administration's Risk Management Division,
sued the State of Arizona in the United States District Court
for the District of Arizona. Yniguez invoked 42 U. S. C.

1 The measure, opposed by the Governor as "sadly misdirected," App.
38, drew the affirmative votes of 50.5% of Arizonans casting ballots in the
election, see Yniguez v. Arizonans for Official English, 69 F. 3d 920, 924
(CA9 1995).

2 Article XXVIII, titled "English as the Official Language," is set out in

full in an appendix to this opinion.

Opinion of the Court

$ 1983 as the basis for her suit.3 Soon after the lawsuit commenced, Yniguez added as defendants, in their individual and
official capacities, Arizona Governor Rose Mofford, Arizona
Attorney General Robert K. Corbin, and the Director of
Arizona's Department of Administration, Catherine Eden.
Yniguez brought suit as an individual and never sought designation as a class representative.

Fluent in English and Spanish, Yniguez was engaged primarily in handling medical malpractice claims against the
State. In her daily service to the public, she spoke English
to persons who spoke only that language, Spanish to persons
who spoke only that language, and a combination of English
and Spanish to persons able to communicate in both languages. Record, Doc. No. 62, |||| 8, 13 (Statement of Stipulated Facts, filed Feb. 9, 1989). Yniguez feared that Article
XXVIII's instruction to "act in English," $ 3(1)(a), if read
broadly, would govern her job performance "every time she
[did] something." See Record, Doc. No. 62, || 10. She believed she would lose her job or face other sanctions if she
did not immediately refrain from speaking Spanish while
serving the State. See App. 58, || 19 (Second Amended
Complaint). Yniguez asserted that Article XXVIII violated
the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78
Stat. 252, 42 U. S. C. $ 2000d. She requested injunctive and
declaratory relief, counsel fees, and "all other relief that the

Opinion of the Court
Court deems just and proper under the circumstances."App. 60.

All defendants named in Yniguez's complaint moved todismiss all claims asserted against them.

4 The State of

Arizona asserted immunity from suit under the EleventhAmendment. The individual defendants asserted the absence of a case or controversy because "none of [them] ha[d]threatened [Yniguez] concerning her use of Spanish in the
performance of her job duties [or had] ever told her not touse Spanish [at work]." Record, Doc. No. 30, p. 1. The defendants further urged that novel state-law questions con-cerning the meaning and application of Article XXVIII
should be tendered first to the state courts. See id., at 2.5Trial on the merits of Yniguez's complaint, the parties
agreed, would be combined with the hearing on her motionfor a preliminary injunction.

6 Before the trial occurred, the

State Attorney General, on January 24, 1989, released anopinion, No. I89-009, construing Article XXVIII and explaining why he found the measure constitutional. App.61-76.

4 Under Arizona law, the State Attorney General represents the State
in federal court. See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 41-193(A)(3) (1992).
Throughout these proceedings, the State and all state officials have been
represented by the State Attorney General, or law department members
under his supervision. See $ 41-192(A).

5 Arizona law permits the State's highest court to "answer questions of

law certified to it by the supreme court of the United States, a court of
appeals of the United States, a United States district court or a tribal
court . . . if there are involved in any proceedings before the certifying
court questions of [Arizona law] which may be determinative of the cause
then pending in the certifying court and as to which it appears to the
certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the
supreme court and the intermediate appellate courts of this state." Ariz.
Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 12-1861 (1994).

6 The District Court, on December 8, 1988, had denied Yniguez's application for a temporary restraining order, finding no "imminent danger of the
imposition of sanctions" against her. Record, Doc. No. 23, p. 1.

520US1 Unit: $U33 [09-10-99 14:35:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN
52 ARIZONANS FOR OFFICIAL ENGLISH v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
In Opinion No. I89-009, the Attorney General said it washis obligation to read Article XXVIII "as a whole," in line

"with the other portions of the Arizona Constitution" and"with the United States Constitution and federal laws."
App. 61. While Article XXVIII requires the performanceof "official acts of government" in English, it was the Attorney General's view that government employees remainedfree to use other languages "to facilitate the delivery of governmental services." Id., at 62. Construction of the word"act," as used in Article XXVIII, to mean more than an "official ac[t] of government," the Attorney General asserted,"would raise serious questions" of compatibility with federal
and state equal protection guarantees and federal civil rightslegislation. Id., at 65-66.

7

On February 9, 1989, two weeks after release of the Attor-ney General's opinion, the parties filed a statement of stipulated facts, which reported Governor Mofford's opposition tothe ballot initiative, her intention nevertheless "to comply
with Article XXVIII," and her expectation that "State serv-ice employees [would] comply" with the measure. See Record, Doc. No. 62, |||| 35, 36, 39. The stipulation confirmedthe view of all parties that "[t]he efficient operation [and administration] of the State is enhanced by permitting Stateservice employees to communicate with citizens of the State
in languages other than English where the citizens are notproficient in English."

Id., |||| 16, 17. In particular, theparties recognized that "Yniguez'[s] use of a language other

7 Specifically addressing "[t]he handling of customer inquiries or complaints involving state or local government services," the Attorney General elaborated:

"All official documents that are governmental acts must be in English,
but translation services and accommodating communications are permissible, and may be required if reasonably necessary to the fair and effective
delivery of services, or required by specific federal regulation. Communications between elected and other governmental employees with the public at large may be in a language other than English on the same principles." App. 74.

than English in the course of her performing governmentbusiness contributes to the efficient operation . . . and . . .

administration of the State." Id., || 15. The stipulation re-ferred to the Attorney General's January 24, 1989, opinion,
id., || 46, and further recounted that since the passage of Article XXVIII, "none of [Yniguez's] supervisors ha[d] ever toldher to change or cease her prior use of Spanish in the performance of her duties," id., || 48.8The District Court heard testimony on two days in February and April 1989, and disposed of the case in an opinionand judgment filed February 6, 1990.

Yniguez v. Mofford,
730 F. Supp. 309. Prior to that final decision, the court haddismissed the State of Arizona as a defendant, accepting the

State's plea of Eleventh Amendment immunity. See id., at311. Yniguez's second amended complaint, filed February
23, 1989, accordingly named as defendants only the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Director of the Department of Administration. See App. 55.9

The District Court determined first that, among the
named defendants, only the Governor, in her official capacity,
was a proper party. The Attorney General, the District
Court found, had no authority under Arizona law to enforce
provisions like Article XXVIII against state employees.
730 F. Supp., at 311-312. The Director and the Governor,

8 Supplementing their pleas to dismiss for want of a case or controversy,
the defendants urged that Attorney General Opinion No. I89-009 "puts to
rest any claim that [Yniguez] will be penalized by the State for using
Spanish in her work." Record, Doc. No. 51, p. 4, n. 1.

9 The second amended complaint added another plaintiff, Arizona State

Senator Jaime Gutierrez. Senator Gutierrez alleged that Article XXVIII
interfered with his rights to communicate freely with persons, including
residents of his Senate district, who spoke languages other than English.
App. 58-59. The District Court dismissed Gutierrez's claim on the
ground that the defendants, all executive branch officials, lacked authority
to take enforcement action against elected legislative branch officials.
Yniguez v. Mofford, 730 F. Supp. 309, 311 (Ariz. 1990). Gutierrez is no
longer a participant in these proceedings.

Opinion of the Court
on the other hand, did have authority to enforce state lawsand rules against state service employees.

Id., at 311. But
nothing in the record, the District Court said, showed thatthe Director had undertaken or threatened to undertake any

action adverse to Yniguez. Id., at 313. That left Governor Mofford.The Attorney General "ha[d] formally interpreted Article

XXVIII as not imposing any restrictions on Yniguez's con-tinued use of Spanish during the course of her official duties," id., at 312, and indeed all three named defendants--Mofford as well as Corbin and Eden, see

supra, at 50--"ha[d]
stated on the record that Yniguez may continue to speak
Spanish without fear of official retribution." 730 F. Supp.,
at 312. Governor Mofford therefore reiterated that Yniguez
faced no actual or threatened injury attributable to any Arizona executive branch officer, and hence presented no genuine case or controversy. See ibid. But the District Court
singled out the stipulations that "Governor Mofford intends
to comply with Article XXVIII," and "expects State service
employees to comply with Article XXVIII." Record, Doc.
No. 62, |||| 35, 36; see 730 F. Supp., at 312. If Yniguez proved
right and the Governor wrong about the breadth of Article
XXVIII, the District Court concluded, then Yniguez would
be vulnerable to the Governor's pledge to enforce compliance
with the Article. See ibid.

Proceeding to the merits, the District Court found Article
XXVIII fatally overbroad. The measure, as the District
Court read it, was not merely a direction that all official acts
be in English, as the Attorney General's opinion maintained;
instead, according to the District Court, Article XXVIII
imposed a sweeping ban on the use of any language other
than English by all of Arizona officialdom, with only limited
exceptions. Id., at 314. The District Court adverted to
the Attorney General's confining construction, but found
it unpersuasive. Opinion No. I89-009, the District Court
observed, is "merely . . . advisory," not binding on any

Opinion of the Court
court. 730 F. Supp., at 315. "More importantly," the Dis-trict Court concluded, "the Attorney General's interpretation . . . is simply at odds with Article XXVIII's plainlanguage." Ibid.

The view that Article XXVIII's text left no room for amoderate and restrained interpretation led the District
Court to decline "to allow the Arizona courts the initial op-portunity to determine the scope of Article XXVIII."

Id.,at 316. The District Court ultimately dismissed all parties

save Yniguez and Governor Mofford in her official capacity,then declared Article XXVIII unconstitutional as violative of
the First and Fourteenth Amendments, but denied Yniguez'srequest for an injunction because "she ha[d] not established
an enforcement threat sufficient to warrant [such] relief."
Id., at 316-317.Postjudgment motions followed, sparked by Governor

Mofford's announcement that she would not pursue an ap-peal. See App. 98. The Attorney General renewed his request to certify the pivotal state-law question--the correct
construction of Article XXVIII--to the Arizona SupremeCourt. See Record, Doc. No. 82. He also moved to intervene on behalf of the State, pursuant to 28 U. S. C.$ 2403(b),

10 in order to contest on appeal the District Court's

declaration that a provision of Arizona's Constitution violated the Federal Constitution. Record, Doc. Nos. 92, 93.

10 Title 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(b) provides:
"In any action, suit, or proceeding in a court of the United States to
which a State or any agency, officer, or employee thereof is not a party,
wherein the constitutionality of any statute of that State affecting the
public interest is drawn in question, the court shall certify such fact to the
attorney general of the State, and shall permit the State to intervene for
presentation of evidence, if evidence is otherwise admissible in the case,
and for argument on the question of constitutionality. The State shall,
subject to the applicable provisions of law, have all the rights of a party
and be subject to all liabilities of a party as to court costs to the extent
necessary for a proper presentation of the facts and law relating to the
question of constitutionality."

Opinion of the Court
Two newcomers also appeared in the District Court afterjudgment: the Arizonans for Official English Committee

(AOE) and Robert D. Park, Chairman of AOE. InvokingRule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, AOE and
Park moved to intervene as defendants in order to urge on
appeal the constitutionality of Article XXVIII. App. 94-102. AOE, an unincorporated association, was principal

sponsor of the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII.AOE and Park alleged in support of their intervention motion the interest of AOE members in enforcement of ArticleXXVIII and Governor Mofford's unwillingness to defend the
measure on appeal. Responding to the AOE/Park motion,
Governor Mofford confirmed that she did not wish to appeal,
but would have no objection to the Attorney General's intervention to pursue an appeal as the State's representative, or
to the pursuit of an appeal by any other party. See Record,
Doc. No. 94.

Yniguez expressed reservations about proceeding further.
"She ha[d] won [her] suit against her employer" and had "obtained her relief," her counsel noted. Record, Doc. No. 114,
p. 18 (Tr. of Proceeding on Motion to Intervene and Motion
to Alter or Amend Judgment, Mar. 26, 1990). If the litigation "goes forward," Yniguez's counsel told the District
Court, "I guess we do, too," but, counsel added, it might be
in Yniguez's "best interest . . . if we stopped it right here."
Ibid. The District Court agreed.

In an opinion filed April 3, 1990, the District Court denied
all three postjudgment motions. Yniguez v. Mofford, 130
F. R. D. 410. Certification was inappropriate, the District
Court ruled, in light of the court's prior rejection of the Attorney General's narrow reading of Article XXVIII. See
id., at 412. As to the Attorney General's intervention application, the District Court observed that $ 2403(b) addresses
only actions " `to which the State or any agency, officer, or
employee thereof is not a party.' " See id., at 413 (quoting

$ 2403(b)). Yniguez's action did not fit the $ 2403(b) de520US1 Unit: $U33 [09-10-99 14:35:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

57Cite as: 520 U. S. 43 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
scription, the District Court said, because the State and itsofficers were the very defendants--the sole defendants--

Yniguez's complaint named. Governor Mofford remained aparty throughout the District Court proceedings. If the
State lost the opportunity to defend the constitutionality ofArticle XXVIII on appeal, the District Court reasoned, it
was "only because Governor Mofford determine[d] that thestate's sovereign interests would be best served by foregoing
an appeal." Ibid.Turning to the AOE/Park intervention motion, the District Court observed first that the movants had failed to filea pleading "setting forth the[ir] claim or defense," as required by Rule 24(c). Ibid. But that deficiency was notcritical, the District Court said. Ibid. The insurmountable
hurdle was Article III standing. The labor and resourcesAOE spent to promote the ballot initiative did not suffice to
establish standing to sue or defend in a federal tribunal, theDistrict Court held. Id., at 414-415. Nor did Park or any
other AOE member qualify for party status, the DistrictCourt ruled, for the interests of voters who favored the initiative were too general to meet traditional standing criteria.
Id., at 415.In addition, the District Court was satisfied that AOE and

Park could not tenably assert practical impairment of theirinterests stemming from the precedential force of the decision. As nonparticipants in the federal litigation, theywould face no issue preclusion. And a lower federal-court
judgment is not binding on state courts, the District Courtnoted. Thus, AOE and Park would not be precluded by the
federal declaration from pursuing "any future state courtproceeding [based on] Article XXVIII."

The Ninth Circuit viewed the matter of standing to appealdifferently. In an opinion released July 19, 1991,

Yniguez v.Arizona, 939 F. 2d 727, the Court of Appeals reached these

Opinion of the Court
conclusions: AOE and Park met Article III requirements andcould proceed as appellants; Arizona's Attorney General,

however, having successfully moved in the District Court forhis dismissal as a defendant, could not reenter as a party,
but would be permitted to present argument regarding the
constitutionality of Article XXVIII. Id., at 738-740. TheNinth Circuit reported it would retain jurisdiction over the

District Court's decision on the merits, id., at 740, but didnot then address the question whether Article XXVIII's
meaning should be certified for definitive resolution by theArizona Supreme Court.

Concerning AOE's standing, the Court of Appeals rea-soned that the Arizona Legislature would have standing to
defend the constitutionality of a state statute; by analogy,
the Ninth Circuit maintained, AOE, as principal sponsor ofthe ballot initiative, qualified to defend Article XXVIII on

appeal. Id., at 732-733; see also id., at 734, n. 5 ("[W]e holdthat AOE has standing in the same way that a legislature
might."). AOE Chairman Park also had standing to appeal,according to the Ninth Circuit, because Yniguez "could have
had a reasonable expectation that Park (and possibly AOEas well) would bring an enforcement action against her"
under $ 4 of Article XXVIII, which authorizes any person
residing in Arizona to sue in state court to enforce the Arti-cle.

Id., at 734, and n. 5.11

11 In a remarkable passage, the Ninth Circuit addressed Yniguez's argument, opposing intervention by AOE and Park, that the District Court's
judgment was no impediment to any state-court proceeding AOE and
Park might wish to bring, because that judgment is not a binding precedent on Arizona's judiciary. See 939 F. 2d, at 735-736. The Court of
Appeals questioned the wisdom of the view expressed "in the academic
literature," "by some state courts," and by "several individual justices"
that state courts are "coordinate and coequal with the lower federal courts
on matters of federal law." Id., at 736 (footnote omitted). The Ninth
Circuit acknowledged "there may be valid reasons not to bind the state
courts to a decision of a single federal district judge--which is not even
binding on the same judge in a subsequent action." Id., at 736-737.
However, the appellate panel added, those reasons "are inapplicable to

Opinion of the Court
Having allowed AOE and Park to serve as appellants, theCourt of Appeals held Arizona's Attorney General "judicial[ly] estoppe[d]" from again appearing as a party. Id., at738-739; see also id., at 740 ("[H]aving asked the district
court to dismiss him as a party, [the Attorney General] can-not now become one again.").

12 With Governor Mofford

choosing not to seek Court of Appeals review, the appealbecame one to which neither "[the] State [n]or any agency,

officer, or employee thereof [was] a party," the Ninth Circuitobserved, so the State's Attorney General could appear pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(b). See 939 F. 2d, at 739.13 But,
the Ninth Circuit added, $ 2403(b) "confers only a limitedright," a right pendent to the AOE/Park appeal, "to make

an argument on the question of [Article XXVIII's] constitu-tionality."

Id., at 739-740.
Prior to the Ninth Circuit's July 1991 opinion, indeed the
very day after AOE, Park, and the Arizona Attorney Generalfiled their notices of appeal, a development of prime importance occurred. On April 10, 1990, Yniguez resigned fromstate employment in order to accept another job. Her resigdecisions of the federal courts of appeals." Id., at 737. But cf. ASARCO
Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U. S. 605, 617 (1989) ("state courts . . . possess the
authority, absent a provision for exclusive federal jurisdiction, to render
binding judicial decisions that rest on their own interpretations of federal
law"); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U. S. 364, 375-376 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring) (Supremacy Clause does not require state courts to follow rulings
by federal courts of appeals on questions of federal law).

12 Because the Court of Appeals found AOE and Park to be proper appellants, that court did not "address the question whether the Attorney General would have standing to appeal under Article III if no other party
were willing and able to appeal." 939 F. 2d, at 738. The Court of Appeals assumed, however, that "whenever the constitutionality of a provision of state law is called into question, the state government will have a
sufficient interest [to satisfy] Article III." Id., at 733, n. 4. Cf. Maine v.
Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 137 (1986) (intervening State had standing to appeal
from judgment holding state law unconstitutional); Diamond v. Charles,
476 U. S. 54, 62 (1986) ("a State has standing to defend the constitutionality
of its statute").

Opinion of the Court
nation apparently became effective on April 25, 1990. Arizona's Attorney General so informed the Ninth Circuit in
September 1991, "suggest[ing] that this case may lack a viable plaintiff and, hence, may be moot." Suggestion of Mootness in Nos. 90-15546 and 90-15581 (CA9), Affidavit and
Exh. A.

One year later, on September 16, 1992, the Ninth Circuit
rejected the mootness suggestion. Yniguez v. Arizona, 975
F. 2d 646. The court's ruling adopted in large part Yniguez's argument opposing a mootness disposition. See App.
194-204 (Appellee Yniguez's Response Regarding Mootness
Considerations). "[T]he plaintiff may no longer be affected
by the English only provision," the Court of Appeals acknowledged. 975 F. 2d, at 647. Nevertheless, the court
continued, "[her] constitutional claims may entitle her to an
award of nominal damages." Ibid. Her complaint did "not
expressly request nominal damages," the Ninth Circuit
noted, but "it did request `all other relief that the Court
deems just and proper under the circumstances.' " Id., at
647, n. 1; see supra, at 50-51. Thus, the Court of Appeals
reasoned, one could regard the District Court's judgment

as including an "implicit denial" of nominal damages. 975
F. 2d, at 647, n. 2.

To permit Yniguez and AOE to clarify their positions, the
Ninth Circuit determined to return the case to the District
Court. There, with the Ninth Circuit's permission, AOE's
Chairman Park could file a notice of appeal from the District
Court's judgment, following up the Circuit's decision 14
months earlier allowing AOE and Park to intervene. Id., at
647.14 And next, Yniguez could cross-appeal to place before

14 In their original notice of appeal, filed April 9, 1990, AOE and Park
targeted the District Court's denial of their motion to intervene. See
App. 150-151. Once granted intervention, their original notice indicated,
they would be positioned to file an appeal from the judgment declaring
Article XXVIII unconstitutional. See id., at 150.

In line with the Ninth Circuit's instructions, the case filewas returned to the District Court on November 5, 1992;

AOE and Park filed their second notice of appeal on Decem-ber 3, App. 206-208, and Yniguez cross-appealed on December 15, App. 209.16 The Ninth Circuit heard argument onthe merits on May 3, 1994. After argument, on June 21,
1994, the Ninth Circuit allowed Arizonans Against Constitu-tional Tampering (AACT) and Thomas Espinosa, Chairman
of AACT, to intervene as plaintiffs-appellees. App. 14;
Yniguez v. Arizona, 42 F. 3d 1217, 1223-1224 (1994)(amended Jan. 17, 1995). AACT was the principal opponent

of the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII. Id., at1224. In permitting this late intervention, the Court of Appeals noted that "it d[id] not rely on [AACT's] standing as aparty."

Ibid. The standing of the preargument partici-pants, in the Ninth Circuit's view, sufficed to support a determination on the merits. See ibid.In December 1994, the Ninth Circuit panel that had superintended the case since 1990 affirmed the judgment declaringArticle XXVIII unconstitutional and remanded the case, directing the District Court to award Yniguez nominal dam15 The Ninth Circuit made two further suggestions in the event that
Yniguez failed to seek nominal damages: A new plaintiff "whose claim
against the operation of the English only provision is not moot" might
intervene; or Yniguez herself might have standing to remain a suitor if she
could show that others had refrained from challenging the English-only
provision in reliance on her suit. See 975 F. 2d, at 647-648. No state
employee later intervened to substitute for Yniguez, nor did Yniguez endeavor to show that others had not sued because they had relied on her
suit.

16 On March 16, 1993, the District Court awarded Yniguez nearly

$100,000 in attorney's fees. Record, Doc. No. 127. Governor Mofford and
the State filed a notice of appeal from that award on April 8, 1993. Record, Doc. No. 128. Because the Ninth Circuit ultimately affirmed the District Court's judgment on the merits, the appeals court did not reach the
state defendants' appeal from the award of fees. 69 F. 3d, at 924, n. 2, 927.

ages. 42 F. 3d 1217 (amended Jan. 17, 1995). Despite theCourt of Appeals' July 1991 denial of party status to Arizona,

the Ninth Circuit apparently viewed the State as the defend-ant responsible for any damages, for it noted: "The State of
Arizona expressly waived its right to assert the EleventhAmendment as a defense to the award of nominal damages."
Id., at 1243. The Ninth Circuit agreed to rehear the case enbanc, 53 F. 3d 1084 (1995), and in October 1995, by a 6-to-5
vote, the en banc court reinstated the panel opinion withminor alterations. 69 F. 3d 920.

Adopting the District Court's construction of ArticleXXVIII, the en banc court read the provision to prohibit

" `the use of any language other than English by allofficers and employees of all political subdivisions in
Arizona while performing their official duties, save tothe extent that they may be allowed to use a foreign
language by the limited exceptions contained in $ 3(2)of Article XXVIII.' " 69 F. 3d, at 928 (quoting 730
F. Supp., at 314).
Because the court found the "plain language" dispositive, 69F. 3d, at 929, it rejected the State Attorney General's limiting construction and declined to certify the matter to theArizona Supreme Court,

id., at 929-931. As an additionalreason for its refusal to grant the Attorney General's request

for certification, the en banc court stated: "The AttorneyGeneral . . . never conceded that [Article XXVIII] would be
unconstitutional if construed as Yniguez asserts it properlyshould be."

Id., at 931, and n. 14.17 The Ninth Circuit alsopointed to a state-court challenge to the constitutionality of

17 The Court of Appeals contrasted Virginia v. American Booksellers
Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383 (1988), in which this Court certified to the Virginia Supreme Court questions concerning the proper interpretation of a
state statute. In American Booksellers, the Ninth Circuit noted, "the
State Attorney General conceded [the statute] would be unconstitutional
if construed as the plaintiffs contended it should be." 69 F. 3d, at 930.

Opinion of the Court
Article XXVIII, Ruiz v. State, No. CV92-19603 (Sup. Ct.
Maricopa County, Jan. 24, 1994). In Ruiz, the Ninth Circuit
observed, the state court of first instance "dispos[ed] of [the]
First Amendment challenge in three paragraphs" and "d[id]
nothing to narrow [the provision]." 69 F. 3d, at 931.18

After construing Article XXVIII as sweeping in scope, the
en banc Court of Appeals condemned the provision as manifestly overbroad, trenching untenably on speech rights of
Arizona officials and public employees. See id., at 931-948.
For prevailing in the $ 1983 action, the court ultimately announced, Yniguez was "entitled to nominal damages." Id.,
at 949. On remand, the District Court followed the en banc
Court of Appeals' order and, on November 3, 1995, awarded
Yniguez $1 in damages. App. 211.

AOE and Park petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari
to the Ninth Circuit.19 They raised two questions: (1) Does
Article XXVIII violate the Free Speech Clause of the First

18 The Ruiz case included among its several plaintiffs four elected officials and five state employees. After defeat in the court of first instance,
the Ruiz plaintiffs prevailed in the Arizona Court of Appeals. Ruiz v.
Symington, No. 1 CA-CV 94-0235, 1996 WL 309512 (Ariz. App., June 11,
1996). That court noted, with evident concern, that "the Ninth Circuit
refused to abstain and certify the question of Article [XXVIII]'s proper
interpretation to the Arizona Supreme Court, although the issue was
pending in our state court system." Id., at *4. "Comity," the Arizona
intermediate appellate court observed, "typically applies when a federal
court finds that deference to a state court, on an issue of state law, is
proper." Ibid. Nevertheless, in the interest of uniformity and to discourage forum shopping, the Arizona appeals court decided to defer to
the federal litigation, forgoing independent analysis. Ibid. The Arizona
Supreme Court granted review in Ruiz in November 1996, and stayed
proceedings pending our decision in this case. App. to Supplemental
Brief for Petitioners 1.

19 The State did not oppose the petition and, in its Appearance Form,

filed in this Court on January 10, 1996, noted that "if the Court grants the
Petition and reverses the lower court's decision . . . Arizona will seek
reversal of award of attorney's fees against the State." See supra, at

Article III, $ 2, of the Constitution confines federal courtsto the decision of "Cases" or "Controversies." Standing to

56 (1986) (standing to defend on appeal). To qualify as aparty with standing to litigate, a person must show, first and
foremost, "an invasion of a legally protected interest" thatis "concrete and particularized" and " `actual or imminent.' "

Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U. S. 149, 155 (1990)).An interest shared generally with the public at large in the

proper application of the Constitution and laws will not do.See Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S., at 573-576. Standing
to defend on appeal in the place of an original defendant, noless than standing to sue, demands that the litigant possess

(citation omitted). An intervenor cannot step into the shoesof the original party unless the intervenor independently
"fulfills the requirements of Article III." Id., at 68.In granting the petition for a writ of certiorari in this case,
we called for briefing on the question whether AOE and Parkhave standing, consonant with Article III of the Federal
Constitution, to defend in federal court the constitutionalityof Arizona Constitution Article XXVIII. Petitioners argue
primarily that, as initiative proponents, they have a quasi-legislative interest in defending the constitutionality of the
measure they successfully sponsored. AOE and Park stressthe funds and effort they expended to achieve adoption of
Article XXVIII. We have recognized that state legislatorshave standing to contest a decision holding a state statute
unconstitutional if state law authorizes legislators to repre-sent the State's interests. See Karcher v. May, 484 U. S. 72,
82 (1987).20 AOE and its members, however, are not electedrepresentatives, and we are aware of no Arizona law appointing initiative sponsors as agents of the people of Ari-zona to defend, in lieu of public officials, the constitutionality
of initiatives made law of the State. Nor has this Court everidentified initiative proponents as Article-III-qualified defenders of the measures they advocated. Cf. Don't Bankrupt Washington Committee v. Continental Ill. Nat. Bank &Trust Co. of Chicago, 460 U. S. 1077 (1983) (summarily dismissing, for lack of standing, appeal by an initiative propo-nent from a decision holding the initiative unconstitutional).

AOE also asserts representational or associational stand-ing. An association has standing to sue or defend in such

capacity, however, only if its members would have standingin their own right. See Food and Commercial Workers v.

Brown Group, Inc., 517 U. S. 544, 551-553 (1996); Hunt v.Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333,
343 (1977). The requisite concrete injury to AOE membersis not apparent. As nonparties in the District Court, AOE's
members were not bound by the judgment for Yniguez.That judgment had slim precedential effect, see

supra, at58-59, n. 11,
21 and it left AOE entirely free to invoke Article

XXVIII, $ 4, the citizen suit provision, in state court, whereAOE could pursue whatever relief state law authorized.

Nor do we discern anything flowing from Article XXVIII'scitizen suit provision--which authorizes suits to enforce Article XXVIII in state court--that could support standing forArizona residents in general, or AOE in particular, to defend
the Article's constitutionality in federal court.We thus have grave doubts whether AOE and Park
have standing under Article III to pursue appellate review.Nevertheless, we need not definitively resolve the issue.
Rather, we will follow a path we have taken before and inquire, as a primary matter, whether originating plaintiffYniguez still has a case to pursue. See

Burke v. Barnes, 479
U. S. 361, 363, 364, n. (1987) (leaving unresolved question of
congressional standing because Court determined case wasmoot). For purposes of that inquiry, we will assume,

arguendo, that AOE and Park had standing to place this casebefore an appellate tribunal. See

id., at 366 (Stevens, J.,
dissenting) (Court properly assumed standing, even thoughthat matter raised a serious question, in order to analyze

mootness issue). We may resolve the question whether

21 As the District Court observed, the stare decisis effect of that court's
ruling was distinctly limited. The judgment was "not binding on the Arizona state courts [and did] not foreclose any rights of [AOE] or Park in any
future state-court proceeding arising out of Article XXVIII." Yniguez v.
Mofford, 130 F. R. D. 410, 416 (D. Ariz. 1990).

Opinion of the Court
there remains a live case or controversy with respect to Yni-guez's claim without first determining whether AOE or Park

has standing to appeal because the former question, like thelatter, goes to the Article III jurisdiction of this Court and
the courts below, not to the merits of the case. Cf. U. S.
Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U. S.18, 20-22 (1994).

IV
To qualify as a case fit for federal-court adjudication, "anactual controversy must be extant at all stages of review,

not merely at the time the complaint is filed." Preiser v.
Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 401 (1975) (quoting Steffel v. Thomp-son, 415 U. S. 452, 459, n. 10 (1974)) (internal quotation marks

omitted). As a state employee subject to Article XXVIII,Yniguez had a viable claim at the outset of the litigation in
late 1988. We need not consider whether her case lost vital-ity in January 1989 when the Attorney General released
Opinion No. I89-009. That opinion construed ArticleXXVIII to require the expression of "official acts" in English, but to leave government employees free to use otherlanguages "if reasonably necessary to the fair and effective
delivery of services" to the public. See App. 71, 74; supra,at 52-53, 54; see also

Marston's Inc. v. Roman Catholic
Church of Phoenix, 132 Ariz. 90, 94, 644 P. 2d 244, 248 (1982)("Attorney General opinions are advisory only and are not

binding on the court. . . . This does not mean, however, thatcitizens may not rely in good faith on Attorney General opinions until the courts have spoken."). Yniguez left her statejob in April 1990 to take up employment in the private sector, where her speech was not governed by Article XXVIII.
At that point, it became plain that she lacked a still vitalclaim for prospective relief. Cf.

Boyle v. Landry, 401 U. S.
77, 78, 80-81 (1971) (prospective relief denied where plain-tiffs failed to show challenged measures adversely affected

any plaintiff 's primary conduct).

Opinion of the Court
The Attorney General suggested mootness,22 but Yniguezresisted, and the Ninth Circuit adopted her proposed method

of saving the case. See supra, at 60-61.23 It was not dis-positive, the court said, that Yniguez "may no longer be affected by the English only provision," 975 F. 2d, at 647, for
Yniguez had raised in response to the mootness suggestion"[t]he possibility that [she] may seek nominal damages,"

ibid.; see App. 197-200 (Appellee Yniguez's Response Re-garding Mootness Considerations). At that stage of the litigation, however, Yniguez's plea for nominal damages was notthe possibility the Ninth Circuit imagined.

Yniguez's complaint rested on 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. See
supra, at 49-50, and n. 3. Although Governor Mofford in
her official capacity was the sole defendant against whom the

22 Mootness has been described as " `the doctrine of standing set in a
time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the litigation (standing) must continue throughout its existence (mootness).' " United States Parole Comm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U. S.
388, 397 (1980) (quoting Monaghan, Constitutional Adjudication: The Who
and When, 82 Yale L. J. 1363, 1384 (1973)).

23 Yniguez's counsel did not inform the Court of Appeals of Yniguez's

departure from government employment, a departure effective April 25,
1990, the day before the appeal was docketed. See App. 7. It was not
until September 1991 that the State's Attorney General notified the Ninth
Circuit of the plaintiff's changed circumstances. See id., at 187. Yniguez's counsel offered a laconic explanation for this lapse: First, "legal
research disclosed that this case was not moot"; second, counsel for the
State of Arizona knew of the resignation and "agreed this appeal should
proceed." App. 196, n. 2 (Appellee Yniguez's Response Regarding Mootness Considerations). The explanation was unsatisfactory. It is the duty
of counsel to bring to the federal tribunal's attention, "without delay,"
facts that may raise a question of mootness. See Board of License
Comm'rs of Tiverton v. Pastore, 469 U. S. 238, 240 (1985) (per curiam).
Nor is a change in circumstances bearing on the vitality of a case a matter
opposing counsel may withhold from a federal court based on counsels'
agreement that the case should proceed to judgment and not be treated
as moot. See United States v. Alaska S. S. Co., 253 U. S. 113, 116 (1920);
R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice

Opinion of the Court
District Court's February 1990 declaratory judgment ran,see

supra, at 55, the Ninth Circuit held the State answerable
for the nominal damages Yniguez requested on appeal. See69 F. 3d, at 948-949 (declaring Yniguez "entitled to nominal

damages for prevailing in an action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983"
and noting that "[t]he State of Arizona expressly waived itsright to assert the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to the

award of nominal damages"). We have held, however, that$ 1983 actions do not lie against a State.

Will v. Michigan
Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 71 (1989). Thus, the claimfor relief the Ninth Circuit found sufficient to overcome

mootness was nonexistent. The barrier was not, as theNinth Circuit supposed, Eleventh Amendment immunity,
which the State could waive. The stopper was that $ 1983
creates no remedy against a State.24Furthermore, under the Ninth Circuit's ruling on intervention, the State of Arizona was permitted to participate in
the appeal, but not as a party. 939 F. 3d, at 738-740. The
Court of Appeals never revised that ruling. To recapitulate,

24 State officers in their official capacities, like States themselves, are not
amenable to suit for damages under $ 1983. See Will v. Michigan Dept.
of State Police, 491 U. S., at 71, and n. 10. State officers are subject to

$ 1983 liability for damages in their personal capacities, however, even
when the conduct in question relates to their official duties. Hafer v.
Melo, 502 U. S. 21, 25-31 (1991). At no point after the nominal damages
solution to mootness surfaced in this case did the Ninth Circuit identify
Governor Mofford as a party whose conduct could be the predicate for
retrospective relief. That is hardly surprising, for Mofford never participated in any effort to enforce Article XXVIII against Yniguez. Moreover, she opposed the ballot initiative that became Article XXVIII, see
supra, at 49, n. 1, associated herself with the Attorney General's restrained
interpretation of the provision, see supra, at 52-53, and was unwilling to
appeal from the District Court's judgment declaring the Article unconstitutional, see supra, at 56. In this Court, Yniguez raised the possibility of
Governor Mofford's individual liability under the doctrine of Ex parte
Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908). See Brief for Respondent Yniguez 21-22.
That doctrine, however, permits only prospective relief, not retrospective
monetary awards. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 664 (1974).

70 ARIZONANS FOR OFFICIAL ENGLISH v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
in July 1991, two months prior to the Attorney General's
suggestion of mootness, the Court of Appeals rejected the
Attorney General's plea for party status, as representative of
the State. Ibid. The Ninth Circuit accorded the Attorney
General the "right [under 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(b)] to argue the
constitutionality of Article XXVIII . . . contingent upon AOE
and Park's bringing the appeal." Id., at 740; see supra, at
59. But see Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131, 136-137 (1986)
(State's $ 2403(b) right to urge on appeal the constitutionality
of its laws is not contingent on participation of other appellants). AOE and Park, however, were the sole participants
recognized by the Ninth Circuit as defendants-appellants.
The Attorney General "ha[d] asked the district court to dismiss him as a party," the Court of Appeals noted, hence he
"cannot now become one again." 939 F. 2d, at 740. While
we do not rule on the propriety of the Ninth Circuit's exclusion of the State as a party, we note this lapse in that court's
accounting for its decision: The Ninth Circuit did not explain
how it arrived at the conclusion that an intervenor the court
had designated a nonparty could be subject, nevertheless, to
an obligation to pay damages.

True, Yniguez and the Attorney General took the steps
the Ninth Circuit prescribed: Yniguez filed a cross-appeal
notice, see supra, at 61; the Attorney General waived the
State's right to assert the Eleventh Amendment as a defense
to an award of nominal damages, see 69 F. 3d, at 948-949.
But the earlier, emphatic Court of Appeals ruling remained
in place: The State's intervention, although proper under

$ 2403(b), the Ninth Circuit maintained, gave Arizona no status as a party in the lawsuit. See 939 F. 2d, at 738-740.25

25 Section 2403(b) by its terms subjects an intervenor "to all liabilities
of a party as to court costs" required "for a proper presentation of the
facts and law relating to the question of constitutionality." 28 U. S. C.

$ 2403(b) (emphasis added). It does not subject an intervenor to liability
for damages available against a party defendant.

Opinion of the Court
In advancing cooperation between Yniguez and the Attorney General regarding the request for and agreement to pay
nominal damages, the Ninth Circuit did not home in on the
federal courts' lack of authority to act in friendly or feigned
proceedings. Cf. United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 302,
304 (1943) (per curiam) (absent "a genuine adversary issue
between . . . parties," federal court "may not safely proceed
to judgment"). It should have been clear to the Court of
Appeals that a claim for nominal damages, extracted late in
the day from Yniguez's general prayer for relief and asserted
solely to avoid otherwise certain mootness, bore close inspection. Cf. Fox v. Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.,
42 F. 3d 135, 141-142 (CA2 1994) (rejecting claim for nominal
damages proffered to save case from mootness years after
litigation began where defendants could have asserted qualified immunity had plaintiffs' complaint specifically requested
monetary relief). On such inspection, the Ninth Circuit
might have perceived that Yniguez's plea for nominal damages could not genuinely revive the case.26

When a civil case becomes moot pending appellate adjudication, "[t]he established practice . . . in the federal system
. . . is to reverse or vacate the judgment below and remand
with a direction to dismiss." United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39 (1950). Vacatur "clears the path
for future relitigation" by eliminating a judgment the loser
was stopped from opposing on direct review. Id., at 40.
Vacatur is in order when mootness occurs through happenstance--circumstances not attributable to the parties--or,

26 Endeavoring to meet the live case requirement, petitioners AOE and
Park posited in this Court several "controversies remaining between the
parties." Reply Brief for Petitioners 18-19. Tellingly, none of the asserted controversies involved Yniguez, sole plaintiff and prevailing party
in the District Court. See ibid. (describing AOE and Park as adverse to
intervenor Arizonans Against Constitution Tampering (AACT), see supra,
at 61, AACT as adverse to the State, AOE and Park as adverse to the
State).

Opinion of the Court
relevant here, the "unilateral action of the party who prevailed in the lower court." U. S. Bancorp Mortgage Co., 513
U. S., at 23; cf. id., at 29 ("mootness by reason of settlement
[ordinarily] does not justify vacatur of a judgment under
review").

As just explained, Yniguez's changed circumstances--her
resignation from public sector employment to pursue work
in the private sector--mooted the case stated in her complaint.27 We turn next to the effect of that development on
the judgments below. Yniguez urges that vacatur ought not
occur here. She maintains that the State acquiesced in the
Ninth Circuit's judgment and that, in any event, the District
Court judgment should not be upset because it was entered
before the mooting event occurred and was not properly appealed. See Brief for Respondent Yniguez 23-25.

Concerning the Ninth Circuit's judgment, Yniguez argues
that the State's Attorney General effectively acquiesced in
that court's dispositions when he did not petition for this
Court's review. See id., at 24-25; Brief for United States as
Amicus Curiae 10-11, and n. 4 (citing Diamond v. Charles,
476 U. S. 54 (1986)).28 We do not agree that this Court is
disarmed in the manner suggested.

27 It bears repetition that Yniguez did not sue on behalf of a class. See
supra, at 50; cf. Preiser v. Newkirk, 422 U. S. 395, 404 (1975) (Marshall,
J., concurring) (mootness determination unavoidable where plaintiffrespondent's case lost vitality and action was not filed on behalf of a class);
Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 397-403 (1975) (recognizing class action exception to mootness doctrine).

28 Designated a respondent in this Court, the State was not required or

specifically invited to file a brief answering the AOE/Park petition. In
his appearance form, filed January 10, 1996, Arizona's Attorney General
made this much plain: The State--aligned with petitioners AOE and Park
in that Arizona defended Article XXVIII's constitutionality--did not oppose certiorari; in the event Yniguez did not prevail here, Arizona would
seek to recoup the attorney's fees the District Court had ordered the State
to pay her. See supra, at 61, n. 16.

Opinion of the Court
We have taken up the case for consideration on the petitionfor certiorari filed by AOE and Park. Even if we were to

rule definitively that AOE and Park lack standing, we wouldhave an obligation essentially to search the pleadings on core
matters of federal-court adjudicatory authority--to inquire
not only into this Court's authority to decide the questionspetitioners present, but to consider, also, the authority of the

lower courts to proceed. As explained in Bender v. Williamsport Area School Dist., 475 U. S. 534 (1986):

"[E]very federal appellate court has a special obligation
to `satisfy itself not only of its own jurisdiction, but also
that of the lower courts in a cause under review,' eventhough the parties are prepared to concede it.

Mitchell
v. Maurer, 293 U. S. 237, 244 (1934). See Juidice v.
Vail, 430 U. S. 327, 331-332 (1977) (standing). `And if
the record discloses that the lower court was withoutjurisdiction this court will notice the defect, although

the parties make no contention concerning it. [When
the lower federal court] lack[s] jurisdiction, we have jurisdiction on appeal, not of the merits but merely for
the purpose of correcting the error of the lower court in
entertaining the suit.' United States v. Corrick, 298
U. S. 435, 440 (1936) (footnotes omitted)." Id., at 541
(brackets in original).

See also Iron Arrow Honor Soc. v. Heckler, 464 U. S. 67,
72-73 (1983) (per curiam) (vacating judgment below where
Court of Appeals had ruled on the merits although case had
become moot). In short, we have authority to "make such
disposition of the whole case as justice may require." U. S.
Bancorp Mortgage Co., 513 U. S., at 21 (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted). Because the Ninth Circuit refused to stop the adjudication when Yniguez's departure
from public employment came to its attention, we set aside
the unwarranted en banc Court of Appeals judgment.

74 ARIZONANS FOR OFFICIAL ENGLISH v. ARIZONA

Opinion of the Court
As to the District Court's judgment, Yniguez stresses thatthe date of the mooting event--her resignation from state

employment effective April 25, 1990--was some 21/2 monthsafter the February 6, 1990, decision she seeks to preserve.
Governor Mofford was the sole defendant bound by the Dis-trict Court judgment, and Mofford declined to appeal.
Therefore, Yniguez contends, the District Court's judgment
should remain untouched.But AOE and Park had an arguable basis for seeking appellate review, and the Attorney General promptly madeknown his independent interest in defending Article XXVIII
against the total demolition declared by the District Court.
First, the Attorney General repeated his plea for certification of Article XXVIII to the Arizona Supreme Court. See
Record, Doc. No. 82. And if that plea failed, he asked, in his
motion to intervene, "to be joined as a defendant so that he
may participate in all post-judgment proceedings." Record,
Doc. No. 93, p. 2. Although denied party status, the Attorney General had, at a minimum, a right secured by Congress,
a right to present argument on appeal "on the question of
constitutionality." See 28 U. S. C. $ 2403(b). He was in the
process of pursuing that right when the mooting event
occurred.

We have already recounted the course of proceedings
thereafter. First, Yniguez did not tell the Court of Appeals
that she had left the State's employ. See supra, at 68, n. 23.
When that fact was disclosed to the court by the Attorney
General, a dismissal for mootness was suggested, and rejected. A mootness disposition at that point was in order,
we have just explained. Such a dismissal would have
stopped in midstream the Attorney General's endeavor,
premised on $ 2403(b), to defend the State's law against a
declaration of unconstitutionality, and so would have warranted a path-clearing vacatur decree.

The State urges that its current plea for vacatur is compelling in view of the extraordinary course of this litigation.

Opinion of the Court
See Brief for Respondents State of Arizona et al. 34 ("Itwould certainly be a strange doctrine that would permit a

plaintiff to obtain a favorable judgment, take voluntaryaction [that] moot[s] the dispute, and then retain the [benefit
of the] judgment."). We agree. The "exceptional circum-stances" that abound in this case, see

U. S. Bancorp Mort-gage Co., 513 U. S., at 29, and the federalism concern we next

consider, lead us to conclude that vacatur down the line isthe equitable solution.

V
In litigation generally, and in constitutional litigation mostprominently, courts in the United States characteristically

pause to ask: Is this conflict really necessary? 29 When an-ticipatory relief is sought in federal court against a state
statute, respect for the place of the States in our federalsystem calls for close consideration of that core question.
See, e. g., Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 526 (1961) (Harlan,J., dissenting) ("[N]ormally this Court ought not to consider
the Constitutionality of a state statute in the absence of acontrolling interpretation of its meaning and effect by the
state courts."); Rescue Army v. Municipal Court of LosAngeles, 331 U. S. 549, 573-574 (1947); Shapiro, Jurisdiction
and Discretion, 60 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 543, 580-585 (1985).Arizona's Attorney General, in addition to releasing his
own opinion on the meaning of Article XXVIII, see supra,at 52, asked both the District Court and the Court of Appeals
to pause before proceeding to judgment; specifically, he
asked both federal courts to seek, through the State's certi-fication process, an authoritative construction of the new

measure from the Arizona Supreme Court. See supra, at51, and n. 5, 55, 62-63, and nn. 17, 18.

Certification today covers territory once dominated by adeferral device called "

Pullman abstention," after the gen29 The phrasing is borrowed from Traynor, Is This Conflict Really Necessary?, 37 Texas L. Rev. 657 (1959).

Opinion of the Court
erative case, Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312U. S. 496 (1941). Designed to avoid federal-court error in

deciding state-law questions antecedent to federal constitu-tional issues, the Pullman mechanism remitted parties to
the state courts for adjudication of the unsettled state-lawissues. If settlement of the state-law question did not prove
dispositive of the case, the parties could return to the federalcourt for decision of the federal issues. Attractive in theory
because it placed state-law questions in courts equipped torule authoritatively on them,

Pullman abstention provedprotracted and expensive in practice, for it entailed a full

round of litigation in the state court system before any re-sumption of proceedings in federal court. See generally
17A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice andProcedure $$ 4242, 4243 (2d ed. 1988 and Supp. 1996).

Certification procedure, in contrast, allows a federal courtfaced with a novel state-law question to put the question
directly to the State's highest court, reducing the delay, cut-ting the cost, and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response. See Note, Federal Courts--Certifica-tion Before Facial Invalidation: A Return to Federalism, 12
W. New Eng. L. Rev. 217 (1990). Most States have adoptedcertification procedures. See generally 17A Wright,
Miller, & Cooper, supra, $ 4248. Arizona's statute, set outsupra, at 51, n. 5, permits the State's highest court to consider questions certified to it by federal district courts, aswell as courts of appeals and this Court.

Both lower federal courts in this case refused to invite theaid of the Arizona Supreme Court because they found the
language of Article XXVIII "plain," and the Attorney Gen-eral's limiting construction unpersuasive. See 730 F. Supp.,
at 315-316; 69 F. 3d, at 928-931.30 Furthermore, the Ninth

30 But cf. Huggins v. Isenbarger, 798 F. 2d 203, 207-210 (CA7 1986) (Easterbrook, J., concurring) (reasoned opinion of State Attorney General

Opinion of the Court
Circuit suggested as a proper price for certification a conces-sion by the Attorney General that Article XXVIII "would

be unconstitutional if construed as [plaintiff Yniguez] con-tended it should be." Id., at 930; see id., at 931, and n. 14.
Finally, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged the pendency of acase similar to Yniguez's in the Arizona court system, but
found that litigation no cause for a stay of the federal-courtproceedings. See

id., at 931; supra, at 62-63, and n. 18 (de-scribing the Ruiz litigation).

A more cautious approach was in order. Through certifi-cation of novel or unsettled questions of state law for authoritative answers by a State's highest court, a federal courtmay save "time, energy, and resources and hel[p] build a cooperative judicial federalism." Lehman Brothers v. Schein,416 U. S. 386, 391 (1974); see also

Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U. S.132, 148 (1976) (to warrant district court certification, "[i]t is

sufficient that the statute is susceptible of . . . an interpreta-tion [that] would avoid or substantially modify the federal
constitutional challenge to the statute"). It is true, as theNinth Circuit observed, 69 F. 3d, at 930, that in our decision
certifying questions in Virginia v. American Booksellers
Assn., Inc., 484 U. S. 383 (1988), we noted the State's con-cession that the statute there challenged would be unconstitutional if construed as plaintiffs contended it should be,id., at 393-396. But neither in that case nor in any other
did we declare such a concession a condition precedent tocertification.

The District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled outcertification primarily because they believed Article XXVIII
was not fairly subject to a limiting construction. See 730F. Supp., at 316 (citing

Houston v. Hill, 482 U. S. 451, 467(1987)); 69 F. 3d, at 930. The assurance with which the

lower courts reached that judgment is all the more puzzling

to conclude that "[a State's] Executive Branch does not understand state
law").

Opinion of the Court
in view of the position the initiative sponsors advanced before this Court on the meaning of Article XXVIII.

At oral argument on December 4, 1996, counsel for petitioners AOE and Park informed the Court that, in petitioners' view, the Attorney General's reading of the Article was
"the correct interpretation." Tr. of Oral Arg. 6; see id., at
5 (in response to the Court's inquiry, counsel for petitioners
stated: "[W]e agree with the Attorney General's opinion as
to [the] construction of Article XXVIII on [constitutional]
grounds."). The Ninth Circuit found AOE's "explanations
as to the initiative's scope . . . confused and selfcontradictory," 69 F. 3d, at 928, n. 12, and we agree that AOE
wavered in its statements of position, see, e. g., Brief for Petitioners 15 (AOE may "protect its political and statutory
rights against the State and government employees"), 32-39
(Article XXVIII regulates Yniguez's "language on the job"),
44 ("AOE might . . . sue the State for limiting Art. XXVIII").
Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals understood that the ballot initiative proponents themselves at least "partially endorsed the Attorney General's reading." 69 F. 3d, at 928,
n. 12. Given the novelty of the question and its potential
importance to the conduct of Arizona's business, plus the
views of the Attorney General and those of Article XXVIII's
sponsors, the certification requests merited more respectful
consideration than they received in the proceedings below.

Federal courts, when confronting a challenge to the constitutionality of a federal statute, follow a "cardinal principle":
They "will first ascertain whether a construction . . . is fairly
possible" that will contain the statute within constitutional
bounds. See Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 348 (1936)
(Brandeis, J., concurring); Ellis v. Railway Clerks, 466 U. S.
435, 444 (1984); Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U. S. 682, 692-693
(1979); Rescue Army, 331 U. S., at 568-569. State courts,
when interpreting state statutes, are similarly equipped to
apply that cardinal principle. See Knoell v. Cerkvenik520US1 Unit: $U33 [09-10-99 14:35:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Anderson Travel, Inc., 185 Ariz. 546, 548, 917 P. 2d 689, 691(1996) (citing Ashwander).

Warnings against premature adjudication of constitutionalquestions bear heightened attention when a federal court is
asked to invalidate a State's law, for the federal tribunalrisks friction-generating error when it endeavors to construe
a novel state Act not yet reviewed by the State's highestcourt. See

Rescue Army, 331 U. S., at 573-574. "Specula-tion by a federal court about the meaning of a state statute in

the absence of prior state court adjudication is particularlygratuitous when . . . the state courts stand willing to address
questions of state law on certification from a federal court."
Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 510 (1985)(

O'Connor, J., concurring).Blending abstention with certification, the Ninth Circuit

found "no unique circumstances in this case militating infavor of certification." 69 F. 3d, at 931. Novel, unsettled
questions of state law, however, not "unique circumstances,"are necessary before federal courts may avail themselves of
state certification procedures.31 Those procedures do notentail the delays, expense, and procedural complexity that
generally attend abstention decisions. See supra, at 76.Taking advantage of certification made available by a State
may "greatly simplif[y]" an ultimate adjudication in federalcourt. See

Bellotti, 428 U. S., at 151.The course of Yniguez's case was complex. The complexity might have been avoided had the District Court, morethan eight years ago, accepted the certification suggestion
made by Arizona's Attorney General. The Arizona Su-preme Court was not asked by the District Court or the
Court of Appeals to say what Article XXVIII means. Butthe State's highest court has that very question before it in

31 Arizona itself requires no "unique circumstances." It permits certification to the State's highest court of matters "which may be determinative of the cause," and as to which "no controlling precedent" is apparent
to the certifying court. Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 12-1861 (1994).

83OCTOBER TERM, 1996
Syllabus

ADAMS et al. v. ROBERTSON et al.
certiorari to the supreme court of alabama
No. 95-1873. Argued January 14, 1997--Decided March 3, 1997
Respondent Robertson filed a class action in Alabama, alleging that respondent Liberty National Life Insurance Company had fraudulently
encouraged its customers to exchange existing health insurance policies
for new ones with less coverage. The trial court made him class representative and certified the class under the Alabama Rules of Civil Procedure, which do not give class members the right to opt out of a class.
It then approved a settlement that precluded class members from individually suing Liberty National for fraud based on its exchange program. Petitioners, who had objected to the settlement in the trial
court, appealed, and the State Supreme Court affirmed in an opinion
addressing only state-law issues. Certiorari was granted on the question whether the certification and settlement violated the Fourteenth
Amendment's Due Process Clause because class members could not opt
out of the class or settlement.

Held: Since petitioners have failed to establish that they properly presented the due process issue to the Alabama Supreme Court, this Court

519, 533, this Court will not consider a petitioner's federal claim that
was not addressed by, or properly presented to, the state court rendering the decision. The Alabama Supreme Court did not expressly
address the claim raised here, and petitioners have not shown that it
was properly presented to that court. When the highest state court is
silent on the federal question before this Court, it is assumed that the
issue was not properly presented; the aggrieved party bears the burden
of defeating this assumption, Board of Directors of Rotary Int'l v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U. S. 537, 550, by demonstrating that the state
court had a fair opportunity to address the issue, Webb v. Webb, 451

demonstrated that they complied with the applicable state rules for raising their federal claim before the State Supreme Court, see, e. g., Bankers Life & Casualty Co. v. Crenshaw, 486 U. S. 71, 77-78, explained why
the failure to comply with those rules would not be an adequate and
independent ground for the state court to disregard that claim, see, e. g.,

the rule that a claim be addressed or properly presented in state court

of the class action and the settlement agreement in this case,without affording all class members the right to exclude

a settlement agreement that precluded class members fromindividually suing Liberty National for fraud based on its
insurance policy exchange program. See 676 So. 2d, at1270-1271; App. 158-159.

Petitioners, who had objected to the settlement in the trialcourt, appealed. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed in
an opinion addressing only state-law issues, see 676 So. 2d, at1270-1274, and petitioners sought a writ of certiorari. We
granted certiorari, 518 U. S. 1056 (1996), on the questionwhether the certification and settlement of this class-action
suit (which petitioners characterize as primarily involvingclaims for monetary relief) violated the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment because the class memberswere not afforded the right to opt out of the class or the

With "very rare exceptions," Yee v. Escondido, 503 U. S.519, 533 (1992), we have adhered to the rule in reviewing

As petitioners concede here, the Alabama Supreme Court did notexpressly address the question on which we granted certiorari.

comply with those rules would not be an adequate and inde-pendent ground for the state court to disregard that claim.

Neither have petitioners satisfied us that they presentedtheir federal claim with "fair precision and in due time."
They argue that they raised their federal due process claimin their initial brief before the Alabama Supreme Court, and
point to two pages of that brief discussing Brown v. Ticor,982 F. 2d 386 (CA9 1992), cert. dism'd as improvidently
granted, 511 U. S. 117 (1994). Although Ticor is relevant tothe federal claim they present here, see 982 F. 2d, at 392,
they mentioned the case below in the context of an entirelydifferent argument that the right to a jury trial under $ 11
of the Alabama Constitution gives a plaintiff the right to optout of a class-action settlement agreement. The discussion
of "a federal case, in the midst of an unrelated argument, isinsufficient to inform a state court that it has been presented
with a claim." Board of Directors of Rotary Int'l, supra, at550, n. 9.

Equally unavailing is petitioners' reliance on three otherpages of their Alabama Supreme Court brief. Although
that portion begins with a heading asserting that "[m]ini-mum due process requires that Class Members be given the
right to opt out or exclude themselves from the class," seeBrief for Appellants in Nos. 1931603 et al. (Sup. Ct. Ala.),
p. 23, the discussion under that heading addresses onlywhether members of the class who were not Alabama residents had been afforded due process under Phillips Petro-leum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U. S. 797 (1985). We therefore think
that a court may fairly have read this section as arguing, ashad the petitioner in Shutts, id., at 802, that the state court
lacked personal jurisdiction over out-of-state class members,not the different and broader question of whether, if a state

court has jurisdiction over the plaintiffs, due process re-quires that all class members have the right to opt out of the

addressed the federal due process issue raised here in their
briefs as appellees in the Alabama Supreme Court.2 Peti-tioners failed to address respondents' federal due process

arguments in their reply brief in the State Supreme Courtand, instead, described "[t]he pivotal issue in this case" as the
right to a jury trial under the Alabama Constitution. ReplyBrief for Appellants in Nos. 1931603 et al. (Sup. Ct. Ala.),

broader federal claim was not before it.3

containing papers filed in the trial court, see Reply Brief for Petitioners
2-3, n. 1 (referring to App. 93-126, 190-245). This general citation fails
to comply with our requirement that petitioners provide us with "specific
reference to the places in the record where the matter appears," see this
Court's Rule 14.1(g)(i) (emphasis added). Moreover, the passing invocations of "due process" we found therein, see App. 196, 209, 226-227, fail
to cite the Federal Constitution or any cases relying on the Fourteenth
Amendment, but could have just as easily referred to the due process
guarantee of the Alabama Constitution, see Ala. Const., $ 13 (1901), and
thus they did not meet our minimal requirement that it must be clear that
a federal claim was presented, Webb v. Webb, 451 U. S. 493, 496-497, 501
(1981); see Bowe v. Scott, 233 U. S. 658, 664-665 (1914).

Petitioners also note that they raised their federal due process claim in
their petition for rehearing before the Alabama Supreme Court. While
the claim presented there closely resembles the one they ask us to review,
see Appellants' Application for Rehearing and Brief in Support of Application for Rehearing in Nos. 1931603 et al. (Sup. Ct. Ala.), pp. 7-12, we have
generally refused to consider issues raised clearly for the first time in a

Petitioners having thus failed to carry their burden ofshowing that the claim they raise here was properly presented to the Alabama Supreme Court, we will not reach thequestion presented. We need not decide in this case
whether our requirement that a federal claim be addressedor properly presented in state court is jurisdictional or prudential, see Yee, 503 U. S., at 533; Bankers Life & Casualty
Co., 486 U. S., at 79; Gates, 462 U. S., at 217-219, because eventreating the rule as purely prudential, the circumstances

here justify no exception.The rule serves an important interest of comity.

BankersLife & Casualty Co., supra, at 79. As we have explained,

"it would be unseemly in our dual system of government" todisturb the finality of state judgments on a federal ground
that the state court did not have occasion to consider. Webb,451 U. S., at 500 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the rule affords state courts "an opportunity toconsider the constitutionality of the actions of state officials,
and, equally important, proposed changes" that could obvi-ate any challenges to state action in federal court.

Gates,supra, at 221-222. Here, the Alabama Supreme Court has

an undeniable interest in having the opportunity to determine in the first instance whether its existing rules govern-ing class-action settlements satisfy the requirements of due

process, and whether to exercise its power to amend thoserules to avoid potential constitutional challenges, see Ala.
Const., $ 6.11; 1971 Ala. Acts No. 1311.Our traditional standard also reflects "practical considerations" relating to this Court's capacity to decide issues.

on state-law grounds, but also assists us in our deliberationsby promoting the creation of an adequate factual and legal

record. See Webb, supra, at 500. Here, even if the statecourt's construction of its class-action rules would not obviate the due process challenge, it would undoubtedly aid ourunderstanding of those rules as a predicate to our assessment of their constitutional adequacy. And not incidentally,the parties would enjoy the opportunity to test and refine
their positions before reaching this Court.The only unusual consideration weighing in favor of reaching the question presented is that respondents failed to raisea timely objection to our granting the petition for certiorari,
on the ground that the question presented in that petitionhad not been properly raised or addressed.

5 Respondents' obligation to object under Rule 15.2 was not diminished

by the fact that their objection may have been based on this Court's jurisdiction, see supra, at 90, and thus nonwaivable. Even if, contrary to the
assumption underlying our discussion in the main text, the requirement
that claims be raised in or addressed by the state court is jurisdictional
and cannot be waived, counsel are obliged to this Court (not to mention
their clients) to raise such threshold issues in their briefs in opposition.

Nor is respondents' failure to object in accordance with Rule 15.2 excused by petitioners' failure to comply with this Court's Rule 14.1(g)(i),
which requires a petitioner seeking review of a state-court judgment to
specify, among other things, "when the federal questions sought to be reviewed were raised" in the state court system and "the method or manner
of raising them and the way in which they were passed on by those courts,

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE v.

ESTATE OF HUBERT, DECEASED, C & SSOVRAN TRUST CO. (GEORGIA) N. A.,

CO-EXECUTOR
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 95-1402. Argued November 12, 1996--Decided March 18, 1997
The executors of decedent Hubert's substantial estate filed a federal estate

tax return about a year after his death. Subsequently, petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue issued a notice of deficiency, claiming
underreporting of federal estate tax liability caused by the estate's asserted entitlement to marital and charitable deductions. While the estate's redetermination petition was pending in the Tax Court, interested
parties settled much of the litigation surrounding the estate that had
begun after Hubert's death. The agreement divided the estate's residue principal, assumed to be worth $26 million on the date of death,
about equally between marital trusts and a charitable trust. It also
provided that the estate would pay its administration expenses either
from the principal or the income of the assets that would comprise the
residue and the corpus of the trusts, preserving the executors' discretion to apportion such expenses. The estate paid about $500,000 of its
nearly $2 million of administration expenses from principal and the rest
from income. It then recalculated its tax liability, reducing the marital
and charitable deductions by the amount of principal, but not the
amount of income, used to pay the expenses. The Commissioner concluded that using income for expenses required a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the deductions. The Tax Court disagreed, finding that no reduction was required by reason of the executors' power, or the exercise of
their power, to pay administration expenses from income. The Court
of Appeals affirmed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
63 F. 3d 1083, affirmed.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens,
and Justice Ginsburg, concluded that a taxpayer does not have to
reduce the estate tax deduction for marital or charitable bequests by
the amount of the administration expenses that were paid from income
generated during administration by assets allocated to those bequests.

94 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Syllabus
(a) Hubert's executors used the standard date-of-death valuation to
determine the value of property included in the gross estate for estate
tax purposes. The parties agree that, for purposes of the question presented, the charitable, 26 U. S. C. $ 2055, and marital, $ 2056, deduction
statutes should be read to require the same answer, notwithstanding
differences in their language. Since the marital deduction statute and
regulation speak in more specific terms on this question than the charitable deduction statute, this plurality concentrates on the marital provisions, but the holding here applies to both deductions. Pp. 99-100.

(b) The marital deduction statute allows deduction for qualifying
property only to the extent of the property's "value." So when the
executors use date-of-death valuation for gross estate purposes, the
deduction's value will be limited by that value. Marital deduction
"value" is "net value," determined by the same principles as if the bequest were a gift to the spouse, 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a), i. e., present
value as of the controlling valuation date, $ 25.2523(a)-1(e); see also

$$ 20.2056(b)-4(d), 20.2055-2(f)(1). Although the question presented is
not controlled by these provisions' exact terms, it is natural to apply
the present-value principle here. Thus, assuming it were necessary for
valuation purposes to take into account that income, this would be done
by subtracting from the value of the bequest, computed as if the income
were not subject to administration expense charges, the present value
(as of the controlling valuation date) of the income expected to be used
to pay administration expenses. Cf. Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States,
279 U. S. 151. There is no dispute the entire interests transferred in
trust here qualify for the marital and charitable deductions; the question before the Court is one of valuation. Pp. 100-104.

(c) Only material limitations on the right to receive income are taken
into account when valuing the property interest passing to the surviving
spouse. 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a). A provision requiring or allowing
administration expenses to be paid from income "may" be deemed a
"material limitation" on the spouse's right to income. For example,
where the amount of the corpus, and the expected income from it, are
small, the amount of the estate's anticipated administration expenses
chargeable to income may be material as compared with the anticipated
income used to determine the assets' date-of-death value. Whether a
limitation is material will also depend in part on the nature of the
spouse's interest in the assets generating income. An obligation to pay
administration expenses from income is more likely to be material
where the value of the trust to the spouse is derived solely from income,
but is less likely to be material where, as here, the marital property is
valued as being equivalent to a transfer of the fee. Pp. 104-107.

Syllabus
(d) The Tax Court found that, on the facts presented, the trustee's
discretion to pay administration expenses out of income was not a material limitation on the right to receive income. There is no reason to
reverse for the Tax Court's failure to specify the facts it considered
relevant to the materiality inquiry. The anticipated expenses could
have been thought immaterial in light of the income the trust corpus
could have been expected to generate. P. 107.

(e) This approach to the valuation question is consistent with the language of 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(b), as interpreted in United States v. Stapf,
375 U. S. 118, 126, in which the Court held that the marital deduction
should not exceed the "net economic interest received by the surviving
spouse." There is no basis here for the Commissioner's argument that
the reduction she seeks is necessary to avoid a "double deduction" for
administration expenses in violation of 26 U. S. C. $ 642(g). Moreover,
assuming that the marital deduction statute's legislative history would
have relevance here, it does not support the Commissioner's position.
Pp. 109-111.

Justice O'Connor, joined by Justice Souter and Justice Thomas,
concluded that the relevant sources point to a test of quantitative materiality to determine whether allocation of administrative expenses
to postmortem income reduces marital and charitable deductions,
and that test is not met by the unusual factual record in this case.
Pp. 111-122.

(a) Neither the Tax Code itself nor its legislative history supplies
guidance on the question whether allocation of administrative expenses
to postmortem income reduces the marital deduction always, sometimes, or not at all. However, the Commissioner's regulations and
revenue rulings can be relied on to decide this issue. Title 26 CFR

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a) directs the reader to ask whether the executor's right
to allocate administrative expenses to the marital bequest's postmortem
income is a "material limitation" upon the spouse's "right to income from
the property," such that "account must be taken of its effect." Because
the executor's power is undeniably a "limitation" on the spouse's right
to income, the case hinges on whether that limitation is "material." In
Revenue Ruling 93-48, the Commissioner ruled that $ 20.2056(b)-4(a)'s
marital deduction is not "ordinarily" reduced when an executor allocates
interest payments on deferred federal estate taxes to the spousal bequest's postmortem income. Such interest and the administrative expenses at issue here are so similar that they should be treated the same
under $ 20.2056(b)-4(a). The Commissioner's treatment of interest in
the Revenue Ruling also indicates that some, but not all, financial obligations will reduce the marital deduction. Thus, by virtue of the Rul520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing, the Commissioner has created a quantitative materiality rule for

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a). This rule is consistent with the example set forth in

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a), and the Commissioner's expressed preference for such
a construction is entitled to deference. Pp. 112-120.

(b) The proper measure of materiality has yet to be decided by the
Commissioner. In the absence of guidance from the Commissioner, the
Tax Court's approach is as consistent with the Code as any other test,
and provides no basis for reversal. Here, the Commissioner's litigation
strategy effectively pre-empted the Tax Court from finding the $1.5
million diminution in postmortem income material under a quantitative
materiality test, for she argued that any diversion of postmortem income was material and never presented any evidence or argued that
this diminution was quantitatively material. Her failure to offer proof
of materiality left the Tax Court with little choice but to reach its carefully crafted conclusion that the amount was not quantitatively material
on the facts before it. Pp. 120-122.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
Justice Kennedy announced the judgment of the Courtand delivered an opinion, in which

The Chief Justice,
Justice Stevens, and Justice Ginsburg join.

In consequence of life's two certainties a decedent's estatefaced federal estate tax deficiencies, giving rise to this case.

The issue is whether the amount of the estate tax deductionfor marital or charitable bequests must be reduced to the
extent administration expenses were paid from income gen-erated during administration by assets allocated to those
bequests. I

The estate of Otis C. Hubert was substantial, valued atmore than $30 million when he died. Considerable probate
and civil litigation ensued soon after his death. The partiesto the various proceedings included his wife and children; his
nephew; one of the estate's coexecutors, Citizens and South-ern Trust Company (Georgia), N. A., the predecessor of respondent C & S Sovran Trust Company (Georgia), N. A.; thedistrict attorney for Cobb County, Georgia, on behalf of certain charitable beneficiaries; and the Georgia State RevenueCommission. Hubert had made various wills and codicils,
and the legal disputes for the most part concerned the distri-bution of estate assets; but they were not confined to this.
In addition to will contests alleging fraud and undue influ-ence, there were satellite civil suits including claims of slander and abuse of process. The principal proceedings werein the Probate and the Superior Courts of Cobb County,
Georgia.The estate attracted the attention of petitioner, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The executors filed the fed-eral estate tax return in 1987, about a year after Hubert
died. In 1990, the Commissioner issued a notice of defi-ciency, claiming underreporting of federal estate tax liability
by some $14 million. The Commissioner's major challengethen was to the estate's claimed entitlement to two deduc520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
tions. One was the marital deduction, under 68A Stat. 392,as amended, 26 U. S. C. $ 2056, for qualifying property passing from a decedent to the surviving spouse. The other wasthe charitable deduction, under $ 2055, for qualifying property passing from a decedent to a charity. The Commissioner's notice of deficiency asserted, for reasons not relevanthere, that the property passing to Hubert's surviving wife

and to charity did not qualify for the marital and charitabledeductions. The estate petitioned the United States Tax
Court for a redetermination of the deficiency.Within days of the estate's petition in the Tax Court, much
of the other litigation surrounding the estate settled. The
settlement agreement divided the estate's residue principal
between a marital and a charitable share, which we can assume for purposes of our discussion were worth a total of $26
million on the day Hubert died. The settlement agreement
divided the $26 million principal about half to trusts for the
surviving spouse and half to a trust for the charities. The
Commissioner stipulated that the nature of the trusts did not
prevent them from qualifying for the marital and charitable
deductions. The stipulation streamlined the Tax Court litigation but did not resolve it.

The settlement agreement provided that the estate would
pay its administration expenses either from the principal or
from the income of the assets that would comprise the residue and the corpus of the trusts, preserving the discretion
Hubert's most recent will had given his executors to apportion administration expenses. The apportionment provisions of the agreement and the will were consistent for all
relevant purposes with the law of Georgia, the State where
the decedent resided. The estate's administration expenses,
including attorney's fees, were on the order of $2 million.
The estate paid about $500,000 in expenses from principal
and the rest from income.

The estate recalculated its estate tax liability based on
the settlement agreement and the payments from principal.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The estate did not include in its marital and charitable de-ductions the amount of residue principal used to pay administration expenses. The parties here have agreed through-out that the marital or charitable deductions could not
include those amounts. The estate, however, did not reduceits marital or charitable deductions by the amount of the
income used to pay the balance of the administration ex-penses. The Commissioner disagreed and contended that
use of income for this purpose required a dollar-for-dollarreduction of the amounts of the marital and charitable
deductions.In a reviewed opinion, the Tax Court, with two judges
concurring in part and dissenting in part, rejected the Com-missioner's position. 101 T. C. 314 (1993). The court noted
it had resolved the same issue against the Commissioner inEstate of Street v. Commissioner, 56 TCM 774, 57 TCM 2851
(1988), || 88,553 P-H Memo TC. The Court of Appeals forthe Sixth Circuit had reversed this aspect of Estate of Street,
see 974 F. 2d 723, 727-729 (1992), but in the instant case theTax Court adhered to its view and said, given all the circumstances here, no reduction was required by reason of theexecutors' power, or the exercise of their power, to pay administration expenses from income. The Court of Appealsfor the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the Tax Court, adopting the latter's opinion and noting the resulting conflictwith the Sixth Circuit's decision in

Street and with the Courtof Appeals for the Federal Circuit's decision in

Burke v.United States, 994 F. 2d 1576, cert. denied, 510 U. S. 990

(1993). See 63 F. 3d 1083, 1084-1085 (CA11 1995). Wegranted certiorari, 517 U. S. 1166 (1996), and, in agreement
with the Tax Court and the Court of Appeals for the Elev-enth Circuit, we now affirm the judgment.

II
A necessary first step in calculating the taxable estate forfederal estate tax purposes is to determine the property in520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
100 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
cluded in the gross estate, and its value. Though an alterna-tive valuation date is authorized, the executors of the Hubert

estate used the standard date-of-death valuation. See 26U. S. C. $$ 2031(a), 2051. A later step is to compute any
claimed charitable or marital deductions. See $$ 2055 (charitable), 2056 (marital). Our inquiry here involves the rela-tionship between valuation principles and those computations. The language of the charitable and marital deductionsections differs. For instance, $ 2056 requires consideration,
in valuing a marital bequest, of obligations or encumbrancesthe decedent imposes on the bequest, "in the same manner
as if the amount of a gift to such spouse of such interest
were being determined." $ 2056(b)(4). Section 2055 has no
similar language. Treasury Reg. $ 20.2056(b)-4(a), 26 CFR

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996), moreover, has amplified aspects of
the marital deduction statute, as we discuss. There is no
similar regulation for the charitable deduction statute.
These differences notwithstanding, the Commissioner and
respondent agree that, for purposes of the question presented, the two deduction statutes should be read to require
the same answer. We adopt this approach. For the issue
we decide, the marital deduction statute and regulation
speak in more specific terms than the charitable deduction
statute, so we concentrate on the marital provisions. Our
holding in the case applies to both deductions.

We begin with the language of the marital deduction statute. It allows an estate to deduct for federal estate tax
purposes "an amount equal to the value of any interest in
property which passes or has passed from the decedent to his
surviving spouse, but only to the extent that such interest
is included in determining the value of the gross estate." 26
U. S. C. $ 2056(a).

The statute allows deduction for qualifying property only
to the extent of the property's "value." So when the executors value the property for gross estate purposes as of the
date of death, the value of the marital deduction will be lim520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

101Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
ited by its date-of-death value. This is directed by the stat-utory language capping the deduction at "the value of any

interest . . . included in determining the value of the grossestate." It is made explicit by Treas. Reg. $ 20.2056(b)-4(a),
which says "value, for the purpose of the marital deduction
. . . is to be determined as of the date of the decedent's death[unless the estate uses the alternative valuation date]."

Section 20.2056(b)-4(a) provides that "value" for maritaldeduction purposes is "net value," determined by applying
"the same principles . . . as if the amount of a gift to thespouse were being determined." Section 25.2523(a)-1, entitled "Gift to spouse; in general," includes a subsection (e),entitled "Valuation," which parallels $ 20.2056(b)-4(d); see
also $ 20.2055-2(f)(1). Section 25.2523(a)-1(e) provides:

"If the income from property is made payable to the
donor or another individual for life or for a term ofyears, with remainder to the donor's spouse . . . the

marital deduction is computed . . . with respect to the
present value of the remainder, determined under [26U. S. C. $ ]7520. The present value of the remainder

(that is, its value as of the date of gift) is to be deter-mined in accordance with the rules stated in $ 25.2512-5
or, for certain prior periods, $ 25.2512-5A."
Section 7520, in turn, refers to present-value tables located
in regulation $ 20.2031-7. The question presented here, in-volving date-of-death valuation of property or a principal

amount, some of the income from which may be used to payadministration expenses, is not controlled by the exact terms
of these provisions. For that reason, we do not attempt to
force it into their detailed mold. It is natural, however, to
apply the present-value principle to the question at hand, as
we are directed to do by $ 20.2056(b)-4(a). In other words,
assuming it were necessary for valuation purposes to take
into account that income, see infra, at 106-107 (discussing
materiality), this would be done by subtracting from the

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
value of the bequest, computed as if the income were notsubject to administration expense charges, the present value

(as of the controlling valuation date) of the income expectedto be used to pay administration expenses.

Our application of the present-value principle to the issue
here is further supported by Justice Holmes' explanation ofvaluation theory in his opinion for the Court in

Ithaca Trust
Co. v. United States, 279 U. S. 151 (1929). The decedentthere bequeathed the residue of his estate in trust to charity,

subject to a particular life interest in his wife. After hold-ing that the charitable bequest qualified for the charitable
deduction under the law as it stood in 1929, the Court consid-ered how to value the bequest. The Government argued the
value should be reduced to reflect the wife's probable life
expectancy as of the date the decedent died. The estate ar-gued for a smaller reduction than the Government, because

by the time of the litigation it was known that the wife had,in fact, lived for only six months after the decedent died.
Justice Holmes wrote:

"The first impression is that it is absurd to resort to
statistical probabilities when you know the fact. But
this is due to inaccurate thinking. . . . [Value] depends
largely on more or less certain prophecies of the future;
and the value is no less real at that time if later the
prophecy turns out false than when it comes out true. . . .
Tempting as it is to correct uncertain probabilities by
the now certain fact, we are of opinion that it cannot be
done. . . . Our opinion is not changed by the necessary
exceptions to the general rule specifically made by the
Act." Id., at 155.

So the charitable deduction had to be valued based on the
wife's probable life expectancy as of the date of death rather
than the known fact that she died only six months after her
husband.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
It is suggested that $ 20.2056(b)-4(a)'s direction to value
the marital deduction as a spousal gift refers to a gift tax
qualification regulation, $ 25.2523(e)-1(f), and a Revenue Ruling interpreting it, Rev. Rul. 69-56, 1969-1 Cum. Bull. 224.
Post, at 116 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment). The
suggestion misunderstands the regulations and the Revenue Ruling. Section 20.2056(b)-4(a) concerns how to determine the "value, for the purpose of the marital deduction, of
any deductible interest." Before determining an interest's
value under $ 20.2056(b)-4(a), one must decide the extent to
which the interest qualifies as deductible.

There is a structural problem with interpreting

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a) as directing reference to $ 25.2523(e)-1(f )
for valuation purposes. Qualification and valuation are different steps. Section 25.2523(e)-1(f) prescribes conditions
under which an interest transferred in trust qualifies for a
marital deduction under the gift tax. It tracks the language
of $ 20.2056(b)-5(f ), which prescribes the same conditions for
determining whether an interest transferred in trust qualifies for a marital deduction under the estate tax. Any interest to which $ 25.2523(e)-1(f) would apply, were its principles
understood to be incorporated into $ 20.2056(b)-4(a), would,
of necessity, already have been analyzed under the same
principles at the earlier, qualification stage of the estate-tax
marital-deduction inquiry under $ 20.2056(b)-5(f). So under
the suggested interpretation, whether or not an interest
passed the qualification test, there would never be a need
to value it. If it failed, there would be nothing to value;
if it passed, its value would never be reduced at the valuation stage. The qualification step of the estate-tax
marital-deduction inquiry would render the valuation step
superfluous.

We do not think the Commissioner adopted this view of
the regulations in Revenue Ruling 69-56. The Revenue
Ruling held that a trustee's power to:

520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
104 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
"charge to income or principal, executor's or trustee's
commissions, legal and accounting fees, custodian fees,
and similar administration expenses . . . [does] not result. . . . .

"[does] in the disallowance or diminution of the marital
deduction for estate and gift tax purposes unless the
execution of such directions would or the exercise of
such powers could, cause the spouse to have less than
substantially full beneficial enjoyment of the particular
interest transferred." Rev. Rul. 69-56, 1969-1 Cum.
Bull. 224.

The Revenue Ruling cites for this proposition $$ 20.2056(b)-
5(f)(1) and 25.2523(e)-1(f )(1), parts of the estate and gift
tax qualification regulations discussed above. The qualification regulations provide that an interest may qualify as deductible only in part. Where that happens, the deduction
need not be disallowed but it must be diminished. See,
e. g., $ 20.2056(b)-5(b); $ 25.2523(e)-1(b); see also 26 U. S. C.

$$ 2056(b)(5), 2523(e). It is in this qualification context that
the Revenue Ruling speaks of "diminution" of the marital
deduction. There is no dispute the entire interests transferred in trust here qualify for the estate tax marital and
charitable deductions, respectively. The question before us
is one of valuation. Sections 25.2523(e)-1(f ) and 20.2056(b)-
5(f) and Revenue Ruling 69-56 do not bear on our inquiry.

The parties here agree that the marital and charitable deductions had to be reduced by the amount of marital and
charitable residue principal used to pay administration expenses. The Commissioner contends that the estate must
reduce its marital and charitable deductions by the amount
of administration expenses paid not only from principal but
also, and in all events, from income and by a dollar-for-dollar
amount. The Commissioner cites the controlling regulation
in support of her position. The regulation says:

520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

105Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
"The value, for the purpose of the marital deduction,of any deductible interest which passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse is to be determined as ofthe date of the decedent's death [unless the estate uses
the alternative valuation date]. The marital deduction
may be taken only with respect to the net value of anydeductible interest which passed from the decedent to

his surviving spouse, the same principles being applica-ble as if the amount of a gift to the spouse were being
determined. In determining the value of the interestin property passing to the spouse account must be taken
of the effect of any material limitations upon her rightto income from the property. An example of a case in
which this rule may be applied is a bequest of property
in trust for the benefit of the decedent's spouse but theincome from the property from the date of the decedent's death until distribution of the property to thetrustee is to be used to pay expenses incurred in the
administration of the estate." 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-
4(a) (1996).

The regulation does not help the Commissioner. It says a
limitation providing that income "is to be used" throughout
the administration period to pay administration expenses
"may" be material in a given case and, if it is, account must
be taken of it for valuation purposes as if it were a gift to
the spouse, as we have discussed, see supra, at 101-102.
The Tax Court was quite accurate in its description of the
regulation when it said:

"That section is merely a valuation provision which requires material limitations on the right to receive income to be taken into account when valuing the property interest passing to the surviving spouse. The fact
that income from property is to be used to pay expenses
during the administration of the estate is not necessarily

520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
106 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
a material limitation on the right to receive income thatwould have a significant effect on the date-of-death

value of the property of the estate." 101 T. C., at324-325.

There is no indication in the case before us that the execu-tor's power to charge administration expenses to income is
equivalent to an express postponement of the spouse's rightto income beyond a reasonable period of administration. Cf.
26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-5(f)(9) (1996) (requiring valuation of ex-press postponements of the spouse's right to income beyond
a reasonable period of administration). By contrast, wehave no difficulty conceiving of situations where a provision
requiring or allowing administration expenses to be paidfrom income could be deemed a "material limitation" on the
spouse's right to income. Suppose the decedent's other be-quests account for most of the estate's property or that most
of its assets are nonincome producing, so that the corpusof the surviving spouse's bequest, and the income she could
expect to receive from it, would be quite small. In thesecircumstances, the amount of the estate's anticipated administration expenses chargeable to income may be material ascompared with the anticipated income used to determine the
assets' date-of-death value. If so, a provision requiring orallowing administration expenses to be charged to income
would be a material limitation on the spouse's right to in-come, reducing the marital bequest's date-of-death value and
the allowable marital deduction.Whether a limitation is "material" will also depend in part
on the nature of the spouse's interest in the assets generat-ing income. This analysis finds strong support in the text
of $ 20.2056(b)-4(a). The regulation gives an example ofwhere a limitation on the right to income "may" be material--bequests "in trust" for the benefit of a decedent'sspouse. The example suggests a significant difference between a bequest of income and an outright gift of the feeinterest in the income-producing property. A fee in the

107Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
same interest will almost always be worth much more.Where the value of the trust to the beneficiaries is derived

solely from income, an obligation to pay administration ex-penses from that income is more likely to be "material." In
the case of a specific bequest of income, for example, valued
only for its future income stream, a diversion of that incomewould be more significant. The marital property in this

case, however, comprising trusts involving either a generalpower of appointment (the GPA trust) or an irrevocable election (the QTIP trust), was valued as being equivalent to atransfer of the fee. See Brief for Petitioner 8-9, n. 1 ("[T]he
corpus of both trusts is includable in the estate of the surviving spouse"). As a result, the limitation on the right to
income here is less likely to be material. The inquiry into
the value of the estate's anticipated administration expenses
should be just as administrable, if not more so, than valuing property interests like going-concern businesses, see,
e. g., $ 20.2031-3, involving much greater complexity and
uncertainty.

The Tax Court concluded here: "On the facts before us,
we find that the trustee's discretion to pay administration
expenses out of income is not a material limitation on the
right to receive income." 101 T. C., at 325. The Tax Court
did not specify the facts it considered relevant to the materiality inquiry. As we have explained, however, the Commissioner does not contend the estate failed to give adequate
consideration to expected future administration expenses as
of the date of death in determining the amount of the marital
deduction. We have no basis to reverse for the Tax Court's
failure to elaborate. Here, given the size and complexity of
the estate, one might have expected it to incur substantial
litigation costs. But the anticipated expenses could nonetheless have been thought immaterial in light of the income
the trust corpus could have been expected to generate.

The major disagreement in principle between the Tax
Court majority and dissenters involved the distinction be520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
108 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
tween expected and actual income and expenses. JudgeHalpern's opinion, joined by Judge Beghe, explained:

"I believe the majority is undone by its view that incomeearned on estate property is not included in the gross
estate. Once it is accepted that income earned on es-tate property (as anticipated at the appropriate valuation date) is included in the gross estate, the next ques-tion is whether, but for the use of such income to pay
administration expenses, it would be received by thesurviving spouse or charitable beneficiary. If the answer is yes, then it follows easily that, when such income
is used for administration expenses, rather than re-ceived by the surviving spouse or charitable beneficiary,

the value of the interest passing from the decedent tothe surviving spouse or charitable beneficiary is decreased." Id., at 342-343 (opinion concurring in partand dissenting in part).

The Tax Court dissenters recognized that only anticipated,not actual, income is included in the gross estate, as the gross
estate is based on date-of-death value. See also id., at 342,n. 5 (opinion of Halpern, J.) ("It is true, of course, that income
actually earned on . . . property [included in valuing thegross estate] during the period of estate administration is
not included in the gross estate. The gross estate, however,
does include the discounted value of post mortem income ex-pected to be earned during estate administration" (emphasis

deleted)). The dissenters failed to recognize that followingtheir own logic, as a general rule, assuming compliance with

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a)'s limitation to relevant facts on the controlling valuation date, only anticipated administration expenses
payable from income, not the actual ones, affect the date-ofdeath value of the marital or charitable bequests. The dissenters were, in a sense, a step closer to $ 25.2523(a)-1(e)'s
present-value approach than the Commissioner, for they
would have required the estate to reduce the marital or char520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

109Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Opinion of Kennedy, J.
itable deduction by only the discounted value of the actualadministration expenses, whereas the Commissioner insists

on a dollar-for-dollar reduction. The dissenters' wait-and-see approach to the valuation inquiry, however, is still at
odds with the valuation inquiry required by the regulations:What is the net value of the marital or charitable bequest on
the controlling valuation date, determined as if it were a giftto the spouse?

The Commissioner directs us to the language of$ 2056(b)(4), which says:

"In determining . . . the value of any interest in prop-erty passing to the surviving spouse for which a deduction is allowed by this section--. . . . .

"(B) where such interest or property is encumbered
in any manner, or where the surviving spouse incurs anyobligation imposed by the decedent with respect to the

passing of such interest, such encumbrance or obligation
shall be taken into account in the same manner as if theamount of a gift to such spouse of such interest were

being determined."
We interpreted this language in United States v. Stapf, 375U. S. 118 (1963). The husband's will there gave property to

his wife, conditioned on her relinquishing other property she
owned to the couple's children. We held that the husband'sestate was entitled to a marital deduction only to the extent

the value of the property the husband gave his wife ex-ceeded the value of the property she relinquished to receive
it. The marital deduction, we explained, should not exceedthe "net economic interest received by the surviving
spouse." Id., at 126. The statutory language, as we inter-preted it in

Stapf, is consistent with our analysis here.
Where the will requires or allows the estate to pay administration expenses from income that would otherwise go tothe surviving spouse, our analysis requires that the marital

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
deduction reflect the date-of-death value of the expected future administration expenses chargeable to income if they
are material as compared with the date-of-death value of the
expected future income. Using this approach to valuation,
the estate will arrive at the "net economic interest received
by the surviving spouse." Ibid.

For the first time at oral argument, the Commissioner suggested that the reduction she seeks is necessary to avoid
a "double deduction" in violation of 26 U. S. C. $ 642(g).
Under $ 642(g), an estate may take an estate tax deduction
for administration expenses under $ 2053(a)(2), or it may take
them, if deductible, off its taxable income, but it may not do
both. The so-called double deduction argument is rhetorical, not statutory. As our colleagues in dissent recognize,
"nothing in $ 642(g) compels the conclusion that the marital
(or charitable) deduction must be reduced whenever an estate elects to deduct expenses from income." Post, at 137
(Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). The Commissioner nevertheless suggests that, unless we reduce the
estate's marital deduction by the amount of administration
expenses paid from income and deducted on its income tax,
the estate will receive a deduction for them on its income
tax as well as a deduction for them on its estate tax in the
form of inflated marital and charitable deductions. See Tr.
of Oral Arg. 12, 15. The marital and charitable estate tax
deductions do not include income, however. When income
is used, consistent with state law and the will, to pay administration expenses, this does not require that the estate tax
deductions be diminished. The deductions include asset values determined with reference to expected income, but
under our analysis the values must also be reduced to reflect
material expected administration expense charges to which
that income may be subjected. As noted above, the Commissioner has not contended the estate's marital and charitable deductions fail to reflect such expected payments. So

there is no basis for the double deduction argument. Ouranalysis is consistent with the design of the statute.

The Commissioner also invites our attention to the legisla-tive history of the marital deduction statute. Assuming for
the sake of argument it would have relevance here, it doesnot support her position. The Senate Report accompanying
the statute says:

"The interest passing to the surviving spouse fromthe decedent is only such interest as the decedent can

give. If the decedent by his will leaves the residue ofhis estate to the surviving spouse and she pays, or if the
estate income is used to pay, claims against the estateso as to increase the residue, such increase in the residue
is acquired by purchase and not by bequest. Accord-ingly, the value of any additional part of the residue
passing to the surviving spouse cannot be included inthe amount of the marital deduction." S. Rep. No. 1013,
80th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 6 (1948).
The Report supports our analysis. It underscores that valu-ation for marital deduction purposes occurs on the date of

death.The Commissioner's position is inconsistent with the controlling regulations. The Tax Court and the Court of Ap-peals were correct in finding for the taxpayer on these facts,
and we affirm the judgment. It is so ordered.

a generalized estate tax valuation theory from one regula-tion and then to apply that theory to resolve this case, perhaps with the hope of making sense out of the applicable law.But where the applicability--not to mention the validity--of
that theory is far from clear, the temptation to make orderout of chaos at any cost should be resisted, especially when
the question presented can be resolved--albeit imperfectly--by reference to more directly applicable sources. While
Justice Scalia, Justice Breyer, and I agree on this point,we disagree on the result ultimately dictated by these
sources. I therefore write separately to explain why inmy view the plurality's result, though not its reasoning, is
correct. I

When a citizen or resident of the United States dies, theFederal Government imposes a tax on "all [of his] property,
real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated."26 U. S. C. $$ 2001(a), 2031(a). Specifically excluded from
taxation, however, is certain property devised to the dece-dent's spouse or to charity. Such testamentary gifts may
qualify for the marital deduction, $ 2056(a), or the charitablededuction, $ 2055(a). If they do, they are removed from the
decedent's "gross estate" and exempted from the estate tax.$ 2051. Calculating the estate tax, however, takes time, as
does marshaling the decedent's property and distributingit to the ultimate beneficiaries. During this process, the
assets in the estate often earn income and the estate itselfincurs administrative expenses. To deal with this eventuality, the Tax Code permits an estate administrator to choosebetween allocating these expenses to the assets in the estate
at the time of death (the estate principal), or to the postmor-tem income earned by those assets. $ 642(g). Everyone
agrees that when these expenses are charged against a por-tion of the estate's principal devised to the spouse or charity,
that portion of the principal is diverted from the spouse orcharity and the marital and charitable deductions are accord520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ingly "reduced" by the actual amount of expenses incurred.See ante, at 104 (plurality opinion); post, at 123 (

Scalia, J.,dissenting); Brief for Petitioner 19; Brief for Respondent 6.

The question presented here is what becomes of these deduc-tions when the estate chooses the second option under

$ 642(g) and allocates administrative expenses to the post-mortem income generated by the property in the spousal or
charitable devise.The Tax Code itself supplies no guidance. Accord, post,
at 127 (Scalia, J., dissenting). The statute most relevant tothis case, 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(b)(4)(B), provides:

"[W]here [any interest in property otherwise qualifyingfor the marital deduction] is encumbered in any manner,
or where the surviving spouse incurs any obligation im-posed by the decedent with respect to the passing of
such interest, such encumbrance or obligation shall betaken into account in the same manner as if the amount
of a gift to such spouse of such interest were beingdetermined."

Although an executor's power to burden the postmortem in-come of the marital bequest with the estate's administrative
expenses is arguably an "encumbrance" or an "obligation im-posed by the decedent with respect to the passing of such
interest," the statute itself says only that the "encumbranceor obligation shall be taken into account." It does not explain how this should be done, however. In my view, it isnot possible to tell from $ 2056(b)(4)(B) whether allocation of
administrative expenses to postmortem income reduces themarital deduction always, sometimes, or not at all.

Nor does the Code's legislative history give shape to itsotherwise ambiguous language. The discussion in the Senate Report of $ 2056(b)(4)(B)'s predecessor statute reads:

"The interest passing to the surviving spouse from thedecedent is only such interest as the decedent can give.

If the decedent by his will leaves the residue of his es520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
tate to the surviving spouse and she pays, or if the estateincome is used to pay, claims against the estate so as

to increase the residue, such increase in the residue isacquired by purchase and not by bequest. Accordingly,
the value of any such additional part of the residue
passing to the surviving spouse cannot be included inthe amount of the marital deduction." S. Rep. No.

1013, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, p. 6 (1948) (emphasisadded).

This italicized passage might be helpful if it explicitlyreferred to "administrative expenses" instead of "claims
against the estate." But it is not at all clear from the SenateReport whether the latter term includes the former: The
Report nowhere defines the term "claims against the es-tate," and the immediately preceding paragraph discusses

$ 2056(b)(4)(B)'s language with reference to mortgages.
Ibid. Because mortgages differ from administrative ex-penses in many ways (e. g., mortgages pre-exist the decedent's death and are fixed in amount at that time), there isa reasonable argument that administrative expenses are
not "claims against the estate." In sum, the Code's legisla-tive history is not illuminating.

II
All that remains in this statutory vacuum are the Commis-sioner's regulations and Revenue Rulings, and it is on these

sources that I would decide this issue. The key regulationis 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996):

"The value, for the purpose of the marital deduction, ofany deductible interest which passed from the decedent
to his surviving spouse is to be determined as of the dateof the decedent's death . . . . The marital deduction
may be taken only with respect to the net value of anydeductible interest which passed from the decedent to
his surviving spouse, the same principles being applica520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

115Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)

ble as if the amount of a gift to the spouse were beingdetermined. In determining the value of the interest

in property passing to the spouse account must be takenof the effect of any material limitations upon her right
to income from the property."
The text of the regulation leaves no doubt that only the "netvalue" of the spousal gift may be deducted. Moreover,

there is little doubt that, in assessing this "net value," oneshould examine how the spousal devise would have been
treated if it were instead an inter vivos gift. See 26 U. S. C.$ 2056(b)(4)(A) (also referring to treatment of gifts).

The plurality latches onto 26 CFR $ 25.2523(a)-1(e) (1996),and to the statutes and regulations to which it refers. Ante,
at 101-102 (referring to 26 U. S. C. $ 7520; 26 CFR $ 20.2031-7(1996)). In the plurality's view, these regulations define how
to "tak[e] [account] of the effect of any material limitationsupon [a spouse's] right to income from the property." 26
CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996). The plurality frankly admitsthat these regulations do not speak directly to the antecedent inquiry--when an executor's right to allocate administra-tive expenses to income constitutes a "material limitation."
Ante, at 106. The plurality nevertheless believes that theseregulations bear

indirectly on this inquiry by imply-ing an underlying estate tax valuation theory that, in the

plurality's view, dovetails nicely with our decision in Ithaca
Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U. S. 151 (1929). Ante, at102. It is on the basis of this valuation theory that the plurality is able to conclude that the Tax Court's analysis waswrong because that analysis did not, consistent with the plurality's theory, focus solely on anticipated administrative ex-penses and

anticipated income. Ante, at 107-109. But, as
Justice Scalia points out, the plurality's valuation theoryis not universally applicable and, in fact, conflicts with the

Commissioner's treatment of some other expenses. See 26CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(c) (1996);

post, at 133-136. Because$ 25.2523(a)-1(e) and its accompanying provisions do no more

than suggest an estate tax valuation theory that itself hasquestionable value in this context, these provisions do not in

my view provide any meaningful guidance in this case.The Tax Court, on the other hand, zeroed in on 26 CFR

$$ 25.2523(e)-1(f)(3) and (4) (1996), the gift tax regulations
which, read together, provide that a trustee's power to allo-cate the "trustees' commissions . . . and other charges" to

the trust's income will not disqualify the trust from the gifttax spousal deduction as long as the donee spouse receives
"substantial beneficial enjoyment" of the trust property.101 T. C. 314, 325 (1993); see also 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-5(f )
(1996) (tracking language of $ 25.2523(e)-1(f )). The Commis-sioner interpreted this language in Revenue Ruling 69-56,
and held that a trustee's power to

"charge to income or principal, executor's or trustee's
commissions, legal and accounting fees, custodian fees,and similar administration expenses . . .

. . . . .
"[does] not result in the disallowance or diminution of
the marital deduction for estate and gift tax purposes
unless the execution of such directions would or the ex-ercise of such powers could, cause the spouse to have

less than substantially full beneficial enjoyment ofthe particular interest transferred." Rev. Rul. 69-56,
1969-1 Cum. Bull. 224 (emphasis added).
Both the plurality and Justice Scalia argue that these gift
regulations and rulings are inapposite because they addresshow the power to allocate expenses affects a trust's

qualification for the marital deduction, and not how it affects the
trust's value. Ante, at 103-104; post, at 125-126, 131-132.
They further contend that the "material limitation" language
in 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996) would be rendered superfluous if a "material limitation" on the spouse's right to
receive income existed only when that spouse lacked "substantial beneficial enjoyment" of the income. 101 T. C.,

117Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
at 325-326 (adopting this argument). Under this reading,there could be no such thing as a trust that qualified for the

marital deduction but imposed a material limitation on theright to income because any trust failing the "substantial
beneficial enjoyment" test would not qualify for the deduction at all. Ante, at 103; post, at 132. These are potentcriticisms. But no matter how poorly drafted or ill conceived the Revenue Ruling might be, the fact remains thatthe Commissioner issued it and its plain language is hard
to ignore. In the end, the conclusion one draws regardinghow the marital and charitable trusts would be treated if
they were inter vivos gifts depends on whether one takesthe Commissioner at her word: If one does, the gift tax provisions, Revenue Ruling 69-56 in particular, favor respondent's position; if one does not, one is left with no guidance atall. Neither result is wholly satisfying.

Fortunately, $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) further directs the reader toconsider a second method of determining the amount of the
marital deduction:

"In determining the value of the interest in property
passing to the spouse account must be taken of the effectof any material limitations upon her right to income

from the property."
From this we ask whether the executor's right to allocate
administrative expenses to the postmortem income of themarital bequest is a material limitation upon the spouse's

"right to income from the property," such that "account mustbe taken of the effect." Because the executor's power is
undeniably a "limitation" on the spouse's right to income,
the case hinges on whether that limitation is "material."
Accord, post, at 128 (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("The beginning
of analysis . . . is to determine what, in the context of

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a), the word `material' means").

We can quibble over which definition of "material"--"substantial" or "relevant"--precedes the other in the dictionary,

118 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
see ibid.; American Heritage Dictionary 772 (2d ed. 1985)("substantial" precedes "relevant"), but this debate is beside

the point. The Commissioner has already interpreted thelanguage in $ 20.2056(b)-4(a). In Revenue Ruling 93-48, the
Commissioner ruled that the marital deduction is not "ordinarily" reduced when an executor allocates interest pay-ments on deferred federal estate taxes to the postmortem

income of the spousal bequest. Rev. Rul. 93-48, 1993-2Cum. Bull. 271 ("[T]he value of a residuary charitable [or
marital] bequest is [not] reduced by the amount of [interest]expenses payable from the income of the residuary property"). Justice Scalia contends that Revenue Ruling
93-48 should be disregarded because it was promulgated
by the Commissioner only after her attempts to prevail on
the contrary position in federal court repeatedly failed.
Post, at 129-130. To be sure, the Commissioner may not
have whole-heartedly embraced Revenue Ruling 93-48, but
the Ruling nevertheless issued and we may not totally ignore the plain language of a regulation or ruling because the
entity promulgating it did not really want to have to adopt
it. See Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, 503 U. S. 249,
253-254 (1992) ("We have stated time and time again that
courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what
it means and means in a statute what it says there"); West
Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U. S. 83, 98
(1991) (rejecting argument that "the congressional purpose
in enacting [a statute] must prevail over the ordinary meaning of statutory terms").

It is, as an initial matter, difficult to reconcile the Commissioner's treatment of interest under Revenue Ruling 93-48
with her position in this case. For all intents and purposes,
interest accruing on estate taxes is functionally indistinguishable from the administrative expenses at issue here.
By definition, neither of these expenses can exist prior to
the decedent's death; before that time, there is no estate to
administer and no estate tax liability to defer. Yet both

119Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment
types of expenses are inevitable once the estate is open be-cause it is virtually impossible to close an estate in a day so

as to avoid the deferral of estate tax payments or the incur-sion of some administration expenses. Although both can
theoretically be avoided if an executor donates his time or
pays up front what he estimates the estate tax to be, thiswill not often occur. Both types of expenses are, moreover,

of uncertain amount on the date of death. Because thesetwo types of expenses are so similar in relevant ways, in my
view they should be treated the same under $ 20.2056(b)-4(a)and Ruling 93-48, despite the Commissioner's limitation
on the applicability of Revenue Ruling 93-48 to interest on
deferred estate taxes.

But more important, the Commissioner's treatment of
interest on deferred estate taxes in Revenue Ruling 93-48
indicates her rejection of the notion that every financial burden on a marital bequest's postmortem income is a material

limitation warranting a reduction in the marital deduction.
That the Ruling purports to apply not only to income but
also to principal, and may therefore deviate from the accepted rule regarding payment of expenses from principal,
see supra, at 112-113, does not undercut the relevance of the
Ruling's implications as to income. Post, at 130 (Scalia, J.,
dissenting). Thus, some financial burdens on the spouse's
right to postmortem income will reduce the marital deduction; others will not. The line between the two does not, as
Justice Scalia contends, depend upon the relevance of the
limitation on the spouse's right to income to the value of the
marital bequest, post, at 128-129, since interest on deferred
estate taxes surely reduces, and is therefore relevant to,
"the value of what passes," post, at 128 (emphasis deleted).
By virtue of Revenue Ruling 93-48, the Commissioner has
instead created a quantitative rule for $ 20.2056(b)-4(a).
That a limitation affects the marital deduction only upon
reaching a certain quantum of substantiality is not a concept
alien to the law of taxation; such rules are quite common.

See, e. g., Rev. Rul. 75-298, 1975-2 Cum. Bull. 290 (exemptingfrom income tax the income of qualifying banks owned by

foreign governments, as long as their participation in domes-tic commercial activity is

de minimis); Rev. Rul. 90-60,
1990-2 Cum. Bull. 3 (establishing de minimis rule so that
taxpayers who give up less than 33.3% of their partnershipinterest need not post a bond to enable them to defer payment of credit recapture taxes for low-income housing).The Commissioner's quantitative materiality rule is consistent with the example set forth in 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996):

"An example of a case in which [the material limitation]rule may be applied is a bequest of property in trust for
the benefit of the decedent's spouse but the income fromthe property from the date of the decedent's death until
distribution of the property to the trustee is to be usedto pay expenses incurred in the administration of the
estate."
Even assuming that Justice Scalia is correct that the word
"may" connotes "possibility rather than permissibility," post,at 131, the example still does not specify whether it applies

when all the income, some of the income, or any of the income"from the property . . . is to be used to pay expenses incurred
in the administration of the estate." Any of these constructions of the example's language is plausible, and the Commis-sioner's expressed preference for the second one is worthy of

deference. National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United
States, 440 U. S. 472, 476 (1979).

That said, the proper measure of materiality has yet to be
decided by the Commissioner. The Tax Court below compared the actual amount spent on administration expenses
to its estimate of the income to be generated by the marital
bequest during the spouse's lifetime. 101 T. C., at 325. One

1-2. The plurality, drawing upon its valuation theory,

income . . . [is] material as compared with the date-of-deathvalue of the expected future income."

Ante, at 110. None
of these tests specifies with any particularity when thethreshold of materiality is crossed. Cf. 26 U. S. C. $ 2503(b)

(setting $10,000 annual minimum before gift tax liability attaches). The proliferation of possible tests only underscores
the need for the Commissioner's guidance. In its absence,
the Tax Court's approach is as consistent with the Code as
any of the others, and provides no basis for reversal.

I share Justice Scalia's reluctance to find a $1.5 million
diminution in postmortem income immaterial under any
standard. Post, at 128-129. Were this Court considering
the question of quantitative materiality in the first instance,
I would be hard pressed not to find this amount "material"
given the size of Mr. Hubert's estate. But the Tax Court in
this case was effectively pre-empted from making such a
finding by the Commissioner's litigation strategy. It appears from the record that the Commissioner elected to
marshal all her resources behind the proposition that any
diversion of postmortem income was material, and never
presented any evidence or argued that $1.5 million was quantitatively material. See App. 58 (Stipulation of Agreed
Issues) (setting forth Commissioner's argument); Brief for
Respondent 47. Because she bore the burden of proving
materiality (since her challenge to administrative expenses
was omitted from the original notice of deficiency), Tax
Court Rule 142(a), her failure of proof left the Tax Court
with little choice but to reach its carefully crafted conclusion
that $1.5 million was not quantitatively material on "the

facts before [it]." 101 T. C., at 325. I would resist thetemptation to correct the seemingly counterintuitive result

in this case by protecting the Commissioner from her ownlitigation strategy, especially when she continues to adhere
to that strategy and does not, even now, ask us to reconsider
the Tax Court's finding on this issue.This complex case has spawned four separate opinions

from this Court. The question presented is simple and itsanswer should have been equally straightforward. Yet we
are confronted with a maze of regulations and rulings thatlead at times in opposite directions. There is no reason why
this labyrinth should exist, especially when the Commis-sioner is empowered to promulgate new regulations and
make the answer clear. Indeed, nothing prevents the Commissioner from announcing by regulation the very position
she advances in this litigation. Until that time, however,
the relevant sources point to a test of quantitative materiality, one that is not met by the unusual factual record in this
case. I would, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the Tax
Court.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Breyer joins,
dissenting.

The statute and regulation most applicable to the question
presented in this case are discussed in today's opinion almost
as an afterthought. Instead of relying on the text of 26
U. S. C. $ 2056(b)(4)(B) and its interpretive Treasury Regulation, 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996), the plurality hinges its
analysis on general principles of valuation which it mistakenly believes to inhere in the estate tax. It thereby creates
a tax boondoggle never contemplated by Congress, and announces a test of deductibility virtually impossible for taxpayers and the Internal Revenue Service to apply. In my
view, $ 2056(b)(4)(B) and $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) provide a straightforward disposition, namely, that the marital (and charitable)
deductions must be reduced whenever income from property

Scalia, J., dissenting
comprising the residuary bequest to the spouse (or charity)is used to satisfy administration expenses. I therefore respectfully dissent. I

Section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code providesfor a deduction from gross estate for marital bequests.1 The Code places two limitations on the marital de-duction which are relevant to this case. First, as would be
expected, the marital deduction is limited to "an amountequal to the value of any interest in property which passes
or has passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse, butonly to the extent that such interest is included in determining the value of the gross estate." 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(a).Thus, as the plurality correctly recognizes, and as both parties agree, if any portion of marital bequest principal is usedto pay estate administration expenses, then the marital deduction must be reduced commensurately. Second, andmore to the point, "where such interest or property [bequeathed to the spouse] is encumbered in any manner, orwhere the surviving spouse incurs any obligation imposed by
the decedent with respect to the passing of such interest,such encumbrance or obligation shall be taken into account
in the same manner as if the amount of a gift to such spouseof such interest were being determined." $ 2056(b)(4)(B).
Section 2056(b)(4)(B) controls this case and leads to theconclusion that the marital deduction must be reduced when
estate income which would otherwise pass to the spouseis used to pay administration expenses of the estate.

agree with the plurality's determination that the provisions governing the
two should be read in pari materia, ante, at 100, and, like the plurality, I

Scalia, J., dissenting
administration expenses. The settlement agreement resolv-ing the will contest, like Mr. Hubert's most recent will, provided that the estate's administration expenses would bepaid from the residuary trusts, with the discretion given to
the executor to apportion expenses between the income and
principal of the residue. The marital bequest, which makesup some 52% of the residue, was thus plainly burdened with

the obligation of paying 52% of the administration expensesof the estate. (The charitable bequest accounted for the
remaining 48% of the residue.)Our task under $ 2056(b)(4)(B) is to determine how this
obligation would affect the value of the marital bequest were
the bequest an inter vivos gift. This seemingly rudimentary question proves difficult to answer. Both parties point
to various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the
Treasury Regulations, but these concern the quite different question whether a gift qualifies for the gift tax marital deduction; none discusses how the actual payment of
administration expenses from income will affect the value
of the gift tax marital deduction. See, e. g., Treas. Reg.

$$ 25.2523(e)-1(f)(3) and (4), 26 CFR $$ 25.2523(e)-1(f)(3) and
(4) (1996) (inclusion of the power to a trustee to allocate expenses of a trust between income and corpus will not disqualify the gift from the marital deduction so long as the
spouse maintains substantial beneficial enjoyment of the income). The plurality seeks to derive some support from

$ 25.2523(a)-1(e), see ante, at 101-102, though it must acknowledge that "[t]he question presented here . . . is not controlled by the exact terms of [that regulation or the provisions to which it refers]," ante, at 101. Even going beyond
its "exact terms," however, the regulation has no relevance.
Like its counterparts in the estate tax provisions, see

$$ 20.2031-1(b), 20.2031-7, it simply provides instruction on
how to value the assets comprising the gift. It says nothing
about how to take account of administration expenses. Indeed, the gross estate does not include anticipated adminis520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tration expenses. As I discuss below, infra, at 134-135, theestate tax provisions provide for a deduction from the gross

estate for administration expenses actually incurred. See26 U. S. C. $ 2053(a)(2) and 26 CFR $ 20.2053-3(a) (1996).
Were expected administration expenses taken into account
in valuing the assets of the gross estate, as the plurality in-correctly suggests, then the estate tax deduction for actual

administration expenses would in effect be a second deduc-tion for the same charge.

Respondent's strongest argument is based on Rev. Rul.69-56, 1969-1 Cum. Bull. 224, which held that inclusion in a
marital trust of the power to charge administration expenses
to either income or principal does not run afoul of that provision of the regulations which requires, in order for a lifeestate trust to qualify for the gift and estate tax marital
deductions, that the settlor intend the spouse to enjoy "substantially that degree of beneficial enjoyment of the trust
property during her life which the principles of the law of
trust accord to a person who is unqualifiedly designated as
the life beneficiary of a trust." 26 CFR $$ 2523(e)-1(f)(1),
2056(b)-5(f)(1) (1996). Although the Revenue Ruling was
an interpretation of qualification regulations, it also purported to "h[o]ld" that inclusion of the "power" to allocate
expenses between income and principal "does not result in
the disallowance or diminution of the marital deduction,"
Rev. Rul. 69-56, 1969-1 Cum. Bull. 224, 225 (emphasis
added). I agree with the Commissioner that this Revenue
Ruling is inapposite because it deals with the effect of the
mere existence of the power to allocate expenses against income; it speaks not at all to the question of how the actual
exercise of that power will affect the valuation of the estate
tax marital deduction. If the Ruling is construed to mean
that exercise of the power does not reduce the marital deduction, then actually using principal to pay the expenses should
not reduce the marital deduction, a result which everyone
agrees is incorrect, see, e. g., ante, at 104 (plurality opinion);

supra, at 123, and which plainly conflicts with $ 2056(a). It
seems to me obvious that the Commissioner was simply not
addressing the issue before us today when she issued Revenue Ruling 69-56, a conclusion confirmed by the fact that the
Commissioner's longstanding view--which antedates Revenue Ruling 69-56--is that use of marital bequest income to
pay administration expenses requires that the marital deduction be reduced, see, e. g., Brief for Government Appellee in
Ballantine v. Tomlinson, No. 18,736 (CA5 1961), p. 18; Brief
for Government Appellee in Alston v. United States, No.
21,402 (CA5 1965), p. 15.

The Commissioner contends that Treas. Reg. $ 20.2056
(b)-4(a), 26 CFR $ 2056(b)-4(a) (1996), which interprets

$ 2056(b)-(4)(B), mandates the conclusion that payment of administration expenses from marital bequest income reduces
the marital deduction. Section 20.2056(b)-4(a) provides:

"The value, for the purpose of the marital deduction, of
any deductible interest which passed from the decedent
to his surviving spouse is to be determined as of the
date of the decedent's death, [unless the executor elects
the alternate valuation date]. The marital deduction
may be taken only with respect to the net value of any
deductible interest which passed from the decedent to
his surviving spouse, the same principles being applicable as if the amount of a gift to the spouse were being
determined. In determining the value of the interest
in property passing to the spouse account must be taken
of the effect of any material limitations upon her right
to income from the property. An example of a case in
which this rule may be applied is a bequest of property
in trust for the benefit of the decedent's spouse but the
income from the property from the date of decedent's
death until distribution of the property to the trustee is

to be used to pay expenses incurred in the administra-tion of the estate." (Emphasis added.)

This text was issued pursuant to explicit authority given theSecretary of the Treasury to promulgate the rules and regulations necessary to enforce the Internal Revenue Code.See 26 U. S. C. $ 7805(a). As this Court has repeatedly acknowledged, judicial deference to the Secretary's handiwork"helps guarantee that the rules will be written by `masters
of the subject.' " National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v.
United States, 440 U. S. 472, 477 (1979), quoting UnitedStates v. Moore, 95 U. S. 760, 763 (1878). Thus, when a provision of the Internal Revenue Code is ambiguous, as$ 2056(b)(4)(B) plainly is, this Court has consistently deferred
to the Treasury Department's interpretive regulations solong as they " ` "implement the congressional mandate in
some reasonable manner." ' " National Muffler Dealers
Assn., Inc., supra, at 476, quoting United States v. Cart-wright, 411 U. S. 546, 550 (1973), in turn quoting United

States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 307 (1967). See also CottageSavings Assn. v. Commissioner, 499 U. S. 554, 560-561
(1991).As the courts below recognized, the crucial term of the
regulation for present purposes is "material limitations."Curiously enough, however, neither the Commissioner nor
respondent comes forward with a definition of this term, theformer simply contending that "it is the burden of paying
administration expenses itself that constitutes the `material'limitation," Brief for Petitioner 31, and the latter simply contending that that burden is for various reasons not substan-tial enough to qualify. Today's plurality opinion also takes
the latter approach, never defining the term but displayingby its examples that "material" must mean "relatively substantial." If, it says, a spouse's bequest represents a smallportion of the overall estate and could be expected to generate little income, the estate's anticipated administrationexpenses " `may' be material" when compared to the antici520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pated income. Ante, at 106. But, it says, the mere fact thatan estate incurs (or as I discuss below, under the plurality's

approach, expects to incur) "substantial litigation costs" isinsufficient to make a limitation material.

Ante, at 107.
The beginning of analysis, it seems to me, is to determine
what, in the context of $ 20.2056(b)-4(a), the word "material"means. In common parlance, the word sometimes bears the

meaning evidently assumed by respondent: "substantial," or"serious," or "important." See 1 The New Shorter Oxford
English Dictionary 1714 (1993) (def. 3); Webster's New Inter-national Dictionary 1514 (2d ed. 1950) (def. 2a). It would
surely bear that meaning in a regulation that referred to
a "material diminution of the value of the spouse's estate."
Relatively small diminutions would not count. But where,
as here, the regulation refers to "material limitations upon
[the spouse's] right to receive income," it seems to me that
the more expansive meaning of "material" is naturally suggested--the meaning that lawyers use when they move that
testimony be excluded as "immaterial": Not "insubstantial"
or "unimportant," but "irrelevant" or "inconsequential."
See American Heritage Dictionary 1109 (3d ed. 1992) (def. 4:
defining "material" as "[b]eing both relevant and consequential," and listing "relevant" as a synonym). In the context
of $ 20.2056(b)-4(a), which deals, as its first sentence recites,
with "[t]he value, for the purpose of the marital deduction,
of any deductible interest which passed from the decedent to
his surviving spouse" (emphasis added), a "material limitation" is a limitation that is relevant or consequential to the
value of what passes. Many limitations are not--for example, a requirement that the spouse not spend the income for
five years, or that the spouse be present at the reading of the
will, or that the spouse reconcile with an alienated relative.

That this is the more natural reading of the provision is
amply demonstrated by the consequences of the alternative
reading, which would leave it to the taxpayer, the Commissioner, and ultimately the courts, to guess whether a particu520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

129Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Scalia, J., dissenting
lar decrease in value is "material" enough to qualify--with-out any hint as to what might be a "ballpark" figure, or

indeed any hint as to whether there is such a thing as "abso-lute materiality" (the $2 million at issue here, for instance),
or whether it is all relative to the size of the estate. One
should not needlessly impute such a confusing meaning to aregulation which readily bears another interpretation that is

more precise. Moreover, the Commissioner's interpretationof her own regulation, so long as it is consistent with the
text, is entitled to considerable deference, see National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc., supra, at 488-489; Cottage Savings
Assn., supra, at 560-561.

The concurrence contends that the other (more unnatural)
reading of "material" must be adopted--and that no deference is to be accorded the Commissioner's longstanding approach of reducing the marital deduction for any payment
of administrative expenses out of marital-bequest income--
because of a recent Revenue Ruling in which the Commissioner acquiesced in lower court holdings that the marital
deduction is not reduced by the payment from the marital
bequest of interest on deferred estate taxes. Ante, at 118-
120 (discussing Rev. Rul. 93-48). The concurrence asserts
that interest accruing on estate taxes "is functionally indistinguishable" from administrative expenses, so that Revenue
Ruling 93-48 "created a quantitative rule" shielding some
financial burdens from affecting the calculation of the marital
deduction. Ante, at 118, 119. I think not. The Commissioner issued Revenue Ruling 93-48 only after her contention, that $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) required the marital deduction to
be reduced by payment of estate tax interest from the marital bequest, was repeatedly rejected by the Tax Court and
the Courts of Appeals. See, e. g., Estate of Street v. Commissioner, 974 F. 2d 723 (CA6 1992); Estate of Whittle v.
Commissioner, 994 F. 2d 379 (CA7 1993); Estate of Richardson v. Commissioner, 89 T. C. 1193 (1987). Rather than continuing to expend resources in litigation that seemed likely

Scalia, J., dissenting
to bring little or no income to the Treasury, the Commis-sioner chose, in Revenue Ruling 93-48, to "adopt the result"

of then-recent court decisions regarding interest on taxes.It is impossible to think that this suggested her view on the
proper treatment of administrative expenses had changed.
Indeed, the Ruling itself expressly indicates continued ad-herence to the Commissioner's longstanding position by reaffirming Revenue Ruling 73-98, which held that the charita-ble deduction must be reduced by the amount of charitable
bequest income and principal consumed to pay administra-tive expenses, modifying it only insofar as it applies to payment of interest on taxes. Moreover, the Courts of Appeals
whose results the Commissioner adopted themselves distinguished administrative expenses. In Estate of Street, for
example, the court reasoned that while administrative expenses accrue at death interest on taxes accrues after death,
and noted that the example in Treas. Reg. $ 2056(b)-4(a) specifically required a reduction of the marital deduction for
payment of administrative expenses, but was silent as to interest on taxes. 974 F. 2d, at 727, 729. While the concurrence may be correct that the distinctions advanced by the
Courts of Appeals are not wholly persuasive (the Commissioner herself argued that to no avail), I hardly think they
are so irrational that it was arbitrary or capricious for the
Commissioner to maintain her longstanding prior position on
administrative expenses once Revenue Ruling 93-48 was
issued; and it is utterly impossible to think that Revenue
Ruling 93-48 was, or was understood to be, an indication
that the Commissioner had changed her prior position on
administrative expenses. That eliminates the only two
grounds on which Revenue Ruling 93-48 could be relevant.

The concurrence's reading of Revenue Ruling 93-48 suffers from an additional flaw. Revenue Ruling 93-48 is not
limited to payment from marital bequest income, but rather
extends to payment from marital bequest principal as well.
Thus, under the concurrence's view of that Ruling, even sub520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

131Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Scalia, J., dissenting
stantial administrative expenses paid out of marital bequestprincipal may not require a reduction of the marital deduction. This result is, of course, inconsistent with the statute,see 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(a), and with what appears to be (as I
noted earlier, supra, at 125-126) the concurrence's view,
ante, at 112-113.Respondent asserts that some inquiry into "substantiality"

is necessarily implied by the fact that the last sentence ofthe regulation describes an income-to-pay-administrationexpenses limitation as "[a]n example of a case in which thisrule [of taking account of material limitations]

may be
applied," 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996) (emphasis added).
The word "may" implies, the argument goes, that in some
circumstances under those same facts the rule would not be
applied--namely (the argument posits), when the administration expenses are not "substantial." But the latter is not
the only explanation for the "may." Assuming it connotes
possibility rather than permissibility (as in, "My boss said
that I may go to New York"), the contingency referred to
could simply be the contingency that there be some income
which is used to pay administration expenses.

The Tax Court (in analysis adopted verbatim by the Eleventh Circuit and seemingly adopted by the concurrence, ante,
at 120-121) took yet a third approach to "material limitation," which I must pause to consider. The Tax Court relied
on 26 CFR $ 25.2523(e)-1(f)(3) (1996), which, it stated, provides that so long as the spouse has substantial beneficial
enjoyment of the income of a trust, the bequest will not be
disqualified from the marital gift deduction by virtue of a
provision allowing the trustee to allocate expenses to income, and the spouse will be deemed to have received all the
income from the trust. The Tax Court concluded: "If Mrs.
Hubert is treated as having received all of the income from
the trust, there can be no material limitation on her right to
receive income." 101 T. C. 314, 325-326 (1993). This reasoning fails for a number of reasons. First, $ 25.2523(e)-

520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
132 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Scalia, J., dissenting
1(f)(3) is a qualification provision; it does not purport to
instruct on how to value the bequest. Second, and more
fundamentally, the Tax Court's approach renders the "material limitation" phrase in $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) superfluous.
Under that view, a limitation is material only if it deprives
the spouse of substantial beneficial enjoyment of the income.
However, if the spouse does not have substantial beneficial
enjoyment of the income, the trust does not qualify for the
marital deduction and whether the limitation is material is
irrelevant. That "material limitation" is not synonymous
with "substantial beneficial enjoyment" is further suggested
by the regulations governing the qualification of trusts for
the marital estate tax deduction, which are virtually identical to the gift tax provisions relied upon by the Tax Court.
See 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-5(f ) (1996). Section 20.2056(b)-
5(f)(9) provides that a spouse will not be deemed to lack substantial beneficial enjoyment of the income merely because
the spouse is not entitled to the income from the estate
assets for the period reasonably required for administration
of the estate. However, that section expressly provides: "As
to the valuation of the property interest passing to the
spouse in trust where the right to income is expressly postponed, see $ 20.2056(b)-4." Ibid. (emphasis added).

C
My understanding of $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) is the only approach
consistent with the statutory requirement that the marital
deduction be limited to the value of property which passes
to the spouse. See 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(a). As the plurality
and the concurrence acknowledge, one component of an
asset's value is its discounted future income. See, e. g.,
Maass v. Higgins, 312 U. S. 443, 448 (1941); 26 CFR

$ 20.2031-1(b) (1996). (This explains why postmortem income earned by the estate is not added to the date-of-death
value in computing the gross estate: projected income was
already included in the date-of-death value.) The plurality

133Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Scalia, J., dissenting
and the concurrence also properly acknowledge that if resid-uary principal is used to pay administration expenses, then

the marital deduction must be reduced commensurately be-cause the property does not pass to the spouse. See ante,
at 104 (plurality opinion); ante, at 112-113 (O'Connor, J.,concurring in judgment); 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(a). The plurality
and the concurrence decline, however, to follow this reason-ing to its logical conclusion. Since the future stream of
income is one part of the value of the assets at the date ofdeath, use of the income to pay administration expenses
(which were not included in calculating the assets' values)in effect reduces the value of the interest that passes to
the spouse. As succinctly explained by a respected taxcommentator:

"Beneficiaries are compensated for the delay in receiv-ing possession by giving them the right to the income
that is earned during administration. . . . [I]t is only thecombination of the two rights--that to the income and
that to possess the property in the future--that givesthe beneficiary rights at death that are equal to value of
the property at death. If the beneficiary does not getthe income, what the beneficiary gets is less than the
deathtime value of the property." Davenport, A StreetThrough

Hubert's Fog, 73 Tax Notes 1107, 1110 (1996).

If the beneficiary does not receive the income generated bythe marital bequest principal, she in effect receives at the

date of death less than the value of the property in the es-tate, in much the same way as she receives less than the
value of the property in the estate when principal is used topay expenses.

II
Besides giving the word "material" the erroneous meaningof something in excess of "substantial," the plurality's opinion adopts a unique methodology for determining material-ity. Consistent with its apparent view that the estate tax
provisions prohibit examination of any events following the

520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
134 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Scalia, J., dissenting
date of death, the plurality concludes that whether a limita-tion is material, and the extent of any reduction in the marital deduction, are determined solely on the basis of the infor-mation available at the date of death--a position espoused
by neither litigant, none of the amici, and none of the courtsto have considered this issue since it arose some 35 years
ago. The plurality appears to have been misled by its viewthat the estate tax demands symmetry: Since only anticipated income is included in the gross estate, only anticipatedadministration expenses can reduce the marital deduction.
See ante, at 102, 106-109. The provisions of the estate taxclearly reject such a notion of symmetry and do not sharply
discriminate between date-of-death and postmortem eventsinsofar as the allowance of deductions for claims against and
obligations of the estate are concerned. In this very case,for example, in calculating the taxable estate the executors
deducted $506,989 of actual administration expenses pur-suant to 26 U. S. C. $ 2053(a)(2). App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.
The regulations governing such deductions provide that"[t]he amounts deductible . . . as `administration expenses'
. . . are limited to such expenses as are actually and necessarily, incurred in the administration of the decedent's es-tate," 26 CFR $ 20.2053-3(a) (1996) (emphasis added), and

expressly prohibit taking a deduction "upon the basis of avague or uncertain estimate," $ 20.2053-1(b)(3). Since such
common administration expenses as litigation costs will beimpossible to ascertain with any exactitude as of the date of
death, the plurality's approach flatly contradicts the provi-sions of these regulations.

2

The marital deduction itself is calculated on the basis ofactual, rather than anticipated, expenditures from the marital bequest. The regulations governing 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(b)

2 The plurality's reference to Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U. S.
151 (1929), is unhelpful. That case holds that date-of-death valuation is
applicable to bequeathed assets, not that it is applicable to claims and
obligations that are to be satisfied out of those assets.

Scalia, J., dissenting
(4)(A), the provision requiring the marital deduction to bereduced to take account of the effect of estate and inheritance taxes, make it clear that the actual amounts of thosetaxes control. See 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(c) (1996). (With
respect to the charitable deduction, the requirement that actual amounts be used is apparent on the face of the statuteitself, see 26 U. S. C. $ 2055(c).) Moreover, the language

of $ 2056(b)(4)(A) is quite similar to the language of theregulation at issue here, $ 20.2056(b)-4(a), suggesting that
the latter, like the former, should be interpreted to requireconsideration of

actual, rather than merely expected, administration expenses. Compare 26 U. S. C. $ 2056(b)(4)(A)
("[T]here shall be taken into account the effect which the tax
imposed by section 2001, or any estate [tax], has on the net
value to the surviving spouse of such interest" (emphasis
added)) with 26 CFR $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996) ("The marital
deduction may be taken only with respect to the net value
of any deductible interest which passed from the decedent to
his surviving spouse . . . . In determining the value of the
interest in property passing to the spouse account must be
taken of the effect of any material limitations upon [the
spouse's] right to income" (emphasis added)).

In short, the plurality's general theory concerning valuation is contradicted by provisions of both the Code and
regulations. It is also plagued by a number of practical
problems. Most prominently, the plurality's rule is simply
unadministrable. It requires the Internal Revenue Service
and courts to engage in a peculiar, nunc pro tunc, threestage investigation into what would have been believed on
the date of death of the decedent. This highly speculative
inquiry begins, I presume, with an examination of the various possible administration expenditures multiplied by the
likelihood that they would actually come into being (for
example, estimating the chances that a will contest would
develop). Next, one must calculate the expected future
income from the bequest. Finally, one must determine if,

520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
136 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Scalia, J., dissenting
in light of the expected income, the anticipated expensesare such that a willing buyer would deem them to be a "material [i. e., substantial] limitation" on the right to receiveincome.

Just how a court, presiding over a tax controversy many
years after the decedent's death, is supposed to blind itself tolater developed facts, and gauge the expected administration

expenses and anticipated income just as they would havebeen gauged on the date of death, is a mystery to me. In
most cases, it is nearly impossible to estimate administrationexpenses as of the date of death; much less is it feasible to
reconstruct such an estimation five or six years later. The
plurality's test creates tremendous uncertainty and will undoubtedly produce extensive litigation. We should be very
reluctant to attribute to the Code or the Secretary's regulations the intention to require this sort of inherently difficult
inquiry, especially when the key regulation is best read to
require that account be taken of actual expenses.

The plurality's test also leads to rather peculiar results.
One example should suffice: Assume a decedent leaves his
entire $30 million estate in trust to his wife and that as of
the date of death a hypothetical buyer estimates that the
estate will generate administration expenses on the order of
$5 million because the decedent's estranged son has publicly
stated that he is going to wage a fight over the will. Further, assume that the will provides that either income or
principal may be used to satisfy the estate's expenses. Finally, assume that a week after the decedent's death, mother
and son put aside their differences and that the money passes
to the spouse almost immediately with virtually no administration expenses. Under the plurality's test, since "only anticipated administration expenses payable from income, not
the actual ones, affect the date-of-death value of the marital
or charitable bequests," ante, at 108, the marital deduction
will be limited to approximately $25 million, and, despite
generating almost no income and having very few adminis520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

137Cite as: 520 U. S. 93 (1997)
Scalia, J., dissenting
tration expenses, the estate will be required to pay an estatetax on some $5 million even though the entire estate passed

to the spouse. The plurality's test creates taxable estateswhere none exist. The proper result under $ 2056(b)(4)(B)
and $ 20.2056(b)-4(a) is that the marital deduction is $30
million and the estate pays no estate tax.I have one final concern with the plurality's approach: It

effectively permits an estate to obtain a double deductionfrom tax for administration expenses, a tax windfall which
Congress could never have intended. Title 26 U. S. C.$ 642(g) provides that administration expenses, which are allowed as a deduction in computing the taxable estate of a
decedent, see $ 2053, may be deducted from income (provided
they fall within an income tax deduction) if the estate files a
statement with the Commissioner stating that such amounts
have not been taken as deductions from the gross estate.
Here, respondent elected to deduct some $1.5 million of its
administration expenses on its fiduciary income tax returns
and was prohibited from taking these expenses as a deduction from the gross estate. Notwithstanding $ 642(g), however, the plurality's holding effectively permits respondent
to deduct the $1.5 million of administration expenses on the
estate tax return under the guise of a marital or charitable
deduction. Of course, the estate could have avoided the estate tax by electing to deduct its administration expenses on
its estate tax return, but then it would have had no income
tax deduction; Congress gave estates a choice, not a road
map to a double deduction. I recognize that nothing in

$ 642(g) compels the conclusion that the marital (or charitable) deduction must be reduced whenever an estate elects to
deduct expenses from income. However, by enacting $ 642
to prohibit a double deduction, Congress seemingly anticipated that if an estate elected to deduct administration expenses against income, its potential estate tax liability would
increase commensurately. The plurality's holding today
defeats this expectation.

$ 2056(b)(4)(B), squarely controls this case and requires thatthe marital (and charitable) deductions be reduced whenever
marital (or charitable) bequest income is used to pay admin-istration expenses, I would reverse the judgment of the
Eleventh Circuit. There is some dispute as to how exactlyto calculate the reduction in the marital and charitable deductions. The dissenting judges in the Tax Court, on theone hand, contended that the marital and charitable deductions should be reduced by the date-of-death value of an an-nuity charged against the residuary interest that would be
sufficient to pay the actual administration expenses chargedto income. See 101 T. C., at 348-349 (Beghe, J., dissenting).
The Commissioner, on the other hand, contends that the mar-ital and charitable deductions must be reduced on a dollarfor-dollar basis, reasoning that this is the same way that allclaims and obligations of the estate are treated. Since this
dispute was not adequately briefed by the parties, nor passedupon by the Eleventh Circuit or the majority of judges in
the Tax Court, I would remand the case to allow the lowercourts to consider this issue in the first instance.

Justice Breyer, dissenting.
I join Justice Scalia's dissent. This case turns onwhether a payment of administration expenses out of income

generated by estate assets constitutes a "material limitation"on the right to receive income from those assets. 26 CFR

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996). The Commissioner has long, andconsistently, argued that such a payment does reduce the
value of the marital deduction. See, e. g., Ballantine v.

Brief for Petitioner 15. Justice Scalia explains why theCommissioner's interpretation is consistent with the regulation's language and the statute it interprets. I add a brief
explanation as to why I believe that it is consistent withbasic statutory and regulatory tax law objectives as well.

The regulation, which speaks of the "net value" of whatpasses to the spouse, requires a realistic valuation of the interest left to the spouse as of the date of the decedent'sdeath. Assume, for example, that a decedent leaves his entire estate to his wife in trust, with the proviso that the
administrator pay 25% of the income earned by the estate
assets during the period of administration to the decedent's
son. Assume that the period of administration lasts several
years and that the estate generates several million dollars in
income during that time. On these assumptions, the son
will have received an important asset (included in the estate's date-of-death value) that the surviving spouse did not
receive, namely, the right to a portion of the estate's income
over a period of several years. Were estate tax law to fail
to take account of this fact (that the son, not the wife, received that asset), it would permit a valuable asset (the right
to that income) to pass to the son without estate tax. But
estate tax law does seem realistically to appraise the "net
value" of what passes to the wife in such circumstances.
See 26 CFR $$ 20.2056(b)-5(f )(9), 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996); 4 A.
Casner, Estate Planning $ 13.11, pp. 138-139, and $ 13.14.6,
n. 18 (5th ed. 1988); cf. Estate of Friedberg, 63 TCM 3080
(1992), || 92,310 P-H Memo TC (delay in payment of a specific
bequest to a surviving spouse reduces its marital deduction
value). And that being so, why would it not take account of
the similar limitation on the right to income at issue here?
The fact that the administrator uses estate income to pay
administration expenses, rather than to make a bequest
to the son, makes no difference from a marital deduction

Breyer, J., dissenting
perspective, for, as the regulations state, the marital deduction focuses upon the "net value" of the "interest which
passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse." 26 CFR

$ 20.2056(b)-4(a) (1996); see United States v. Stapf, 375 U. S.
118, 125 (1963).

The Commissioner's position also treats economic equals
as equal. The time when the administrator writes the relevant checks, and not the account to which he debits them,
determines economic impact. Thus $100,000 in administration expenses incurred by a $1 million estate open for one
year, paid by check on the year's last day will (assuming 10%
simple interest and assuming away here-irrelevant complexities) leave $1 million for the spouse at year's end, whether
the administrator pays the expenses out of estate principal
or from income. On these same assumptions, a commitment
to pay, say, $100,000 in administration expenses out of income
will reduce the value of principal by an amount identical to
the reduction in value that would flow from a commitment
to pay a similar amount out of principal. This economic
similarity argues for similar estate tax treatment.

I recognize that the statute permits estates to deduct administration and certain other expenses either from the estate tax or from the estate's income tax. 26 U. S. C. $ 642(g);
cf. ante, at 112-113 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).
But I do not read that statute as allowing a spouse to escape
payment both of the estate tax (through a greater marital
deduction) and also of income tax (through the deduction of
the administration expenses from income). One can easily
read the provision's language as simply granting the estate
the advantage of whichever of the two tax rates is the more
favorable, while continuing to require the estate to pay at
least one of the two potential taxes. To read the "election"
provision in this way makes of it a less dramatic departure
from a Tax Code that otherwise sees what passes to heirs
not as the full value of what the testator left, but, rather, as

Breyer, J., dissenting
that value minus a set of permitted deductions. 26 U. S. C.

$ 2053(a) (specifying deductions).

Although respondent argues that the Commissioner's interpretation will sometimes produce an unjustified "shrinking" of the marital deduction, I do not see how that is so. I
concede that unfairness could occur were the Commissioner
to readjust the marital deduction every time the administrator deducted from the estate's income tax every expense
necessary to produce that income. But regulations guard
against her doing so. Those regulations distinguish between (a) "expenditures . . . essential to the proper settlement of the estate," and (b) expenses "incurred for the individual benefit of the heirs, legatees, or devisees." 26 CFR

$ 20.2053-3(a) (1996). The former are "administration expenses"; the latter are not. Deducting expenses in the latter category from the estate's income tax should not affect
the marital deduction; and, as long as that is so, the Commissioner's interpretation will simply permit estates to use their
administration expense deductions to the best tax advantage.
It will not lead to a marital deduction that to the spouse's
overall disadvantage somehow shrinks, or disappears.

The Commissioner's insistence upon reducing the date-ofdeath value of the trust dollar for dollar poses a more serious
problem. Payment of $100,000 in administration expenses
from future income should reduce the date-of-death value of
assets left to a wife in trust not by $100,000, but by $100,000
discounted to reflect the fact that the $100,000 will be paid
in the future, earning interest in the meantime. (Assuming
a 10% interest rate and payment one year after death, the
reduction in value would be about $91,000, not $100,000.)
Nonetheless, the Commissioner's practice of reducing the
marital deduction dollar for dollar might reflect the simplifying assumption that discount calculations do not make a sufficiently large difference sufficiently often to warrant the administrative burden of authorizing them. Or it might reflect

520US1 Unit: $U35 [09-13-99 10:42:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN
142 COMMISSIONER v. ESTATE OF HUBERT

Breyer, J., dissenting
the fact that when administration expenses are taken as adeduction against the estate tax, their value is not discounted. Were the Commissioner to defend the dollar-for-dollar position in some such way, her approach might prove
reasonable. And this Court will defer to longstanding inter-pretations of the Code and Treasury Regulations, see

supra,at 138-139, that reasonably "implement the congressional

mandate." United States v. Correll, 389 U. S. 299, 307(1967); see National Muffler Dealers Assn., Inc. v. United
States, 440 U. S. 472, 488 (1979). Regardless, I would notdecide this matter now, for it has not been argued to us.

Finally, although I agree with much that Justice O'Connor has written, I cannot agree that the amount at issue--almost $1.5 million of administration expenses deducted from

income--is insignificant hence immaterial; and I can find noconcession to that effect in the courts below.

For these reasons and those set forth by Justice Scalia,I would reverse the Court of Appeals.

143OCTOBER TERM, 1996
Syllabus

YOUNG et al. v. HARPER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe tenth circuit

No. 95-1598. Argued December 9, 1996--Decided March 18, 1997
Oklahoma's Preparole Conditional Supervision Program (preparole or Program) took effect whenever the state prisons became overcrowded and
authorized the conditional release of prisoners before their sentences
expired. The Pardon and Parole Board (Board) determined who could
participate in it, and an inmate could be placed on preparole after serving 15% of his sentence. An inmate was eligible for parole only after
one-third of his sentence had elapsed, and the Governor, based on the
Board's recommendation, decided to grant parole. Program participants and parolees were released subject to similar constraints. Upon
reviewing respondent's criminal record and prison conduct, the Board
simultaneously recommended him for parole and released him under

the Program. At that time, he had served 15 years of a life sentence.
After he spent five apparently uneventful months outside the penitentiary, the Governor denied him parole, whereupon he was ordered to,
and did, report back to prison. Despite his claim that his summary
reincarceration deprived him of liberty without due process in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment, he was denied habeas relief by, successively, the state trial court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals,
and the Federal District Court. The Tenth Circuit reversed, holding
that preparole was sufficiently like parole that a Program participant
was entitled to the procedural protections set forth in Morrissey v.
Brewer, 408 U. S. 471.

Held: The Program, as it existed when respondent was released, was

equivalent to parole as understood in Morrissey. Morrissey's description of the "nature of the interest of the parolee in his continued liberty"
could just as easily have applied to respondent while he was on preparole. In compliance with state procedures, he was released from prison
before the expiration of his sentence. See 408 U. S., at 477. He kept
his own residence; he sought, obtained, and maintained a job; and he
lived a life generally free of the incidents of imprisonment. See id., at
481-482. Although he was not permitted to use alcohol, to incur other
than educational debt, or to travel outside the county without permission, and he was required to report regularly to a parole officer, similar
limits on a parolee's liberty did not in Morrissey render such liberty
beyond procedural protection. Id., at 478. Some of the factors as520US1 Unit: $U36 [09-10-99 15:36:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

serted by petitioners to differentiate the Program from parole under
Meachum v. Fano, 427 U. S. 215, 228--that preparole had the purpose
of reducing prison overcrowding, and that a preparolee continued to
serve his sentence and receive earned credits, remained within the custody of the Department of Corrections, and was aware that he could
have been transferred to a higher security level if the Governor denied
parole--do not, in fact, appear to distinguish the two programs at all.
Other differences identified by petitioners--that participation in the
Program was ordered by the Board, while the Governor conferred parole; that escaped preparolees could be prosecuted as though they had
escaped from prison, while escaped parolees were subject only to parole
revocation, and that a preparolee could not leave Oklahoma under any
circumstances, while a parolee could leave the State with his parole
officer's permission--serve only to set preparole apart from the specific
terms of parole as it existed in Oklahoma, but not from the more general
class of parole identified in Morrissey. The Program appears to have
differed from parole in name alone. Pp. 147-153.

ing of its prisons was sufficiently like parole that a person inthe program was entitled to the procedural protections set

forth in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471 (1972), before hecould be removed from it. We hold that the program, as it
appears to have been structured at the time respondent wasplaced on it, differed from parole in name alone, and affirm
the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.

I
As pertinent to this case, Oklahoma operated two pro-grams under which inmates were conditionally released from

prison before the expiration of their sentences. One was pa-role, the other was the Preparole Conditional Supervision
Program (preparole or Program). The Program was in ef-fect whenever the population of the prison system exceeded
95% of its capacity. Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, $ 365(A) (Supp.1990). An inmate could be placed on preparole after serving
15% of his sentence, $ 365(A)(2), and he was eligible for pa-role when one-third of his sentence had elapsed, $ 332.7(A).
The Pardon and Parole Board (Board) had a role in the place-ment of both parolees and preparolees. The Board itself determined who could participate in the Program, while theGovernor, based on the Board's recommendation, decided
whether a prisoner would be paroled. As we describe fur-ther in Part II, infra, participants in the Program were
released subject to constraints similar to those imposed onparolees.

In October 1990, after reviewing respondent Ernest Eu-gene Harper's criminal record and conduct while incarcerated, the Pardon and Parole Board simultaneously rec-ommended him for parole and released him under the
Program. At that time, respondent had served 15 years ofa life sentence for two murders. Before his release, respondent underwent orientation, during which he reviewedthe "Rules and Conditions of Pre-Parole Conditional Supervision," see App. 7, and after which he executed a document

Opinion of the Court
indicating that he "underst[ood] that being classified to com-munity level depend[ed] upon [his] compliance with each of

these expectations," id., at 6. He spent five apparently un-eventful months outside the penitentiary. Nonetheless, the
Governor of Oklahoma denied respondent parole. On March
14, 1991, respondent was telephoned by his parole officer,informed of the Governor's decision, and told to report back

to prison, which he did later that day.Respondent filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in
state court complaining that his summary return to prisonhad deprived him of liberty without due process. The state
trial court denied relief and the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. 852 P. 2d 164 (1993). The Court of
Criminal Appeals concluded that respondent's removal from
the Program impinged only upon an interest in his "degree
of confinement," an interest to which the procedural protections set out in Morrissey did not attach. 852 P. 2d, at 165.
The court found "[d]ispositive of the issue" the fact that respondent "was not granted parole by the Governor of Oklahoma." Ibid. The court noted that the Board had adopted
a procedure under which preparolees subsequently denied
parole remained on the Program, and had their cases reviewed within 90 days of the denial for a determination
whether they should continue on preparole. According to
the court, "such a procedure gives an inmate sufficient notice
when he is placed in the program that he may be removed
from it when the governor exercises his discretion and declines to grant parole." Ibid.

Respondent fared no better in District Court on his petition for relief under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254. But the Tenth Circuit reversed. 64 F. 3d 563 (1995). It determined that preparole "more closely resembles parole or probation than even
the more permissive forms of institutional confinement" and
that "[d]ue process therefore mandates that program participants receive at least the procedural protections described
in Morrissey." Id., at 566-567. Petitioners sought certio520US1 Unit: $U36 [09-10-99 15:36:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

whether continued participation in such program is protected

"The essence of parole is release from prison, before the
completion of sentence, on the condition that the prisoner
abide by certain rules during the balance of the sentence."
Morrissey, 408 U. S., at 477. In Morrissey, we described
the "nature of the interest of the parolee in his continued
liberty":

"[H]e can be gainfully employed and is free to be with
family and friends and to form the other enduring attachments of normal life. Though the State properly
subjects him to many restrictions not applicable to other
citizens, his condition is very different from that of confinement in a prison. . . . The parolee has relied on at

time, and that we are thus without jurisdiction. We disagree. A timely
filed petition for rehearing will toll the running of the 90-day period for
filing a petition for certiorari until disposition of the rehearing petition.
Missouri v. Jenkins, 495 U. S. 33, 46 (1990). The petition for certiorari
was filed within 90 days of the denial of rehearing. Although the petition
for rehearing was filed two days late, the Tenth Circuit granted petitioners
"leave to file a late petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en
banc," as it had authority to do. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 40(a). Moreover, after granting petitioners leave to file the petition for rehearing, the
Tenth Circuit treated it as timely and no mandate issued until after the
petition was denied. See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 41(a). In these circumstances, we are satisfied that both the petition for rehearing and the subsequent petition for certiorari were timely filed.

Opinion of the Court
least an implicit promise that parole will be revoked onlyif he fails to live up to the parole conditions." Id., at

482.
This passage could just as easily have applied to respondentwhile he was on preparole. In compliance with state procedures, he was released from prison before the expiration ofhis sentence. He kept his own residence; he sought, obtained, and maintained a job; and he lived a life generallyfree of the incidents of imprisonment. To be sure, respondent's liberty was not unlimited. He was not permitted touse alcohol, to incur other than educational debt, or to travel
outside the county without permission. App. 7-8. And hewas required to report regularly to a parole officer. Id., at
7. The liberty of a parolee is similarly limited, but that didnot in Morrissey, 408 U. S., at 478, render such liberty beyond procedural protection.Petitioners do not ask us to revisit

Morrissey; they merelydispute that preparole falls within its compass. Our inquiry,

they argue, should be controlled instead by Meachum v.Fano, 427 U. S. 215 (1976). There, we determined that the
interest of a prisoner in avoiding an intrastate prison trans-fer was "too ephemeral and insubstantial to trigger procedural due process protections as long as prison officials havediscretion to transfer him for whatever reason or for no reason at all." Id., at 228; see also Sandin v. Conner, 515 U. S.472, 487 (1995). Petitioners contend that reincarceration of
a preparolee was nothing more than a "transfe[r] to a higherdegree of confinement" or a "classification to a more supervised prison environment," Brief for Petitioners 18, which,like transfers within the prison setting, involved no liberty
interest.In support of their argument that preparole was merely a
lower security classification and not parole, petitioners iden-tify several aspects of the Program said to render it different
from parole. Some of these do not, in fact, appear to distin-guish the two programs. Others serve only to set preparole

Opinion of the Court
apart from the specific terms of parole as it existed in Okla-homa, but not from the more general class of parole identified

in Morrissey. None of the differences--real or imagined--supports a view of the Program as having been anything
other than parole as described in Morrissey.

We first take up the phantom differences. We are told atthe outset that the purposes of preparole and parole were

different. Preparole was intended "to reduce prison over-crowding," while parole was designed "to help reintegrate
the inmate into society." Reply Brief for Petitioners 10.This alleged difference is less than it seems. Parole could
also be employed to reduce prison overcrowding, see Okla.
Stat., Tit. 57, $ 332.7(B) (Supp. 1990). And the Program's
requirement that its participants work or attend school belies the notion that preparole was concerned only with moving bodies outside of teeming prison yards. In fact, in their
brief below, petitioners described the Program as one in
which the Department of Corrections "places eligible inmates into a community for the purpose of reintegration into
society." Brief for Appellees in No. 95-5026 (CA10), p. 7,
n. 2.

We are also told that "an inmate on the Program continues
to serve his sentence and receives earned credits . . . ,
whereas a parolee is not serving his sentence and, if parole
is revoked, the parolee is not entitled to deduct from his sentence time spent on parole." Reply Brief for Petitioners 11.
Our review of the statute in effect when respondent was released, however, reveals that a parolee was "entitled to a
deduction from his sentence for all time during which he has
been or may be on parole" and that, even when parole was
revoked, the Board had the discretion to credit time spent
on parole against the sentence. Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, $ 350
(Supp. 1990).

Petitioners next argue that preparolees, unlike parolees,
remained within the custody of the Department of Corrections. This is said to be evidenced by respondent's having

150 YOUNG v. HARPER

Opinion of the Court
had to report to his parole officer weekly and to provide the
officer with a weekly itinerary. Reply Brief for Petitioners
13. We are at a loss to explain why respondent's regular
visits to his parole officer rendered him more "in custody"
than a parolee, who was required to make similar visits.
See App. to Brief for Respondent 28a. Likewise, the provision that preparolees "be subject to disciplinary proceedings
as established by the Department of Corrections" in the
event that they "violate any rule or condition during the period of community supervision," Okla. Stat., Tit. 57, $ 365(E)
(Supp. 1990), did not distinguish their "custodial" status from
that of parolees, who were also subject to the department's
custody in the event of a parole violation. See Reply Brief
for Petitioners 13.

Petitioners, for their final nonexistent distinction, argue
that, because a preparolee "is aware that he may be transferred to a higher security level if the Governor, through his
discretionary power, denies parole," he does not enjoy the
same liberty interest as a parolee. Brief for Petitioners 20.
Preparole, contend petitioners, was thus akin to a furlough
program, in which liberty was not conditioned on the participant's behavior but on extrinsic events. By this reasoning,
respondent would have lacked the "implicit promise" that his
liberty would continue so long as he complied with the conditions of his release, Morrissey, 408 U. S., at 482. Respondent concedes the reasoning of petitioners' argument as it
relates to furloughs, but challenges the premise that his participation in the Program was conditioned on the Governor's
decision regarding parole.

In support of their assertion that a preparolee knew that
a denial of parole could result in reincarceration, petitioners
rely--as they have throughout this litigation--on a procedure promulgated in August 1991, nearly five months after
respondent was returned to prison. See Pardon and Parole
Board Procedure No. 004-011 (1991), App. to Pet. for Cert.

Opinion of the Court
56a.2 The Court of Criminal Appeals also relied on this pro-vision, but because it was not in effect when respondent was

released, it has little relevance to this case.Nor have we been presented with any other evidence to
substantiate this asserted limitation on respondent's release.The closest petitioners come is to direct us to the orientation
form reviewed with respondent upon his release. Item 9 ofthat orientation form says: "Reviewed options available in
the event of parole denial." App. 5. Mindful of ProcedureNo. 004-011, as amended after respondent was reincarcerated, it is possible to read this item as indicating that re-spondent was told his participation in the Program could be
terminated if parole were denied. But the mere possibilityof respondent's having been so informed is insufficient to
overcome his showing of the facially complete, written"Rules and Conditions of Pre-Parole Conditional Supervision," App. 7-9, which said nothing about the effect of aparole denial.

Counsel for the State also claims that at the time respond-ent was participating in the Program, preparolees were always reincarcerated if the Governor denied them parole.Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In the absence of evidence to this effect--and the State points to none--this assertion is insuffi-cient to rebut the seemingly complete rules and conditions
of respondent's release. On the record before us, therefore,the premise of petitioners' argument--that respondent's continued participation was conditioned on extrinsic events--isillusory, and the analogy to furlough inapposite.

2 The version of Procedure No. 004-011 in effect when respondent was
placed on the Program was silent as to a parole denial's effect. See App.
to Pet. for Cert. 43a-52a. The procedure was amended again in 1994,
and now provides that "[i]nmates denied parole by the Governor while on
[preparole] will remain on the program, unless returned to higher security
by due process." App. to Brief for Respondent 38a.

3 Equally illusory is the argument, which petitioners made for the first

time in this Court, that the Board had authority to reimprison a preparolee for any reason or for no reason. The written rules and conditions

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners do identify some actual differences between
preparole and Oklahoma's version of parole, but these do no
better at convincing us that preparole was different from
parole as we understood it in Morrissey. As petitioners
point out, participation in the Program was ordered by the
Board, while the Governor conferred parole. In this regard,
preparole was different from parole in Oklahoma; but it was
no different from parole as we described it in Morrissey.
See 408 U. S., at 477-478. In addition, preparolees who "escape[d]" from the Program could be prosecuted as though
they had escaped from prison, see Okla. Stat., Tit. 57,

$ 365(F) (Supp. 1990), while it appears that parolees who "escaped" from parole were subject not to further prosecution,
but to revocation of parole, see Reply Brief for Petitioners
11. That the punishment for failure to abide by one of the
conditions of his liberty was potentially greater for a preparolee than for a parolee did not itself diminish that liberty.
Petitioners also note that a preparolee could not leave Oklahoma under any circumstances, App. 7, while a parolee could
leave Oklahoma with his parole officer's permission, App. to
Brief for Respondent 27a. This minor difference in a released prisoner's ability to travel did not, we think, alter the
fundamentally parole-like nature of the Program.4

III
We conclude that the Program, as it existed when respondent was released, was a kind of parole as we understood paof respondent's release identify no such absolute discretion, and petitioners
point to nothing to support their contention.

4 A comparison of the conditions of preparole of which respondent was

informed, App. 7-9, and those of which a roughly contemporary parolee
would have been informed, App. to Brief for Respondent 27a-30a, reveals
that--except for the travel and "escape" provisions--the two sets of conditions were essentially identical.

It is so ordered.

5 The Program appears to be different now. We have no occasion to
pass on whether the State's amendments to the Program, adopted since
respondent was reincarcerated, render the liberty interest of a presentday preparolee different in kind from that of a parolee.

BENNETT et al. v. SPEAR et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-813. Argued November 13, 1996--Decided March 19, 1997
The Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) requires the Secretary of the

Interior to specify animal species that are "threatened" or "endangered"
and designate their "critical habitat," 16 U. S. C. $ 1533, and requires
federal agencies to ensure that any action they authorize, fund, or carry
out is not likely to jeopardize a listed species or adversely modify its
critical habitat, $ 1536(a)(2). If an agency determines that a proposed
action may adversely affect such a species, it must formally consult with
the Fish and Wildlife Service, which must provide it with a written
statement (the Biological Opinion) explaining how the proposed action
will affect the species or its habitat. $ 1536(b)(3)(A). If the Service
concludes that such action will result in jeopardy or adverse habitat
modification, $ 1536(a)(2), the Biological Opinion must outline any "reasonable and prudent alternatives" that the Service believes will avoid
that consequence, $ 1536(b)(3)(A). If the Biological Opinion concludes
that no jeopardy or adverse habitat modification will result, or if it offers
reasonable and prudent alternatives, the Service must issue a written
statement (known as the Incidental Take Statement) specifying the
terms and conditions under which an agency may take the species.

$ 1536(b)(4). After the Bureau of Reclamation notified the Service that
the operation of the Klamath Irrigation Project might affect two endangered species of fish, the Service issued a Biological Opinion, concluding
that the proposed long-term operation of the project was likely to jeopardize the species and identifying as a reasonable and prudent alternative the maintenance of minimum water levels on certain reservoirs.
The Bureau notified the Service that it would operate the project in
compliance with the Biological Opinion. Petitioners, irrigation districts
receiving project water and operators of ranches in those districts, filed
this action against respondents, the Service's director and regional directors and the Secretary, claiming that the jeopardy determination and
imposition of minimum water levels violated $ 1536, and constituted an
implicit critical habitat determination for the species in violation of

$ 1533(b)(2)'s requirement that the designation's economic impact be considered. They also claimed that the actions violated the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA), which prohibits agency actions that are arbitrary,
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with

Syllabus
law. 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A). The District Court dismissed the complaint, concluding that petitioners lacked standing because they asserted
"recreational, aesthetic, and commercial interests" that did not fall
within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the ESA. The
Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the "zone of interests" test--
which requires that a plaintiff's grievance arguably fall within the zone
of interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision or constitutional guarantee invoked in the suit--limits the class of persons who
may obtain judicial review not only under the APA, but also under the
ESA's citizen-suit provision, 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(g); and that only plaintiffs
alleging an interest in the preservation of endangered species fall
within the zone of interests protected by the ESA.

Held: Petitioners have standing to seek judicial review of the Biological

Opinion. Pp. 161-179.

(a) The Court of Appeals erred in concluding that petitioners lacked
standing under the zone-of-interests test to bring their claims under the
ESA's citizen-suit provision. The test is a prudential standing requirement of general application, see, e. g., Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751,
that applies unless expressly negated by Congress. By providing that
"any person may commence a civil suit," $ 1540(g)(1) negates the test.
The quoted phrase is an authorization of remarkable breadth when
compared with the language Congress ordinarily uses. The Court's
readiness to take the term "any person" at face value is greatly augmented by the interrelated considerations that the legislation's overall
subject matter is the environment and that $ 1540(g)'s obvious purpose
is to encourage enforcement by so-called "private attorneys general."
See Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205, 210-211.
The "any person" formulation applies to all $ 1540(g) causes of action,
including actions against the Secretary asserting overenforcement
of $ 1533; there is no textual basis for saying that the formulation's
expansion of standing requirements applies to environmentalists alone.
Pp. 161-166.

(b) Three alternative grounds advanced by the Government--(1) that
petitioners fail to meet Article III standing requirements; (2) that

$ 1540(g) does not authorize judicial review of the types of claims petitioners advanced; and (3) that judicial review is unavailable under the
APA--do not support affirmance. Petitioners' complaint alleges an injury in fact that is fairly traceable to the Biological Opinion and redressable by a favorable judicial ruling and, thus, meets Article III standing
requirements at this stage of the litigation. Their $ 1533 claim is clearly
reviewable under $ 1540(g)(1)(C), which authorizes suit against the Secretary for an alleged failure to perform any nondiscretionary act or duty

under $ 1533. Their $ 1536 claims are obviously not reviewable under
subsection (C), however. Nor are they reviewable under subsection
(A), which authorizes injunctive actions against any person "who is alleged to be in violation" of the ESA or its regulations. Viewed in the
context of the entire statute, subsection (A)'s reference to any ESA
"violation" cannot be interpreted to include the Secretary's maladministration of the Act. The $ 1536 claims are nonetheless reviewable under
the APA. The ESA does not preclude such review, and the claim that
petitioners will suffer economic harm because of an erroneous jeopardy
determination is plainly within the zone of interests protected by $ 1536,
the statutory provision whose violation forms the basis for the complaint, see Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871. In
addition, the Biological Opinion constitutes final agency action for APA
purposes. It marks the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking
process, Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp.,
333 U. S. 103, 113. It is also an action from which "legal consequences
will flow," Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget
Transatlantic, 400 U. S. 62, 71, because the Biological Opinion and accompanying Incidental Take Statement alter the legal regime to which
the Bureau is subject, authorizing it to take the endangered species if
(but only if) it complies with the prescribed conditions. Franklin v.
Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, and Dalton v. Specter, 511 U. S. 462, distinguished. Pp. 166-179.

to designate their "critical habitat." 16 U. S. C. $ 1533.The ESA further requires each federal agency to "insure

that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by suchagency . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence
of any endangered species or threatened species or result in
the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of suchspecies which is determined by the Secretary . . . to be critical." $ 1536(a)(2). If an agency determines that action itproposes to take may adversely affect a listed species, it
must engage in formal consultation with the Fish and Wild-life Service, as delegate of the Secretary,

ibid.; 50 CFR

$ 402.14 (1995), after which the Service must provide the
agency with a written statement (the Biological Opinion) explaining how the proposed action will affect the species or
its habitat, 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(b)(3)(A). If the Service concludes that the proposed action will "jeopardize the continued existence of any [listed] species or threatened species or
result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical
habitat]," $ 1536(a)(2), the Biological Opinion must outline
any "reasonable and prudent alternatives" that the Service
believes will avoid that consequence, $ 1536(b)(3)(A). Additionally, if the Biological Opinion concludes that the agency
action will not result in jeopardy or adverse habitat modification, or if it offers reasonable and prudent alternatives to
avoid that consequence, the Service must provide the agency
with a written statement (known as the Incidental Take
Statement) specifying the "impact of such incidental taking
on the species," any "reasonable and prudent measures that

The Klamath Project, one of the oldest federal reclamation

pursuant to the Reclamation Act of 1902, 32 Stat. 388, asamended, 43 U. S. C. $ 371

et seq., and the Act of Feb. 9, 1905,
33 Stat. 714, and is administered by the Bureau of Reclama-tion, which is under the Secretary's jurisdiction. In 1992,

the Bureau notified the Service that operation of the project
might affect the Lost River Sucker (Deltistes luxatus) andShortnose Sucker

(Chasmistes brevirostris), species of fish
that were listed as endangered in 1988, see 53 Fed. Reg.27130-27133 (1988). After formal consultation with the Bureau in accordance with 50 CFR $ 402.14 (1995), the Serviceissued a Biological Opinion which concluded that the " `longterm operation of the Klamath Project was likely to jeopardize the continued existence of the Lost River and shortnose
suckers.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 3. The Biological Opinion
identified "reasonable and prudent alternatives" the Service
believed would avoid jeopardy, which included the maintenance of minimum water levels on Clear Lake and Gerber
reservoirs. The Bureau later notified the Service that it
intended to operate the project in compliance with the Biological Opinion.

Petitioners, two Oregon irrigation districts that receive
Klamath Project water and the operators of two ranches
within those districts, filed the present action against the
director and regional director of the Service and the Secretary of the Interior. Neither the Bureau nor any of its officials is named as defendant. The complaint asserts that the
Bureau "has been following essentially the same procedures
for storing and releasing water from Clear Lake and Gerber
reservoirs throughout the twentieth century," id., at 36; that
"[t]here is no scientifically or commercially available evidence
indicating that the populations of endangered suckers in
Clear Lake and Gerber reservoirs have declined, are declining, or will decline as a result" of the Bureau's operation of
the Klamath Project, id., at 37; that "[t]here is no commercially or scientifically available evidence indicating that the
restrictions on lake levels imposed in the Biological Opinion

Opinion of the Court
will have any beneficial effect on the . . . populations of suck-ers in Clear Lake and Gerber reservoirs," id., at 39; and that

the Bureau nonetheless "will abide by the restrictions im-posed by the Biological Opinion," id., at 32.

Petitioners' complaint included three claims for relief thatare relevant here. The first and second claims allege that
the Service's jeopardy determination with respect to ClearLake and Gerber reservoirs, and the ensuing imposition of
minimum water levels, violated $ 7 of the ESA, 16 U. S. C.$ 1536. The third claim is that the imposition of minimum
water elevations constituted an implicit determination ofcritical habitat for the suckers, which violated $ 4 of the
ESA, 16 U. S. C. $ 1533(b)(2), because it failed to take intoconsideration the designation's economic impact.

1 Each of

the claims also states that the relevant action violated theAPA's prohibition of agency action that is "arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordancewith law." 5 U. S. C. $ 706(2)(A).

The complaint asserts that petitioners' use of the reser-voirs and related waterways for "recreational, aesthetic and
commercial purposes, as well as for their primary sources ofirrigation water," will be "irreparably damaged" by the actions complained of, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, and that therestrictions on water delivery "recommended" by the Biological Opinion "adversely affect plaintiffs by substantially re-ducing the quantity of available irrigation water,"

id., at 40.In essence, petitioners claim a competing interest in the

water the Biological Opinion declares necessary for the pres-ervation of the suckers.

The District Court dismissed the complaint for lack ofjurisdiction. It concluded that petitioners did not have

1 Petitioners also raised a fourth claim: that the de facto designation of
critical habitat violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 83
Stat. 853, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 4332(2)(C), because it was not preceded
by preparation of an environmental assessment. The Court of Appeals'
dismissal of that claim has not been challenged.

standing because their "recreational, aesthetic, and commer-cial interests . . . do not fall within the zone of interests

sought to be protected by ESA." Id., at 28. The Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed. Bennett v. Plenert,
63 F. 3d 915 (1995). It held that the "zone of interests" testlimits the class of persons who may obtain judicial review
not only under the APA, but also under the citizen-suit provi-sion of the ESA, 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(g), and that "only plaintiffs
who allege an interest in the preservation of endangeredspecies fall within the zone of interests protected by the
ESA," 63 F. 3d, at 919 (emphasis in original). We grantedcertiorari. 517 U. S. 1102 (1996).

In this Court, petitioners raise two questions: first,whether the prudential standing rule known as the "zone of
interests" test applies to claims brought under the citizen-suit provision of the ESA; and second, if so, whether petitioners have standing under that test notwithstanding that theinterests they seek to vindicate are economic rather than
environmental. In this Court, the Government has made noeffort to defend the reasoning of the Court of Appeals. Instead, it advances three alternative grounds for affirmance:(1) that petitioners fail to meet the standing requirements
imposed by Article III of the Constitution; (2) that the ESA'scitizen-suit provision does not authorize judicial review of
the types of claims advanced by petitioners; and (3) that judi-cial review is unavailable under the APA because the Biological Opinion does not constitute final agency action.

II
We first turn to the question the Court of Appeals founddispositive: whether petitioners lack standing by virtue of

the zone-of-interests test. Although petitioners contendthat their claims lie both under the ESA and the APA, we
look first at the ESA because it may permit petitioners torecover their litigation costs, see 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(g)(4), and
because the APA by its terms independently authorizes re520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
view only when "there is no other adequate remedy in acourt," 5 U. S. C. $ 704.

The question of standing "involves both constitutional lim-itations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations on its exercise." Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 498
(1975) (citing Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249 (1953)). Tosatisfy the "case" or "controversy" requirement of Article

III, which is the "irreducible constitutional minimum" ofstanding, a plaintiff must, generally speaking, demonstrate
that he has suffered "injury in fact," that the injury is "fairlytraceable" to the actions of the defendant, and that the injury
will likely be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v.
Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U. S. 555, 560-561 (1992); Valley
Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U. S. 464, 471-472 (1982).
In addition to the immutable requirements of Article III,
"the federal judiciary has also adhered to a set of prudential
principles that bear on the question of standing." Id., at
474-475. Like their constitutional counterparts, these "judicially self-imposed limits on the exercise of federal jurisdiction," Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 751 (1984), are "founded
in concern about the proper--and properly limited--role of
the courts in a democratic society," Warth, supra, at 498; but
unlike their constitutional counterparts, they can be modified
or abrogated by Congress, see 422 U. S., at 501. Numbered
among these prudential requirements is the doctrine of particular concern in this case: that a plaintiff 's grievance must
arguably fall within the zone of interests protected or regulated by the statutory provision or constitutional guarantee
invoked in the suit. See Allen, supra, at 751; Valley Forge,
supra, at 474-475.

The "zone of interests" formulation was first employed in
Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc.
v. Camp, 397 U. S. 150 (1970). There, certain data processors sought to invalidate a ruling by the Comptroller of the
Currency authorizing national banks to sell data processing

Opinion of the Court
services on the ground that it violated, inter alia, $ 4 of theBank Service Corporation Act of 1962, 76 Stat. 1132, which

prohibited bank service corporations from engaging in "anyactivity other than the performance of bank services for
banks." The Court of Appeals had held that the banks'
data-processing competitors were without standing to chal-lenge the alleged violation of $ 4. In reversing, we stated

the applicable prudential standing requirement to be"whether the interest sought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within the zone of interests to be pro-tected or regulated by the statute or constitutional guarantee in question." Data Processing, supra, at 153. Data
Processing, and its companion case, Barlow v. Collins, 397
U. S. 159 (1970), applied the zone-of-interests test to suits
under the APA, but later cases have applied it also in suits
not involving review of federal administrative action, see
Dennis v. Higgins, 498 U. S. 439, 449 (1991); Boston Stock
Exchange v. State Tax Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 320-321, n. 3
(1977); see also Note, A Defense of the "Zone of Interests"
Standing Test, 1983 Duke L. J. 447, 455-456, and nn. 40-49
(1983) (cataloging lower court decisions), and have specifically listed it among other prudential standing requirements
of general application, see, e. g., Allen, supra, at 751; Valley
Forge, supra, at 474-475. We have made clear, however,
that the breadth of the zone of interests varies according

to the provisions of law at issue, so that what comes within
the zone of interests of a statute for purposes of obtaining
judicial review of administrative action under the " `generous
review provisions' " of the APA may not do so for other purposes, Clarke v. Securities Industry Assn., 479 U. S. 388,
400, n. 16 (1987) (quoting Data Processing, supra, at 156).

Congress legislates against the background of our prudential standing doctrine, which applies unless it is expressly
negated. See Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467
U. S. 340, 345-348 (1984). Cf. Associated Gen. Contractors
of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U. S. 519, 532-533, and n. 28

Opinion of the Court
(1983). The first question in the present case is whether theESA's citizen-suit provision, set forth in pertinent part in the

margin,2 negates the zone-of-interests test (or, perhaps moreaccurately, expands the zone of interests). We think it does.
The first operative portion of the provision says that "anyperson may commence a civil suit"--an authorization of remarkable breadth when compared with the language Con2 "(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection any person
may commence a civil suit on his own behalf--

"(A) to enjoin any person, including the United States and any other
governmental instrumentality or agency (to the extent permitted by the
eleventh amendment to the Constitution), who is alleged to be in violation
of any provision of this chapter or regulation issued under the authority
thereof; or. . . . .

"(C) against the Secretary where there is alleged a failure of the Secretary to perform any act or duty under section 1533 of this title which is
not discretionary with the Secretary.

"The district courts shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount
in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to enforce any such provision or regulation, or to order the Secretary to perform such act or duty,
as the case may be. . . .

"(2)(A) No action may be commenced under subparagraph (1)(A) of
this section--

"(i) prior to sixty days after written notice of the violation has been
given to the Secretary, and to any alleged violator of any such provision
or regulation;

"(ii) if the Secretary has commenced action to impose a penalty pursuant to subsection (a) of this section; or

"(iii) if the United States has commenced and is diligently prosecuting
a criminal action . . . to redress a violation of any such provision or
regulation.. . . . .

"(3)(B) In any such suit under this subsection in which the United
States is not a party, the Attorney General, at the request of the Secretary, may intervene on behalf of the United States as a matter of right.

"(4) The court, in issuing any final order in any suit brought pursuant
to paragraph (1) of this subsection, may award costs of litigation (including
reasonable attorney and expert witness fees) to any party, whenever the
court determines such award is appropriate." 16 U. S. C. $ 1540(g).

Opinion of the Court
gress ordinarily uses. Even in some other environmentalstatutes, Congress has used more restrictive formulations,

such as "[any person] having an interest which is or may beadversely affected," 33 U. S. C. $ 1365(g) (Clean Water Act);
see also 30 U. S. C. $ 1270(a) (Surface Mining Control and
Reclamation Act) (same); "[a]ny person suffering legalwrong," 15 U. S. C. $ 797(b)(5) (Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act); or "any person having a valid legalinterest which is or may be adversely affected . . . whenever
such action constitutes a case or controversy," 42 U. S. C.$ 9124(a) (Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion Act). And in
contexts other than the environment, Congress has often
been even more restrictive. In statutes concerning unfair
trade practices and other commercial matters, for example,
it has authorized suit only by "[a]ny person injured in his
business or property," 7 U. S. C. $ 2305(c); see also 15 U. S. C.

$ 72 (same), or only by "competitors, customers, or subsequent purchasers," $ 298(b).

Our readiness to take the term "any person" at face value
is greatly augmented by two interrelated considerations:
that the overall subject matter of this legislation is the environment (a matter in which it is common to think all persons
have an interest) and that the obvious purpose of the particular provision in question is to encourage enforcement by
so-called "private attorneys general"--evidenced by its elimination of the usual amount-in-controversy and diversity-ofcitizenship requirements, its provision for recovery of the
costs of litigation (including even expert witness fees), and
its reservation to the Government of a right of first refusal
to pursue the action initially and a right to intervene later.
Given these factors, we think the conclusion of expanded
standing follows a fortiori from our decision in Trafficante
v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U. S. 205 (1972), which held
that standing was expanded to the full extent permitted
under Article III by $ 810(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968,
82 Stat. 85, 42 U. S. C. $ 3610(a) (1986 ed.), that authorized

Opinion of the Court
"[a]ny person who claims to have been injured by a discrimi-natory housing practice" to sue for violations of the Act.

There also we relied on textual evidence of a statutoryscheme to rely on private litigation to ensure compliance
with the Act. See 409 U. S., at 210-211. The statutory lan-guage here is even clearer, and the subject of the legislation
makes the intent to permit enforcement by everyman evenmore plausible.

It is true that the plaintiffs here are seeking to preventapplication of environmental restrictions rather than to implement them. But the "any person" formulation applies toall the causes of action authorized by $ 1540(g)--not only to
actions against private violators of environmental restric-tions, and not only to actions against the Secretary asserting
underenforcment under $ 1533, but also to actions against theSecretary asserting overenforcement under $ 1533. As we
shall discuss below, the citizen-suit provision does favor envi-ronmentalists in that it covers all private violations of the
ESA but not all failures of the Secretary to meet his admin-istrative responsibilities; but there is no textual basis for
saying that its expansion of standing requirements appliesto environmentalists alone. The Court of Appeals therefore
erred in concluding that petitioners lacked standing underthe zone-of-interests test to bring their claims under the
ESA's citizen-suit provision.

III
The Government advances several alternative groundsupon which it contends we may affirm the dismissal of petitioners' suit. Because the District Court and the Court ofAppeals found the zone-of-interests ground to be dispositive,
these alternative grounds were not reached below. A re-spondent is entitled, however, to defend the judgment on any
ground supported by the record, see Ponte v. Real, 471 U. S.491, 500 (1985);

Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. v. Epstein,516 U. S. 367, 379, n. 5 (1996). The asserted grounds were

Opinion of the Court
raised below, and have been fully briefed and argued here;we deem it an appropriate exercise of our discretion to consider them now rather than leave them for disposition onremand.

A
The Government's first contention is that petitioners' com-plaint fails to satisfy the standing requirements imposed by

the "case" or "controversy" provision of Article III. This"irreducible constitutional minimum" of standing requires:
(1) that the plaintiff have suffered an "injury in fact"--aninvasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not con-jectural or hypothetical; (2) that there be a causal connection
between the injury and the conduct complained of--the in-jury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the
defendant, and not the result of the independent action ofsome third party not before the court; and (3) that it be
likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury willbe redressed by a favorable decision.

Defenders of Wild-life, 504 U. S., at 560-561.

Petitioners allege, among other things, that they currentlyreceive irrigation water from Clear Lake, that the Bureau
"will abide by the restrictions imposed by the BiologicalOpinion," App. to Pet. for Cert. 32, and that "[t]he restrictions on lake levels imposed in the Biological Opinion ad-versely affect [petitioners] by substantially reducing the
quantity of available irrigation water," id., at 40. The Gov-ernment contends, first, that these allegations fail to satisfy
the "injury in fact" element of Article III standing becausethey demonstrate only a diminution in the

aggregate amountof available water, and do not necessarily establish (absent

information concerning the Bureau's water allocation prac-tices) that

petitioners will receive less water. This conten-tion overlooks, however, the proposition that each element

of Article III standing "must be supported in the same wayas any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden

168 BENNETT v. SPEAR

Opinion of the Court
of proof, i. e., with the manner and degree of evidence re-quired at the successive stages of the litigation."

Defenders
of Wildlife, supra, at 561. Thus, while a plaintiff must "setforth" by affidavit or other evidence "specific facts" to survive a motion for summary judgment, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.
56(e), and must ultimately support any contested facts withevidence adduced at trial, "[a]t the pleading stage, general

factual allegations of injury resulting from the defendant'sconduct may suffice, for on a motion to dismiss we `presum[e]
that general allegations embrace those specific facts thatare necessary to support the claim.' "

Defenders of Wildlife, supra, at 561 (quoting Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S. 871, 889 (1990)). Given petitioners' allegation that the amount of available water will be reduced and
that they will be adversely affected thereby, it is easy to
presume specific facts under which petitioners will be injured--for example, the Bureau's distribution of the reduction pro rata among its customers. The complaint alleges
the requisite injury in fact.

The Government also contests compliance with the second
and third Article III standing requirements, contending that
any injury suffered by petitioners is neither "fairly traceable" to the Service's Biological Opinion, nor "redressable"
by a favorable judicial ruling, because the "action agency"
(the Bureau) retains ultimate responsibility for determining
whether and how a proposed action shall go forward. See
50 CFR $ 402.15(a) (1995) ("Following the issuance of a biological opinion, the Federal agency shall determine whether
and in what manner to proceed with the action in light of its
section 7 obligations and the Service's biological opinion").
"If petitioners have suffered injury," the Government contends, "the proximate cause of their harm is an (as yet unidentified) decision by the Bureau regarding the volume of
water allocated to petitioners, not the biological opinion
itself." Brief for Respondents 22. This wrongly equates
injury "fairly traceable" to the defendant with injury as to

520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

169Cite as: 520 U. S. 154 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
which the defendant's actions are the very last step in thechain of causation. While, as we have said, it does not suffice if the injury complained of is " `th[e] result [of] the independent action of some third party not before the court,' "
Defenders of Wildlife, supra, at 560-561 (emphasis added)
(quoting Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization,426 U. S. 26, 41-42 (1976)), that does not exclude injury

produced by determinative or coercive effect upon the actionof someone else.

By the Government's own account, while the Service's Bio-logical Opinion theoretically serves an "advisory function,"
51 Fed. Reg. 19928 (1986), in reality it has a powerful coer-cive effect on the action agency:

"The statutory scheme . . . presupposes that the biologi-cal opinion will play a central role in the action agency's
decisionmaking process, and that it will typically bebased on an administrative record that is fully adequate
for the action agency's decision insofar as ESA issues
are concerned. . . . [A] federal agency that chooses todeviate from the recommendations contained in a biological opinion bears the burden of `articulat[ing] in its ad-ministrative record its reasons for disagreeing with the
conclusions of a biological opinion.' 51 Fed. Reg. 19,956(1986). In the government's experience, action agencies
very rarely choose to engage in conduct that the Servicehas concluded is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species." Brief for Respondents 20-21.
What this concession omits to say, moreover, is that the action agency must not only articulate its reasons for disagreement (which ordinarily requires species and habitat investigations that are not within the action agency's expertise),
but that it runs a substantial risk if its (inexpert) reasons
turn out to be wrong. A Biological Opinion of the sort rendered here alters the legal regime to which the action agency
is subject. When it "offers reasonable and prudent alterna520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
170 BENNETT v. SPEAR

Opinion of the Court
tives" to the proposed action, a Biological Opinion must in-clude a so-called "Incidental Take Statement"--a written

statement specifying, among other things, those "measuresthat the [Service] considers necessary or appropriate to minimize [the action's impact on the affected species]" and the
"terms and conditions . . . that must be complied with by theFederal agency . . . to implement [such] measures." 16

U. S. C. $ 1536(b)(4). Any taking that is in compliance withthese terms and conditions "shall not be considered to be
a prohibited taking of the species concerned." $ 1536(o)(2).Thus, the Biological Opinion's Incidental Take Statement
constitutes a permit authorizing the action agency to "take"
the endangered or threatened species so long as it respects
the Service's "terms and conditions." The action agency is
technically free to disregard the Biological Opinion and proceed with its proposed action, but it does so at its own peril
(and that of its employees), for "any person" who knowingly
"takes" an endangered or threatened species is subject to
substantial civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment. See $$ 1540(a) and (b) (authorizing civil fines of up to
$25,000 per violation and criminal penalties of up to $50,000
and imprisonment for one year); see also Babbitt v. Sweet
Home Chapter, Communities for Great Ore., 515 U. S. 687,
708 (1995) (upholding interpretation of the term "take" to
include significant habitat degradation).

The Service itself is, to put it mildly, keenly aware of the
virtually determinative effect of its biological opinions. The
Incidental Take Statement at issue in the present case begins by instructing the reader that any taking of a listed
species is prohibited unless "such taking is in compliance
with this incidental take statement," and warning that "[t]he
measures described below are nondiscretionary, and must be
taken by [the Bureau]." App. 92-93. Given all of this, and
given petitioners' allegation that the Bureau had, until issuance of the Biological Opinion, operated the Klamath Project
in the same manner throughout the 20th century, it is not

520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

171Cite as: 520 U. S. 154 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
difficult to conclude that petitioners have met their burden--which is relatively modest at this stage of the litigation--of

alleging that their injury is "fairly traceable" to the Service'sBiological Opinion and that it will "likely" be redressed--
i. e., the Bureau will not impose such water level restric-tions--if the Biological Opinion is set aside.

B
Next, the Government contends that the ESA's citizen-suitprovision does not authorize judicial review of petitioners'

claims. The relevant portions of that provision provide that

"any person may commence a civil suit on his ownbehalf--

"(A) to enjoin any person, including the United Statesand any other governmental instrumentality or agency
. . . who is alleged to be in violation of any provisionof this chapter or regulation issued under the authority
thereof; or. . . . .
"(C) against the Secretary [of Commerce or the Inte-rior] where there is alleged a failure of the Secretary to
perform any act or duty under section 1533 of this titlewhich is not discretionary with the Secretary." 16
U. S. C. $ 1540(g)(1).
The Government argues that judicial review is not availableunder subsection (A) because the Secretary is not "in violation" of the ESA, and under subsection (C) because the Sec-retary has not failed to perform any nondiscretionary duty
under $ 1533. 1

Turning first to subsection (C): that it covers only viola-tions of $ 1533 is clear and unambiguous. Petitioners' first
and second claims, which assert that the Secretary has vio-lated $ 1536, are obviously not reviewable under this provision. However, as described above, the third claim alleges

520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
172 BENNETT v. SPEAR

Opinion of the Court
that the Biological Opinion implicitly determines criticalhabitat without complying with the mandate of $ 1533(b)(2)

that the Secretary "tak[e] into consideration the economicimpact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any

particular area as critical habitat." This claim does comewithin subsection (C).

The Government seeks to avoid this result by appealingto the limitation in subsection (C) that the duty sought to be
enforced not be "discretionary with the Secretary." But theterms of $ 1533(b)(2) are plainly those of obligation rather
than discretion: "The Secretary shall designate critical habi-tat, and make revisions thereto, . . . on the basis of the best
scientific data available and after taking into considerationthe economic impact, and any other relevant impact, of specifying any particular area as critical habitat." (Emphasisadded.) It is true that this is followed by the statement
that, except where extinction of the species is at issue, "[t]heSecretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he
determines that the benefits of such exclusion outweigh thebenefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat." Ibid. (emphasis added). However, the fact that theSecretary's ultimate decision is reviewable only for abuse of
discretion does not alter the categorical requirement that,in arriving at his decision, he "tak[e] into consideration the
economic impact, and any other relevant impact," and use"the best scientific data available."

Ibid. It is rudimen-tary administrative law that discretion as to the substance

of the ultimate decision does not confer discretion to ig-nore the required procedures of decisionmaking. See

SECv. Chenery Corp., 318 U. S. 80, 94-95 (1943). Since it is

the omission of these required procedures that petition-ers complain of, their $ 1533 claim is reviewable under

$ 1540(g)(1)(C). 2

Having concluded that petitioners' $ 1536 claims are notreviewable under subsection (C), we are left with the ques520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

173Cite as: 520 U. S. 154 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
tion whether they are reviewable under subsection (A),which authorizes injunctive actions against any person "who

is alleged to be in violation" of the ESA or its implementingregulations. The Government contends that the Secretary's
conduct in implementing or enforcing the ESA is not a "violation" of the ESA within the meaning of this provision. Inits view, $ 1540(g)(1)(A) is a means by which private parties

may enforce the substantive provisions of the ESA againstregulated parties--both private entities and Government
agencies--but is not an alternative avenue for judicial reviewof the Secretary's implementation of the statute. We agree.

The opposite contention is simply incompatible with the
existence of $ 1540(g)(1)(C), which expressly authorizes suit
against the Secretary, but only to compel him to perform a
nondiscretionary duty under $ 1533. That provision would
be superfluous--and, worse still, its careful limitation to

$ 1533 would be nullified--if $ 1540(g)(1)(A) permitted suit
against the Secretary for any "violation" of the ESA. It is
the " `cardinal principle of statutory construction' . . . [that]
[i]t is our duty `to give effect, if possible, to every clause and
word of a statute' . . . rather than to emasculate an entire
section." United States v. Menasche, 348 U. S. 528, 538
(1955) (quoting NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301
U. S. 1, 30 (1937), and Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U. S. 147,
152 (1883)). Application of that principle here clearly requires us to conclude that the term "violation" does not include the Secretary's failure to perform his duties as administrator of the ESA.

Moreover, the ESA uses the term "violation" elsewhere in
contexts in which it is most unlikely to refer to failure by the
Secretary or other federal officers and employees to perform
their duties in administering the ESA. Section 1540(a), for
example, authorizes the Secretary to impose substantial civil
penalties on "[a]ny person who knowingly violates . . . any
provision of [the ESA]," and entrusts the Secretary with the
power to "remi[t] or mitigat[e]" any such penalty. We know

520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
174 BENNETT v. SPEAR

Opinion of the Court
of no precedent for applying such a provision against thosewho administer (as opposed to those who are regulated by)

a substantive law. Nor do we think it likely that the statutemeant to subject the Secretary and his officers and employees to criminal liability under $ 1540(b), which makes it acrime for "[a]ny person [to] knowingly violat[e] any provision
of [the ESA]," or that $ 1540(e)(3), which authorizes law en-forcement personnel to "make arrests without a warrant for
any violation of [the ESA]," was intended to authorize war-rantless arrest of the Secretary or his delegates for "knowingly" failing to use the best scientific data available.Finally, interpreting the term "violation" to include any
errors on the part of the Secretary in administering the ESAwould effect a wholesale abrogation of the APA's "final
agency action" requirement. Any procedural default, evenone that had not yet resulted in a final disposition of the
matter at issue, would form the basis for a lawsuit. We areloathe to produce such an extraordinary regime without the
clearest of statutory direction, which is hardly present here.Viewed in the context of the entire statute, $ 1540(g)
(1)(A)'s reference to any "violation" of the ESA cannot beinterpreted to include the Secretary's maladministration of
the ESA. Petitioners' claims are not subject to judicial re-view under $ 1540(g)(1)(A).

IV
The foregoing analysis establishes that the principal stat-ute invoked by petitioners, the ESA, does authorize review

of their $ 1533 claim, but does not support their claims basedupon the Secretary's alleged failure to comply with $ 1536.
To complete our task, we must therefore inquire whetherthese $ 1536 claims may nonetheless be brought under the
Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes a court to"set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to
be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-wise not in accordance with law," 5 U. S. C. $ 706.

Opinion of the Court

A
No one contends (and it would not be maintainable) thatthe causes of action against the Secretary set forth in the

ESA's citizen-suit provision are exclusive, supplanting thoseprovided by the APA. The APA, by its terms, provides a
right to judicial review of all "final agency action for whichthere is no other adequate remedy in a court," $ 704, and
applies universally "except to the extent that--(1) statutespreclude judicial review; or (2) agency action is committed to
agency discretion by law," $ 701(a). Nothing in the ESA'scitizen-suit provision expressly precludes review under the
APA, nor do we detect anything in the statutory schemesuggesting a purpose to do so. And any contention that
the relevant provision of 16 U. S. C. $ 1536(a)(2) is discretion-ary would fly in the face of its text, which uses the imperative "shall."In determining whether the petitioners have standing
under the zone-of-interests test to bring their APA claims,we look not to the terms of the ESA's citizen-suit provision,
but to the substantive provisions of the ESA, the allegedviolations of which serve as the gravamen of the complaint.
See National Wildlife Federation, 497 U. S., at 886. Theclassic formulation of the zone-of-interests test is set forth
in Data Processing, 397 U. S., at 153: "whether the interestsought to be protected by the complainant is arguably within
the zone of interests to be protected or regulated by thestatute or constitutional guarantee in question." The Court
of Appeals concluded that this test was not met here, sincepetitioners are neither directly regulated by the ESA nor
seek to vindicate its overarching purpose of species preser-vation. That conclusion was error.

Whether a plaintiff 's interest is "arguably . . . protected. . . by the statute" within the meaning of the zone-ofinterests test is to be determined not by reference to theoverall purpose of the Act in question (here, species preservation), but by reference to the particular provision of law

520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN
176 BENNETT v. SPEAR

Opinion of the Court
upon which the plaintiff relies. It is difficult to understand
how the Ninth Circuit could have failed to see this from our
cases. In Data Processing itself, for example, we did not
require that the plaintiffs' suit vindicate the overall purpose
of the Bank Service Corporation Act of 1962, but found it
sufficient that their commercial interest was sought to be
protected by the anticompetition limitation contained in $ 4
of the Act--the specific provision which they alleged had
been violated. See Data Processing, supra, at 155-156. As
we said with the utmost clarity in National Wildlife Federation, "the plaintiff must establish that the injury he complains of . . . falls within the `zone of interests' sought to be
protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms
the legal basis for his complaint." 497 U. S., at 883 (emphasis added). See also Air Courier Conference v. Postal
Workers, 498 U. S. 517, 523-524 (1991) (same).

In the claims that we have found not to be covered by the
ESA's citizen-suit provision, petitioners allege a violation of

$ 7 of the ESA, 16 U. S. C. $ 1536, which requires, inter alia,
that each agency "use the best scientific and commercial data
available," $ 1536(a)(2). Petitioners contend that the available scientific and commercial data show that the continued
operation of the Klamath Project will not have a detrimental
impact on the endangered suckers, that the imposition of
minimum lake levels is not necessary to protect the fish, and
that by issuing a Biological Opinion which makes unsubstantiated findings to the contrary the defendants have acted
arbitrarily and in violation of $ 1536(a)(2). The obvious purpose of the requirement that each agency "use the best scientific and commercial data available" is to ensure that the
ESA not be implemented haphazardly, on the basis of speculation or surmise. While this no doubt serves to advance
the ESA's overall goal of species preservation, we think it
readily apparent that another objective (if not indeed the
primary one) is to avoid needless economic dislocation

520US1 Unit: $U37 [09-10-99 16:19:30] PAGES PGT: OPIN

177Cite as: 520 U. S. 154 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
produced by agency officials zealously but unintelligentlypursuing their environmental objectives. That economic

consequences are an explicit concern of the ESA is evidencedby $ 1536(h), which provides exemption from $ 1536(a)(2)'s
no-jeopardy mandate where there are no reasonable and pru-dent alternatives to the agency action and the benefits of the
agency action clearly outweigh the benefits of any alterna-tives. We believe the "best scientific and commercial data"
provision is similarly intended, at least in part, to preventuneconomic (because erroneous) jeopardy determinations.
Petitioners' claim that they are victims of such a mistakeis plainly within the zone of interests that the provision
protects. B

The Government contends that petitioners may not obtainjudicial review under the APA on the theory that the Biological Opinion does not constitute "final agency action," 5U. S. C. $ 704, because it does not conclusively determine the
manner in which Klamath Project water will be allocated:

"Whatever the practical likelihood that the [Bureau]would adopt the reasonable and prudent alternatives

(including the higher lake levels) identified by the Serv-ice, the Bureau was not legally obligated to do so. Even
if the Bureau decided to adopt the higher lake levels,moreover, nothing in the biological opinion would constrain the [Bureau's] discretion as to how the availablewater should be allocated among potential users."
Brief for Respondents 33.
This confuses the question whether the Secretary's actionis final with the separate question whether petitioners' harm

is "fairly traceable" to the Secretary's action (a questionwe have already resolved against the Government, see Part
III-A, supra). As a general matter, two conditions must besatisfied for agency action to be "final": First, the action must

Opinion of the Court
mark the "consummation" of the agency's decisionmakingprocess, Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman

S. S. Corp., 333 U. S. 103, 113 (1948)--it must not be of amerely tentative or interlocutory nature. And second, the
action must be one by which "rights or obligations have beendetermined," or from which "legal consequences will flow,"
Port of Boston Marine Terminal Assn. v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatlantic, 400 U. S. 62, 71 (1970). It is uncontestedthat the first requirement is met here; and the second is met

because, as we have discussed above, the Biological Opinionand accompanying Incidental Take Statement alter the legal
regime to which the action agency is subject, authorizing itto take the endangered species if (but only if) it complies
with the prescribed conditions. In this crucial respect thepresent case is different from the cases upon which the Government relies, Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788(1992), and

Dalton v. Specter, 511 U. S. 462 (1994). In theformer case, the agency action in question was the Secretary

of Commerce's presentation to the President of a report tab-ulating the results of the decennial census; our holding that
this did not constitute "final agency action" was premised onthe observation that the report carried "no direct consequences" and served "more like a tentative recommendationthan a final and binding determination." 505 U. S., at 798.
And in the latter case, the agency action in question wassubmission to the President of base closure recommendations
by the Secretary of Defense and the Defense Base Closureand Realignment Commission; our holding that this was not
"final agency action" followed from the fact that the recom-mendations were in no way binding on the President, who
had absolute discretion to accept or reject them. 511 U. S.,at 469-471. Unlike the reports in Franklin and Dalton,
which were purely advisory and in no way affected the legalrights of the relevant actors, the Biological Opinion at issue
here has direct and appreciable legal consequences.

The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the DistrictCourt's dismissal of petitioners' claims for lack of jurisdiction. Petitioners' complaint alleges facts sufficient to meetthe requirements of Article III standing, and none of their
ESA claims is precluded by the zone-of-interests test. Peti-tioners' $ 1533 claim is reviewable under the ESA's citizensuit provision, and petitioners' remaining claims are review-able under the APA.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion.

It is so ordered.

appeal from the united states district court forthe district of columbia

No. 95-992. Argued October 7, 1996--Decided March 31, 1997
Sections 4 and 5 of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (Cable Act) require cable television systems to dedicate some of their channels to local broadcast television stations. In
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622 (Turner), this
Court held these so-called "must-carry" provisions to be subject to intermediate First Amendment scrutiny under United States v. O'Brien,
391 U. S. 367, 377, whereby a content-neutral regulation will be sustained if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the
suppression of free speech and does not burden substantially more
speech than necessary to further those interests. However, because a
plurality considered the record as then developed insufficient to determine whether the provisions would in fact alleviate real harms in a
direct and material way and would not burden substantially more
speech than necessary, the Court remanded the case. After 18 months
of additional factfinding, the District Court granted summary judgment
for the Government and other appellees, concluding that the expanded
record contained substantial evidence supporting Congress' predictive
judgment that the must-carry provisions further important governmental interests in preserving cable carriage of local broadcast stations, and
that the provisions are narrowly tailored to promote those interests.
This direct appeal followed.

Held: The judgment is affirmed.
910 F. Supp. 734, affirmed.

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to
all but a portion of Part II-A-1, concluding that the must-carry provisions are consistent with the First Amendment:

1. The record as it now stands supports Congress' predictive judgment that the must-carry provisions further important governmental
interests. Pp. 189-196, 208-213.

(a) This Court decided in Turner, 512 U. S., at 662, and now reaffirms, that must-carry was designed to serve three interrelated, important governmental interests: (1) preserving the benefits of free,
over-the-air local broadcast television, (2) promoting the widespread

Syllabus
dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources, and (3) promoting fair competition in the television programming market. Protecting noncable households from loss of regular broadcasting service
due to competition from cable systems is important because 40 percent
of American households still rely on over-the-air signals for television
programming. See, e. g., id., at 663. Moreover, there is a corresponding governmental purpose of the highest order in ensuring public access
to a multiplicity of information sources, ibid., and the Government has
an interest in eliminating restraints on fair competition even when the
regulated parties are engaged in protected expressive activity, ibid.
The parties' attempts to recast these interests in forms more readily
proved--i. e., the Government's claim that the loss of even a few broadcast stations is critically important and appellants' assertions that Congress' interest in preserving broadcasting is not implicated absent a
showing that the entire industry would fail, and that its interest in
assuring a multiplicity of information sources extends only as far as
preserving a minimum amount of broadcast service--are inconsistent
with Congress' stated interests in enacting must-carry. Pp. 189-194.

(b) Even in the realm of First Amendment questions where Congress must base its conclusions upon substantial evidence, courts must
accord deference to its findings as to the harm to be avoided and to the
remedial measures adopted for that end, lest the traditional legislative
authority to make predictive judgments when enacting nationwide regulatory policy be infringed. See, e. g., Turner, 512 U. S., at 665 (plurality opinion). The courts' sole obligation is to assure that, in formulating
its judgments, Congress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence. Id., at 666. Pp. 195-196.

(c) The must-carry provisions serve important governmental interests "in a direct and effective way." Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U. S. 781, 800. Congress could reasonably conclude from the substantial body of evidence before it that attaining cable carriage would
be of increasing importance to ensuring broadcasters' economic viability,
and that, absent legislative action, the free local off-air broadcast system
was endangered. Such evidence amply indicated that: a broadcast station's viability depends to a material extent on its ability to secure cable
carriage and thereby to increase its audience size and revenues; broadcast stations had fallen into bankruptcy, curtailed their operations, and
suffered serious reductions in operating revenues as a result of adverse
carriage decisions by cable systems; stations without carriage encountered severe difficulties obtaining financing for operations; and the potentially adverse impact of losing carriage was increasing as the growth
of "clustering"--i. e., the acquisition of as many cable systems in a given

market as possible--gave multiple system operators centralized control
over more local markets. The reasonableness of the congressional
judgment is confirmed by evidence assembled on remand that clearly
establishes the importance of cable to broadcast stations and suggests
that expansion in the cable industry was harming broadcasting. Although the record also contains evidence to support a contrary conclusion, the question is not whether Congress was correct as an objective matter, but whether the legislative conclusion was reasonable
and supported by substantial evidence. Turner, supra, at 665-666.
Where, as here, that standard is satisfied, summary judgment is appropriate regardless of whether the evidence is in conflict. Cf., e. g.,
American Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490, 523.
Pp. 208-213.

2. The must-carry provisions do not burden substantially more speech
than is necessary to further the governmental interests they promote.
See, e. g., Turner, supra, at 662. Appellants say must-carry's burden is
great, but significant evidence adduced on remand indicates the vast
majority of cable operators have not been affected in a significant manner. This includes evidence that: such operators have satisfied their
must-carry obligations 87 percent of the time using previously unused
channel capacity; 94.5 percent of the cable systems nationwide have not
had to drop any programming; the remaining 5.5 percent have had to
drop an average of only 1.22 services from their programming; operators
nationwide carry 99.8 percent of the programming they carried before
must-carry; and broadcast stations gained carriage on only 5,880 cable
channels as a result of must-carry. The burden imposed by must-carry
is congruent to the benefits it affords because, as appellants concede,
most of those 5,880 stations would be dropped in its absence. Mustcarry therefore is narrowly tailored to preserve a multiplicity of broadcast stations for the 40 percent of American households without cable.
Cf., e. g., Ward, supra, at 799, n. 7. The possibilities that must-carry
will prohibit dropping a broadcaster even if the cable operator has
no anticompetitive motives or if the broadcaster would survive without cable access are not so prevalent that they render must-carry substantially overbroad. This Court's precedents establish that it will
not invalidate the preferred remedial scheme merely because some alternative solution is marginally less intrusive on a speaker's First
Amendment interests. In any event, a careful examination of each of
appellants' suggestions--a more limited set of must-carry obligations
modeled on those earlier used by the Federal Communications Commission; use of so-called A/B switches, giving consumers a choice of both
cable and broadcast signals; a leased-access regime requiring cable oper520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
ators to set aside channels for both broadcasters and cable programmers
to use at a regulated price; subsidies for broadcasters; and a system of
antitrust enforcement or an administrative complaint procedure--reveals that none of them is an adequate alternative to must-carry for
achieving the Government's aims. Because it has received only the
most glancing attention from the District Court and the parties, prudence dictates that this Court not reach appellants' challenge to the
Cable Act provision requiring carriage of low power stations in certain
circumstances. Pp. 213-225.

Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Stevens,
and Justice Souter, and by Justice Breyer in part, concluded in
Part II-A-1 that the expanded record contains substantial evidence to
support Congress' conclusion that enactment of must-carry was justified
by a real threat to local broadcasting's economic health. The harm
Congress feared was that broadcast stations dropped or denied cable
carriage would be at a serious risk of financial difficulty, see Turner,
512 U. S., at 667, and would deteriorate to a substantial degree or fail
altogether, id., at 666. The evidence before Congress, as supplemented
on remand, indicated, inter alia, that: cable operators had considerable
and growing market power over local video programming markets in
1992; the industry's expanding horizontal and vertical integration would
give cable operators increasing ability and incentive to drop, or reposition to less-viewed channels, independent local broadcast stations, which
competed with the operators for audiences and advertisers; significant
numbers of local broadcasters had already been dropped; and, absent
must-carry, additional stations would be deleted, repositioned, or not
carried in an attempt to capture their local advertising revenues to offset waning cable subscription growth. The reasonableness of Congress'
predictive judgment is also supported by additional evidence, developed
on remand, indicating that the percentage of local broadcasters not carried on the typical cable system is increasing, and that the growth of
cable systems' market power has proceeded apace, better enabling them
to sell their own reach to potential advertisers, and to deny broadcast
competitors access to all or substantially all the cable homes in a market
area. Pp. 196-208.

Justice Breyer, although agreeing that the statute satisfies the intermediate scrutiny standard set forth in United States v. O'Brien, 391
U. S. 367, 377, rested his conclusion not upon the principal opinion's analysis of the statute's efforts to promote fair competition, but rather upon
its discussion of the statute's other two objectives. He therefore joined
the opinion of the Court except insofar as Part II-A-1 relies on an
anticompetitive rationale. Pp. 225-229.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court,except as to a portion of Part II-A-1.

Sections 4 and 5 of the Cable Television Consumer Protec-tion and Competition Act of 1992 require cable television systems to dedicate some of their channels to local broadcasttelevision stations. Earlier in this case, we held the socalled "must-carry" provisions to be content-neutral restric-tions on speech, subject to intermediate First Amendment
scrutiny under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377(1968). A plurality of the Court considered the record as
then developed insufficient to determine whether the provi-sions were narrowly tailored to further important governmental interests, and we remanded the case to the DistrictCourt for the District of Columbia for additional factfinding.

On appeal from the District Court's grant of summaryjudgment for appellees, the case now presents the two questions left open during the first appeal: First, whether therecord as it now stands supports Congress' predictive judgment that the must-carry provisions further important gov-ernmental interests; and second, whether the provisions do
not burden substantially more speech than necessary tofurther those interests. We answer both questions in the
affirmative, and conclude the must-carry provisions areconsistent with the First Amendment.

I
An outline of the Cable Act, Congress' purposes in adopt-ing it, and the facts of the case are set out in detail in our

first opinion, see Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,512 U. S. 622 (1994)

(Turner), and a more abbreviated sum-mary will suffice here. Soon after Congress enacted the

Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Actof 1992 (Cable Act), Pub. L. 102-385, 106 Stat. 1460, appellants brought suit against the United States and the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC) (both referred to here
as the Government) in the United States District Court for

186 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of the Court
the District of Columbia, challenging the constitutionalityof the must-carry provisions under the First Amendment.

The three-judge District Court, in a divided opinion, grantedsummary judgment for the Government and intervenordefendants. A majority of the court sustained the mustcarry provisions under the intermediate standard of scru-tiny set forth in

United States v. O'Brien, supra, concluding
the must-carry provisions were content-neutral "industry-specific antitrust and fair trade" legislation narrowly tailored

to preserve local broadcasting beset by monopoly power inmost cable systems, growing concentration in the cable industry, and concomitant risks of programming decisions
driven by anticompetitive policies. 819 F. Supp. 32, 40,
45-47 (1993).

On appeal, we agreed with the District Court that mustcarry does not "distinguish favored speech from disfavored
speech on the basis of the ideas or views expressed," 512
U. S., at 643, but is a content-neutral regulation designed "to
prevent cable operators from exploiting their economic
power to the detriment of broadcasters," and "to ensure that
all Americans, especially those unable to subscribe to cable,
have access to free television programming--whatever its
content." Id., at 649. We held that, under the intermediate
level of scrutiny applicable to content-neutral regulations,
must-carry would be sustained if it were shown to further
an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated
to the suppression of free speech, provided the incidental
restrictions did not " `burden substantially more speech than
is necessary to further' " those interests. Id., at 662 (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 799 (1989)).
Although we "ha[d] no difficulty concluding" the interests
must-carry was designed to serve were important in the abstract, 512 U. S., at 663, a four-Justice plurality concluded
genuine issues of material fact remained regarding whether
"the economic health of local broadcasting is in genuine jeopardy and in need of the protections afforded by must-carry,"

Opinion of the Court
and whether must-carry " `burden[s] substantially morespeech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.' " Id., at 665 (quoting Ward, supra, at 799).
Justice Stevens would have found the statute valid on the
record then before us; he agreed to remand the case to ensure a judgment of the Court, and the case was returnedto the District Court for further proceedings. 512 U. S., at

673-674 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judg-ment);

id., at 667-668.
The District Court oversaw another 18 months of fac-tual development on remand "yielding a record of tens of

thousands of pages" of evidence, Turner Broadcasting v.
FCC, 910 F. Supp. 734, 755 (1995), comprised of materials acquired during Congress' three years of pre-enactment hearings, see Turner, supra, at 632-634, as well as additional
expert submissions, sworn declarations and testimony, and
industry documents obtained on remand. Upon consideration of the expanded record, a divided panel of the District
Court again granted summary judgment to appellees. 910
F. Supp., at 751. The majority determined "Congress drew
reasonable inferences" from substantial evidence before it to
conclude that "in the absence of must-carry rules, `significant' numbers of broadcast stations would be refused carriage." Id., at 742. The court found Congress drew on
studies and anecdotal evidence indicating "cable operators
had already dropped, refused to carry, or adversely repositioned significant numbers of local broadcasters," and suggesting that in the vast majority of cases the broadcasters
were not restored to carriage in their prior position. Ibid.
Noting evidence in the record before Congress and the testimony of experts on remand, id., at 743, the court decided the
noncarriage problem would grow worse without must-carry
because cable operators had refrained from dropping broadcast stations during Congress' investigation and the pendency of this litigation, id., at 742-743, and possessed increasing incentives to use their growing economic power to

Opinion of the Court
capture broadcasters' advertising revenues and promote af-filiated cable programmers,

ibid. The court concluded "substantial evidence before Congress" supported the predictivejudgment that a local broadcaster denied carriage "would

suffer financial harm and possible ruin." Id., at 743-744. It
cited evidence that adverse carriage actions decrease broad-casters' revenues by reducing audience levels,

id., at 744-745,
and evidence that the invalidation of the FCC's prior must-carry regulations had contributed to declining growth in the

broadcast industry, id., at 744, and n. 34.The court held must-carry to be narrowly tailored to promote the Government's legitimate interests. It found the
effects of must-carry on cable operators to be minimal, noting evidence that: most cable systems had not been required
to add any broadcast stations since the rules were adopted;
only 1.2 percent of all cable channels had been devoted to
broadcast stations added because of must-carry; and the burden was likely to diminish as channel capacity expanded in
the future. Id., at 746-747. The court proceeded to consider a number of alternatives to must-carry that appellants
had proposed, including: a leased-access regime, under which
cable operators would be required to set aside channels for
both broadcasters and cable programmers to use at a regulated price; use of so-called A/B switches, giving consumers
a choice of both cable and broadcast signals; a more limited
set of must-carry obligations modeled on those earlier used
by the FCC; and subsidies for broadcasters. The court rejected each in turn, concluding that "even assuming that [the
alternatives] would be less burdensome" on cable operators'
First Amendment interests, they "are not in any respect as
effective in achieving the government's [interests]." Id., at
747. Judge Jackson would have preferred a trial to summary judgment, but concurred in the judgment of the court.
Id., at 751-754.

Judge Williams dissented. His review of the record, and
particularly evidence concerning growth in the number of

Opinion of the Court
broadcasters, industry advertising revenues, and per-stationprofits during the period without must-carry, led him to conclude the broadcast industry as a whole would not be " `seri-ously jeopardized' " in the absence of must-carry. Id., at
759-767. Judge Williams acknowledged the Governmenthad a legitimate interest in preventing anticompetitive behavior, and accepted that cable operators have incentives todiscriminate against broadcasters in favor of their own vertically integrated cable programming. Id., at 772, 775, 779.He would have granted summary judgment for appellants
nonetheless on the ground must-carry is not narrowly tai-lored. In his view, must-carry constitutes a significant
(though "diminish[ing]," id., at 782) burden on cable opera-tors' and programmers' rights, ibid., and the Cable Act's
must-carry provisions suppress more speech than necessarybecause "less-restrictive" alternatives exist to accomplish
the Government's legitimate objectives, id., at 782-789.This direct appeal followed. See 47 U. S. C. $ 555(c)(1); 28
U. S. C. $ 1253. We noted probable jurisdiction, 516 U. S.1110 (1996), and we now affirm.

II
We begin where the plurality ended in Turner, applyingthe standards for intermediate scrutiny enunciated in

O'Brien. A content-neutral regulation will be sustainedunder the First Amendment if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speechand does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests. O'Brien, 391 U. S., at 377.As noted in

Turner, must-carry was designed to serve "threeinterrelated interests: (1) preserving the benefits of free,

over-the-air local broadcast television, (2) promoting thewidespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity
of sources, and (3) promoting fair competition in the marketfor television programming." 512 U. S., at 662. We decided
then, and now reaffirm, that each of those is an important

Opinion of the Court
governmental interest. We have been most explicit in hold-ing that " `protecting noncable households from loss of regular television broadcasting service due to competition fromcable systems' is an important federal interest."

Id., at 663
(quoting Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691,
714 (1984)). Forty percent of American households continueto rely on over-the-air signals for television programming.

Despite the growing importance of cable television and alter-native technologies, " `broadcasting is demonstrably a principal source of information and entertainment for a great partof the Nation's population.' "

Turner, supra, at 663 (quoting
United States v. Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U. S. 157, 177
(1968)). We have identified a corresponding "governmental
purpose of the highest order" in ensuring public access to "a
multiplicity of information sources," 512 U. S., at 663. And
it is undisputed the Government has an interest in "eliminating restraints on fair competition . . . , even when the individuals or entities subject to particular regulations are engaged
in expressive activity protected by the First Amendment."
Id., at 664.

On remand, and again before this Court, both sides have
advanced new interpretations of these interests in an attempt to recast them in forms "more readily proven." 910
F. Supp., at 759 (Williams, J., dissenting). The Government
downplays the importance of showing a risk to the broadcast
industry as a whole and suggests the loss of even a few
broadcast stations "is a matter of critical importance." Tr.
of Oral Arg. 23. Taking the opposite approach, appellants
argue Congress' interest in preserving broadcasting is not
implicated unless it is shown the industry as a whole would
fail without must-carry, Brief for Appellant National Cable
Television Association, Inc. 18-23 (NCTA Brief); Brief for
Appellant Time Warner Entertainment Co., L. P. 8-10 (Time
Warner Brief), and suggest Congress' legitimate interest in
"assuring that the public has access to a multiplicity of information sources," Turner, supra, at 663, extends only as far

Opinion of the Court
as preserving "a minimum amount of television broadcastservice," Time Warner Brief 28; NCTA Brief 40; Reply Brief

for Appellant NCTA 12.These alternative formulations are inconsistent with Congress' stated interests in enacting must-carry. The congressional findings do not reflect concern that, absent must-carry,"a few voices," Tr. of Oral Arg. 23, would be lost from the

television marketplace. In explicit factual findings, Con-gress expressed clear concern that the "marked shift in market share from broadcast television to cable television serv-ices," Cable Act $ 2(a)(13), note following 47 U. S. C. $ 521,
resulting from increasing market penetration by cable services, as well as the expanding horizontal concentration and
vertical integration of cable operators, combined to give
cable systems the incentive and ability to delete, reposition,
or decline carriage to local broadcasters in an attempt to
favor affiliated cable programmers. $$ 2a(2)-(5), (15). Congress predicted that "absent the reimposition of [must-carry],
additional local broadcast signals will be deleted, repositioned, or not carried," $ 2(a)(15); see also $ 2(a)(8)(D), with
the end result that "the economic viability of free local
broadcast television and its ability to originate quality local
programming will be seriously jeopardized," $ 2(a)(16).

At the same time, Congress was under no illusion that
there would be a complete disappearance of broadcast television nationwide in the absence of must-carry. Congress recognized broadcast programming (and network programming
in particular) "remains the most popular programming on
cable systems," $ 2(a)(19). Indeed, reflecting the popularity
and strength of some broadcasters, Congress included in the
Cable Act a provision permitting broadcasters to charge
cable systems for carriage of the broadcasters' signals. See

$ 6, codified at 47 U. S. C. $ 325. Congress was concerned
not that broadcast television would disappear in its entirety
without must-carry, but that without it, "significant numbers
of broadcast stations will be refused carriage on cable sys520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tems," and those "broadcast stations denied carriage will
either deteriorate to a substantial degree or fail altogether."
512 U. S., at 666. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 102-628, p. 51
(1992) (House Report) (the absence of must-carry "will result
in a weakening of the over-the-air television industry and a
reduction in competition"); id., at 64 ("The Committee wishes
to make clear that its concerns are not limited to a situation
where stations are dropped wholesale by large numbers of
cable systems"); S. Rep. No. 102-92, p. 62 (1991) (Senate Report) ("Without congressional action, . . . the role of local
television broadcasting in our system of communications will
steadily decline . . ."); see also Brief for Federal Appellees in
Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, No. 93-44, p. 32,
n. 22 (the question is not whether "the evidence shows that
broadcast television is likely to be totally eliminated" but
"whether the broadcast services available to viewers [without cable] are likely to be reduced to a significant extent,
because of either loss of some stations altogether or curtailment of services by others").

Nor do the congressional findings support appellants' suggestion that legitimate legislative goals would be satisfied by
the preservation of a rump broadcasting industry providing
a minimum of broadcast service to Americans without cable.
We have noted that " `it has long been a basic tenet of national communications policy that "the widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic
sources is essential to the welfare of the public." ' " Turner,
512 U. S., at 663-664 (quoting United States v. Midwest
Video Corp., 406 U. S. 649, 668, n. 27 (1972) (plurality opinion), in turn quoting Associated Press v. United States, 326
U. S. 1, 20 (1945)); see also FCC v. WNCN Listeners Guild,
450 U. S. 582, 594 (1981). " `[I]ncreasing the number of outlets for community self-expression' " represents a " `longestablished regulatory goa[l] in the field of television broadcasting.' " United States v. Midwest Video Corp., supra, at

Opinion of the Court
667-668 (plurality opinion). Consistent with this objective,
the Cable Act's findings reflect a concern that congressional
action was necessary to prevent "a reduction in the number
of media voices available to consumers." $ 2(a)(4). Congress identified a specific interest in "ensuring [the] continuation" of "the local origination of [broadcast] programming,"

$ 2(a)(10), an interest consistent with its larger purpose of
promoting multiple types of media, $ 2(a)(6), and found
must-carry necessary "to serve the goals" of the original
Communications Act of 1934 of "providing a fair, efficient,
and equitable distribution of broadcast services," $ 2(a)(9).
In short, Congress enacted must-carry to "preserve the existing structure of the Nation's broadcast television medium
while permitting the concomitant expansion and development of cable television." 512 U. S., at 652.

Although Congress set no definite number of broadcast
stations sufficient for these purposes, the Cable Act's requirement that all cable operators with more than 12 channels set aside one-third of their channel capacity for local
broadcasters, $ 4, 47 U. S. C. $ 534(b)(1)(B), refutes the notion
that Congress contemplated preserving only a bare minimum
of stations. Congress' evident interest in "preserv[ing] the
existing structure," 512 U. S., at 652, of the broadcast industry discloses a purpose to prevent any significant reduction
in the multiplicity of broadcast programming sources available to noncable households. To the extent the appellants
question the substantiality of the Government's interest in
preserving something more than a minimum number of stations in each community, their position is meritless. It is for
Congress to decide how much local broadcast television
should be preserved for noncable households, and the validity of its determination " `does not turn on a judge's agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning' . . . the
degree to which [the Government's] interests should be promoted." Ward, 491 U. S., at 800 (quoting United States v.

The dissent proceeds on the assumption that must-carry is
designed solely to be (and can only be justified as) a measure
to protect broadcasters from cable operators' anticompetitive
behavior. See post, at 251, 253, 258. Federal policy, however, has long favored preserving a multiplicity of broadcast
outlets regardless of whether the conduct that threatens it
is motivated by anticompetitive animus or rises to the level
of an antitrust violation. See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v.
Crisp, 467 U. S., at 714; United States v. Midwest Video
Corp., supra, at 665 (plurality opinion) (FCC regulations
"were . . . avowedly designed to guard broadcast services
from being undermined by unregulated [cable] growth"); National Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U. S. 190, 223-
224 (1943) (" `While many of the network practices raise serious questions under the antitrust laws, . . . [i]t is not [the
FCC's] function to apply the antitrust laws as such' " (quoting
FCC Report on Chain Broadcasting Regulations (1941))).
Broadcast television is an important source of information to
many Americans. Though it is but one of many means for
communication, by tradition and use for decades now it has
been an essential part of the national discourse on subjects
across the whole broad spectrum of speech, thought, and expression. See Turner, supra, at 663; FCC v. National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, 436 U. S. 775, 783 (1978) (referring to studies "showing the dominant role of television
stations . . . as sources of local news and other information").
Congress has an independent interest in preserving a multiplicity of broadcasters to ensure that all households have access to information and entertainment on an equal footing
with those who subscribe to cable.

Opinion of the Court

A
On our earlier review, we were constrained by the state ofthe record to assessing the importance of the Government's

asserted interests when "viewed in the abstract," Turner,512 U. S., at 663. The expanded record now permits us to
consider whether the must-carry provisions were designedto address a real harm, and whether those provisions will
alleviate it in a material way. Id., at 663-664. We turnfirst to the harm or risk which prompted Congress to act.
The Government's assertion that "the economic health oflocal broadcasting is in genuine jeopardy and in need of the
protections afforded by must-carry," id., at 664-665, rests ontwo component propositions: First, "significant numbers of
broadcast stations will be refused carriage on cable systems"absent must-carry, id., at 666. Second, "the broadcast stations denied carriage will either deteriorate to a substantialdegree or fail altogether."

Ibid.In reviewing the constitutionality of a statute, "courts

must accord substantial deference to the predictive judg-ments of Congress." Id., at 665. Our sole obligation is "to
assure that, in formulating its judgments, Congress hasdrawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence."
Id., at 666. As noted in the first appeal, substantiality is tobe measured in this context by a standard more deferential
than we accord to judgments of an administrative agency.See

id., at 666-667; id., at 670, n. 1 (Stevens, J., concurringin part and concurring in judgment). We owe Congress'

findings deference in part because the institution "is far bet-ter equipped than the judiciary to `amass and evaluate the
vast amounts of data' bearing upon" legislative questions.

dence"); Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. DemocraticNational Committee, 412 U. S. 94, 103 (1973). This principle has special significance in cases, like this one, involvingcongressional judgments concerning regulatory schemes of
inherent complexity and assessments about the likely inter-action of industries undergoing rapid economic and technological change. Though different in degree, the deference toCongress is in one respect akin to deference owed to administrative agencies because of their expertise. See FCC v.
National Citizens Comm. for Broadcasting, supra, at 814("[C]omplete factual support in the record for the [FCC's]

judgment or prediction is not possible or required; `a forecastof the direction in which future public interest lies necessarily involves deductions based on the expert knowledge of theagency' ");

United States v. Midwest Video Corp., 406 U. S.,at 674 (it was "beyond the competence of the Court of Appeals itself to assess the relative risks and benefits" of FCCpolicy, so long as that policy was based on findings supported
by evidence). This is not the sum of the matter, however.We owe Congress' findings an additional measure of deference out of respect for its authority to exercise the legisla-tive power. Even in the realm of First Amendment questions where Congress must base its conclusions uponsubstantial evidence, deference must be accorded to its findings as to the harm to be avoided and to the remedial meas-ures adopted for that end, lest we infringe on traditional

legislative authority to make predictive judgments whenenacting nationwide regulatory policy.

We have no difficulty in finding a substantial basis to sup-port Congress' conclusion that a real threat justified enactment of the must-carry provisions. We examine first theevidence before Congress and then the further evidence presented to the District Court on remand to supplement thecongressional determination.

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
As to the evidence before Congress, there was specific sup-port for its conclusion that cable operators had considerable

and growing market power over local video programmingmarkets. Cable served at least 60 percent of American
households in 1992, see Cable Act $ 2(a)(3), and evidence indicated cable market penetration was projected to grow be-yond 70 percent. See Cable TV Consumer Protection Act

of 1991: Hearing on S. 12 before the Subcommittee on Com-munications of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science,
and Transportation, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 259 (1991) (state-ment of Edward O. Fritts) (App. 1253); see also Defendants'
Joint Statement of Evidence Before Congress |||| 9, 10
(JSCR) (App. 1252-1253). As Congress noted, $ 2(a)(2),
cable operators possess a local monopoly over cable households. Only one percent of communities are served by more
than one cable system, JSCR |||| 31-40 (App. 1262-1266).
Even in communities with two or more cable systems, in the
typical case each system has a local monopoly over its subscribers. See Comments of NAB before the FCC on MM
Docket No. 85-349, || 47 (Apr. 25, 1986) (App. 26). Cable
operators thus exercise "control over most (if not all) of

the television programming that is channeled into the subscriber's home [and] can thus silence the voice of competing
speakers with a mere flick of the switch." Turner, 512
U. S., at 656.

Evidence indicated the structure of the cable industry
would give cable operators increasing ability and incentive
to drop local broadcast stations from their systems, or reposition them to a less-viewed channel. Horizontal concentration was increasing as a small number of multiple system
operators (MSO's) acquired large numbers of cable systems
nationwide. $ 2(a)(4). The trend was accelerating, giving
the MSO's increasing market power. In 1985, the 10 largest
MSO's controlled cable systems serving slightly less than 42
percent of all cable subscribers; by 1989, the figure was
nearly 54 percent. JSCR || 77 (App. 1282); Competitive

Rights of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101stCong., 1st Sess., 74 (1990) (Hearing on Competitive Problems

As Congress was aware, many MSO's owned or had affilia-tion agreements with cable programmers. $ 2(a)(5); Senate
Report, at 24-29. Evidence indicated that before 1984 cableoperators had equity interests in 38 percent of cable programming networks. In the late 1980's, 64 percent of new
cable programmers were held in vertical ownership. JSCR

favor their affiliated programming services," $ 2(a)(5); Senate

conceded to be reasonable. See 910 F. Supp., at 775. Extensive testimony indicated that cable operators would have
an incentive to drop local broadcasters and to favor affiliated
programmers. See, e. g., Competitive Issues in the Cable

Though the dissent criticizes our reliance on evidence provided to Congress by parties that are private appellees here,
post, at 237-238, that argument displays a lack of regard for
Congress' factfinding function. It is the nature of the legislative process to consider the submissions of the parties most
affected by legislation. Appellants, too, sent representatives before Congress to try to persuade them of their side
of the debate. See, e. g., Hearing on Competitive Problems
in the Cable Television Industry, at 228-241 (statement of
James P. Mooney, president and CEO of appellant NCTA);
Hearings on Cable Television Regulation, at 575-582 (statement of Decker S. Anstrom, executive vice president of appellant NCTA); Cable TV Consumer Protection Act of 1991:
Hearing on S. 12 before the Subcommittee on Communications of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 173-180 (1991) (statement of Ted Turner, president of appellant Turner Broadcasting System). After hearing years of testimony, and
reviewing volumes of documentary evidence and studies offered by both sides, Congress concluded that the cable industry posed a threat to broadcast television. The Constitution
gives to Congress the role of weighing conflicting evidence in
the legislative process. Even when the resulting regulation
touches on First Amendment concerns, we must give considerable deference, in examining the evidence, to Congress'
findings and conclusions, including its findings and conclusions with respect to conflicting economic predictions. See
supra, at 195-196. Furthermore, much of the testimony,
though offered by interested parties, was supported by verifiable information and citation to independent sources. See,
e. g., Hearings on Cable Television Regulation, at 869-870,

200 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

Opinion of Kennedy, J.
The reasonableness of Congress' conclusion was borne outby the evidence on remand, which also reflected cable industry favoritism for integrated programmers. See, e. g., Rec-ord, Defendants' Additional Evidence, Vol. VII.H, Exh. 170,
p. 1749 (DAE) (cable industry memo stating: "All [of an
MSO's] systems must launch Starz [an integrated program-mer] 2/94. Word from corporate: if you don't have free channels . . . make one free"); Third Declaration of Tom Meek || 44(Third Meek Declaration) (App. 2071-2072); see also Declaration of Roger G. Noll |||| 18-22 (Noll Declaration) (App. 1009-1013); Declaration of James Dertouzos || 6a (Dertouzos Declaration) (App. 959).

In addition, evidence before Congress, supplemented on
remand, indicated that cable systems would have incentives
to drop local broadcasters in favor of other programmers less
likely to compete with them for audience and advertisers.
Independent local broadcasters tend to be the closest substitutes for cable programs, because their programming tends
to be similar, see JSCR |||| 269, 274, 276 (App. 1367, 1368-
1370), and because both primarily target the same type of
advertiser: those interested in cheaper (and more frequent)
ad spots than are typically available on network affiliates.

(Reply Comment of FTC) (App. 176). The ability of broadcast stations to compete for advertising is greatly increased
by cable carriage, which increases viewership substantially.
See Second Meek Declaration || 34 (App. 1866-1867). With
expanded viewership, broadcast presents a more competitive
medium for television advertising. Empirical studies indicate that cable-carried broadcasters so enhance competition
for advertising that even modest increases in the numbers of

broadcast stations carried on cable are correlated with sig-nificant decreases in advertising revenue to cable systems.

Dertouzos Declaration |||| 20, 25-28 (App. 966, 969-971); seealso Reply Comment of FTC, at 18 (App. 175). Empirical
evidence also indicates that demand for premium cable services (such as pay-per-view) is reduced when a cable systemcarries more independent broadcasters. Hearing on Competitive Problems in the Cable Television Industry, at 323(statement of Michael O. Wirth). Thus, operators stand to
benefit by dropping broadcast stations. Dertouzos Declara-tion || 6b (App. 959).

Cable systems also have more systemic reasons for seeking to disadvantage broadcast stations: Simply stated, cable
has little interest in assisting, through carriage, a competing
medium of communication. As one cable-industry executive
put it, " `our job is to promote cable television, not broadcast
television.' " Hearing on Competitive Issues, at 658 (quoting Multichannel News, Channel Realignments: United
Cable Eyes Plan to Bump Network Affils to Upper Channels,
Nov. 3, 1986, p. 39); see also Hearing on Competitive Issues,
at 661 (" `Shouldn't we give more . . . shelf space to cable?
Why have people trained to view UHF?' ") (vice president of
operations at Comcast, an MSO, quoted in Multichannel
News, Cable Operators begin to Shuffle Channel Lineups,
Sept. 8, 1986, p. 38). The incentive to subscribe to cable is
lower in markets with many over-the-air viewing options.
See JSCR || 275 (App. 1369); Dertouzos Declaration |||| 27,
32 (App. 970, 972). Evidence adduced on remand indicated
cable systems have little incentive to carry, and a significant
incentive to drop, broadcast stations that will only be
strengthened by access to the 60 percent of the television
market that cable typically controls. Dertouzos Declaration
|||| 29, 35 (App. 971, 973); Noll Declaration || 43 (App. 1029).
Congress could therefore reasonably conclude that cable systems would drop broadcasters in favor of programmers--
even unaffiliated ones--less likely to compete with them for

audience and advertisers. The cap on carriage of affiliatesincluded in the Cable Act, 47 U. S. C. $ 533(f )(1)(B); 47 CFR

$ 76.504 (1995), and relied on by the dissent, post, at 238, 252,is of limited utility in protecting broadcasters.

The dissent contends Congress could not reasonably conclude cable systems would engage in such predation becausecable operators, whose primary source of revenue is subscriptions, would not risk dropping a widely viewed broad-cast station in order to capture advertising revenues.

Post,
at 239. However, if viewers are faced with the choice ofsacrificing a handful of broadcast stations to gain access to

dozens of cable channels (plus network affiliates), it is likely
they would still subscribe to cable even if they would prefer
the dropped television stations to the cable programming
that replaced them. Substantial evidence introduced on remand bears this out: With the exception of a handful of very
popular broadcast stations (typically network affiliates), a
cable system's choice between carrying a cable programmer
or broadcast station has little or no effect on cable subscriptions, and subscribership thus typically does not bear on carriage decisions. Noll Declaration || 29 (App. 1018-1019); Rebuttal Declaration of Roger G. Noll || 20 (App. 1798); Reply
Declaration of Roger G. Noll |||| 3-4, and n. 3 (App. 2003-
2004); see also Declaration of John R. Haring || 37 (Haring
Declaration) (App. 1106).

It was more than a theoretical possibility in 1992 that cable
operators would take actions adverse to local broadcasters;
indeed, significant numbers of broadcasters had already been
dropped. The record before Congress contained extensive
anecdotal evidence about scores of adverse carriage decisions
against broadcast stations. See JSCR |||| 291-467, 664 (App.
1376-1489, 1579). Congress considered an FCC-sponsored
study detailing cable system carriage practices in the wake
of decisions by the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit striking down prior must-carry
regulations. See Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC, 768 F. 2d

pp. CR 15297-15298, 15306-15307.

Substantial evidence demonstrated that absent must-carry
the already "serious," Senate Report, at 43, problem of noncarriage would grow worse because "additional local broadcast signals will be deleted, repositioned, or not carried,"

the cable industry was acting with restraint in dropping
broadcast stations in an effort to discourage reregulation.

and penetration levels off, systems will turn increasingly toadvertising for revenues. The incentive to deny carriage to
local stations is a logical, rational and, without must carry, a
legal business strategy." App. A to Testimony of James B.

Additional evidence developed on remand supports the
reasonableness of Congress' predictive judgment. Approximately 11 percent of local broadcasters were not carried on
the typical cable system in 1989. See Reply Comment of
FTC, at 9-10 (App. 168-169). The figure had grown to even
more significant proportions by 1992. According to one of
appellants' own experts, between 19 and 31 percent of all
local broadcast stations, including network affiliates, were
not carried by the typical cable system. See Declaration of
Stanley Besen, Exhs. C-2, C-3 (App. 907-908). Based on
the same data, another expert concluded that 47 percent of
local independent commercial stations, and 36 percent of noncommercial stations, were not carried by the typical cable
system. The rate of noncarriage was even higher for new
stations. Third Meek Declaration || 4 (App. 2054). Appel520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

lees introduced evidence drawn from an empirical study con-cluding the 1988 FCC survey substantially underestimated

the actual number of drops (Declaration of Tom Meek |||| 5,25, 36 (Meek Declaration) (App. 619, 625, 626)), and the noncarriage problem grew steadily worse during the period

year, in a total of 7,945 incidents. Id., |||| 12, 15 (App. 621,622).

The dissent cites evidence indicating that many droppedbroadcasters were stations few viewers watch,

post, at 242,
and it suggests that must-carry thwarts noncable viewers'
preferences, ibid. Undoubtedly, viewers without cable--the
immediate, though not sole, beneficiaries of efforts to preserve broadcast television--would have a strong preference
for carriage of any broadcast program over any cable program, for the simple reason that it helps to preserve a medium to which they have access. The methodological flaws
in the cited evidence are of concern. See post, at 243. Even
aside from that, the evidence overlooks that the broadcasters
added by must-carry had ratings greater than or equal to the
cable programs they replaced. Second Meek Declaration
|| 23 (App. 1863) (ratings of broadcasters added by mustcarry "are generally higher than that achieved . . . by their

their must-carry obligations using spare channels, and did
not displace cable programmers. See Report to Counsel for

cable systems refused to carry certain local broadcast sta-tions because of their subscribers' preferences for the cable

services carried in their place, one would expect that allcable programming services would have ratings exceeding
those of broadcasters not carried. That is simply not thecase.

The evidence on remand also indicated that the growth of
cable systems' market power proceeded apace. The trend
toward greater horizontal concentration continued, driven
by "[e]nhanced growth prospects for advertising sales."

JSCR |||| 199, 204 (App. 1334, 1336). The FTC study the dissent cites, post, at 242, takes a skeptical view of the potential
for cable systems to engage in anticompetitive behavior, but
concedes the risk of anticompetitive carriage denials is "most
plausible" when "the cable system's franchise area is large
relative to the local area served by the affected broadcast
station," Reply Comment of FTC, at 20 (App. 177), and when
"a system's penetration rate is both high and relatively unresponsive to the system's carriage decisions," id., at 18 (App.
175). That describes "precisely what is happening" as large
cable operators expand their control over individual markets
through clustering. Second Meek Declaration || 35 (App.
1867). As they do so, they are better able to sell their own
reach to potential advertisers, and to limit the access of
broadcast competitors by denying them access to all or substantially all the cable homes in the market area. Ibid.; accord, Noll Declaration || 24 (App. 1015).

This is not a case in which we are called upon to give
our best judgment as to the likely economic consequences of
certain financial arrangements or business structures, or to
assess competing economic theories and predictive judgments, as we would in a case arising, say, under the antitrust
laws. "Statutes frequently require courts to make policy
judgments. The Sherman Act, for example, requires courts
to delve deeply into the theory of economic organization."

Opinion of the Court
See Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 966 (1994) (separate opinionof

Stevens, J.). The issue before us is whether, given con-flicting views of the probable development of the television

industry, Congress had substantial evidence for making thejudgment that it did. We need not put our imprimatur on
Congress' economic theory in order to validate the rea-sonableness of its judgment.

The harm Congress feared was that stations dropped ordenied carriage would be at a "serious risk of financial difficulty," 512 U. S., at 667, and would "deteriorate to a sub-stantial degree or fail altogether," id., at 666. Congress
had before it substantial evidence to support its conclusion.Congress was advised the viability of a broadcast station
depends to a material extent on its ability to secure cablecarriage. JSCR |||| 597-617, 667-670, 673 (App. 1544-1553,
1580-1581, 1582-1583). One broadcast industry executiveexplained it this way:

"Simply put, a television station's audience size directlytranslates into revenue--large audiences attract larger
revenues, through the sale of advertising time. If a sta-tion is not carried on cable, and thereby loses a substantial portion of its audience, it will lose revenue. Withless revenue, the station can not serve its community
as well. The station will have less money to invest inequipment and programming. The attractiveness of its
programming will lessen, as will its audience. Reve-nues will continue to decline, and the cycle will repeat."

by cable systems, see id., |||| 618-620, 622-623 (App. 1553-
1555). The record also reflected substantial evidence that
stations without cable carriage encountered severe difficulties obtaining financing for operations, reflecting the financial markets' judgment that the prospects are poor for broadcasters unable to secure carriage. See, e. g., id., |||| 302, 304,

Second Meek Declaration || 11 (App. 1858); Declaration of Jeffrey Rohlfs || 6 (App. 1157-1158). Evidence before Congress
suggested the potential adverse impact of losing carriage
was increasing as the growth of clustering gave MSO's centralized control over more local markets. See JSCR |||| 150-
153 (App. 1311-1313). Congress thus had ample basis to
conclude that attaining cable carriage would be of increasing
importance to ensuring a station's viability. We hold Congress could conclude from the substantial body of evidence
before it that "absent legislative action, the free local off-air
broadcast system is endangered." Senate Report, at 42.

The evidence assembled on remand confirms the reasonableness of the congressional judgment. Documents
produced on remand reflect that internal cable industry

Opinion of the Court
"clearly establis[h] the importance of cable televisionto broadcast television stations. Because viewership

equates to ratings and in turn ratings equate to reve-nues, it is unlikely that broadcast stations could afford
to be off the cable system's line-up for any extended pe-riod of time." Memorandum from F. Lopez to T. Baxter
re: Adlink's Presentations on Retransmission Consent,dated June 14, 1993 (App. 2118).

Another study prepared by a large MSO in 1993 concludedthat "[w]ith cable penetration now exceeding 70% in many
markets, the ability of a broadcast television station to easilyreach its audience through cable television is crucial." Exh.
B to Haring Declaration, DAE Vol. II.A (App. 2147). Thestudy acknowledged that even in a market with significantly
below-average cable penetration, "[t]he loss of cable carriagecould cause a significant decrease in a station's ratings and a
resulting loss in advertising revenues." Ibid. (App. 2147).For an average market "the impact would be even greater."
Ibid. (App. 2149). The study determined that for a popu-lar station in a major television market, even modest reductions in carriage could result in sizeable reductions in reve-nue. A 5 percent reduction in cable viewers, for example,
would result in a $1.48 million reduction in gross revenue forthe station. (App. 2156.)

To be sure, the record also contains evidence to supporta contrary conclusion. Appellants (and the dissent in the
District Court) make much of the fact that the number ofbroadcast stations and their advertising revenue continued
to grow during the period without must-carry, albeit at adiminished rate. Evidence introduced on remand indicated
that only 31 broadcast stations actually went dark during theperiod without must-carry (one of which failed after a tornado destroyed its transmitter), and during the same periodsome 263 new stations signed on the air. Meek Declaration
|||| 76-77 (App. 627-628). New evidence appellants pro-duced on remand indicates the average cable system volun520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tarily carried local broadcast stations accounting for about97 percent of television ratings in noncable households.

Declaration of Stanley Besen, Part III-D (App. 808). Ap-pellants, as well as the dissent in the District Court, contend
that in light of such evidence, it is clear "the must-carry law
is not necessary to assure the economic viability of the broad-cast system as a whole." NCTA Brief 18.

This assertion misapprehends the relevant inquiry. Thequestion is not whether Congress, as an objective matter,
was correct to determine must-carry is necessary to pre-vent a substantial number of broadcast stations from losing
cable carriage and suffering significant financial hardship.
Rather, the question is whether the legislative conclusion
was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence in the
record before Congress. Turner, 512 U. S., at 665-666. In
making that determination, we are not to "reweigh the evidence de novo, or to replace Congress' factual predictions
with our own." Id., at 666. Rather, we are simply to determine if the standard is satisfied. If it is, summary judgment for defendants-appellees is appropriate regardless of
whether the evidence is in conflict. We have noted in another context, involving less deferential review than is at
issue here, that " `the possibility of drawing two inconsistent
conclusions from the evidence does not prevent . . . [a] finding
from being supported by substantial evidence.' " American
Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U. S. 490, 523
(1981) (citation omitted) (quoting Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm'n, 383 U. S. 607, 620 (1966)).

Although evidence of continuing growth in broadcast could
have supported the opposite conclusion, a reasonable interpretation is that expansion in the cable industry was causing
harm to broadcasting. Growth continued, but the rate of
growth fell to a considerable extent during the period without must-carry (from 4.5 percent in 1986 to 1.7 percent by
1992), and appeared to be tapering off further. JSCR

Opinion of the Court
(App. 626-631); 910 F. Supp., at 790, App. 2. At the sametime, "in an almost unprecedented development," 5 FCC

Rcd, at 5041, |||| 153-154, stations began to fail in increasingnumbers. Meek Declaration || 78 (App. 628) ("[T]he number
of stations going dark began to escalate" after 1988) (emphasis deleted); JSCR |||| 659, 661, 669, 671-672, 676, 681 (App.1576, 1581-1582, 1584, 1587). Broadcast advertising revenues declined in real terms by 11 percent between 1986 and1991, during a period in which cable's real advertising revenues nearly doubled. See 910 F. Supp., at 790, App. 1.While these phenomena could be thought to stem from factors quite separate from the increasing market power of
cable (for example, a recession in 1990-1992), it was for Congress to determine the better explanation. We are not at
liberty to substitute our judgment for the reasonable conclusion of a legislative body. See Turner, supra, at 665-666.
It is true the number of bankruptcies among local broadcasters was small; but Congress could forecast continuance of
the "unprecedented" 5-year downward trend and conclude
the station failures of 1985-1992 were, as Commissioner
Quello warned, the tip of the iceberg. A fundamental principle of legislation is that Congress is under no obligation to
wait until the entire harm occurs but may act to prevent it.
"An industry need not be in its death throes before Congress
may act to protect it from economic harm threatened by a
monopoly." Turner, supra, at 672 (Stevens, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment). As a Senate Committee noted in a Report on the Cable Act: "[W]e need not wait
until widespread further harm has occurred to the system of
local broadcasting or to competition in the video market before taking action to forestall such consequences. Congress
is allowed to make a rational predication of the consequences
of inaction and of the effects of regulation in furthering governmental interests." Senate Report, at 60.

Opinion of the Court
broadcast stations are at risk, the dissent believes yet moreis required before Congress could act. It demands more information about which of the dropped broadcast stations stillqualify for mandatory carriage, post, at 241; about the broadcast markets in which adverse decisions take place, ibid.; andabout the features of the markets in which bankrupt broadcast stations were located prior to their demise, post, at 246.The level of detail in factfinding required by the dissent
would be an improper burden for courts to impose on theLegislative Branch. That amount of detail is as unreasonable in the legislative context as it is constitutionally unwar-ranted. "Congress is not obligated, when enacting its statutes, to make a record of the type that an administrativeagency or court does to accommodate judicial review."
Turner, supra, at 666 (plurality opinion).We think it apparent must-carry serves the Government's
interests "in a direct and effective way." Ward, 491 U. S.,at 800. Must-carry ensures that a number of local broadcasters retain cable carriage, with the concomitant audienceaccess and advertising revenues needed to support a multiplicity of stations. Appellants contend that even were thisso, must-carry is broader than necessary to accomplish its
goals. We turn to this question.

B
The second portion of the O'Brien inquiry concerns thefit between the asserted interests and the means chosen to

advance them. Content-neutral regulations do not pose thesame "inherent dangers to free expression," Turner, supra,
at 661, that content-based regulations do, and thus are sub-ject to a less rigorous analysis, which affords the Government latitude in designing a regulatory solution. See, e. g.,
Ward, supra, at 798-799, n. 6. Under intermediate scrutiny,the Government may employ the means of its choosing " `so

long as the . . . regulation promotes a substantial governmen-tal interest that would be achieved less effectively absent

Opinion of the Court
the regulation,' " and does not " `burden substantially morespeech than is necessary to further' " that interest.

Turner,
512 U. S., at 662 (quoting Ward, supra, at 799).The must-carry provisions have the potential to interfere

with protected speech in two ways. First, the provisions
restrain cable operators' editorial discretion in creating pro-gramming packages by "reduc[ing] the number of channels

over which [they] exercise unfettered control." Turner, 512U. S., at 637. Second, the rules "render it more difficult for
cable programmers to compete for carriage on the limitedchannels remaining."

Ibid.
Appellants say the burden of must-carry is great, but the
evidence adduced on remand indicates the actual effects are
modest. Significant evidence indicates the vast majority of
cable operators have not been affected in a significant manner by must-carry. Cable operators have been able to satisfy their must-carry obligations 87 percent of the time using
previously unused channel capacity, Declaration of Harry
Shooshan III, || 14 (App. 692); 94.5 percent of the 11,628 cable
systems nationwide have not had to drop any programming
in order to fulfill their must-carry obligations; the remaining
5.5 percent have had to drop an average of only 1.22 services
from their programming, id., || 15 (App. 692); and cable operators nationwide carry 99.8 percent of the programming they
carried before enactment of must-carry, id., || 21 (App. 694-
695). Appellees note that only 1.18 percent of the approximately 500,000 cable channels nationwide is devoted to channels added because of must-carry, see id., || 11(b) (App.
688-689); weighted for subscribership, the figure is 2.4 percent, 910 F. Supp., at 780 (Williams, J., dissenting). Appellees contend the burdens of must-carry will soon diminish as
cable channel capacity increases, as is occurring nationwide.
NAB Brief 45; see also 910 F. Supp., at 746-747.

We do not understand appellants to dispute in any fundamental way the accuracy of those figures, only their significance. See NCTA Brief 46; id., at 44-49; Time Warner Brief

520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
38-45; Turner Brief 33-42. They note national averages failto account for greater crowding on certain (especially urban)

cable systems, see Time Warner Brief 41, 43; Turner Brief41, and contend that half of all cable systems, serving twothirds of all cable subscribers, have no available capacity,
NCTA Brief 45; Turner Brief 34; Time Warner Brief 42,n. 58. Appellants argue that the rate of growth in cable

programming outstrips cable operators' creation of newchannel space, that the rate of cable growth is lower than
claimed, Turner Brief 39, and that must-carry infringes FirstAmendment rights now irrespective of future growth,
Turner Brief 40; Reply Brief for Appellants Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., et al. 12-13. Finally, they say that regardless of the percentage of channels occupied, must-carry
still represents "thousands of real and individual infringements of speech." Time Warner Brief 44.

While the parties' evidence is susceptible of varying interpretations, a few definite conclusions can be drawn about the
burdens of must-carry. It is undisputed that broadcast stations gained carriage on 5,880 channels as a result of mustcarry. While broadcast stations occupy another 30,006 cable
channels nationwide, this carriage does not represent a significant First Amendment harm to either system operators
or cable programmers because those stations were carried
voluntarily before 1992, and even appellants represent, Tr.
of Oral Arg. 6, that the vast majority of those channels would
continue to be carried in the absence of any legal obligation
to do so. See Turner, supra, at 673, n. 6 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). The 5,880
channels occupied by added broadcasters represent the actual burden of the regulatory scheme. Appellants concede
most of those stations would be dropped in the absence of
must-carry, Tr. of Oral Arg. 6, so the figure approximates the
benefits of must-carry as well.

Because the burden imposed by must-carry is congruent
to the benefits it affords, we conclude must-carry is narrowly

tailored to preserve a multiplicity of broadcast stations forthe 40 percent of American households without cable. Cf.

Ward, 491 U. S., at 799, n. 7 ("[T]he essence of narrow tailor-ing" is "focus[ing] on the source of the evils the [Government] seeks to eliminate [without] significantly restricting a
substantial quantity of speech that does not create the sameevils");

Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U. S., at
297 ("None of [the regulation's] provisions appears unrelatedto the ends that it was designed to serve"). Congress took

steps to confine the breadth and burden of the regulatoryscheme. For example, the more popular stations (which appellants concede would be carried anyway) will likely opt to
be paid for cable carriage under the "retransmission consent"
provision of the Cable Act; those stations will nonetheless be
counted toward systems' must-carry obligations. Congress
exempted systems of 12 or fewer channels, and limited the
must-carry obligation of larger systems to one-third of capacity, 47 U. S. C. $ 534(b)(1); see also $$ 535(b)(2)-(3); allowed
cable operators discretion in choosing which competing and
qualified signals would be carried, $ 534(b)(2); and permitted
operators to carry public stations on unused public, educational, and governmental channels in some circumstances,

$ 535(d).

Appellants say the must-carry provisions are overbroad
because they require carriage in some instances when the
Government's interests are not implicated: The must-carry
rules prohibit a cable system operator from dropping a
broadcaster "even if the operator has no anticompetitive motives, and even if the broadcaster that would have to be
dropped . . . would survive without cable access." 512 U. S.,
at 683 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). See also NCTA Brief 25-
26. We are not persuaded that either possibility is so prevalent that must-carry is substantially overbroad. As discussed supra, at 201-202, cable systems serving 70 percent
of subscribers are vertically integrated with cable programmers, so anticompetitive motives may be implicated in a

Opinion of the Court
majority of systems' decisions not to carry broadcasters.Some broadcasters will opt for must-carry although they

would not suffer serious financial harm in its absence. SeeTime Warner Brief 35-36, and n. 49. Broadcasters with
stronger finances tend, however, to be popular ones that ordinarily seek payment from cable systems for transmission,so their reliance on must-carry should be minimal. It appears, for example, that no more than a few hundred of the500,000 cable channels nationwide are occupied by network
affiliates opting for must-carry, see Time Warner Brief 35-36, and n. 49, a number insufficient to render must-carry
"substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government's interest," Ward, supra, at 800. Even on the doubtful
assumption that a narrower but still practicable must-carry
rule could be drafted to exclude all instances in which the
Government's interests are not implicated, our cases establish that content-neutral regulations are not "invalid simply
because there is some imaginable alternative that might
be less burdensome on speech." Albertini, 472 U. S., at 689;
accord, Ward, supra, at 797; Community for Creative NonViolence, supra, at 299.

Appellants posit a number of alternatives in an effort to
demonstrate a less restrictive means to achieve the Government's aims. They ask us, in effect, to "sif[t] through all the
available or imagined alternative means of regulating [cable
television] in order to determine whether the [Government's]
solution was `the least intrusive means' of achieving the
desired end," an approach we rejected in Ward, 491 U. S.,
at 797. This " `less-restrictive-alternative analysis . . . has
never been a part of the inquiry into the validity' " of
content-neutral regulations on speech. Ibid. (quoting Regan
v. Time, Inc., 468 U. S. 641, 657 (1984) (plurality opinion)
(ellipses in original)). Our precedents establish that when
evaluating a content-neutral regulation which incidentally
burdens speech, we will not invalidate the preferred remedial scheme because some alternative solution is marginally

Opinion of the Court
less intrusive on a speaker's First Amendment interests."So long as the means chosen are not substantially broader

than necessary to achieve the government's interest, . . . theregulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government's interest could be adequately
served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative." Ward,491 U. S., at 800. See generally

ibid. (holding regulation
valid although Court of Appeals had identified less restric-tive "alternative regulatory methods" of controlling volume

at concerts); Albertini, supra, at 689 (upholding validity oforder barring a person from a military base, although excluding barred person was not "essential" to preserving security
and there were less speech-restrictive means of attaining
that end); Community for Creative Non-Violence, supra, at
299 (overnight camping ban upheld although "there [were]
less speech-restrictive alternatives" of satisfying interest in
preserving park lands); Members of City Council of Los
Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 815-817
(1984) (stating that although making exceptions to ban on
posting signs on public property "would have had a less
severe effect on expressive activity," they were not "constitutionally mandated"). It is well established a regulation's
validity "does not turn on a judge's agreement with the
responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate
method for promoting significant government interests."
Albertini, supra, at 689.

In any event, after careful examination of each of the alternatives suggested by appellants, we cannot conclude that any
of them is an adequate alternative to must-carry for promoting the Government's legitimate interests. First among appellants' suggested alternatives is a proposal to revive a
more limited set of must-carry rules, known as the "Century
rules" after the 1987 court decision striking them down, see
Century Communications Corp. v. FCC, 835 F. 2d 292
(CADC). Those rules included a minimum viewership
standard for eligibility and limited the must-carry obligation

Opinion of the Court
to 25 percent of channel capacity. The parties agree only 14percent of broadcasters added to cable systems under the

Cable Act would be eligible for carriage under the Centuryrules. See Turner Brief 45; Brief for Federal Appellees
45; NAB Brief 49; see also Declaration of Gregory Klein
|||| 21-25 (App. 1141-1143). The Century rules, for the mostpart, would require carriage of the same stations a system

would carry without statutory compulsion. While we ac-knowledge appellants' criticism of any rationale that more is
better, the scheme in question does not place limitless must-carry obligations on cable system operators. In the final
analysis this alternative represents nothing more than appellants' " `[dis]agreement with the responsible decisionmaker
concerning' . . . the degree to which [the Government's] interests should be promoted." Ward, supra, at 800 (quoting Albertini, supra, at 689); Community for Creative
Non-Violence, 468 U. S., at 299. Congress legislated in the
shadow of Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC, 768 F. 2d 1434
(CADC 1985), and Century Communications. Its deliberations reflect awareness of the must-carry rules at issue in
those cases, Senate Report, at 39-41, 62; indeed, in drafting
the must-carry provisions of the Cable Act, Congress made
specific comparisons to the rules struck down in Quincy,
supra. See House Report, at 65-66; Senate Report, at 61.
The record reflects a deliberate congressional choice to adopt
the present levels of protection, to which this Court must
defer.

The second alternative appellants urge is the use of input
selector or "A/B" switches, which, in combination with antennas, would permit viewers to switch between cable and
broadcast input, allowing cable subscribers to watch broadcast programs not carried on cable. Congress examined the
use of A/B switches as an alternative to must-carry and concluded it was "not an enduring or feasible method of distribution and . . . not in the public interest." $ 2(a)(18). The data
showed that: many households lacked adequate antennas to

The group's engineering committee likewise concluded the
switches suffered from technical problems and that no solution "appear[ed] imminent." Joint Petition for Reconsideration in MM Docket No. 85-349, pp. 6-8 (Dec. 17, 1986) (App.

and had an A/B switch, id., at 131. Of the small numberof households possessing the switch, an even smaller number (only 38 percent) had ever used it. Ibid. See HouseReport, at 54, and nn. 62-63. Congress' decision that use of
A/B switches was not a real alternative to must-carry was
a reasonable one based on substantial evidence of technicalshortcomings and lack of consumer acceptance. The reasonableness of its judgment was confirmed by additionalevidence on remand that A/B switches can create signal interference and add complexity to video systems, factorsdiscouraging their use.

246).

Appellants also suggest a leased-access regime, under
which both broadcasters and cable programmers would have
equal access to cable channels at regulated rates. Turner
Brief 46-47. Appellants do not specify what kind of regime
they would propose, or how it would operate, making this
alternative difficult to compare to the must-carry rules.
Whatever virtues the proposal might otherwise have, it
would reduce the number of cable channels under cable systems' control in the same manner as must-carry. Because
this alternative is aimed solely at addressing the bottleneck
control of cable operators, it would not be as effective in
achieving Congress' further goal of ensuring that significant
programming remains available for the 40 percent of American households without cable. Indeed, unless the number of
channels set aside for local broadcast stations were to decrease (sacrificing Congress' interest in preserving a multiplicity of broadcasters), additional channels would have to be
set aside for cable programmers, further reducing the channels under the systems' control. Furthermore, Congress
was specific in noting that requiring payment for cable car520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
riage was inimical to the interests it was pursuing, becauseof the burden it would impose on small broadcasters. See

House Report, at 51; Senate Report, at 43, 45. Congressspecifically prohibited such payments under the Cable Act.
47 U. S. C. $$ 534(b)(10), 535(i).

Appellants next suggest a system of subsidies for finan-cially weak stations. Appellants have not proposed any particular subsidy scheme, so it is difficult to determine whetherthis option presents a feasible means of achieving the Government's interests, let alone one preferable to must-carryunder the First Amendment. To begin with, a system of
subsidies would serve a very different purpose than mustcarry. Must-carry is intended not to guarantee the financial
health of all broadcasters, but to ensure a base number of
broadcasters survive to provide service to noncable households. Must-carry is simpler to administer and less likely to
involve the Government in making content-based determinations about programming. The must-carry rules distinguish
between categories of speakers based solely on the technology used to communicate. The rules acknowledge cable
systems' expertise by according them discretion to determine which broadcasters to carry on reserved channels,
and (within the Cable Act's strictures) allow them to choose
broadcasters with a view to offering program choices appealing to local subscribers. Appellants' proposal would require
the Government to develop other criteria for giving subsidies
and to establish a potentially elaborate administrative structure to make subsidy determinations.

Appellants also suggest a system of antitrust enforcement
or an administrative complaint procedure to protect broadcasters from cable operators' anticompetitive conduct. See
Turner Brief 47-48. Congress could conclude, however, that
the considerable expense and delay inherent in antitrust litigation, and the great disparities in wealth and sophistication
between the average independent broadcast station and average cable system operator, would make these remedies in520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:41:59] PAGES PGT: OPIN

223Cite as: 520 U. S. 180 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
adequate substitutes for guaranteed carriage. The recordsuggests independent broadcasters simply are not in a position to engage in complex antitrust litigation, which involvesextensive discovery, significant motions practice, appeals,
and the payment of high legal fees throughout. See JSCR
|||| 556-576 (App. 1528-1537); Meek Declaration || 58 (Record,Defendants' Joint Submission of Expert Affidavits and Reports in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment, Vol.II.A, Exh. 2). An administrative complaint procedure, although less burdensome, would still require stations to incurconsiderable expense and delay before enforcing their rights.
As it is, some public stations have been forced by limited
resources to forgo pursuing administrative complaints under
the Cable Act to obtain carriage. See Declaration of Carolyn Lewis || 13 (App. 548-549); Declaration of John Beabout
|| 11 (App. 526-527). Those problems would be compounded
if instead of proving entitlement under must-carry, the station had to prove facts establishing an antitrust violation.

There is a final argument made by appellants that we do
not reach. Appellant Time Warner Entertainment raises in
its brief a separate First Amendment challenge to a subsection of the Cable Act, 47 U. S. C. $ 534(c), that requires carriage on unfilled must-carry channels of low power broadcast
stations if the FCC determines that the station's programming "would address local news and informational needs
which are not being adequately served by full power television broadcast stations because of the geographic distance of
such full power stations from the low power station's community of license." $ 534(h)(2)(B). We earlier reserved this
question and invited the District Court to address it on remand. See Turner, 512 U. S., at 643-644, n. 6. Because
this question has received "only the most glancing" attention, ibid., from the District Court and the parties, we have
no more information about "the operation of, and justifications for, the low-power broadcast provisions," ibid., on
which to base an informed determination than we did on the

earlier appeal. The District Court's primary opinion dis-posed of the question in a perfunctory discussion, 910

F. Supp., at 750-751; and the dissent explicitly declined toreach the question, id., at 789. The issue has received even
less attention from the parties. It was not addressed in thejurisdictional statement, the motions to affirm, or the appellants' oppositions to the motions to affirm. In over 400pages of merits briefs, the parties devoted a total of four
paragraphs (two of which were relegated to footnotes) toconclusory argumentation on this subject, largely concerning
not the merits of the question but whether it was even prop-erly before us. On this state of the record we have insufficient basis to make an informed judgment on this discreteissue. Even if the issue is "fairly included" in the broadly
worded question presented, it is tangential to the main issue,and prudence dictates that we not decide this question based
on such scant argumentation. See Socialist Labor Party v.Gilligan, 406 U. S. 583, 588-589, n. 2 (1972); Teamsters v.
Denver Milk Producers, Inc., 334 U. S. 809 (1948) (per curiam); see also Carducci v. Regan, 714 F. 2d 171, 177 (CADC1983) (Scalia, J.).

Judgments about how competing economic interests are tobe reconciled in the complex and fast-changing field of television are for Congress to make. Those judgments "cannotbe ignored or undervalued simply because [appellants] cas[t]

Columbia Broadcasting v. Democratic National Committee,412 U. S., at 103. Appellants' challenges to must-carry reflect little more than disagreement over the level of protec-tion broadcast stations are to be afforded and how protection
is to be attained. We cannot displace Congress' judgmentrespecting content-neutral regulations with our own, so long
as its policy is grounded on reasonable factual findings sup-ported by evidence that is substantial for a legislative determination. Those requirements were met in this case, and in

As Justice Kennedy clearly explains, the policy judg-ments made by Congress in the enactment of legislation that

Ante, at 195-196, 224 andthis page. That is true even when the attempt to protect

an economic market imposes burdens on communication.Cf.

rather than the structure of the market, our task would bequite different. See

I fully concur in the Court's thorough opinion.

Justice Breyer, concurring in part.
I join the opinion of the Court except insofar as Part II-A-1 relies on an anticompetitive rationale. I agree with the

majority that the statute must be "sustained under the FirstAmendment if it advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and doesnot burden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests." Ante, at 189 (citing United States v.

Breyer, J., concurring in part
O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367, 377 (1968)). I also agree that the
statute satisfies this standard. My conclusion rests, however, not upon the principal opinion's analysis of the statute's
efforts to "promot[e] fair competition," see post, at 230-232,
237-240, but rather upon its discussion of the statute's other
objectives, namely, " `(1) preserving the benefits of free,
over-the-air local broadcast television,' " and " `(2) promoting
the widespread dissemination of information from a multiplicity of sources,' " ante, at 189 (quoting Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 662 (1994) (Turner)).
Whether or not the statute does or does not sensibly compensate for some significant market defect, it undoubtedly seeks
to provide over-the-air viewers who lack cable with a rich
mix of over-the-air programming by guaranteeing the overthe-air stations that provide such programming with the
extra dollars that an additional cable audience will generate.
I believe that this purpose--to assure the over-the-air public
"access to a multiplicity of information sources," id., at
663--provides sufficient basis for rejecting appellants' First
Amendment claim.

I do not deny that the compulsory carriage that creates
the "guarantee" extracts a serious First Amendment price.
It interferes with the protected interests of the cable operators to choose their own programming; it prevents displaced
cable program providers from obtaining an audience; and it
will sometimes prevent some cable viewers from watching
what, in its absence, would have been their preferred set of
programs. Ante, at 214; post, at 250. This "price" amounts
to a "suppression of speech."

But there are important First Amendment interests on
the other side as well. The statute's basic noneconomic purpose is to prevent too precipitous a decline in the quality
and quantity of programming choice for an ever-shrinking
non-cable-subscribing segment of the public. Ante, at 190,
191-194. This purpose reflects what "has long been a basic
tenet of national communications policy," namely, that "the

(1981). That policy, in turn, seeks to facilitate the publicdiscussion and informed deliberation, which, as Justice Brandeis pointed out many years ago, democratic governmentpresupposes and the First Amendment seeks to achieve.

supra, at 20. Indeed, Turner rested in part upon the proposition that "assuring that the public has access to a multiplic-ity of information sources is a governmental purpose of the

highest order, for it promotes values central to the FirstAmendment." 512 U. S., at 663.

With important First Amendment interests on both sidesof the equation, the key question becomes one of proper fit.
That question, in my view, requires a reviewing court to determine both whether there are significantly less restrictive
ways to achieve Congress' over-the-air programming objectives, and also to decide whether the statute, in its effort to
achieve those objectives, strikes a reasonable balance between potentially speech-restricting and speech-enhancing
consequences. Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781,
799-800 (1989); ante, at 217-218. The majority's opinion
analyzes and evaluates those consequences, and I agree with
its conclusions in respect to both of these matters. Ante,
at 213-224.

In particular, I note (and agree) that a cable system, physically dependent upon the availability of space along city
streets, at present (perhaps less in the future) typically faces
little competition, that it therefore constitutes a kind of bot520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tleneck that controls the range of viewer choice (whetheror not it uses any consequent economic power for economically predatory purposes), and that some degree--at leasta limited degree--of governmental intervention and control
through regulation can prove appropriate when justified
under O'Brien (at least when not "content based"). Ante,at 197, 208-213; see also Defendants' Joint Statement of Evidence before Congress |||| 12-21, 31-59 (App. 1254-1258,1262-1274) (JSCR); Cable Television Consumer Protection

United Broadcasting Co., 10 F. C. C. 515 (1945); New Broadcasting Co., 6 P & F Radio Reg. 258 (1950). I also agree
that, without the statute, cable systems would likely carry
significantly fewer over-the-air stations, ante, at 191, 202-
205, that station revenues would therefore decline, ante, at
208-213, and that the quality of over-the-air programming
on such stations would almost inevitably suffer, e. g., JSCR
|||| 596, 704-706 (App. 1544, 1600-1601); Rebuttal Declaration
of Roger G. Noll |||| 5, 11, 34, 38 (App. 1790, 1793, 1804-1805,
1806). I agree further that the burden the statute imposes
upon the cable system, potential cable programmers, and
cable viewers is limited and will diminish as typical cable
system capacity grows over time.

Finally, I believe that Congress could reasonably conclude
that the statute will help the typical over-the-air viewer (by
maintaining an expanded range of choice) more than it will
hurt the typical cable subscriber (by restricting cable slots
otherwise available for preferred programming). The latter's cable choices are many and varied, and the range of
choice is rapidly increasing. The former's over-the-air
choice is more restricted; and, as cable becomes more popular, it may well become still more restricted insofar as the
over-the-air market shrinks and thereby, by itself, becomes

less profitable. In these circumstances, I do not believe theFirst Amendment dictates a result that favors the cable

viewers' interests.These and other similar factors discussed by the majority
lead me to agree that the statute survives "intermediate
scrutiny," whether or not the statute is properly tailored toCongress' purely economic objectives.

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Scalia, Justice
Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In sustaining the must-carry provisions of the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992 (Cable Act),Pub. L. 102-385, $$ 4-5, 106 Stat. 1460, against a First

Amendment challenge by cable system operators and cableprogrammers, the Court errs in two crucial respects. First,
the Court disregards one of the principal defenses of the
statute urged by appellees on remand: that it serves a substantial interest in preserving "diverse," "quality" programming that is "responsive" to the needs of the local community. The course of this litigation on remand and the
proffered defense strongly reinforce my view that the Court
adopted the wrong analytic framework in the prior phase of
this case. See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,
512 U. S. 622, 643-651 (1994) (Turner); id., at 675-680
(O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).
Second, the Court misapplies the "intermediate scrutiny"
framework it adopts. Although we owe deference to Congress' predictive judgments and its evaluation of complex
economic questions, we have an independent duty to identify
with care the Government interests supporting the scheme,
to inquire into the reasonableness of congressional findings
regarding its necessity, and to examine the fit between its
goals and its consequences. Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S.

I did not join those portions of the principal opinion inTurner holding that the must-carry provisions of the Cable

Act are content neutral and therefore subject to intermedi-ate First Amendment scrutiny. 512 U. S., at 643-651. The
Court there referred to the "unusually detailed statutoryfindings" accompanying the Cable Act, in which Congress
recognized the importance of preserving sources of localnews, public affairs, and educational programming.

Id., at646; see id., at 632-634, 648. Nevertheless, the Court minimized the significance of these findings, suggesting that theymerely reflected Congress' view of the "intrinsic value" of
broadcast programming generally, rather than a congres-sional preference for programming with local, educational, or
informational content. Id., at 648.In

Turner, the Court drew upon Senate and House Re-ports to identify three "interests" that the must-carry provisions were designed to serve: "(1) preserving the benefits offree, over-the-air local broadcast television, (2) promoting
the widespread dissemination of information from a multi-plicity of sources, and (3) promoting fair competition in the
market for television programming." Id., at 662 (citingS. Rep. No. 102-92, p. 58 (1991); H. R. Rep. No. 102-628,
p. 63 (1992)). The Court reiterates these interests here,
ante, at 189-190, but neither the principal opinion nor thepartial concurrence ever explains the relationship between

them with any clarity.Much of the principal opinion treats the must-carry provisions as a species of antitrust regulation enacted by Con-gress in response to a perceived threat that cable system
operators would otherwise engage in various forms of anti-competitive conduct resulting in harm to broadcasters.
E. g., ante, at 191, 196-208. The Court recognizes that ap520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

pellees cannot show an anticompetitive threat to broadcasttelevision simply by demonstrating that "a few" broadcast

stations would be forced off the air in the absence of must-carry.

Ante, at 191; see Brief for Federal Appellees 14, 17,
18. No party has ever questioned that adverse carriage decisions by cable operators will threaten some broadcastersin some markets. The notion that Congress premised the

must-carry provisions upon a far graver threat to the struc-ture of the local broadcast system than the loss of "a few"
stations runs through virtually every passage in the princi-pal

Turner opinion that discusses the Government interests
the provisions were designed to serve. See, e. g., 512 U. S.,
at 647 (recognizing substantiality of interest in " `protecting
noncable households from loss of regular television broadcasting service due to competition from cable systems' "
(quoting Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691,
714 (1984) (emphasis added))); 512 U. S., at 652 ("Congress
sought to preserve the existing structure of the Nation's
broadcast television medium, . . . and, in particular, to ensure that broadcast television remains available as a source
of video programming for those without cable" (emphasis
added)); id., at 663 (recognizing interest in "maintaining the
local broadcasting structure"); id., at 664-665 (plurality opinion) (characterizing inquiry as whether Government "has adequately shown that the economic health of local broadcasting is in genuine jeopardy" (emphasis added)); id., at 665
(noting Government's reliance on Congress' finding that "absent mandatory carriage rules, the continued viability of
local broadcast television would be `seriously jeopardized' "
(quoting Cable Act, $ 2(a)(16) (emphasis added))); id., at 666
(recognizing Government's assertion that "the must-carry
rules are necessary to protect the viability of broadcast television" (emphasis added)). Ostensibly adopting this framework, the Court now asks whether Congress could reasonably have thought the must-carry regime necessary to
prevent a "significant reduction in the multiplicity of broad520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

cast programming sources available to noncable households."
Ante, at 193 (emphasis added).

I fully agree that promoting fair competition is a legiti-mate and substantial Government goal. But the Court nowhere examines whether the breadth of the must-carry provisions comports with a goal of preventing anticompetitiveharms. Instead, in the course of its inquiry into whether the

must-carry provisions are "narrowly tailored," the principalopinion simply assumes that most adverse carriage decisions
are anticompetitively motivated, and that must-carry istherefore a measured response to a problem of anticompetitive behavior. Ante, at 216-217. We ordinarily do
not substitute unstated and untested assumptions for our

independent evaluation of the facts bearing upon an issue
of constitutional law. See Schaumburg v. Citizens for a
Better Environment, 444 U. S. 620, 636 (1980).

Perhaps because of the difficulty of defending the mustcarry provisions as a measured response to anticompetitive
behavior, the Court asserts an "independent" interest in preserving a "multiplicity" of broadcast programming sources.
Ante, at 194; ante, at 226-227 (Breyer, J., concurring in
part). In doing so, the Court posits existence of "conduct
that threatens" the availability of broadcast television outlets, quite apart from anticompetitive conduct. Ante, at 194.
We are left to wonder what precisely that conduct might be.
Moreover, when separated from anticompetitive conduct,
this interest in preserving a "multiplicity of broadcast programming sources" becomes poorly defined. Neither the
principal opinion nor the partial concurrence offers any guidance on what might constitute a "significant reduction" in
the availability of broadcast programming. The proper
analysis, in my view, necessarily turns on the present distribution of broadcast stations among the local broadcast
markets that make up the national broadcast "system."
Whether cable poses a "significant" threat to a local broadcast market depends first on how many broadcast stations in

520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

233Cite as: 520 U. S. 180 (1997)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
that market will, in the absence of must-carry, remain avail-able to viewers in noncable households. It also depends on

whether viewers actually watch the stations that aredropped or denied carriage. The Court provides some raw
data on adverse carriage decisions, but it never connects
those data to markets and viewership. Instead, the Courtproceeds from the assumptions that adverse carriage decisions nationwide will affect broadcast markets in proportionto their size; and that all broadcast programming is watched
by viewers. Neither assumption is logical or has any factualbasis in the record.

Appellees bear the burden of demonstrating that the provisions of the Cable Act restricting expressive activity survive constitutional scrutiny. See Turner, supra, at 664. As
discussed below, the must-carry provisions cannot be justified as a narrowly tailored means of addressing anticompetitive behavior. See infra, at 235-257; ante, at 225, 226, 227-
228 (Breyer, J., concurring in part). As a result, the
Court's inquiry into whether must-carry would prevent a
"significant reduction in the multiplicity of broadcast programming sources" collapses into an analysis of an ill-defined
and generalized interest in maintaining broadcast stations,
wherever they might be threatened and whatever their
viewership. Neither the principal opinion nor the partial
concurrence ever explains what kind of conduct, apart from
anticompetitive conduct, threatens the "multiplicity" of
broadcast programming sources. Indeed, the only justification advanced by the parties for furthering this interest is
heavily content based. It is undisputed that the broadcast
stations protected by must-carry are the "marginal" stations
within a given market, see infra, at 244; the record on remand reveals that any broader threat to the broadcast system was entirely mythical. Pressed to explain the importance of preserving noncable viewers' access to "vulnerable"
broadcast stations, appellees emphasize that the must-carry
rules are necessary to ensure that broadcast stations main520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tain "diverse," "quality" programming that is "responsive"to the needs of the local community. Brief for Federal Appellees 13, 30; see Brief for Appellees National Associationof Broadcasters et al. 36-37 (NAB Brief); Tr. of Oral Arg.
29, 42; see also ante, at 226 (Breyer, J., concurring in part)
( justifying must-carry as a means of preventing a decline in"quality and quantity of programming choice"). Must-carry

is thus justified as a way of preserving viewers' access toa Spanish or Chinese language station or of preventing an
independent station from adopting a home-shopping format.NAB Brief 28, 33; Brief for Federal Appellees 31; Tr. of Oral
Arg. 32-33. Undoubtedly, such goals are reasonable and important, and the stations in question may well be worthwhile
targets of Government subsidies. But appellees' characterization of must-carry as a means of protecting these stations,
like the Court's explicit concern for promoting " `community
self-expression' " and the " `local origination of broadcast programming,' " ante, at 192, 193 (brackets omitted), reveals a
content-based preference for broadcast programming. This
justification of the regulatory scheme is, in my view, wholly
at odds with the Turner Court's premise that must-carry is
a means of preserving "access to free television programming--whatever its content," 512 U. S., at 649 (emphasis
added).

I do not read Justice Breyer's opinion--which analyzes
the must-carry rules in part as a "speech-enhancing" measure designed to ensure a "rich mix" of over-the-air programming, see ante, at 226, 227--to treat the content of over-theair programming as irrelevant to whether the Government's
interest in promoting it is an important one. The net result
appears to be that five Justices of this Court do not view
must-carry as a narrowly tailored means of serving a substantial governmental interest in preventing anticompetitive
behavior; and that five Justices of this Court do see the
significance of the content of over-the-air programming to
the Government's and appellees' efforts to defend the law.

Under these circumstances, the must-carry provisions shouldbe subject to strict scrutiny, which they surely fail.

II
The principal opinion goes to great lengths to avoid ac-knowledging that preferences for "quality," "diverse," and

"responsive" local programming underlie the must-carryscheme, although the partial concurrence's reliance on such
preferences is explicit. See ante, at 226 (opinion of Breyer,
J.). I take the principal opinion at its word and evaluate theclaim that the threat of anticompetitive behavior by cable

operators supplies a content-neutral basis for sustaining thestatute. It does not.

The Turner Court remanded the case for a determinationwhether the must-carry provisions satisfy intermediate scrutiny under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U. S. 367 (1968).Under that standard, appellees must demonstrate that the
must-carry provisions (1) "furthe[r] an important or substan-tial government interest"; and (2) burden speech no more
"than is essential to the furtherance of that interest." Id.,at 377; see also

Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781,799 (1989). The Turner plurality found that genuine issues

of material fact remained as to both parts of the O'Brienanalysis. On whether must-carry furthers a substantial
governmental interest, the Turner Court remanded the caseto test two essential and unproven propositions: "(1) that unless cable operators are compelled to carry broadcast sta-tions,

significant numbers of broadcast stations will be re-fused carriage on cable systems; and (2) that the broadcast

stations denied carriage will either deteriorate to a substantial degree or fail altogether." 512 U. S., at 666 (emphasisadded). As for whether must-carry restricts no more

speech than essential to further Congress' asserted purpose,the Turner plurality found evidence lacking on the extent of
the burden that the must-carry provisions would place oncable operators and cable programmers. Id., at 667-668.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
The District Court resolved this case on cross-motions for
summary judgment. As the Court recognizes, ante, at 211,
the fact that the evidence before Congress might have been
in conflict will not necessarily preclude summary judgment
upholding the must-carry scheme. The question, rather, is
what the undisputed facts show about the reasonableness of
Congress' conclusions. We are not, however, at liberty to
substitute speculation for evidence or to ignore factual disputes that call the reasonableness of Congress' findings into
question. The evidence on remand demonstrates that appellants, not appellees, are entitled to summary judgment.

A
The principal opinion devotes substantial discussion to the
structure of the cable industry, see ante, at 197, 206-207, a
matter that was uncontroversial in Turner. See, e. g., 512
U. S., at 627-628, 632-633, 639-640; id., at 684 (O'Connor,
J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). As of 1992,
cable already served 60 percent of American households. I
agree with the observation that Congress could reasonably
predict an increase in cable penetration of the local video
programming market. Ante, at 197. Local franchising requirements and the expense of constructing a cable system
to serve a particular area make it possible for cable franchisees to exercise a monopoly over cable service. 512 U. S.,
at 633. Nor was it ever disputed that some cable system
operators own large numbers of systems nationwide, or that
some cable systems are affiliated with cable programmers.

What was not resolved in Turner was whether "reasonableinferences based on substantial evidence," 512 U. S., at 666

(plurality opinion), supported Congress' judgment that themust-carry provisions were necessary "to prevent cable operators from exploiting their economic power to the det-riment of broadcasters,"

id., at 649. Because I remainconvinced that the statute is not a measured response

to congressional concerns about monopoly power, see infra,at 249-256, in my view the principal opinion's discussion on
this point is irrelevant. But even if it were relevant, it isincorrect.

1
The Turner plurality recognized that Congress' interestin curtailing anticompetitive behavior is substantial "in the

abstract." 512 U. S., at 664. The principal opinion nowconcludes that substantial evidence supports the congressional judgment that cable operators have incentives to en-gage in significant anticompetitive behavior. It appears to
accept two related arguments on this point: first, that ver-tically integrated cable operators prefer programming
produced by their affiliated cable programming networks tobroadcast programming, ante, at 198-199, 200; and second,
that potential advertising revenues supply cable system op-erators, whether affiliated with programmers or not, with
incentives to prefer cable programming to broadcast pro-gramming,

ante, at 200-202.To support the first proposition, the principal opinion

states that "[e]xtensive testimony" before Congress showedthat in fact operators do have incentives to favor vertically
integrated programmers. Ante, at 198. This testimony,noteworthy as it may be, is primarily that of persons appearing before Congress on behalf of the private appellees in thiscase. Compare

ante, at 198-199, with Competitive Issues inthe Cable Television Industry: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights of theSenate Committee on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 2d Sess.,

the testimony of interested persons with a degree of skepticism when our task is to engage in " `independent judgment
of the facts bearing on an issue of constitutional law.' "
Turner, supra, at 666 (plurality opinion) (quoting Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S., at 129). Moreover, even accepting as reasonable Congress' conclusion that
cable operators have incentives to favor affiliated programmers, Congress has already limited the number of channels
on a cable system that can be occupied by affiliated programmers. 47 U. S. C. $ 533(f )(1)(B); 47 CFR $ 76.504 (1995).
Once a cable system operator reaches that cap, it can no
longer bump a broadcaster in favor of an affiliated programmer. If Congress were concerned that broadcasters favored
too many affiliated programmers, it could simply adjust the
cap. Must-carry simply cannot be justified as a response to
the allegedly "substantial" problem of vertical integration.

The second argument, that the quest for advertising revenue will supply cable operators with incentives to drop local
broadcasters, takes two forms. First, some cable programmers offer blank slots within a program into which a cable
operator can insert advertisements; appellees argue that

520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

239Cite as: 520 U. S. 180 (1997)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
"[t]he opportunity to sell such advertising gives cable pro-grammers an additional value to operators above broadcast

stations . . . ." Brief for Federal Appellees 24. But that"additional value" arises only because the must-carry provisions require cable operators to carry broadcast signals without alteration. 47 U. S. C. $ 534(b)(3). Judge Williams wascorrect in noting that the Government cannot have "a `substantial interest' in remedying a competitive distortion thatarises entirely out of a detail in its own purportedly remedial
legislation." 910 F. Supp. 734, 777 (DC 1995) (dissentingopinion). Second, appellees claim that since cable operators
compete directly with broadcasters for some advertising revenue, operators will profit if they can drive broadcasters out
of the market and capture their advertising revenue. Even
if the record before Congress included substantial evidence
that "advertising revenue would be of increasing importance
to cable operators as subscribership growth began to flatten," ante, at 203, it does not necessarily follow that Congress could reasonably find that the quest for advertising
revenues supplies cable operators with incentives to engage
in predatory behavior, or that must-carry is a reasonable response to such incentives. There is no dispute that a cable
system depends primarily upon its subscriber base for revenue. A cable operator is therefore unlikely to drop a widely
viewed station in order to capture advertising revenues--
which, according to the figures of appellees' expert, account
for between one and five percent of the total revenues of
most large cable systems. Declaration of James N. Dertouzos || 22 (App. 967). In doing so, it would risk losing subscribers. Nevertheless, appellees contend that cable operators will drop some broadcast stations in spite of, and not
because of, viewer preferences. The principal opinion suggests that viewers are likely to subscribe to cable even
though they prefer certain over-the-air programming to
cable programming, because they would be willing to trade
access to their preferred channel for access to dozens of cable

channels. Ante, at 202. Even assuming that, at the mar-gin, advertising revenues would drive cable systems to drop

some stations--invariably described as "vulnerable" or"smaller" independents, see NAB Brief 22; Brief for Federal
Appellees 25, and n. 14--the strategy's success would dependupon the additional untested premise that the advertising
revenues freed by dropping a broadcast station will flow tocable operators rather than to

other broadcasters.

2
Under the standard articulated by the Turner plurality,the conclusion that must-carry serves a substantial governmental interest depends upon the "essential propositio[n]"that, without must-carry, "significant numbers of broadcast
stations will be refused carriage on cable systems." 512U. S., at 666. In analyzing whether this undefined standard
is satisfied, the Court focuses almost exclusively on raw num-bers of stations denied carriage or "repositioned"--that is,
shifted out of their traditional channel positions.The Court begins its discussion of evidence of adverse carriage decisions with the 1988 study sponsored by the FederalCommunications Commission (FCC). Ante, at 202-203; see
Cable System Broadcast Signal Carriage Survey, Staff Re-port by the Policy and Rules Division, Mass Media Bureau
(Sept. 1, 1988) (App. 37). But in Turner, the plurality criti-cized this very study, noting that it did not indicate the timeframe within which carriage denials occurred or whether thestations were later restored to their positions. 512 U. S., at
667. As for the evidence in the record before Congress,these gaps persist; the Court relies on a study of

public tele-vision stations to support the proposition that "in the vast

majority of cases, dropped stations were not restored to thecable service."

Ante, at 203.In canvassing the additional evidence offered on remand,

the Court focuses on the suggestion of one of appellees' ex-perts that the 1988 FCC survey underestimated the number

O'Connor, J., dissenting
of drops of broadcast stations in the non-must-carry era.The data do not indicate which of these stations would now

qualify for mandatory carriage. Appellees' expert framesthe relevant drop statistic as "subscriber instances"--that is,
the number of drop instances multiplied by the number of
cable subscribers affected. Declaration of Tom Meek || 17(Meek Declaration) (App. 623). Two-thirds of the "subscriber instances" of drops existing as of mid-1992 remaineduncured as of mid-1994, fully 19 months after the present
must-carry rules went into effect. Meek Declaration, At-tachment C (Record, Defendants' Joint Submission of Expert
Affidavits and Reports in Support of Motion for Summary
Judgment, Vol. II.A, Exh. 2). The Court discounts the importance of whether dropped stations now qualify for mandatory carriage, on the ground that requiring any such showing
places an "improper burden" on the Legislative Branch.
Ante, at 213. It seems obvious, however, that if the mustcarry rules will not reverse those adverse carriage decisions
on which appellees rely to illustrate the Government "interest" supporting the rules, then a significant question remains
as to whether the rules in fact serve the articulated interest.
Without some further analysis, I do not see how the Court
can, in the course of its independent scrutiny on a question
of constitutional law, deem Congress' judgment "reasonable."

In any event, the larger problem with the Court's approach
is that neither the FCC study nor the additional evidence on
remand canvassed by the Court, ante, at 204-207, says anything about the broadcast markets in which adverse carriage
decisions take place. The Court accepts Congress' stated
concern about preserving the availability of a "multiplicity"
of broadcast stations, but apparently thinks it sufficient to
evaluate that concern in the abstract, without considering
how much local service is already available in a given broadcast market. Ante, at 212-213; see also ante, at 226-227
(Breyer, J., concurring in part). I address this gap in the
Court's discussion at greater length below, infra, at 247-250,

by examining the reasonableness of Congress' predictionthat adverse carriage decisions will inflict severe harm on

broadcast stations.Nor can we evaluate whether must-carry is necessary to
serve an interest in preserving broadcast stations without
examining the value of the stations protected by the must-carry scheme to viewers in noncable households. By disregarding the distribution and viewership of stations not car-ried on cable, the Court upholds the must-carry provisions
without addressing the interests of the over-the-air televi-sion viewers that Congress purportedly seeks to protect.
See Turner, 512 U. S., at 647 (describing interest in "protecting noncable households from loss of regular television
broadcasting service" (emphasis added; internal quotation
marks omitted)); id., at 652 (describing interest in ensuring that broadcast television remains available as a source
of video programming for those without cable); ante, at 193
(describing interest in preventing "any significant reduction
in the multiplicity of broadcast programming sources available to noncable households" (emphasis added)). The Court
relies on analyses suggesting that, as of 1992, the typical
independent commercial broadcaster was being denied carriage on cable systems serving 47 percent of subscribers in
its local market, and the typical noncommercial station was
denied carriage on cable systems serving 36 percent of subscribers in its local market. Ante, at 204. The only analysis in the record of the relationship between carriage and
noncable viewership favors the appellants. A 1991 study by
Federal Trade Commission staff concluded that most cable
systems voluntarily carried broadcast stations with any
reportable ratings in noncable households and that most
instances of noncarriage involved "relatively remote (and
duplicated) network stations, or local stations that few
viewers watch." Carriage of Television Broadcast Signals

30 percent of all local broadcast stations with no reportableratings).

Appellees claim there are various methodological flaws in
each study, including appellants' expert's reliance on Nielsen
data to measure viewership shares. A protective order entered by the District Court in this case prevents the parties
from contesting the accuracy of such data. App. 321. But
appellees--who bear the burden of proof in this case--offer
no alternative measure of the viewership in noncable households of stations dropped or denied carriage. Instead, appellees and their experts repeatedly emphasize the importance of preserving "vulnerable" or "marginal" independent
stations serving "relatively small" audiences. Brief for Federal Appellees 14, 17, 25, n. 14; NAB Brief 31; see also

this: even the lowest rated commercial stations attract view-ers, and the lowest rated noncommercial stations attract

members"). The Court suggests that it is appropriate todisregard the low noncable viewership of stations denied carriage, because in some instances cable viewers preferred thedropped broadcast channels to the cable channels that replaced them. Ante, at 206. The viewership statistics inquestion, as well as their significance, are sharply disputed,
but they are also irrelevant. The issue is whether the Gov-ernment can demonstrate a substantial interest in forced carriage of certain broadcast stations, for the benefit of viewerswho lack access to cable. That inquiry is not advanced by
an analysis of relative cable household viewership of broad-cast and cable programming. When appellees are pressed
to explain the Government's "substantial interest" in pre-serving noncable viewers' access to "vulnerable" or "marginal" stations with "relatively small" audiences, it becomesevident that the interest has nothing to do with anticompetitive behavior, but has everything to do with content--pre-serving "quality" local programming that is "responsive" to
community needs. Brief for Federal Appellees 13, 30. In-deed,

Justice Breyer expressly declines to accept the anti-competitive rationale for the must-carry rules embraced by

the principal opinion, and instead explicitly relies on a needto preserve a "rich mix" of "quality" programming. Ante,
at 226 (opinion concurring in part).

I turn now to the evidence of harm to broadcasters deniedcarriage or repositioned. The Court remanded for a determination whether broadcast stations denied carriage wouldbe at " `serious risk of financial difficulty' " and would " `deteriorate to a substantial degree or fail altogether.' " Ante, at208 (quoting Turner, 512 U. S., at 667, 666). The Turner
plurality noted that there was no evidence that "local broad-cast stations have fallen into bankruptcy, turned in their

O'Connor, J., dissenting
broadcast licenses, curtailed their broadcast operations, orsuffered a serious reduction in operating revenues" because

of adverse carriage decisions. Id., at 667. The record onremand does not permit the conclusion, at the summary judgment stage, that Congress could reasonably have predicted
serious harm to a significant number of stations in the ab-sence of must-carry.

The purported link between an adverse carriage decisionand severe harm to a station depends on yet another untested premise. Even accepting the conclusion that a cablesystem operator has a monopoly over

cable services to the
home, supra, at 237, it does not necessarily follow that the
operator also has a monopoly over all video services to cabled
households. Cable subscribers using an input selector
switch and an antenna can receive broadcast signals. Widespread use of such switches would completely eliminate any
cable system "monopoly" over sources of video input. See
910 F. Supp., at 786 (Williams, J., dissenting). Growing use
of direct-broadcast satellite television also tends to undercut
the notion that cable operators have an inevitable monopoly
over video services entering cable households. See, e. g.,
Farhi, Dishing Out the Competition to Cable TV, Washington
Post, Oct. 12, 1996, at H1, col. 3.

In the Cable Act, Congress rejected the wisdom of any
"substantial societal investment" in developing input selector
switch technology. $ 2(a)(18). In defending this choice, the
Court purports to identify "substantial evidence of technological shortcomings" that prevent widespread, efficient use
of such devices. But nearly all of the "data" in question are
drawn from sources predating the enactment of must-carry
by roughly six years. Compare ante, at 219-220, with Defendants' Joint Statement of Evidence Before Congress || 725

The Court concludes that the evidence on remand meets
the threshold of harm established in Turner. The Court begins with the "[c]onsiderable evidence" that broadcast stations denied carriage have fallen into bankruptcy. Ante, at
209. The analysis, however, does not focus on features of
the market in which these stations were located or on the
size of the audience they commanded. The "considerable
evidence" relied on by the Court consists of repeated references to the bankruptcies of the same 23 commercial independent stations--apparently, new stations. See JSCR

new stations seeking financing.
See ante, at 209 (citing JSCR |||| 643-658 (App. 1564-1576)).The Court also claims that the record on remand reflects

"considerable evidence" of stations curtailing their broadcast
operations or suffering reductions in operating revenues.
Ante, at 209. Most of the anecdotal accounts of harm on
which the Court relies are sharply disputed. CompareJSCR |||| 618, 619, 622, 623, 692 (App. 1553-1555, 1591), with

Time Warner Entertainment Company, L. P.'s BroadcastStation Rebuttal || 8 (App. 2299) (ABC affiliate claiming
harm from denial of carriage experienced $3.8 million net
revenue increase between 1986 and 1992); id., || 111 (App.
2403) (Home Shopping Network affiliate did not report to
Congress that it was harmed by cable operator conduct between 1986 and 1992); id., || 83 (App. 2372-2373) (station alleged to have lost half of its cable carriage in fact obtained

claimed anticompetitive carriage denials were precluded
from carrying station due to signal strength and quality
problems). Congress' reasonable conclusions are entitled to
deference, and for that reason the fact that the evidence is
in conflict will not necessarily preclude summary judgment
in appellees' favor. Nevertheless, in the course of our independent review, we cannot ignore sharp conflicts in the record that call into question the reasonableness of Congress'
findings.

Moreover, unlike other aspects of the record on remand,
the station-specific accounts cited by the Court do permit an
evaluation of trends in the various broadcast markets, or
"areas of dominant influence," in which carriage denials allegedly caused harm. The Court does not conduct this sort

of analysis. Were it to do so, the Court would have to recog-nize that all but

one of the commercial broadcast stations
cited as claiming a curtailment in operations or a decline inrevenue was broadcasting within an area of dominant influence that experienced net growth, or at least no net reduction, in the number of commercial broadcast stations operat-ing during the non-must-carry era. See Besen Declaration,

Exh. 11 (App. 861-869); cf. JSCR || 618 (App. 1553) (stationclaiming harm within Cedar Rapids market, with four commercial broadcast stations in 1987 and five in 1992); id., || 620(App. 1554) (station claiming harm within Tulsa market, with
seven commercial broadcast stations in 1987 and 1992); id.,

City market, with 14 commercial broadcast stations in 1987
and 1992); id., || 692 (App. 1591) (station claiming harm
within Salt Lake City market, with five commercial broadcast stations in 1987 and eight in 1992); id., || 695 (App. 1593-

seven commercial broadcast stations in 1987 and nine in
1992); id., || 703 (App. 1599) (station claiming harm within
Grand Rapids market, with seven commercial broadcast
stations in 1987 and 1992). Indeed, in 499 of 504 areas of
dominant influence nationwide, the number of commercial
broadcast stations operating in 1992 equaled or exceeded
the number operating in 1987. Besen Declaration, Exh. 11
(App. 861-869). Only two areas of dominant influence experienced a reduction in the number of noncommercial broadcast stations operating between 1987 and 1992. Ibid. (App.
871-880).

In sum, appellees are not entitled to summary judgment
on whether Congress could conclude, based on reasonable
inferences drawn from substantial evidence, that " `absent
legislative action, the free local off-air broadcast system is
endangered.' " Ante, at 209 (quoting S. Rep. No. 102-92, at
42). The Court acknowledges that the record contains much
evidence of the health of the broadcast industry, including

O'Connor, J., dissenting
evidence that 263 new broadcast stations signed on the airin the period without must-carry rules, evidence of growth

in stations' advertising revenue, and evidence of voluntarycarriage of broadcast stations accounting for virtually all
measurable viewership in noncable households. Ante, at210-211. But the Court dismisses such evidence, emphasizing that the question is not whether Congress correctly de-termined that must-carry is necessary to prevent significant
financial hardship to a substantial number of stations, butwhether "the legislative conclusion was reasonable and supported by substantial evidence in the record before Con-gress."

Ante, at 211. Even accepting the Court's articula-tion of the relevant standard, it is not properly applied here.

The principal opinion disavows a need to closely scrutinizethe logic of the regulatory scheme at issue on the ground
that it "need not put [its] imprimatur on Congress' economictheory in order to validate the reasonableness of its judgment." Ante, at 208. That approach trivializes the FirstAmendment issue at stake in this case. A highly dubious
economic theory has been advanced as the "substantial inter-est" supporting a First Amendment burden on cable operators and cable programmers. In finding that must-carryserves a substantial interest, the principal opinion necessarily accepts that theory. The partial concurrence does not,but neither does it articulate what threat to the availability
of a "multiplicity" of broadcast stations would exist in a per-fectly competitive market.

B
I turn now to the second portion of the O'Brien inquiry,which concerns the fit between the Government's asserted

interests and the means chosen to advance them. TheCourt observes that "broadcast stations gained carriage on
5,880 channels as a result of must-carry," and recognizes thatthis forced carriage imposes a burden on cable system operators and cable programmers. Ante, at 215. But the Courtalso concludes that the other 30,006 cable channels occupied

250 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

O'Connor, J., dissenting
by broadcast stations are irrelevant to measuring the burdenof the must-carry scheme. The must-carry rules prevent

operators from dropping these broadcast stations shouldother more desirable cable programming become available,
even though operators have carried these stations voluntarily in the past. The must-carry requirements thus burdenan operator's First Amendment freedom to exercise unfettered control over a number of channels in its system,whether or not the operator's present choice is aligned with
that of the Government.Even assuming that the Court is correct that the 5,880
channels occupied by added broadcasters "represent the actual burden of the regulatory scheme," ibid., the Court's leap
to the conclusion that must-carry "is narrowly tailored to
preserve a multiplicity of broadcast stations," ante, at 215-
216, is nothing short of astounding. The Court's logic is circular. Surmising that most of the 5,880 channels added by
the regulatory scheme would be dropped in its absence, the
Court concludes that the figure also approximates the "benefit" of must-carry. Finding the scheme's burden "congruent" to the benefit it affords, the Court declares the statute
narrowly tailored. The Court achieves this result, however,
only by equating the effect of the statute--requiring cable
operators to add 5,880 stations--with the governmental interest sought to be served. The Court's citation of Ward v.
Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781 (1989), reveals the true
nature of the interest at stake. The "evi[l] the Government
seeks to eliminate," id., at 799, n. 7, is not the failure of cable
operators to carry these 5,880 stations. Rather, to read the
first half of the principal opinion, the "evil" is anticompetitive behavior by cable operators. As a factual matter, we
do not know whether these stations were not carried because
of anticompetitive impulses. Positing the effect of a statute
as the governmental interest "can sidestep judicial review
of almost any statute, because it makes all statutes look
narrowly tailored." Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of

O'Connor, J., dissenting
N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U. S. 105, 120 (1991).Without a sense whether

most adverse carriage decisions are
anticompetitively motivated, it is improper to conclude thatthe statute is narrowly tailored simply because it prevents

some adverse carriage decisions. See Board of Trustees of
State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (scope oflaw must be "in proportion to the interest served") (internal

quotation marks omitted).In my view, the statute is not narrowly tailored to serve a
substantial interest in preventing anticompetitive conduct.I do not understand

Justice Breyer to disagree with this
conclusion. Ante, at 227 (examining fit between "speechrestricting and speech-enhancing consequences" of mustcarry). Congress has commandeered up to one-third of each
cable system's channel capacity for the benefit of local broadcasters, without any regard for whether doing so advances
the statute's alleged goals. To the extent that Congress was
concerned that anticompetitive impulses would lead vertically integrated operators to prefer those programmers in
which the operators have an ownership stake, the Cable Act
is overbroad, since it does not impose its requirements solely
on such operators. An integrated cable operator cannot satisfy its must-carry obligations by allocating a channel to an
unaffiliated cable programmer. And must-carry blocks an
operator's access to up to one-third of the channels on the
system, even if its affiliated programmer provides programming for only a single channel. The Court rejects this logic,
finding the possibility that the must-carry regime would require reversal of a benign carriage decision not "so prevalent
that must-carry is substantially overbroad." Ante, at 216.
The principal opinion reasons that "cable systems serving 70
percent of subscribers are vertically integrated with cable
programmers, so anticompetitive motives may be implicated in a majority of systems' decisions not to carry broadcasters." Ante, at 216-217 (emphasis added). It is unclear
whether the principal opinion means that anticompetitive

252 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

O'Connor, J., dissenting
motives may be implicated in a majority of decisions, or indecisions by a majority of

systems. In either case, the principal opinion's conclusion is wholly speculative. We do notknow which of these vertically integrated systems are affiliated with one cable programmer and which are affiliated
with five cable programmers. Moreover, Congress hasplaced limits upon the number of channels that can be used

for affiliated programming. 47 U. S. C. $ 533(f)(1)(B). Theprincipal opinion does not suggest why these limits are inadequate or explain why, once a system reaches the limit, itsremaining carriage decisions would also be anticompetitively
motivated. Even if the channel limits are insufficient, the
principal opinion does not explain why requiring carriage of
broadcast stations on one-third of the system's channels is a
measured response to the problem.

Finally, I note my disagreement with the Court's suggestion that the availability of less-speech-restrictive alternatives is never relevant to O'Brien's narrow tailoring inquiry.
Ante, at 217-218. The Turner Court remanded this case in
part because a plurality concluded that "judicial findings
concerning the availability and efficacy of constitutionally
acceptable less restrictive means of achieving the Government's asserted interests" were lacking in the original record. 512 U. S., at 668 (internal quotation marks omitted).
The Court's present position on this issue is puzzling.

Our cases suggest only that we have not interpreted the
narrow tailoring inquiry to "require elimination of all less
restrictive alternatives." Fox, supra, at 478. Put another
way, we have refrained from imposing a least-restrictivemeans requirement in cases involving intermediate First
Amendment scrutiny. Ward, supra, at 798 (time, place, and
manner restriction); Clark v. Community for Creative NonViolence, 468 U. S. 288, 293 (1984) (same); Fox, supra, at 478
(commercial speech). It is one thing to say that a regulation
need not be the least-speech-restrictive means of serving an
important governmental objective. It is quite another to

520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

253Cite as: 520 U. S. 180 (1997)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
suggest, as I read the majority to do here, that the availabil-ity of less-speech-restrictive alternatives cannot establish or

confirm that a regulation is substantially broader than neces-sary to achieve the Government's goals. While the validity
of a Government regulation subject to intermediate First
Amendment scrutiny does not turn on our "agreement withthe responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government inter-ests,"

United States v. Albertini, 472 U. S. 675, 689 (1985),
the availability of less intrusive approaches to a problemserves as a benchmark for assessing the reasonableness of

the fit between Congress' articulated goals and the means
chosen to pursue them, Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S.
476, 490-491 (1995).

As shown supra, at 251-252 and this page, in this case it
is plain without reference to any alternatives that the mustcarry scheme is "substantially broader than necessary,"
Ward, 491 U. S., at 800, to serve the only governmental interest that the principal opinion fully explains--preventing unfair competition. If Congress truly sought to address anticompetitive behavior by cable system operators, it passed
the wrong law. See Turner, supra, at 682 (O'Connor, J.,
concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("That some
speech within a broad category causes harm . . . does not
justify restricting the whole category"). Nevertheless, the
availability of less restrictive alternatives--a leased access
regime and subsidies--reinforces my conclusion that the
must-carry provisions are overbroad.

Consider first appellants' proposed leased access scheme,
under which a cable system operator would be required to
make a specified proportion of the system's channels available to broadcasters and independent cable programmers
alike at regulated rates. Leased access would directly address both vertical integration and predatory behavior, by
placing broadcasters and cable programmers on a level playing field for access to cable. The principal opinion never ex520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
254 TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC. v. FCC

O'Connor, J., dissenting
plicitly identifies any threat to the availability of broadcasttelevision to noncable households

other than anticompetitive
conduct, nor does Justice Breyer's partial concurrence.Accordingly, to the extent that leased access would address

problems of anticompetitive behavior, I fail to understand
why it would not achieve the goal of "ensuring that signifi-cant programming remains available" for noncable households. Ante, at 221. The Court observes that a leased ac-cess regime would, like must-carry, "reduce the number of
cable channels under cable systems' control in the same man-ner as must-carry."

Ibid. No leased access scheme is currently before the Court, and I intimate no view on whether
leased access, like must-carry, imposes unacceptable burdens
on cable operators' free speech interests. It is important to
note, however, that the Court's observation that a leased access scheme may, like must-carry, impose First Amendment
burdens does not dispose of the narrow tailoring inquiry in
this case. As noted, a leased access regime would respond
directly to problems of vertical integration and problems of
predatory behavior. Must-carry quite clearly does not respond to the problem of vertical integration. Supra, at 251-
253. In addition, the must-carry scheme burdens the rights
of cable programmers and cable operators; there is no suggestion here that leased access would burden cable programmers in the same way as must-carry does. In both of these
respects, leased access is a more narrowly tailored guard
against anticompetitive behavior. Finally, if, as the Court
suggests, Congress were concerned that a leased access
scheme would impose a burden on "small broadcasters"
forced to pay for access, subsidies would eliminate the
problem.

Subsidies would not, of course, eliminate anticompetitive
behavior by cable system operators--a problem that Congress could address directly or through a leased-access
scheme. Appellees defend the must-carry provisions, however, not only as a means of preventing anticompetitive

O'Connor, J., dissenting
behavior, but also as a means of protecting "marginal" or"vulnerable" stations, even if they are

not threatened by
anticompetitive behavior. The principal opinion chooses notto acknowledge this interest explicitly, although

Justice
Breyer does. Even if this interest were content neutral--
which it is not--subsidies would address it directly. TheCourt adopts appellees' position that subsidies would serve

a "very different purpose than must-carry. Must-carry isintended not to guarantee the financial health of all broadcasters, but to ensure a base number of broadcasters surviveto provide service to noncable households."

Ante, at 222;
see Brief for Federal Appellees 47. To the extent that
Justice Breyer sees must-carry as a "speech-enhancing"
measure designed to guarantee over-the-air broadcasters
"extra dollars," ante, at 226, it is unclear why subsidies
would not fully serve that interest. In any event, I take
appellees' concern to be that subsidies, unlike must-carry,
would save some broadcasters that would not survive even
with cable carriage. There is a straightforward solution to
this problem. If the Government is indeed worried that imprecision in allocation of subsidies would prop up stations
that would not survive even with cable carriage, then it could
tie subsidies to a percentage of stations' advertising revenues (or, for public stations, member contributions), determined by stations' access to viewers. For example, in a
broadcast market where 50 percent of television-viewing
households subscribe to cable, a broadcaster has access to all
households without cable as well as to those households
served by cable systems on which the broadcaster has secured carriage. If a broadcaster is carried on cable systems
serving only 20 percent of cable households (i. e., 10 percent
of all television-viewing households in the broadcast market),
the broadcaster has access to 60 percent of the televisionviewing households. If the Government provided a subsidy
to compensate for the loss in advertising revenue or member
contributions that a station would sustain by virtue of its

O'Connor, J., dissenting
failure to reach 40 percent of its potential audience, it couldensure that its allocation would do no more than protect

those broadcasters that would survive with full access totelevision-viewing households. In sum, the alleged barrier
to a precise allocation of subsidies is not insurmountable.The Court also suggests that a subsidy scheme would "involve the Government in making content-based determina-tions about programming."

Ante, at 222. Even if that isso, it does not distinguish subsidies from the must-carry

provisions. In light of the principal opinion's steadfast ad-herence to the position that a preference for "diverse" or

local-content broadcasting is not a content-based preference,the argument is ironic indeed.

III
Finally, I note my disagreement with the Court's decisionto sidestep a question reserved in

Turner, see 512 U. S., at643-644, n. 6; addressed by the District Court below, 910

F. Supp., at 750 (Sporkin, J.); fairly included within the ques-tion presented here; and argued by one of the appellants:
whether the must-carry rules requiring carriage of lowpower stations, 47 U. S. C. $ 534(c), survive constitutional
scrutiny. A low power station qualifies for carriage only ifthe FCC determines that the station's programming "would
address local news and informational needs which are notbeing adequately served by full power television broadcast
stations because of the geographic distance of such fullpower stations from the low power station's community of
license." $ 534(h)(2)(B). As the Turner Court noted, "thisaspect of $ 4 appears to single out certain low-power broadcasters for special benefits on the basis of content." 512U. S., at 644, n. 6. Because I believe that the must-carry
provisions fail even intermediate scrutiny, it is clear thatthey would fail scrutiny under a stricter content-based
standard.In declining to address the rules requiring carriage of low
power stations, the Court appears to question whether the

520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

257Cite as: 520 U. S. 180 (1997)
O'Connor, J., dissenting
issue was fairly included within the question presented or
properly preserved by the parties. Ante, at 224. This position is somewhat perplexing. The Court in Turner apparently found the issue both fairly included within the strikingly similar question presented there, compare Brief for
Federal Appellees in Turner, O. T. 1993, No. 93-44, p. I, with
Brief for Federal Appellees I, and properly preserved despite the lack of specific argumentation devoted to this
subsection of the challenged statute in the jurisdictional
statement there, see Juris. Statement in Turner, O. T. 1993,
No. 93-44, pp. 11-28. The Court's focus on the quantity of
briefing devoted to the subject, ante, at 224, ignores the fact
that there are two groups of appellants challenging the judgment below--cable operators and cable programmers--and
that the issue is of more interest to the former than to the
latter. It also seems to suggest that a party defending a
judgment can defeat this Court's review of a question simply
by ignoring its adversary's position on the merits.

In any event, the Court lets stand the District Court's seriously flawed legal reasoning on the point. The District
Court concluded that the provisions "are very close to
content-based legislation triggering strict scrutiny," but held
that they do not "cross the line." 910 F. Supp., at 750.
That conclusion appears to have been based on the fact that
the low power provisions are viewpoint neutral. Ibid.
Whether a provision is viewpoint neutral is irrelevant to the
question whether it is also content neutral. See R. A. V. v.
St. Paul, 505 U. S. 377, 430 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring
in judgment); Turner, supra, at 685 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

IV
In sustaining the must-carry provisions of the Cable Act,
the Court ignores the main justification of the statute urged
by appellees and subjects restrictions on expressive activity
to an inappropriately lenient level of scrutiny. The principal

520US1 Unit: $U38 [09-13-99 10:42:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

opinion then misapplies the analytic framework it chooses,exhibiting an extraordinary and unwarranted deference for

congressional judgments, a profound fear of delving intocomplex economic matters, and a willingness to substitute
untested assumptions for evidence. In light of gaps in logicand evidence, it is improper to conclude, at the summary
judgment stage, that the must-carry scheme serves a sig-nificant governmental interest "in a direct and effective
way." Ward, 491 U. S., at 800. Moreover, because the un-disputed facts demonstrate that the must-carry scheme is
plainly not narrowly tailored to serving the only govern-mental interest the principal opinion fully explains and
embraces--preventing anticompetitive behavior--appellantsare entitled to summary judgment in their favor.

Justice Breyer disavows the principal opinion's posi-tion on anticompetitive behavior, and instead treats the
must-carry rules as a "speech-enhancing" measure designedto ensure access to "quality" programming for noncable
households. Neither the principal opinion nor the partialconcurrence explains the nature of the alleged threat to the
availability of a "multiplicity of broadcast programmingsources," if that threat does not arise from cable operators'
anticompetitive conduct. Such an approach makes it impos-sible to discern whether Congress was addressing a problem
that is "real, not merely conjectural," and whether must-carry addresses the problem in a "direct and material way."
Turner, supra, at 664 (plurality opinion).I therefore respectfully dissent, and would reverse the
judgment below.

259OCTOBER TERM, 1996
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. LANIER
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe sixth circuit

No. 95-1717. Argued January 7, 1997--Decided March 31, 1997
Respondent Lanier was convicted under 18 U. S. C. $ 242 of criminally violating the constitutional rights of five women by assaulting them sexually while he served as a state judge. The jury had been instructed,
inter alia, that the Government had to prove as an element of the offense that Lanier had deprived the victims of their Fourteenth Amendment due process right to liberty, which included the right to be free
from sexually motivated physical assaults and coerced sexual battery.
The en banc Sixth Circuit set aside the convictions for lack of any notice
to the public that $ 242 covers simple or sexual assault crimes. Invoking general interpretive canons and Screws v. United States, 325 U. S.
91 (plurality opinion), the court held that $ 242 criminal liability may be
imposed only if the constitutional right said to have been violated is first
identified in a decision of this Court, and only when the right has been
held to apply in a factual situation "fundamentally similar" to the one at
bar. The court regarded these combined requirements as substantially
higher than the "clearly established" standard used to judge qualified
immunity in civil cases under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.

Held: The Sixth Circuit employed the wrong standard for determining

whether particular conduct falls within the range of criminal liability
under $ 242. Section 242's general language prohibiting "the deprivation of any rights . . . secured . . . by the Constitution" does not describe
the specific conduct it forbids, but--like its companion conspiracy statute, 18 U. S. C. $ 241--incorporates constitutional law by reference. Before criminal liability may be imposed for violation of any penal law, due
process requires "fair warning . . . of what the law intends." McBoyle
v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27. The touchstone is whether the statute, either standing alone or as construed by the courts, made it reasonably clear at the time of the charged conduct that the conduct was criminal. Section 242 was construed in light of this due process requirement
in Screws, supra. The Sixth Circuit erred in adding as a gloss to this
standard the requirement that a prior decision of this Court have declared the constitutional right at issue in a factual situation "fundamentally similar" to the one at bar. The Screws plurality referred in general terms to rights made specific by "decisions interpreting" the
Constitution, see 325 U. S., at 104; no subsequent case has confined the

Syllabus
universe of relevant decisions to the Court's opinions; and the Court
has specifically referred to Court of Appeals decisions in defining the
established scope of a constitutional right under $ 241, see Anderson v.
United States, 417 U. S. 211, 223-227, and in enquiring whether a right
was "clearly established" when applying the qualified immunity rule
under $ 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403
U. S. 388, see, e. g., Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 533. Nor has this
Court demanded precedents applying the right at issue to a "fundamentally similar" factual situation at the level of specificity meant by the
Sixth Circuit. Rather, the Court has upheld convictions under $ 241 or

$ 242 despite notable factual distinctions between prior cases and the
later case, so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that
the conduct at issue violated constitutional rights. See, e. g., United
States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 759, n. 17. The Sixth Circuit's view that
due process under $ 242 demands more than the "clearly established"
qualified immunity test under $ 1983 or Bivens is error. In effect that
test is simply the adaptation of the fair warning standard to give officials (and, ultimately, governments) the same protection from civil liability and its consequences that individuals have traditionally possessed in
the face of vague criminal statutes. As with official conduct under

$ 1983 or Bivens, liability may be imposed under $ 242 if, but only if, in
the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness of the defendant's conduct
is apparent. Pp. 264-272.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Respondent David Lanier was convicted under 18 U. S. C.$ 242 of criminally violating the constitutional rights of five

women by assaulting them sexually while Lanier served asa state judge. The Sixth Circuit reversed his convictions
on the ground that the constitutional right in issue had notpreviously been identified by this Court in a case with fundamentally similar facts. The question is whether this stand-ard of notice is higher than the Constitution requires, and
we hold that it is. I

David Lanier was formerly the sole state Chancery Courtjudge for two rural counties in western Tennessee. The
trial record, read most favorably to the jury's verdict, showsthat from 1989 to 1991, while Lanier was in office, he sexually
assaulted several women in his judicial chambers. The twomost serious assaults were against a woman whose divorce
proceedings had come before Lanier and whose daughter'scustody remained subject to his jurisdiction. When the
woman applied for a secretarial job at Lanier's courthouse,Lanier interviewed her and suggested that he might have to
reexamine the daughter's custody. When the woman got upto leave, Lanier grabbed her, sexually assaulted her, and finally committed oral rape. A few weeks later, Lanier invei-gled the woman into returning to the courthouse again to
get information about another job opportunity, and againsexually assaulted and orally raped her. App. 44-67. On
five other occasions Lanier sexually assaulted four otherwomen: two of his secretaries, a Youth Services Officer of
the juvenile court over which Lanier presided, and a localcoordinator for a federal program who was in Lanier's chambers to discuss a matter affecting the same court. Id., at13-43, 67-109.

Ultimately, Lanier was charged with 11 violations of $ 242,each count of the indictment alleging that, acting willfully
and under color of Tennessee law, he had deprived the victim

Opinion of the Court
of "rights and privileges which are secured and protected bythe Constitution and the laws of the United States, namely

the right not to be deprived of liberty without due processof law, including the right to be free from wilful sexual assault." Id., at 5-12. Before trial, Lanier moved to dismiss
the indictment on the ground that $ 242 is void for vagueness.The District Court denied the motion.

The trial judge instructed the jury on the Government'sburden to prove as an element of the offense that the defendant deprived the victim of rights secured or protected by theConstitution or laws of the United States:

"Included in the liberty protected by the [Due ProcessClause of the] Fourteenth Amendment is the concept of
personal bodily integrity and the right to be free of un-authorized and unlawful physical abuse by state intrusion. Thus, this protected right of liberty provides thatno person shall be subject to physical or bodily abuse
without lawful justification by a state official acting or
claiming to act under the color of the laws of any stateof the United States when that official's conduct is so

demeaning and harmful under all the circumstances asto shock one's consci[ence]. Freedom from such physical abuse includes the right to be free from certain sexu-ally motivated physical assaults and coerced sexual battery. It is not, however, every unjustified touching orgrabbing by a state official that constitutes a violation
of a person's constitutional rights. The physical abuse
must be of a serious substantial nature that involvesphysical force, mental coercion, bodily injury or emotional damage which is shocking to one's consci[ence]."
Id., at 186-187.

The jury returned verdicts of guilty on seven counts, and not
guilty on three (one count having been dismissed at the close
of the Government's evidence). It also found that the two
oral rapes resulted in "bodily injury," for which Lanier was

Opinion of the Court
subject to 10-year terms of imprisonment on each count, inaddition to 1-year terms under the other five counts of conviction, see $ 242. He was sentenced to consecutive maxi-mum terms totaling 25 years.

A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the convictions and sentence, 33 F. 3d 639 (1994), butthe full court vacated that decision and granted rehearing en

banc, 43 F. 3d 1033 (1995). On rehearing, the court set asideLanier's convictions for "lack of any notice to the public that
this ambiguous criminal statute [i. e., $ 242] includes simpleor sexual assault crimes within its coverage." 73 F. 3d 1380,
1384 (1996). Invoking general canons for interpreting criminal statutes, as well as this Court's plurality opinion in
Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91 (1945), the Sixth Circuit
held that criminal liability may be imposed under $ 242 only
if the constitutional right said to have been violated is first
identified in a decision of this Court (not any other federal,
or state, court), and only when the right has been held to
apply in "a factual situation fundamentally similar to the one
at bar." 73 F. 3d, at 1393. The Court of Appeals regarded
these combined requirements as "substantially higher than
the `clearly established' standard used to judge qualified immunity" in civil cases under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C.

$ 1983. 73 F. 3d, at 1393. Finding no decision of this Court
applying a right to be free from unjustified assault or invasions of bodily integrity in a situation "fundamentally
similar" to those charged, the Sixth Circuit reversed the
judgment of conviction with instructions to dismiss the indictment. Two judges would not have dismissed the felony
counts charging the oral rapes but concurred in dismissing
the misdemeanor counts, while three members of the court
dissented as to all dismissals.

We granted certiorari to review the standard for determining whether particular conduct falls within the range
of criminal liability under $ 242. 518 U. S. 1004 (1996). We
now vacate and remand.

264 UNITED STATES v. LANIER

Opinion of the Court

II
Section 242 is a Reconstruction Era civil rights statutemaking it criminal to act (1) "willfully" and (2) under color

of law (3) to deprive a person of rights protected by the Con-stitution or laws of the United States.

1 18 U. S. C. $ 242;

Screws v. United States, supra. The en banc decision of theSixth Circuit dealt only with the last of these elements, and

it is with that element alone that we are concerned here.2The general language of $ 242,

3 referring to "the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or pro1 The present $ 242 has its roots in portions of three Reconstruction Era
Civil Rights Acts, whose substantive criminal provisions were consolidated in a single section in 1874. See 2 Cong. Rec. 827-828 (1874) (describing derivation of consolidated criminal civil rights law from $$ 1 and
2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 14 Stat. 27; $$ 16 and 17 of the Civil
Rights Act of 1870, 16 Stat. 144; and $ 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17
Stat. 13). Although those statutory forebears created criminal sanctions
only for violations of some enumerated rights and privileges, the consolidated statute of 1874 expanded the law's scope to apply to deprivations of
all constitutional rights, despite the "customary stout assertions of the
codifiers that they had merely clarified and reorganized without changing
substance." United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 803 (1966). Since the
1874 recodification, Congress has revisited $ 242 on several occasions, without contracting its substantive scope. See 35 Stat. 1092 (1909) (adding
willfulness requirement); 82 Stat. 75 (1968) (enhancing penalties for some
violations); 102 Stat. 4396 (1988) (same); 108 Stat. 1970, 2109, 2113, 2147
(1994) (same).

2 Thus, we do not address the argument, pressed by respondent, that

the actions for which he was convicted were not taken under color of law.
The Sixth Circuit discussed that issue only in the original panel opinion,
subsequently vacated, but did not reach the question in the en banc decision under review here. To the extent the issue remains open, we leave
its consideration in the first instance to the Court of Appeals on remand.

3 "Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or

custom, willfully subjects any person in any State, Territory, or District
to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or to different
punishments, pains, or penalties, on account of such person being an alien,
or by reason of his color, or race, than are prescribed for the punishment
of citizens," shall be subject to specified criminal penalties.

tected by the Constitution or laws of the United States," ismatched by the breadth of its companion conspiracy statute,

$ 241,4 which speaks of conspiracies to prevent "the free ex-ercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to [any
person] by the Constitution or laws of the United States."Thus, in lieu of describing the specific conduct it forbids, each
statute's general terms incorporate constitutional law by ref-erence, see

United States v. Kozminski, 487 U. S. 931, 941(1988); United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 797, 805 (1966),

and many of the incorporated constitutional guarantees are,of course, themselves stated with some catholicity of phrasing. The result is that neither the statutes nor a good manyof their constitutional referents delineate the range of forbidden conduct with particularity.The right to due process enforced by $ 242 and said to have
been violated by Lanier presents a case in point, with theirony that a prosecution to enforce one application of its spacious protection of liberty can threaten the accused with dep-rivation of another: what Justice Holmes spoke of as "fair
warning . . . in language that the common world will under-stand, of what the law intends to do if a certain line is passed.
To make the warning fair, so far as possible the line shouldbe clear." McBoyle v. United States, 283 U. S. 25, 27 (1931).
" `The . . . principle is that no man shall be held criminallyresponsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.' " Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378U. S. 347, 351 (1964) (quoting

United States v. Harriss, 347U. S. 612, 617 (1954)).

4 Insofar as pertinent: "If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to
him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his
having so exercised the same," they shall be subject to specified criminal
penalties.

5 The fair warning requirement also reflects the deference due to the

legislature, which possesses the power to define crimes and their punishment. See United States v. Wiltberger, 5 Wheat. 76, 95 (1820); United

266 UNITED STATES v. LANIER

Opinion of the Court
There are three related manifestations of the fair warning
requirement. First, the vagueness doctrine bars enforcement of "a statute which either forbids or requires the doing
of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence
must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its
application." Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U. S. 385,
391 (1926); accord, Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 357
(1983); Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 453 (1939).
Second, as a sort of "junior version of the vagueness doctrine," H. Packer, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 95
(1968), the canon of strict construction of criminal statutes,
or rule of lenity, ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct
clearly covered. See, e. g., Liparota v. United States, 471
U. S. 419, 427 (1985); United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336,
347-348 (1971); McBoyle, supra, at 27. Third, although clarity at the requisite level may be supplied by judicial gloss on
an otherwise uncertain statute, see, e. g., Bouie, supra, at
357-359; Kolender, supra, at 355-356; Lanzetta, supra, at
455-457; Jeffries, Legality, Vagueness, and the Construction
of Penal Statutes, 71 Va. L. Rev. 189, 207 (1985), due process
bars courts from applying a novel construction of a criminal
statute to conduct that neither the statute nor any prior judicial decision has fairly disclosed to be within its scope, see,
e. g., Marks v. United States, 430 U. S. 188, 191-192 (1977);
Rabe v. Washington, 405 U. S. 313 (1972) (per curiam);
Bouie, supra, at 353-354; cf. U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 9, cl. 3;
id., $ 10, cl. 1; Bouie, supra, at 353-354 (Ex Post Facto

States v. Aguilar, 515 U. S. 593, 600 (1995). See generally H. Packer,
The Limits of the Criminal Sanction 79-96 (1968) (discussing "principle of
legality," "that conduct may not be treated as criminal unless it has been
so defined by [a competent] authority . . . before it has taken place," as
implementing separation of powers, providing notice, and preventing
abuses of official discretion) (quotation at 80); Jeffries, Legality, Vagueness, and the Construction of Penal Statutes, 71 Va. L. Rev. 189 (1985).

Opinion of the Court
Clauses bar legislatures from making substantive criminaloffenses retroactive). In each of these guises, the touchstone is whether the statute, either standing alone or as con-strued, made it reasonably clear at the relevant time that the
defendant's conduct was criminal.We applied this standard in

Screws v. United States, 325U. S. 91 (1945), which recognized that the expansive language of due process that provides a basis for judicial reviewis, when incorporated by reference into $ 242, generally ill
suited to the far different task of giving fair warning aboutthe scope of criminal liability. The

Screws plurality identified the affront to the warning requirement posed by employing $ 242 to place "the accused . . . on trial for an offense, thenature of which the statute does not define and hence of

which it gives no warning." Id., at 101. At the same time,the same Justices recognized that this constitutional difficulty does not arise when the accused is charged with violat-ing a "right which has been made specific either by the express terms of the Constitution or laws of the United Statesor by decisions interpreting them."

Id., at 104. When
broad constitutional requirements have been "made specific"
by the text or settled interpretations, willful violators "cer-tainly are in no position to say that they had no adequate

advance notice that they would be visited with pun-ishment. . . . [T]hey are not punished for violating an unknowable something." Id., at 105. Accordingly, Screwslimited the statute's coverage to rights fairly warned of, having been "made specific" by the time of the charged conduct.See also

Kozminski, supra, at 941 (parallel construction of

$ 241).6

6 This process of "making specific" does not, as the Sixth Circuit believed, qualify Screws as "the only Supreme Court case in our legal history
in which a majority of the Court seems [to have been] willing to create a
common law crime." 73 F. 3d 1380, 1391 (1996). Federal crimes are defined by Congress, not the courts, Kozminski, 487 U. S., at 939; United
States v. Wiltberger, supra, at 95, and Screws did not "create a common

268 UNITED STATES v. LANIER

Opinion of the Court
The Sixth Circuit, in this case, added two glosses to themade-specific standard of fair warning. In its view, a generally phrased constitutional right has been made specificwithin the meaning of Screws only if a prior decision of this
Court has declared the right, and then only when this Courthas applied its ruling in a case with facts "fundamentally
similar" to the case being prosecuted. 73 F. 3d, at 1393.None of the considerations advanced in this case, however,
persuade us that either a decision of this Court or the ex-treme level of factual specificity envisioned by the Court of
Appeals is necessary in every instance to give fair warning.First, contrary to the Court of Appeals, see

ibid., we thinkit unsound to read
Screws as reasoning that only this Court'sdecisions could provide the required warning. Although the

Screws plurality gave two examples involving decisions ofthe Court, their opinion referred in general terms to rights
made specific by "decisions interpreting" the Constitution,see 325 U. S., at 104 (plurality opinion), and no subsequent
case has held that the universe of relevant interpretive deci-sions is confined to our opinions. While

United States v.Kozminski, 487 U. S. 931 (1988), a case under $ 241 for violatlaw crime"; it narrowly construed a broadly worded Act of Congress, and
the policies favoring strict construction of criminal statutes oblige us to
carry out congressional intent as far as the Constitution will admit, see
Kozminski, supra, at 939; Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 831
(1974); United States v. Morris, 14 Pet. 464, 475 (1840). Nor is $ 242's
pedigree as an Act of Congress tainted by its birth at the hands of codifiers
who arguably made substantive changes in the pre-existing law, see n. 1,
supra, as the Sixth Circuit concluded from the statutory history, 73 F. 3d,
at 1384-1387. The legislative intent of Congress is to be derived from
the language and structure of the statute itself, if possible, not from the
assertions of codifiers directly at odds with clear statutory language. See,
e. g., United States v. Wells, 519 U. S. 482, 496-497 (1997). Further, the
Sixth Circuit's conclusion that Congress never intended $ 242 to extend to
"newly-created constitutional rights," 73 F. 3d, at 1387, is belied by the
fact that Congress has increased the penalties for the section's violation
several times since Screws was decided, without contracting its substantive scope, see n. 1, supra.

Opinion of the Court
ing Thirteenth Amendment rights, did characterize our taskas ascertaining the crime charged "by looking to the scope

of the Thirteenth Amendment prohibition . . . specified inour prior decisions,"

id., at 941, in at least one other case we
have specifically referred to a decision of a Court of Appeals
in defining the established scope of a constitutional right forpurposes of $ 241 liability, see

Anderson v. United States, 417
U. S. 211, 223-227 (1974). It is also to the point, as we ex-plain below, that in applying the rule of qualified immunity

under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.
Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), we have referred to
decisions of the Courts of Appeals when enquiring whether
a right was "clearly established." See Mitchell v. Forsyth,

472 U. S. 511, 533 (1985); Davis v. Scherer, 468 U. S. 183, 191-
192 (1984); see also id., at 203-205 (Brennan, J., concurring
in part and dissenting in part); Elder v. Holloway, 510 U. S.
510, 516 (1994) (treating Court of Appeals decision as "relevant authority" that must be considered as part of qualified
immunity enquiry). Although the Sixth Circuit was concerned, and rightly so, that disparate decisions in various
Circuits might leave the law insufficiently certain even on a
point widely considered, such a circumstance may be taken
into account in deciding whether the warning is fair enough,
without any need for a categorical rule that decisions of the
Courts of Appeals and other courts are inadequate as a matter of law to provide it.

Nor have our decisions demanded precedents that applied
the right at issue to a factual situation that is "fundamentally
similar" at the level of specificity meant by the Sixth Circuit
in using that phrase. To the contrary, we have upheld convictions under $ 241 or $ 242 despite notable factual distinctions between the precedents relied on and the cases then
before the Court, so long as the prior decisions gave reasonable warning that the conduct then at issue violated constitutional rights. See United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 759,
n. 17 (1966) (prior cases established right of interstate travel,

Opinion of the Court
but later case was the first to address the deprivation of thisright by private persons);

United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S.
385 (1944) (pre-Screws; prior cases established right to havelegitimate vote counted, whereas later case involved dilution

of legitimate votes through casting of fraudulent ballots);
United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 321-324 (1941) (preScrews; prior cases established right to have vote counted in
general election, whereas later case involved primary elec-tion); see also

Screws, 325 U. S., at 106 (stating that Classic
met the test being announced).But even putting these examples aside, we think that the

Sixth Circuit's "fundamentally similar" standard would lead
trial judges to demand a degree of certainty at once unnecessarily high and likely to beget much wrangling. This danger flows from the Court of Appeals' stated view, 73 F. 3d,
at 1393, that due process under $ 242 demands more than the
"clearly established" law required for a public officer to be
held civilly liable for a constitutional violation under $ 1983
or Bivens, see Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U. S. 635 (1987)
(Bivens action); Davis v. Scherer, supra ($ 1983 action).
This, we think, is error.

In the civil sphere, we have explained that qualified immunity seeks to ensure that defendants "reasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability," id., at
195, by attaching liability only if "[t]he contours of the right
[violated are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official
would understand that what he is doing violates that right,"
Anderson, supra, at 640. So conceived, the object of the
"clearly established" immunity standard is not different from
that of "fair warning" as it relates to law "made specific" for
the purpose of validly applying $ 242. The fact that one
has a civil and the other a criminal law role is of no significance; both serve the same objective, and in effect the qualified immunity test is simply the adaptation of the fair warning standard to give officials (and, ultimately, governments)
the same protection from civil liability and its consequences

Opinion of the Court
that individuals have traditionally possessed in the face ofvague criminal statutes. To require something clearer than

"clearly established" would, then, call for something beyond"fair warning."

This is not to say, of course, that the single warning standard points to a single level of specificity sufficient in everyinstance. In some circumstances, as when an earlier case

expressly leaves open whether a general rule applies tothe particular type of conduct at issue, a very high degree
of prior factual particularity may be necessary. See, e. g.,
Mitchell v. Forsyth, supra, at 530-535, and n. 12. But general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of
giving fair and clear warning, and in other instances a general constitutional rule already identified in the decisional
law may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in
question, even though "the very action in question has [not]
previously been held unlawful," Anderson, supra, at 640.
As Judge Daughtrey noted in her dissenting opinion in this
case: " `The easiest cases don't even arise. There has never
been . . . a section 1983 case accusing welfare officials of selling foster children into slavery; it does not follow that if such
a case arose, the officials would be immune from damages
[or criminal] liability.' " 73 F. 3d, at 1410 (quoting K. H.
Through Murphy v. Morgan, 914 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA7 1990));
see also Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104, 110 (1972) (due
process requirements are not "designed to convert into a
constitutional dilemma the practical difficulties in drawing
criminal statutes both general enough to take into account a
variety of human conduct and sufficiently specific to provide
fair warning that certain kinds of conduct are prohibited");
Williams v. United States, 341 U. S. 97, 101 (1951) (holding
that beating to obtain a confession plainly violates $ 242). In
sum, as with civil liability under $ 1983 or Bivens, all that
can usefully be said about criminal liability under $ 242 is
that it may be imposed for deprivation of a constitutional
right if, but only if, "in the light of pre-existing law the un520US1 Unit: $U39 [09-10-99 17:14:48] PAGES PGT: OPIN

lawfulness [under the Constitution is] apparent," Anderson,supra, at 640. Where it is, the constitutional requirement

of fair warning is satisfied.Because the Court of Appeals used the wrong gauge in
deciding whether prior judicial decisions gave fair warningthat respondent's actions violated constitutional rights, we
vacate the judgment and remand the case for application ofthe proper standard.

It is so ordered.

7 We also leave consideration of other issues that may remain open to
the Court of Appeals on remand. Several of the arguments tendered by
respondent here are, however, plainly without merit and need not be left
open. First, Lanier's contention that Screws excluded rights protected
by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from the ambit
of $ 242 is contradicted by the language of Screws itself as well as later
cases. See Screws v. United States, 325 U. S. 91, 100, 106 (1945); United
States v. Price, 383 U. S., at 789, and n. 2, 793 ($ 242 is enforcement legislation enacted under $ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment and encompasses
violations of rights guaranteed under the Due Process Clause). Second,
although DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., 489 U. S.
189 (1989), generally limits the constitutional duty of officials to protect
against assault by private parties to cases where the victim is in custody,
DeShaney does not hold, as respondent maintains, that there is no constitutional right to be free from assault committed by state officials themselves outside of a custodial setting. Third, contrary to respondent's
claim, Graham v. Connor, 490 U. S. 386, 394 (1989), does not hold that all
constitutional claims relating to physically abusive government conduct
must arise under either the Fourth or Eighth Amendments; rather, Graham simply requires that if a constitutional claim is covered by a specific
constitutional provision, such as the Fourth or Eighth Amendment, the
claim must be analyzed under the standard appropriate to that specific
provision, not under the rubric of substantive due process.

appeal from the united states district court forthe southern district of mississippi

No. 95-2031. Argued January 6, 1997--Decided March 31, 1997
The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) requires States to

provide simplified systems for registering to vote in federal elections,
including a system for voter registration on a driver's license application. Beginning on January 1, 1995, Mississippi attempted to comply
with the NVRA, attempting to replace its "Old System" of registration
with a "Provisional Plan" that simplified registration procedures for
both federal and state elections. The United States Attorney General
precleared the Provisional Plan under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of
1965 (VRA), which prohibits States with a specified history of voting
discrimination from making changes in voting "practices or procedures"
that have the purpose or effect of denying or abridging the right to
vote on account of race or color. However, a week before the plan was
precleared, the state legislature tabled legislation needed to make the
changes effective for state elections. On February 10, 1995, the State
abandoned the Provisional Plan in favor of a "New System," which uses
the Provisional Plan for federal election registration only and the Old
System for both state and federal election registration. The State
made no further preclearance submissions. In this suit, appellants
claim that the State and its officials violated $ 5 by implementing
changes in its registration system without preclearance. A three-judge
District Court granted the State summary judgment, holding that the
differences in the New System and Provisional Plan were attributable
to the State's attempt to correct a misapplication of state law, and, thus,
were not changes subject to preclearance; and that the State had precleared all the changes that the New System made in the Old when the
Attorney General precleared the changes needed to implement the
NVRA.

Held: Mississippi has not precleared, and must preclear, the "practices and

procedures" that it sought to administer on and after February 10, 1995.
Pp. 281-291.

(a) Several circumstances, taken together, lead to the conclusion that
the Provisional Plan, although precleared by the Attorney General, was
not "in force or effect" under $ 5 and, hence, did not become part of

the baseline against which to judge whether future change occurred.
Those seeking to administer the plan did not intend to administer an

Syllabus
unlawful plan, and they abandoned the plan as soon as it became clear
that the legislature would not pass the laws needed to make it lawful.
Moreover, all these events took place within a few weeks: The plan was
used for only 41 days and by only a third of the State's voter registration
officials, and the State held no elections prior to its abandonment of the
plan, nor were any elections imminent. Pp. 282-283.

(b) Nonetheless, the New System included changes that must be precleared because it contains "practices and procedures" that are significantly different from the Old System. Minor changes, as well as major,
require preclearance. See Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544,
566-569. This is true even where, as here, the changes are made in an
effort to comply with federal law, so long as those changes reflect policy
choices made by state or local officials. Id., at 565, n. 29. The NVRA
does not preclude application of the VRA's requirements. Change invokes the preclearance process whether that change works in favor of,
works against, or is neutral in its impact on minorities because the preclearance process is aimed at preserving the status quo until the Attorney General or the courts have an opportunity to evaluate a proposed
change. Although the NVRA imposed mandates on the States, Mississippi's changes to the New System are discretionary and nonministerial, reflecting the exercise of policy choice and discretion by state
officials. Thus, they are appropriate matters for $ 5 preclearance review. Pp. 283-286.

(c) Mississippi's arguments in favor of its position that the Attorney
General has already precleared its efforts to comply with the NVRA
are rejected. Mississippi correctly argues that the decisions to adopt
the NVRA federal registration system and to retain a prior state registration system, by themselves, are not changes for $ 5 purposes. However, preclearance requires examination of the federal system's discretionary elements in a context that includes history, purpose, and
practical effect. The argument on the merits is whether these changes
could have the purpose and effect of denying or abridging the right to
vote on account of race or color. Preclearance is necessary to evaluate
this argument. Pp. 286-291.

The question before us is whether $ 5 of the Voting RightsAct of 1965, 79 Stat. 439, as amended, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c ($ 5),

requires preclearance of certain changes that Mississippimade in its voter registration procedures--changes that Mississippi made in order to comply with the National VoterRegistration Act of 1993. We hold that $ 5 does require
preclearance. I

The National Voter Registration Act

Congress enacted the National Voter Registration Act of1993 (NVRA), 107 Stat. 77, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973gg et seq., to

take effect for States like Mississippi on January 1, 1995.The NVRA requires States to provide simplified systems for
registering to vote in federal elections, i. e., elections for fed-eral officials, such as the President, congressional Representatives, and United States Senators. The States mustprovide a system for voter registration by mail, $ 1973gg-4,
a system for voter registration at various state offices (in-cluding those that provide "public assistance" and those that
provide services to people with disabilities), $ 1973gg-5, and,particularly important, a system for voter registration on a
driver's license application, $ 1973gg-3. The NVRA speci*Juan Cartagena filed a brief for the Community Service Society of
New York et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.

fies various details about how these systems must work,including, for example, the type of information that States

can require on a voter registration form. $$ 1973gg-3(c)(2),1973gg-7(b). It also imposes requirements about just when,
and how, States may remove people from the federal voterrolls. $$ 1973gg-6(a)(3), (4). The NVRA adds that it does
not "supersede, restrict or limit the application of the VotingRights Act of 1965," and that it does not "authoriz[e] or requir[e] conduct that is prohibited by the Voting Rights Actof 1965." $ 1973gg-9(d).

The Voting Rights Act

Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA), amongother things, prohibits a State with a specified history of

voting discrimination, such as Mississippi, from "enact[ing]or seek[ing] to administer any . . . practic[e], or procedure
with respect to voting different from that in force or effecton November 1, 1964," unless and until the State obtains
preclearance from the United States Attorney General (At-torney General) or the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia. $ 1973c. Preclearance is, in effect, adetermination that the change "does not have the purpose
and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the rightto vote on account of race or color."

Ibid. In the languageof $ 5 jurisprudence, this determination involves a determination that the change is not retrogressive. Beer v. United
States, 425 U. S. 130, 141 (1976); 28 CFR $ 51.54(a) (1996).

The case before us concerns three different Mississippivoting registration systems: The first system, which we shall

call the "Old System," is that used by Mississippi before ittried to comply with the NVRA. The second system, the
"Provisional Plan," is a system aimed at NVRA compliance,which Mississippi tried to implement for about six weeks between January 1, 1995, and February 10, 1995. The third

Opinion of the Court
system, the "New System," is the system that Mississippiput into place after February 10, 1995, in a further effort to

comply with the NVRA. We shall briefly explain the rele-vant features of each system.

The Old System. Before 1995, Mississippi administered a
voting registration system, which, like the systems of mostStates, provided for a single registration that allowed the

registrant to vote in both federal elections and state elec-tions (

i. e., elections for state and local offices). Under Mississippi law, a citizen could register to vote either by appear-ing personally at a county or municipal clerk's office or at

other locations (such as polling places) that the clerk or his
deputy visited to register people to vote. Miss. Code Ann.

$$ 23-15-35, 23-15-37, 23-15-39(6) (1990). Mississippi citizens could also register by obtaining a mail-in registration
form available at driver's license agencies, public schools,
and public libraries, among other places, and mailing it back
to the clerk. Miss. Code Ann. $ 23-15-47(2)(a) (Supp. 1996).
The law set forth various details, requiring, for example, that
a mail-in application contain the name and address of the
voter and that it be attested to by a witness, ibid. (although
there is some dispute between the parties about whether an
application could be rejected for failing to have the witness'
signature). State law also allowed county registration officials to purge voters from the rolls if they had not voted in
four years. Miss. Code Ann. $ 23-15-159 (1990).

The Provisional Plan. In late 1994, the Mississippi secretary of state, with the help of an NVRA implementation
committee, prepared a series of voter registration changes
designed to ensure compliance with the NVRA. The new
voter registration application that was incorporated into the
driver's license form, for example, did not require that the
registrant repeat his or her address, nor did it require an
attesting witness. The secretary of state provided information and instructions about those changes to voter registration officials and state agency personnel throughout the

520US1 Unit: $U40 [09-10-99 17:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
278 YOUNG v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
State. The secretary of state and the implementing com-mittee assumed--and recommended--that the Mississippi

Legislature would change state law insofar as that law mightprevent a valid registration under the NVRA's provisions
from counting as a valid registration for a state or local election. And, on that assumption, at least one official in thesecretary of state's office told state election officials to place

the name of any new valid applicant under the NVRA on alist that would permit him or her to vote in state, as well as
in federal, elections.Using this Provisional Plan, at least some Mississippi officials registered as many as 4,000 voters between January 1,
1995, and February 10, 1995. On January 25, however, the
state legislature tabled a bill that would have made NVRA
registrations valid for all elections in Mississippi (by, for example, allowing applicants at driver's license and other agencies to register on the spot, without having to mail in the
application themselves, App. 86, by eliminating the attesting
witness signature on the mail-in application, compare id., at
96, 101, with Miss. Code Ann. $ 23-15-47(3) (Supp. 1996), and
by eliminating the optional 4-year purge of nonvoting registrants, replacing it with other methods for maintaining upto-date voter rolls, App. 87-92, 103). Because of the legislature's failure to change the Old System's requirements for
state election registration, the state attorney general concluded that Provisional Plan registrations that did not meet
Old System requirements would not work, under state law,
as registration for state elections. State officials notified
voter registration officials throughout the State; and they, in
turn, were asked to help notify the 4,000 registrants that
they were not registered to vote in state or local elections.

The New System. On February 10, 1995, Mississippi
began to use what we shall call the New System. That system consists of the changes that its Provisional Plan set
forth--but as applied only to registration for federal elections. Mississippi maintains the Old System as the only

Statement 21a. All other States, we are told, have modifiedtheir voter registration rules so that NVRA registration

Amicus Curiae 4.

C
This case arises out of efforts by Mississippi to preclear,under $ 5 of the VRA, changes that it made to comply

with the NVRA. In December 1994, Mississippi submittedto the United States Attorney General a list of NVRAimplementing changes that it then intended to make. Thatsubmission essentially described what we have called the
Provisional Plan. The submission contained numerous ad-ministrative changes described in two booklets called The
National Voter Registration Act, App. 26-43, and the Missis-sippi Agency Voter Registration Procedures Manual, id., at
51-60. It also included the proposed state legislation neces-sary to make the Provisional Plan work for state elections
as well. Id., at 86-104. Mississippi requested preclearance.Id., at 109-110. On February 1, 1995, the Department of
Justice wrote to Mississippi that the Attorney General did"not interpose any objection to the specified changes"--
thereby preclearing Mississippi's submitted changes. App.to Juris. Statement 17a.

As we pointed out above, however, on January 25, aboutone week before the Attorney General precleared the proposed changes, the state legislature had tabled the proposedlegislation needed to make those changes effective for state
elections. On February 10, 10 days after the Departmentprecleared the proposed changes, Mississippi officials wrote
to voter registration officials around the State, telling themthat it "appears unlikely that the Legislature will" revive
the tabled bill; that the Provisional Plan's registration wouldtherefore not work for state elections; that they should

Opinion of the Court
write--or help the secretary of state write--to tell thosewho had registered under that system that they were not

registered to vote in state elections; that they should makecertain future registrants understand that they would need
to register separately to be eligible to vote in state, as wellas federal, elections; and that they should develop a system
for distinguishing between NVRA and other voters. Id.,at 20a-23a.

On February 16, about two weeks after the Department ofJustice sent its preclearance letter, the Department wrote
another letter to Mississippi, which made clear that the De-partment did not believe its earlier preclearance had precleared what it now saw as a new plan. The Departmentasked the State to submit what it called this new "dual registration and voter purge system" for preclearance. Id., at24a. The Department added:

"In this regard, we note that while, on February 1, 1995,the Attorney General granted Section 5 preclearance to
procedures instituted by the state to implement theNVRA, that submission did not seek preclearance for
a dual registration and purge system and, indeed, weunderstand that the decision to institute such a system
was not made until after February 1." Id., at 24a-25a.
Mississippi, perhaps believing that the February 1 preclear-ance sufficed, made no further preclearance submissions.

D
On April 20, 1995, four private citizens (appellants)brought this lawsuit before a three-judge District Court.

They claimed that Mississippi and its officials had imple-mented changes in its registration system without preclearance in violation of $ 5. The United States, which is an amicus curiae here, brought a similar lawsuit, and the twoactions were consolidated.

The three-judge District Court granted Mississippi's mo-tion for summary judgment. It considered the plaintiffs'

520US1 Unit: $U40 [09-10-99 17:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
basic claim, namely, that the differences between the Provi-sional Plan and the New System amounted to a change in

the administration of Mississippi's voting registration prac-tice, which change had not been precleared. The court rejected this argument on the ground that the Provisional Planwas a misapplication of state law, never ratified by the State.
Since the differences between the New System and the Pro-visional Plan were attributable to the State's attempt to correct this misapplication of state law, the court held, thosedifferences were not changes subject to preclearance.

The court also considered a different question, namely,whether the New System differed from the

Old System; andwhether Mississippi had precleared all the changes that the

New System made in the Old. The court held that the De-partment had (on February 1) precleared the administrative
changes needed to implement the NVRA. The court alsoheld that Mississippi did not need to preclear its failure to
pass a law that would have permitted NVRA registration tocount for state, as well as for federal, elections, as the distinction between state and federal elections was due to theNVRA's own provisions, not to the State's changes in voting practices.The private plaintiffs appealed, and we noted probable
jurisdiction. 518 U. S. 1055 (1996). We now reverse.

Section 5 of the VRA requires Mississippi to preclear "any. . . practic[e] or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1964." 42U. S. C. $ 1973c. The statute's date of November 1, 1964,
often, as here, is not directly relevant, for differences onceprecleared normally need not be cleared again. They become part of the baseline standard for purposes of determin-ing whether a State has "enact[ed]" or is "seek[ing] to administer" a "practice or procedure" that is "different" enoughitself to require preclearance.

282 YOUNG v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
Comm'n, 502 U. S. 491, 495 (1992) ("To determine whether
there have been changes with respect to voting, we must
compare the challenged practices with those in existence
before they were adopted. Absent relevant intervening
changes, the Act requires us to use practices in existence on
November 1, 1964, as our standard of comparison"). Regardless, none of the parties asks us to look further back in
time than 1994, when the Old System was last in effect. The
appellants ask us to consider whether Mississippi's New System amounts to a forbidden effort to implement unprecleared
changes either (a) because the New System is "different
from" the post-1994 Provisional Plan or (b) because it is "different from" the 1994 Old System. We shall consider each
of these claims in turn.

A

First, the appellants and the Government argue that the
Provisional Plan, because it was precleared by the Attorney
General, became part of the baseline against which to judge
whether a future change must be precleared. They add that
the New System differs significantly from the Provisional
Plan, particularly in its effect on registration for state elections. They conclude that Mississippi had to preclear the
New System insofar as it differed from the Provisional Plan.

The District Court rejected this argument on the ground
that the Provisional Plan practices and procedures never became part of Mississippi's voting-related practices or procedures, but instead simply amounted to a temporary misapplication of state law. We, too, believe that the Provisional
Plan, in the statute's words, was never "in force or effect."
42 U. S. C. $ 1973c.

The District Court rested its conclusion upon the fact that
Mississippi did not change its state law so as to make the
Provisional Plan's "unitary" registration system lawful and
that neither the Governor nor the legislature nor the state
attorney general ratified the Provisional Plan. The appel520US1 Unit: $U40 [09-10-99 17:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

283Cite as: 520 U. S. 273 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
lants argue that the simple fact that a voting practice is un-lawful under state law does not show, entirely by itself, that

the practice was never "in force or effect." We agree. AState, after all, might maintain in effect for many years a
plan that technically, or in one respect or another, violatedsome provision of state law. Cf.

Perkins v. Matthews, 400U. S. 379, 394-395 (1971) (deeming ward system "in fact `in

force or effect' " and requiring change from wards to at-largeelections to be precleared even though ward system was illegal and at-large elections were required under state law (em-phasis in original)); City of Lockhart v. United States, 460
U. S. 125, 132-133 (1983) (numbered-post election system was"in effect" although it may have been unauthorized by state
law). But that is not the situation here.In this case, those seeking to administer the Provisional
Plan did not intend to administer an unlawful plan. Theyexpected it to become lawful. They abandoned the Provisional Plan as soon as its unlawfulness became apparent, i. e.,as soon as it became clear that the legislature would not pass
the laws needed to make it lawful. Moreover, all theseevents took place within the space of a few weeks. The plan
was used to register voters for only 41 days, and only abouta third of the State's voter registration officials had begun
to use it. Further, the State held no elections prior to itsabandonment of the Provisional Plan, nor were any elections
imminent. These circumstances taken together lead us toconclude that the Provisional Plan was not "in force or effect"; hence it did not become part of the baseline againstwhich we are to judge whether future change occurred.

B
We nonetheless agree with the appellants and the Govern-ment that the New System included changes that must be,

but have not been, precleared. That is because the NewSystem contains "practices and procedures" that are significantly "different from" the Old System--the system that was

Opinion of the Court
in effect in 1994. And the State has not precleared thosedifferences.

This Court has made clear that minor, as well as major,changes require preclearance.

changes, including a change from paper ballots to voting ma-chines);

U. S. 166, 175-177 (1985) (election date relative to filing dead-line);

Perkins, supra, at 387 (location of polling places). See
also 28 CFR $ 51.12 (1996) (requiring preclearance of "[a]nychange affecting voting, even though it appears to be minor

or indirect . . ."). This is true even where, as here, the
changes are made in an effort to comply with federal law, so
long as those changes reflect policy choices made by state or
local officials. Allen, supra, at 565, n. 29 (requiring State to
preclear changes made in an effort to comply with $ 2 of the
VRA, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973); McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U. S. 130,
153 (1981) (requiring preclearance of voting changes submitted to a federal court because the VRA "requires that whenever a covered jurisdiction submits a proposal reflecting the
policy choices of the elected representatives of the people--
no matter what constraints have limited the choices available
to them--the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights
Act is applicable"); Lopez v. Monterey County, 519 U. S. 9,

preclear changes reflecting policy choices); Hampton County
Election Comm'n, supra, at 179-180 (requiring preclearance
of change in election date although change was made in an
effort to comply with $ 5). Moreover, the NVRA does not
forbid application of the VRA's requirements. To the contrary, it says "[n]othing in this subchapter authorizes or requires conduct that is prohibited by the" VRA. 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973gg-9(d)(2). And it adds that "neither the rights and
remedies established by this section nor any other provision
of this subchapter shall supersede, restrict, or limit the application of the" VRA. $ 1973gg-9(d)(1).

285Cite as: 520 U. S. 273 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Nor does it matter for the preclearance requirementwhether the change works in favor of, works against, or is

neutral in its impact upon the ability of minorities to vote.See generally

City of Lockhart v. United States, supra (requiring preclearance of a change but finding the change nonretrogressive). It is change that invokes the preclearance
process; evaluation of that change concerns the merits of
whether the change should in fact be precleared. See
Lopez, supra, at 22-25; Allen, supra, at 555, n. 19, 558-559.
That is so because preclearance is a process aimed at pre-serving the status quo until the Attorney General or the

courts have an opportunity to evaluate a proposed change.
See McCain v. Lybrand, 465 U. S. 236, 243-244 (1984) (Without $ 5, even successful antidiscrimination lawsuits might
"merely resul[t] in a change in methods of discrimination");
South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 335 (1966)
(same); id., at 328 (explaining how the VRA could attack the
problems of States going from one discriminatory system to
another, by shifting "the advantage of time and inertia" to
the potential victims of that discrimination).

In this case, the New System contains numerous examples
of new, significantly different administrative practices--practices that are not purely ministerial, but reflect the exercise
of policy choice and discretion by Mississippi officials. The
system, for example, involves newly revised written materials containing significant, and significantly different, registration instructions; new reporting requirements for local
elections officials; new and detailed instructions about what
kind of assistance state agency personnel should offer potential NVRA registrants, which state agencies will be NVRA
registration agencies, and how and in what form registration
material is to be forwarded to those who maintain the voting
rolls; and other similar matters. Insofar as they embody
discretionary decisions that have a potential for discriminatory impact, they are appropriate matters for review under

$ 5's preclearance process.

520US1 Unit: $U40 [09-10-99 17:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN
286 YOUNG v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
In saying this, we recognize that the NVRA imposes certain mandates on States, describing those mandates in detail.
The NVRA says, for example, that the state driver's license
applications must also serve as voter registration applications and that a decision not to register will remain confidential. 42 U. S. C. $$ 1973gg-3(a)(1), (c)(2)(D)(ii). It says
that States cannot force driver's license applications to submit the same information twice (on license applications and
again on registration forms). $ 1973gg-3(c)(2)(A). Nonetheless, implementation of the NVRA is not purely ministerial. The NVRA still leaves room for policy choice. The
NVRA does not list, for example, all the other information
the State may--or may not--provide or request. And a decision about that other information--say, whether or not to
tell the applicant that registration counts only for federal
elections--makes Mississippi's changes to the New System
the kind of discretionary, nonministerial changes that call
for federal VRA review. Hence, Mississippi must preclear
those changes.

C

We shall consider Mississippi's two important arguments
to the contrary.

1

The first set of arguments concerns the effect of the Attorney General's preclearance letter. Mississippi points out
that the Department of Justice wrote to the State on February 1, 1995, that the Attorney General did "not interpose any
objection" to its NVRA changes. App. to Juris. Statement
17a. Hence, says Mississippi, the Attorney General has already precleared its efforts to comply.

The submission that the Attorney General approved, however, assumed that Mississippi's administrative changes
would permit NVRA registrants to vote in both state and
federal elections. The submission included a pamphlet entitled The National Voter Registration Act, App. 26-43, which

520US1 Unit: $U40 [09-10-99 17:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

287Cite as: 520 U. S. 273 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
set forth what Mississippi's submission letter called theState's "plan to administratively implement NVRA on January 1, 1995," id., at 110. The submission included legislativechanges; indeed, Mississippi enclosed in the packet the proposed legislation that would have made a single NVRA registration valid for both federal and state elections. Id., at86-104. The submission also included forms to be provided

NVRA registrants, forms that, by their lack of specificity,probably would have led those voters--and the Attorney
General--to believe that NVRA registration permitted themto vote in all elections.

Id., at 44-50. These forms--perfectly understandable on the "single registration" assumption--might well mislead if they cannot in fact be used to
register for state elections. Cf. City of Lockhart v. United
States, 460 U. S., at 131-132 (requiring city to submit "entire
system" because "[t]he possible discriminatory purpose or
effect of the [changes], admittedly subject to $ 5, cannot be
determined in isolation from the `pre-existing' elements").
Furthermore, the submission included no instructions to
voter registration officials about treating NVRA registrants
differently from other voters and provided for no notice
to NVRA registrants that they could not vote in state
elections.

Mississippi replies that, as a matter of logic, one could read
its submission, with its explicit indication that the state legislation was proposed, but not yet enacted, as a request for
approval of the administrative changes whether or not the
state legislature passed the bill. It tries to derive further
support for its claim by pointing to Department of Justice
regulations that say that the Attorney General will not preclear unenacted legislation. 28 CFR $$ 51.22, 51.35 (1996).
As a matter of pure logic, Mississippi is correct. One could
logically understand the preclearance in the way the State
suggests. But still, that is not the only way to understand
it. At a minimum, its submission was ambiguous as to
whether (1) it sought approval on the assumption that the

288 YOUNG v. FORDICE

Opinion of the Court
state legislature would enact the bill, or (2) it sought ap-proval whether or not the state legislature would enact the

bill. Although there is one reference to the possibility of a"dual registration system" in the absence of legislation, App.
72, the submission simply did not specify what would happen
if the legislature did not pass the bill, and it thereby createdambiguity about whether the practices and procedures described in the submission would be implemented regardlessof what the legislature did. The VRA permits the Attorney
General to resolve such ambiguities against the submittingState.

McCain, 465 U. S., at 249, 255-257 (burden is on the
State to submit a complete and unambiguous description of
proposed changes); Clark v. Roemer, 500 U. S. 646, 658-659
(1991) (relying on "presumption that any ambiguity in the
scope of the preclearance request must be construed against
the [State]" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). See also 28 CFR $$ 51.26(d), 51.27(c) (1996) (requiring
preclearance submissions to explain changes clearly and in
detail). Hence, the Attorney General could read her approval of the submitted plan as an approval of a plan that
rested on the assumption that the proposed changes would
be valid for all elections, not a plan in which NVRA registration does not qualify the registrant to vote in state elections.
We find nothing in the Attorney General's regulations that
forces a contrary conclusion.

Mississippi adds that the Attorney General--if faced with
an ambiguity--could have sought more information to clarify
the situation, to determine what would happen if the legislature failed to pass the bill, for example. And the Attorney
General could then have withheld her approval once she
found out what would likely occur. Again, Mississippi is
right as to what the Attorney General might have done.
See $ 51.37(a) (Attorney General may request more information about submissions). Indeed, the United States "acknowledge[s]" that with "the benefit of hindsight, . . . such a
request might have been preferable" to preclearing the sub520US1 Unit: $U40 [09-10-99 17:19:18] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
mission. Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 27,n. 14. Still, the law does not

require the Attorney General,
in these circumstances, to obtain more information. Clark,
supra, at 658-659 (The Attorney General is under no duty
to investigate voting changes). See also McCain, supra, at
247 (Congress " `acknowledged and anticipated [the] inabilityof the Justice Department--given limited resources--to investigate independently all changes . . .' " (quoting Perkins,400 U. S., at 392, n. 10)). And the issue, of course, is not
whether she should or should not have issued a preclearanceletter on February 1, 1995, but rather

what it was that she
precleared. Her failure to seek added information makes it
more likely, not less likely, that she intended to preclear what
she took to be the natural import of the earlier submission,
namely, a proposal for a single state/federal registration
system.

Finally, Mississippi argues that the Attorney General in
fact knew, on February 1, 1995, when she issued the preclearance letter that the state legislature would not enact the proposed bill. And it adds that the Attorney General nonetheless approved the submission in order to have in place a
precleared unitary system that would serve as a benchmark
for measuring whether subsequent changes are retrogressive, thereby permitting the Attorney General to argue that

$ 5 prohibited as retrogressive the dual system which she
knew would likely emerge because the legislation failed. In
fact, the record is not clear about just what the Department
of Justice did or did not know (e. g., whether tabling the bill
meant killing it; whether state election law definitely had
to be changed). But in any event, the short answer to the
argument is that Mississippi's description of the Department's motive, if true, would refute its claim that the Attorney General intended to preclear a dual system. Indeed,
only two weeks after the February 1 preclearance, the Attorney General wrote to Mississippi stating explicitly her
view that its submission had not sought "preclearance for a

dual registration and purge system." App. to Juris. State-ment 25a. See McCain, supra, at 255-256 (relying on

"such after-the-fact Justice Department statements . . . indetermining whether a particular change was actually
precleared").Regardless, the law ordinarily permits the Attorney General to rest a decision to preclear or not to preclear upon thesubmission itself.

Clark, supra, at 658-659; United Statesv. Sheffield Bd. of Comm'rs, 435 U. S. 110, 136-138 (1978).

Tying preclearance to a particular set of written documentsthemselves helps to avoid the kinds of arguments about
meaning and intent that Mississippi raises here--argumentsthat, were they frequently to arise, could delay expeditious
decisionmaking as to the many thousands of requests forclearance that the Department of Justice receives each year.
See Clark, supra, at 658-659. In sum, we conclude that theDepartment of Justice, on February 1, did not preclear the
New System. 2

Finally, Mississippi argues that the NVRA, because it spe-cifically applies only to registration for federal elections, 42
U. S. C. $ 1973gg-2(a), automatically authorizes it to maintainseparate voting procedures; hence $ 5 cannot be used to force
it to implement the NVRA for all elections. If Mississippimeans that the NVRA does not forbid two systems and that

$ 5 of the VRA does not categorically--without more--forbida State to maintain a dual system, we agree. The decision
to adopt the NVRA federal registration system is not, byitself, a change for the purposes of $ 5, for the State has no
choice but to do so. And of course, a State's retention of aprior system for state elections, by itself, is not a change.
It is the discretionary elements of the new federal systemthat the State must preclear. The problem for Mississippi
is that preclearance typically requires examination of dis-cretionary changes in context--a context that includes history, purpose, and practical effect. See City of Lockhart v.

LAMBERT, GALLATIN COUNTY ATTORNEY v.

WICKLUND et al.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 96-858. Decided March 31, 1997
Montana's Parental Notice of Abortion Act permits a court to waive the

requirement that one parent be notified before a minor has an abortion
if, inter alia, notification is not in the minor's best interests. The Federal District Court declared the Act unconstitutional because the judicial bypass mechanism does not authorize waiver of the notice requirement whenever the abortion itself is in the minor's best interest. The
Ninth Circuit affirmed, basing its conclusion entirely on its earlier decision that Nevada's identical bypass requirement was inconsistent with
Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622, and Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502.

Held: The Act's judicial bypass provision sufficiently protects a minor's

right to an abortion. The Ninth Circuit's holding to the contrary is in
direct conflict with this Court's precedents. The principal opinion in
Bellotti explained the four criteria that a parental consent statute bypass provision must meet to be constitutional, and this Court explicitly
held that the Ohio statute at issue in Akron met the second Bellotti
requirement: that the minor be allowed to show that the desired abortion would be in her best interests. The Ohio statute was indistinguishable in any relevant way from the statute at issue here, and, thus,
the Montana law also meets the second Bellotti requirement. Akron's
context, the Ohio statute's language, and Akron's concurring opinion all
make clear that requiring a minor to show that parental notification is
not in her best interests is equivalent to requiring her to show that
abortion without notification is in her best interests. Contrary to respondents' argument, the Montana statute does not draw a distinction
between requiring a minor to show that parental notification is not in
her best interests and requiring her to show that an abortion (without
notification) is in her best interests, and respondents cite no Montana
state-court decision suggesting that the statute permits a court to separate these questions.

Certiorari granted; 93 F. 3d 567, reversed.

Before a minor has an abortion in Montana, one of herparents must be notified. A waiver, or "judicial bypass," of

the notification requirement is allowed if the minor can con-vince a court that notification would not be in her best interests. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struckdown Montana's parental notification law as unconstitutional,
holding that the judicial bypass did not sufficiently protectthe right of minors to have an abortion. Because the Ninth
Circuit's holding is in direct conflict with our precedents, wegrant the petition for a writ of certiorari and reverse.

In 1995, Montana enacted the Parental Notice of AbortionAct. The Act prohibits a physician from performing an
abortion on a minor unless the physician has notified one ofthe minor's parents or the minor's legal guardian 48 hours in
advance. Mont. Code Ann. $ 50-20-204 (1995).1 However,an "unemancipated" minor

2 may petition the state youth

court to waive the notification requirement, pursuant to thestatute's "judicial bypass" provision. $ 50-20-212 (quoted in

full in an appendix to this opinion). The provision gives theminor a right to court-appointed counsel, and guarantees expeditious handling of the minor's petition (since the petitionis automatically granted if the youth court fails to rule on

1 Section 50-20-204 provides in relevant part: "A physician may not perform an abortion upon a minor or an incompetent person unless the physician has given at least 48 hours' actual notice to one parent or to the legal
guardian of the pregnant minor or incompetent person of the physician's
intention to perform the abortion. . . . If actual notice is not possible after
a reasonable effort, the physician or the physician's agent shall give alternate notice as provided in 50-20-205." Section 50-20-205 provides for
notice by certified mail. The notice requirement does not apply if "a medical emergency exists and there is insufficient time to provide notice."

the petition within 48 hours from the time it is filed). $$ 50-20-212(2)(a), (3). The minor's identity remains anonymous,

and the proceedings and related documents are kept con-fidential. $ 50-20-212(3).

If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that
any of the following three conditions are met, it must grantthe petition and waive the notice requirement: (i) the minor

is "sufficiently mature to decide whether to have an abor-tion"; (ii) "there is evidence of a pattern of physical, sexual,
or emotional abuse" of the minor by one of her parents, aguardian, or a custodian; or (iii) "the

notification of a parent
or guardian is not in the best interests of the [minor]."

$$ 50-20-212(4), (5) (emphasis added). It is this third condition which is at issue here.

Before the Act's effective date, respondents--several physicians who perform abortions, and other medical personnel--filed a complaint seeking a declaration that the Act was
unconstitutional and an order enjoining its enforcement.
The District Court for the District of Montana, addressing
only one of respondents' arguments, held that the Act was
unconstitutional because the third condition set out above
was too narrow. According to the District Court, our precedents require that judicial bypass mechanisms authorize
waiver of the notice requirement whenever "the abortion
would be in [the minor's] best interests," not just when "notification would not be in the minor's best interests." App.
to Pet. for Cert. 17a (emphasis in original) (citing Bellotti v.
Baird, 443 U. S. 622, 640-642 (1979) (plurality opinion)).
Three days before the Act was to go into effect, the District
Court enjoined its enforcement.

The Court of Appeals affirmed, stating that it was bound
by its prior decision in Glick v. McKay, 937 F. 2d 434 (CA9
1991). See Wicklund v. Salvagni, 93 F. 3d 567, 571-572
(CA9 1996). Glick struck down Nevada's parental notification statute which, like Montana's statute here, allowed a
minor to bypass the notification requirement if a court deter520us1$41H 05-14-98 09:56:54 PAGES OPINPGT

mined that the notification would not be in the minor's bestinterests. The court's conclusion was based on its analysis

of our decisions in Bellotti v. Baird, supra, and Ohio v.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502 (1990).

In Bellotti, we struck down a statute requiring a minor to
obtain the consent of both parents before having an abortion,subject to a judicial bypass provision, because the judicial

bypass provision was too restrictive, unconstitutionally bur-dening a minor's right to an abortion. 443 U. S., at 647 (plurality opinion); id., at 655-656 (Stevens, J., concurring injudgment). The Court's principal opinion explained that a
constitutional parental consent statute must contain a bypass provision that meets four criteria: (i) allow the minor to
bypass the consent requirement if she establishes that she is
mature enough and well enough informed to make the abortion decision independently; (ii) allow the minor to bypass
the consent requirement if she establishes that the abortion
would be in her best interests; (iii) ensure the minor's anonymity; and (iv) provide for expeditious bypass procedures.
Id., at 643-644 (plurality opinion). See also Akron, 497
U. S., at 511-513 (restating the four requirements).

In Akron, we upheld a statute requiring a minor to notify
one parent before having an abortion, subject to a judicial
bypass provision. We declined to decide whether a parental
notification statute must include some sort of bypass provision to be constitutional. Id., at 510. Instead, we held that
this bypass provision satisfied the four Bellotti criteria required for bypass provisions in parental consent statutes,
and that a fortiori it satisfied any criteria that might be required for bypass provisions in parental notification statutes.
Critically for the case now before us, the judicial bypass provision we examined in Akron was substantively indistinguishable from both the Montana judicial bypass provision
at issue here and the Nevada provision at issue in Glick.
See 497 U. S., at 508 (summarizing Ohio Rev. Code Ann.

$ 2151.85 (1995)). The judicial bypass provision in Akron al520us1$41H 05-14-98 09:56:54 PAGES OPINPGT

lowed a court to waive the notification requirement if it de-termined by clear and convincing evidence "that

notice is not
in [the minor's] best interests" (not that an abortion is in herbest interests). 497 U. S., at 508 (emphasis added) (citing

$ 2151.85(A)(4)). And we explicitly held that this provision
satisfied the second Bellotti requirement, that "the proce-dure must allow the minor to show that, even if she cannot

make the abortion decision by herself, `the desired abortionwould be in her best interests.' " 497 U. S., at 511 (quoting
Bellotti, supra, at 644).Despite the fact that

Akron involved a parental notification statute, and Bellotti involved a parental consent statute; 3 despite the fact that Akron involved a statute virtually

identical to the Nevada statute at issue in Glick; and despite
the fact that Akron explicitly held that the statute met all
of the Bellotti requirements, the Ninth Circuit in Glick
struck down Nevada's parental notification statute as inconsistent with Bellotti:

"Rather than requiring the reviewing court to consider
the minor's `best interests' generally, the Nevada statute
requires the consideration of "best interests" only with
respect to the possible consequences of parental notification. The best interests of a minor female in obtaining an abortion may encompass far more than her interests in not notifying a parent of the abortion decision.
Furthermore, in Bellotti, the court expressly stated,
`[i]f, all things considered, the court determines that an
abortion is in the minor's best interests, she is entitled
to court authorization without any parental involvement.' Bellotti, 443 U. S. at 648 (emphasis added).
Therefore, the Nevada statute impermissibly narrows

3 See Bellotti, 443 U. S., at 654, n. 1 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]his case [does not] determin[e] the constitutionality of a statute
which does no more than require notice to the parents, without affording
them or any other third party an absolute veto").

the Bellotti `best interests' criterion, and is unconstitutional." 937 F. 2d, at 439.

Based entirely on Glick, the Ninth Circuit in this case affirmed the District Court's ruling that the Montana statute
is unconstitutional, since the statute allows waiver of the notification requirement only if the youth court determines
that notification--not the abortion itself--is not in the minor's best interests. 93 F. 3d, at 572.

As should be evident from the foregoing, this decision simply cannot be squared with our decision in Akron. The Ohio
parental notification statute at issue there was indistinguishable in any relevant way from the Montana statute at issue
here. Both allow for judicial bypass if the minor shows that
parental notification is not in her best interests. We asked
in Akron whether this met the Bellotti requirement that the
minor be allowed to show that "the desired abortion would
be in her best interests." We explicitly held that it did.
497 U. S., at 511. Thus, the Montana statute meets this requirement, too. In concluding otherwise, the Ninth Circuit
was mistaken.

Respondents (as did the Ninth Circuit in Glick) place great
emphasis on our statement in Akron, that "[t]he statute requires the juvenile court to authorize the minor's consent
where the court determines that the abortion is in the minor's best interest." 497 U. S., at 511 (emphasis added) (citing Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2151.85(C)(2) (Supp. 1988)). But
since we had clearly stated that the statute actually required
such authorization only when the court determined that notification would not be in the minor's best interests, it is
wrong to take our statement to imply that the statute said
otherwise. Rather, underlying our statement was an assumption that a judicial bypass procedure requiring a minor
to show that parental notification is not in her best interests
is equivalent to a judicial bypass procedure requiring a minor
to show that abortion without notification is in her best in520us1$41H 05-14-98 09:56:54 PAGES OPINPGT

terests, as the context of the opinion, the statutory language,
and the concurring opinion all make clear.4

Respondents, echoing the Ninth Circuit in Glick, claim
that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between requiring a minor to show that parental notification is
not in her best interests, and requiring a minor to show that
an abortion (without such notification) is in her best interests. See Brief in Opposition 12-13; 937 F. 2d, at 438-439.
But the Montana statute draws no such distinction, and respondents cite no Montana state-court decision suggesting
that the statute permits a court to separate the question
whether parental notification is not in a minor's best interest
from an inquiry into whether abortion (without notification)
is in the minor's best interest. As with the Ohio statute in
Akron, the challenge to the Montana statute here is a facial
one. Under these circumstances, the Ninth Circuit was incorrect to assume that Montana's statute "narrow[ed]" the
Bellotti test, 937 F. 2d, at 439, as interpreted in Akron.

4 See 497 U. S., at 517 ("if she can demonstrate that her maturity or best
interests favor abortion without notifying one of her parents"); id., at 522
(Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("Although
it need not take the form of a judicial bypass, the State must provide an
adequate mechanism for cases in which the minor is mature or notice
would not be in her best interests" (emphasis added)); Ohio Rev. Code

APPENDIX TO PER CURIAM OPINION
Mont. Code Ann. $ 50-20-212 (1995):

"(1) The requirements and procedures under this section
are available to minors and incompetent persons whether or
not they are residents of this state.

"(2) (a) The minor or incompetent person may petition the
youth court for a waiver of the notice requirement and may
participate in the proceedings on the person's own behalf.
The petition must include a statement that the petitioner is
pregnant and is not emancipated. The court may appoint a
guardian ad litem for the petitioner. A guardian ad litem is
required to maintain the confidentiality of the proceedings.
The youth court shall advise the petitioner of the right to
court-appointed counsel and shall provide the petitioner with
counsel upon request.

"(b) If the petition filed under subsection (2)(a) alleges
abuse as a basis for waiver of notice, the youth court shall
treat the petition as a report under 41-3-202. The provisions of Title 41, chapter 3, part 2, apply to an investigation
conducted pursuant to this subsection.

"(3) Proceedings under this section are confidential and
must ensure the anonymity of the petitioner. All proceedings under this section must be sealed. The petitioner may
file the petition using a pseudonym or using the petitioner's
initials. All documents related to the petition are confidential and are not available to the public. The proceedings on
the petition must be given preference over other pending

matters to the extent necessary to ensure that the court
reaches a prompt decision. The court shall issue written
findings of fact and conclusions of law and rule within 48
hours of the time that the petition is filed unless the time is
extended at the request of the petitioner. If the court fails
to rule within 48 hours and the time is not extended, the
petition is granted and the notice requirement is waived.

"(4) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence
that the petitioner is sufficiently mature to decide whether
to have an abortion, the court shall issue an order authorizing the minor to consent to the performance or inducement of
an abortion without the notification of a parent or guardian.

"(5) The court shall issue an order authorizing the petitioner to consent to an abortion without the notification of a
parent or guardian if the court finds, by clear and convincing
evidence, that:

"(a) there is evidence of a pattern of physical, sexual, or
emotional abuse of the petitioner by one or both parents, a
guardian, or a custodian; or

"(b) the notification of a parent or guardian is not in the
best interests of the petitioner.

"(6) If the court does not make a finding specified in subsection (4) or (5), the court shall dismiss the petition.

"(7) A court that conducts proceedings under this section
shall issue written and specific findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting its decision and shall order that a
confidential record of the evidence, findings, and conclusions
be maintained.

"(8) The supreme court may adopt rules providing an expedited confidential appeal by a petitioner if the youth court
denies a petition. An order authorizing an abortion without
notice is not subject to appeal.

"(9) Filing fees may not be required of a pregnant minor
who petitions a court for a waiver of parental notification or
appeals a denial of a petition."

Stevens, J., concurring in judgment
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, concurring in the judgment.

We assumed in Ohio v. Akron Center for ReproductiveHealth, 497 U. S. 502 (1990) (Akron II), that a young woman's

demonstration that an abortion would be in her best interestwas sufficient to meet the requirements of the Ohio statute's
judicial bypass provision. In my view, that case requiresus to make the same assumption here. Whether that is a
necessary showing is a question we need not reach.In

Akron II, we upheld a statute authorizing a judicialbypass of a parental notice requirement on the understanding that Ohio Rev. Code Ann. $ 2151.85(C)(2) (1995) requiredthe juvenile court to authorize the procedure whenever it
determined that "the abortion is in the minor's best inter-est," 497 U. S., at 511. Given the fact that the relevant text
of the Montana statute at issue in this case, Mont. Code Ann.$ 50-20-212(5)(b) (1995), is essentially identical to the Ohio
provision, coupled with the fact that the Montana AttorneyGeneral has advised us that "the best interests standard in

$ 50-20-212(5)(b) [is] either identical to or substantively in-distinguishable from the best interests" provision construed
in Akron II, Pet. for Cert. 7, it is surely appropriate to as-sume that the Montana provision also requires the court to
authorize the minor's consent whenever the abortion is inher best interests. So understood, the Montana statute is
plainly constitutional under our ruling in Akron II. Be-cause the Court of Appeals erroneously construed the statute in a manner that caused that court to hold the statuteunconstitutional, I agree with the majority that the judgment below should be reversed.*

*Our reading of the statute in Akron II appropriately recognized that
the two inquiries at issue here--whether an abortion is in a young woman's best interest, and whether notifying a minor's parents of her desire
to obtain an abortion is in her best interest--are sometimes linked. For
example, if a judge finds after careful assessment of all the circumstances

While a showing that an abortion is in a young woman'sbest interest is therefore sufficient to satisfy the Montana

judicial bypass provision as we understood an analogousstatute in Akron II, I do not think the Court need address
whether the Montana statute can be properly understood tomake such a demonstration a necessary requirement. My
colleagues suggest that the statute requires a minor "toshow that abortion without notification is in her best interests," ante, at 297-298 (emphasis deleted). To the extentthis language indicates that a young woman must demonstrate both that abortion is in her best interest and that noti-fication is not, I think that question is best left for another
day. I note, however, that the plain language of the statutemakes passably clear that a showing that notification is not
in the minor's best interest is alone sufficient. See Mont.Code Ann. $ 50-20-212(5)(b) (1995) ("The court shall issue an
order authorizing the petitioner to consent to an abortionwithout the notification of a parent . . . if the court finds, by
clear and convincing evidence, that . . . the notification of aparent . . . is not in the best interests of the petitioner").

Although I therefore do not agree with all of the Court'sreasoning, I concur in the majority's view that the judgment
of the Court of Appeals must be reversed.

that the abortion a young woman seeks would be in her best interest, and
determines that notifying her parents is both opposed by the young
woman and would likely cause her to be deterred from pursuing the
treatment decision that would serve her best, then parental notification
is assuredly not in her best interest. Under such circumstances, the
proper course for the trial judge would be to permit the abortion without notification.

No. 96-8005. Decided April 14, 1997
Pro se petitioner seeks leave to proceed in forma pauperis and requests

this Court to issue a writ of habeas corpus vacating her 13-year-old
convictions. In the past 6 1/2 years, she has filed 11 petitions for certiorari, 12 petitions for extraordinary relief, and 2 applications for bail, all
of which have been denied. While her first 14 motions to proceed in
forma pauperis were granted, she has since been denied leave to proceed in forma pauperis five times under this Court's Rule 39.8.

Held: Petitioner's motion to proceed in forma pauperis is denied. For

the reasons discussed in Martin v. District of Columbia Court of Appeals, 506 U. S. 1 (per curiam), she is barred from filing any further
petitions for extraordinary writs unless she first pays the docketing fee
and submits her petition in compliance with Rule 33.

This is not Vey's first filing in this Court. In the past 61/2years, she has filed 11 petitions for certiorari, 12 petitions
for extraordinary relief, and 2 applications for bail. All ofthese have been denied. For the first 14 of those submissions, we granted her motions to proceed in forma pauperis.Since then, we have five times denied her leave to proceed
in forma pauperis under this Court's Rule 39.8.*We again deny petitioner's motion to proceed

in formapauperis. Her various allegations are supported by nothing

other than her own conclusory statements that they are true.

*Rule 39.8 provides: "If satisfied that a petition for a writ of certiorari,

CHANDLER et al. v. MILLER, GOVERNOR OFGEORGIA,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 96-126. Argued January 14, 1997--Decided April 15, 1997
A Georgia statute requires candidates for designated state offices to certify that they have taken a urinalysis drug test within 30 days prior to
qualifying for nomination or election and that the test result was negative. Petitioners, Libertarian Party nominees for state offices subject
to the statute's requirements, filed this action in the District Court
about one month before the deadline for submission of the certificates.
Naming as defendants the Governor and two officials involved in the
statute's administration, petitioners asserted, inter alia, that the drug
tests violated their rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution. The District Court
denied petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction and later entered
final judgment for respondents. Relying on this Court's precedents
sustaining drug-testing programs for student athletes, Vernonia School
Dist. 47J v. Acton, 515 U. S. 646, 650, 665-666, Customs Service employees, Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656, 659, and railway
employees, Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602,
608-613, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed. The court accepted as settled
law that the tests were searches, but reasoned that, as was true of the
drug-testing programs at issue in Skinner and Von Raab, the statute
served "special needs," interests other than the ordinary needs of law
enforcement. Balancing the individual's privacy expectations against
the State's interest in the drug-testing program, the court held the statute, as applied to petitioners, not inconsistent with the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Held: Georgia's requirement that candidates for state office pass a drug

test does not fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally
permissible suspicionless searches. Pp. 313-323.

(a) It is uncontested that Georgia's drug-testing requirement, imposed by law and enforced by state officials, effects a search within
the meaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The pivotal
question here is whether the searches are reasonable. To be reasonable
under the Fourth Amendment, a search ordinarily must be based on
individualized suspicion of wrongdoing. See Vernonia, 515 U. S., at
652-653. But particularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes

520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
306 CHANDLER v. MILLER

Syllabus
warranted based on "special needs, beyond the normal need for law
enforcement." See Skinner, 489 U. S., at 619. When such "special
needs" are alleged, courts must undertake a context-specific inquiry,
examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced
by the parties. See Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 665-666. In evaluating
Georgia's ballot-access, drug-testing statute--a measure plainly not tied
to individualized suspicion--the Eleventh Circuit sought to balance the
competing interests in line with this Court's precedents most immediately in point: Skinner, Von Raab, and Vernonia. Pp. 313-317.

(b) These precedents remain the guides for assessing the validity of
the Georgia statute despite respondents' invitation to apply a framework extraordinarily deferential to state measures setting conditions
of candidacy for state office. No precedent suggests that a State's sovereign power to establish qualifications for state offices diminishes
the constraints on state action imposed by the Fourth Amendment.
Pp. 317-318.

(c) Georgia's testing method is relatively noninvasive; therefore, if
the "special need" showing had been made, the State could not be
faulted for excessive intrusion. However, Georgia has failed to show
a special need that is substantial--important enough to override the
individual's acknowledged privacy interest, sufficiently vital to suppress
the Fourth Amendment's normal requirement of individualized suspicion. Respondents contend that unlawful drug use is incompatible with
holding high state office because such drug use draws into question an
official's judgment and integrity; jeopardizes the discharge of public
functions, including antidrug law enforcement efforts; and undermines
public confidence and trust in elected officials. Notably lacking in respondents' presentation is any indication of a concrete danger demanding departure from the Fourth Amendment's main rule. The statute
was not enacted, as respondents concede, in response to any fear or
suspicion of drug use by state officials. A demonstrated problem of
drug abuse, while not in all cases necessary to the validity of a testing
regime, see Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 673-675, would shore up an assertion
of special need for a suspicionless general search program, see Skinner,
489 U. S., at 606-608; Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 662-663. In contrast to
the effective testing regimes upheld in Skinner, Von Raab, and Vernonia, Georgia's certification requirement is not well designed to identify candidates who violate antidrug laws and is not a credible means to
deter illicit drug users from seeking state office. The test date is selected by the candidate, and thus all but the prohibitively addicted could
abstain for a pretest period sufficient to avoid detection. Respondents'
reliance on this Court's decision in Von Raab, which sustained a drug520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

testing program for Customs Service officers prior to promotion or
transfer to certain high-risk positions, despite the absence of any documented drug abuse problem among Service employees, 489 U. S., at 660,
is misplaced. Hardly a decision opening broad vistas for suspicionless
searches, Von Raab must be read in its unique context. Drug interdiction had become the agency's primary enforcement mission. The covered posts directly involved drug interdiction or otherwise required
Customs officers to carry firearms, the employees would have access to
vast sources of valuable contraband, and officers had been targets of and
some had succumbed to bribery by drug smugglers. Moreover, it was
not feasible to subject the Customs Service employees to the kind of
day-to-day scrutiny that is the norm in more traditional office environments. In telling contrast, the day-to-day conduct of candidates for
public office attracts attention notably beyond the norm in ordinary
work environments. What is left, after close review of Georgia's
scheme, is that the State seeks to display its commitment to the struggle
against drug abuse. But Georgia asserts no evidence of a drug problem
among the State's elected officials, those officials typically do not perform high-risk, safety-sensitive tasks, and the required certification immediately aids no interdiction effort. The need revealed is symbolic,
not "special." The Fourth Amendment shields society from state action
that diminishes personal privacy for a symbol's sake. Pp. 318-322.

(d) The Court expresses no opinion on medical examinations designed
to provide certification of a candidate's general health or on financial disclosure requirements, and it does not speak to drug testing in
the private sector, a domain unguarded by Fourth Amendment constraints. P. 323.

Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
The Fourth Amendment requires government to respect"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons . . .

against unreasonable searches and seizures." This restrainton government conduct generally bars officials from undertaking a search or seizure absent individualized suspicion.Searches conducted without grounds for suspicion of particular individuals have been upheld, however, in "certain limitedcircumstances." See

Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489U. S. 656, 668 (1989). These circumstances include brief

stops for questioning or observation at a fixed Border Patrolcheckpoint,

United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U. S. 543,545-550, 566-567 (1976), or at a sobriety checkpoint, Michigan Dept. of State Police v. Sitz, 496 U. S. 444, 447, 455(1990), and administrative inspections in "closely regulated"
businesses, New York v. Burger, 482 U. S. 691, 703-704(1987).

Georgia requires candidates for designated state offices tocertify that they have taken a drug test and that the test
result was negative. Ga. Code Ann. $ 21-2-140 (1993) (here-inafter $ 21-2-140). We confront in this case the question
whether that requirement ranks among the limited cir-cumstances in which suspicionless searches are warranted.

employees involved in train accidents and for those who vio-late particular safety rules), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit judged Georgia's law constitu-tional. We reverse that judgment. Georgia's requirement
that candidates for state office pass a drug test, we hold, doesnot fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally
permissible suspicionless searches.

I
The prescription at issue, approved by the Georgia Legis-lature in 1990, orders that "[e]ach candidate seeking to qualify for nomination or election to a state office shall as a condi-tion of such qualification be required to certify that such
candidate has tested negative for illegal drugs." $ 21-2-140(b). Georgia was the first, and apparently remains the
only, State to condition candidacy for state office on a drugtest.

Under the Georgia statute, to qualify for a place on theballot, a candidate must present a certificate from a stateapproved laboratory, in a form approved by the Secretary ofState, reporting that the candidate submitted to a urinalysis
drug test within 30 days prior to qualifying for nominationor election and that the results were negative. $ 21-2-
140(c). The statute lists as "[i]llegal drug[s]": marijuana,cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidines. $ 21-2-
140(a)(3). The designated state offices are: "the Governor,Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General,
State School Superintendent, Commissioner of Insurance,

Opinion of the Court
Commissioner of Agriculture, Commissioner of Labor, Justices of the Supreme Court, Judges of the Court of Appeals,
judges of the superior courts, district attorneys, members of
the General Assembly, and members of the Public Service
Commission." $ 21-2-140(a)(4).

Candidate drug tests are to be administered in a manner
consistent with the United States Department of Health
and Human Services Guidelines, 53 Fed. Reg. 11979-11989
(1988), or other professionally valid procedures approved by
Georgia's Commissioner of Human Resources. See $ 21-2-
140(a)(2). A candidate may provide the test specimen at a
laboratory approved by the State, or at the office of the candidate's personal physician, see App. 4-5 (Joint Statement
of Undisputed Facts). Once a urine sample is obtained, an
approved laboratory determines whether any of the five
specified illegal drugs are present, id., at 5; $ 21-2-140(c), and
prepares a certificate reporting the test results to the
candidate.

Petitioners were Libertarian Party nominees in 1994 for
state offices subject to the requirements of $ 21-2-140. The
Party nominated Walker L. Chandler for the office of Lieutenant Governor, Sharon T. Harris for the office of Commissioner of Agriculture, and James D. Walker for the office of
member of the General Assembly. In May 1994, about one
month before the deadline for submission of the certificates
required by $ 21-2-140, petitioners Chandler, Harris, and
Walker filed this action in the United States District Court
for the Northern District of Georgia. They asserted, inter
alia, that the drug tests required by $ 21-2-140 violated
their rights under the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Naming as defendants Governor Zell D. Miller and two other state officials
involved in the administration of $ 21-2-140, petitioners requested declaratory and injunctive relief barring enforcement of the statute.

Opinion of the Court
In June 1994, the District Court denied petitioners' motionfor a preliminary injunction. Stressing the importance of

the state offices sought and the relative unintrusiveness ofthe testing procedure, the court found it unlikely that petitioners would prevail on the merits of their claims. App. to
Pet. for Cert. 5B. Petitioners apparently submitted to thedrug tests, obtained the certificates required by $ 21-2-140,

and appeared on the ballot. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 5. Afterthe 1994 election, the parties jointly moved for the entry
of final judgment on stipulated facts. In January 1995, theDistrict Court entered final judgment for respondents.

A divided Eleventh Circuit panel affirmed. 73 F. 3d 1543
(1996). It is settled law, the court accepted, that the drug
tests required by the statute rank as searches. But, as was
true of the drug-testing programs at issue in Skinner and
Von Raab, the court reasoned, $ 21-2-140 serves "special
needs," interests other than the ordinary needs of law enforcement. The court therefore endeavored to " `balance the
individual's privacy expectations against the Government's
interests to determine whether it [was] impractical to require a warrant or some level of individualized suspicion in
the particular context.' " 73 F. 3d, at 1545 (quoting Von
Raab, 489 U. S., at 665-666).

Examining the state interests involved, the court acknowledged the absence of any record of drug abuse by elected
officials in Georgia. Nonetheless, the court observed, "[t]he
people of Georgia place in the trust of their elected officials
. . . their liberty, their safety, their economic well-being, [and]
ultimate responsibility for law enforcement." 73 F. 3d, at
1546. Consequently, "those vested with the highest executive authority to make public policy in general and frequently to supervise Georgia's drug interdiction efforts in
particular must be persons appreciative of the perils of drug
use." Ibid. The court further noted that "[t]he nature of
high public office in itself demands the highest levels of
honesty, clear-sightedness, and clear-thinking." Ibid. Re520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
312 CHANDLER v. MILLER

Opinion of the Court
citing responsibilities of the offices petitioners sought, theCourt of Appeals perceived those "positions [as] particularly

susceptible to the `risks of bribery and blackmail againstwhich the Government is entitled to guard.' " Ibid. (quoting
Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 674).Turning to petitioners' privacy interests, the Eleventh
Circuit emphasized that the tests could be conducted in theoffice of the candidate's private physician, making the "intrusion here . . . even less than that approved in Von Raab."73 F. 3d, at 1547. The court also noted the statute's reference to federally approved drug-testing guidelines. Ibid.The drug test itself would reveal only the presence or absence of indicia of the use of particular drugs, and not anyother information about the health of the candidate. Furthermore, the candidate would control release of the testresults: Should the candidate test positive, he or she could
forfeit the opportunity to run for office, and in that event,nothing would be divulged to law enforcement officials.
Ibid. Another consideration, the court said, is the realitythat "candidates for high office must expect the voters to
demand some disclosures about their physical, emotional, andmental fitness for the position."

Ibid. Concluding that theState's interests outweighed the privacy intrusion caused by

the required certification, the court held the statute, as ap-plied to petitioners, not inconsistent with the Fourth and
Fourteenth Amendments. Ibid.1Judge Barkett dissented. In her view, a balance of the
State's and candidates' interests was not appropriate, for theState had failed to establish a special governmental need for
the regime. "There is nothing so special or immediateabout the generalized governmental interests involved
here," she observed, "as to warrant suspension of the Fourth

We begin our discussion of this case with an uncontestedpoint: Georgia's drug-testing requirement, imposed by law

and enforced by state officials, effects a search within themeaning of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. See
Skinner, 489 U. S., at 617; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36; Brief forUnited States as Amicus Curiae 10 (collection and testing
of urine to meet Georgia's certification statute "constitutes asearch subject to the demands of the Fourth Amendment"
(internal quotation marks omitted)). As explained in Skin-ner, government-ordered "collection and testing of urine intrudes upon expectations of privacy that society has longrecognized as reasonable." 489 U. S., at 617. Because
"these intrusions [are] searches under the Fourth Amend-ment,"

ibid., we focus on the question: Are the searchesreasonable?

To be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a searchordinarily must be based on individualized suspicion of
wrongdoing. See Vernonia, 515 U. S., at 652-653. Butparticularized exceptions to the main rule are sometimes
warranted based on "special needs, beyond the normal needfor law enforcement."

Skinner, 489 U. S., at 619 (internal

2 The United States, as amicus curiae in support of respondents, suggests that this case may have become moot because there is no continuing
controversy regarding the now-completed 1994 election, and petitioners,
who did not sue on behalf of a class, failed to assert in the courts below
that they intended to run for a covered state office in a future election.
See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 9-10, n. 4. We reject the
suggestion of mootness. Petitioner Chandler represented, as an officer of
this Court, that he plans to run again, and counsel for the State does not
contest that representation. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-6, 27; see also 28
U. S. C. $ 1653 (defective allegations of jurisdiction curable by amendment

quotation marks omitted). When such "special needs"--concerns other than crime detection--are alleged in justification of a Fourth Amendment intrusion, courts must under-take a context-specific inquiry, examining closely the competing private and public interests advanced by the parties.See

Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 665-666; see also id., at 668. AsSkinner stated: "In limited circumstances, where the privacy

interests implicated by the search are minimal, and where animportant governmental interest furthered by the intrusion
would be placed in jeopardy by a requirement of individual-ized suspicion, a search may be reasonable despite the absence of such suspicion." 489 U. S., at 624.In evaluating Georgia's ballot-access, drug-testing statute--a measure plainly not tied to individualized suspicion--the Eleventh Circuit sought to " `balance the individual's privacy expectations against the [State's] interests,' " 73 F. 3d,at 1545 (quoting

Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 665), in line with ourprecedents most immediately in point: Skinner, Von Raab,

and Vernonia. We review those decisions before inspectingGeorgia's law.

A
Skinner concerned Federal Railroad Administration(FRA) regulations that required blood and urine tests of rail

employees involved in train accidents; the regulations alsoauthorized railroads to administer breath and urine tests to
employees who violated certain safety rules. 489 U. S., at608-612. The FRA adopted the drug-testing program in response to evidence of drug and alcohol abuse by some rail-road employees, the obvious safety hazards posed by such
abuse, and the documented link between drug- and alcoholimpaired employees and the incidence of train accidents.
Id., at 607-608. Recognizing that the urinalysis tests, most
conspicuously, raised evident privacy concerns, the Courtnoted two offsetting considerations: First, the regulations reduced the intrusiveness of the collection process, id., at 626;

520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
and, more important, railway employees, "by reason of theirparticipation in an industry that is regulated pervasively to

ensure safety," had diminished expectations of privacy, id.,at 627.

"[S]urpassing safety interests," the Court concluded, war-ranted the FRA testing program.

Id., at 634. The drugtests could deter illegal drug use by railroad employees,

workers positioned to "cause great human loss before anysigns of impairment become noticeable to supervisors." Id.,
at 628. The program also helped railroads to obtain invalu-able information about the causes of major train accidents.
See id., at 630. Testing without a showing of individualizedsuspicion was essential, the Court explained, if these vital
interests were to be served. See id., at 628. Employeescould not forecast the timing of an accident or a safety violation, events that would trigger testing. The employee's in-ability to avoid detection simply by staying drug free at a
prescribed test time significantly enhanced the deterrent ef-fect of the program. See

ibid. Furthermore, imposing anindividualized suspicion requirement for a drug test in the

chaotic aftermath of a train accident would seriously impede
an employer's ability to discern the cause of the accident;indeed, waiting until suspect individuals could be identified

"likely would result in the loss or deterioration of the evi-dence furnished by the tests."

Id., at 631.
In Von Raab, the Court sustained a United States Cus-toms Service program that made drug tests a condition of

promotion or transfer to positions directly involving drug interdiction or requiring the employee to carry a firearm. 489U. S., at 660-661, 667-677.

However, we did not rule on this aspect of the program, see id., at 677-678,

mission," id., at 674, as the "first line of defense" against thesmuggling of illicit drugs into the United States, id., at 668.
Work directly involving drug interdiction and posts that re-quire the employee to carry a firearm pose grave safety
threats to employees who hold those positions, and also ex-pose them to large amounts of illegal narcotics and to persons
engaged in crime; illicit drug users in such high-risk po-sitions might be unsympathetic to the Service's mission,
tempted by bribes, or even threatened with blackmail. See
id., at 668-671. The Court held that the Government had a"compelling" interest in assuring that employees placed in

these positions would not include drug users. See id., at670-671. Individualized suspicion would not work in this
setting, the Court determined, because it was "not feasibleto subject [these] employees and their work product to the
kind of day-to-day scrutiny that is the norm in more tradi-tional office environments."

Id., at 674.Finally, in
Vernonia, the Court sustained a random drug-testing program for high school students engaged in interscholastic athletic competitions. The program's context wascritical, for a local government bears large "responsibilities,
under a public school system, as guardian and tutor of chil-dren entrusted to its care." 515 U. S., at 665. An "immediate crisis," id., at 663, caused by "a sharp increase in druguse" in the school district,

id., at 648, sparked installation ofthe program. District Court findings established that student athletes were not only "among the drug users," theywere "leaders of the drug culture." Id., at 649. Our decision noted that " `students within the school environmenthave a lesser expectation of privacy than members of the
population generally.' " Id., at 657 (quoting New Jersey v.
because the record did not clarify "whether the category defined by the
[regulation] encompas[sed] only those Customs employees likely to gain
access to sensitive information," id., at 678.

schoolchildren and the risk of injury a drug-using studentathlete cast on himself and those engaged with him on the

Respondents urge that the precedents just examined arenot the sole guides for assessing the constitutional validity

of the Georgia statute. The "special needs" analysis, theycontend, must be viewed through a different lens because

$ 21-2-140 implicates Georgia's sovereign power, reserved toit under the Tenth Amendment, to establish qualifications for
those who seek state office. Respondents rely on Gregory v.Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452 (1991), which upheld against federal
statutory and Equal Protection Clause challenges Missouri'smandatory retirement age of 70 for state judges. The Court
found this age classification reasonable and not barred by thefederal legislation. See

id., at 473. States, Gregory reaf-firmed, enjoy wide latitude to establish conditions of candidacy for state office, but in setting such conditions, they maynot disregard basic constitutional protections. See id., at
463; McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U. S. 618 (1978) (invalidatingstate provision prohibiting members of clergy from serving
as delegates to state constitutional convention); Communist
Party of Ind. v. Whitcomb, 414 U. S. 441 (1974) (voiding loy-alty oath as a condition of ballot access); Bond v. Floyd, 385

U. S. 116 (1966) (Georgia Legislature could not excludeelected representative on ground that his antiwar statements cast doubt on his ability to take an oath). We areaware of no precedent suggesting that a State's power to
establish qualifications for state offices--any more than itssovereign power to prosecute crime--diminishes the constraints on state action imposed by the Fourth Amendment.We therefore reject respondents' invitation to apply in this
case a framework extraordinarily deferential to state meas520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ures setting conditions of candidacy for state office. Our
guides remain Skinner, Von Raab, and Vernonia.

Turning to those guides, we note, first, that the testing
method the Georgia statute describes is relatively noninvasive; therefore, if the "special needs" showing had been
made, the State could not be faulted for excessive intrusion.
Georgia's statute invokes the drug-testing guidelines applicable to the federal programs upheld in Skinner and Von
Raab. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae
20-21; Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 661-662, n. 1. The State permits a candidate to provide the urine specimen in the office
of his or her private physician; and the results of the test are
given first to the candidate, who controls further dissemination of the report. Because the State has effectively limited
the invasiveness of the testing procedure, we concentrate on
the core issue: Is the certification requirement warranted by
a special need?

Our precedents establish that the proffered special need
for drug testing must be substantial--important enough to
override the individual's acknowledged privacy interest, sufficiently vital to suppress the Fourth Amendment's normal
requirement of individualized suspicion. See supra, at 313-
317 and this page. Georgia has failed to show, in justification of $ 21-2-140, a special need of that kind.

Respondents' defense of the statute rests primarily on the
incompatibility of unlawful drug use with holding high state
office. The statute is justified, respondents contend, because the use of illegal drugs draws into question an official's
judgment and integrity; jeopardizes the discharge of public
functions, including antidrug law enforcement efforts; and
undermines public confidence and trust in elected officials.
Brief for Respondents 11-18. The statute, according to respondents, serves to deter unlawful drug users from becoming candidates and thus stops them from attaining high state
office. Id., at 17-18. Notably lacking in respondents' pres520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
entation is any indication of a concrete danger demandingdeparture from the Fourth Amendment's main rule.

Nothing in the record hints that the hazards respond-ents broadly describe are real and not simply hypothetical
for Georgia's polity. The statute was not enacted, as coun-sel for respondents readily acknowledged at oral argument,
in response to any fear or suspicion of drug use by stateofficials:

"QUESTION: Is there any indication anywhere in thisrecord that Georgia has a particular problem here with
State officeholders being drug abusers?
"[COUNSEL FOR RESPONDENTS]: No, there is nosuch evidence, [and] to be frank, there is no such problem as we sit here today." Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.
See also id., at 31 (counsel for respondents affirms absence
of evidence that state officeholders in Georgia have drugproblems). A demonstrated problem of drug abuse, while

not in all cases necessary to the validity of a testing regime,see

Von Raab, 489 U. S., at 673-675, would shore up an assertion of special need for a suspicionless general search pro-gram. Proof of unlawful drug use may help to clarify--and

to substantiate--the precise hazards posed by such use.
Thus, the evidence of drug and alcohol use by railway em-ployees engaged in safety-sensitive tasks in

Skinner, see 489
U. S., at 606-608, and the immediate crisis prompted by asharp rise in students' use of unlawful drugs in

Vernonia,
see 515 U. S., at 662-663, bolstered the Government's andschool officials' arguments that drug-testing programs were

warranted and appropriate.In contrast to the effective testing regimes upheld in

Skinner, Von Raab, and Vernonia, Georgia's certification requirement is not well designed to identify candidates who violateantidrug laws. Nor is the scheme a credible means to deter

illicit drug users from seeking election to state office. Thetest date--to be scheduled by the candidate anytime within

Opinion of the Court
30 days prior to qualifying for a place on the ballot--is nosecret. As counsel for respondents acknowledged at oral argument, users of illegal drugs, save for those prohibitivelyaddicted, could abstain for a pretest period sufficient to avoid
detection. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 44-46.4 Even if we in-dulged respondents' argument that one purpose of $ 21-2-
140 might be to detect those unable so to abstain, see id., at46, respondents have not shown or argued that such persons
are likely to be candidates for public office in Georgia.Moreover, respondents have offered no reason why ordinary
law enforcement methods would not suffice to apprehendsuch addicted individuals, should they appear in the limelight
of a public stage. Section 21-2-140, in short, is not neededand cannot work to ferret out lawbreakers, and respondents
barely attempt to support the statute on that ground.Respondents and the United States as amicus curiae rely
most heavily on our decision in Von Raab, which sustaineda drug-testing program for Customs Service officers prior to
promotion or transfer to certain high-risk positions, despitethe absence of any documented drug abuse problem among
Service employees. 489 U. S., at 660; see Brief for Respond-ents 12-14; Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 18; seealso 73 F. 3d, at 1546. The posts in question in Von Raab

directly involved drug interdiction or otherwise required theService member to carry a firearm. See 489 U. S., at 670
("Government has a compelling interest in ensuring thatfront-line interdiction personnel are physically fit, and have
unimpeachable integrity and judgment."); id., at 670-671("[T]he public should not bear the risk that employees who
may suffer from impaired perception and judgment will bepromoted to positions where they may need to employ
deadly force.").

4 In Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656 (1989), the applicant
for promotion or transfer could not know precisely when action would be
taken on the application. In contrast, the potential candidate knows from
the start the timing of all relevant events.

Opinion of the Court
Hardly a decision opening broad vistas for suspicionlesssearches,

Von Raab must be read in its unique context. As
the Customs Service reported in announcing the testing pro-gram: "Customs employees, more than any other Federal

workers, are routinely exposed to the vast network of organized crime that is inextricably tied to illegal drug use."
National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab, 816 F. 2d
170, 173 (CA5 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted), aff 'din part, vacated in part, 489 U. S. 656 (1989). We stressed

that "[d]rug interdiction ha[d] become the agency's primaryenforcement mission,"

id., at 660, and that the employees
in question would have "access to vast sources of valuable
contraband," id., at 669. Furthermore, Customs officers
"ha[d] been the targets of bribery by drug smugglers on numerous occasions," and several had succumbed to the temptation. Ibid.

Respondents overlook a telling difference between Von
Raab and Georgia's candidate drug-testing program. In
Von Raab it was "not feasible to subject employees [required
to carry firearms or concerned with interdiction of controlled
substances] and their work product to the kind of day-to-day
scrutiny that is the norm in more traditional office environments." Id., at 674. Candidates for public office, in
contrast, are subject to relentless scrutiny--by their peers,
the public, and the press. Their day-to-day conduct attracts attention notably beyond the norm in ordinary work
environments.

What is left, after close review of Georgia's scheme, is the
image the State seeks to project. By requiring candidates
for public office to submit to drug testing, Georgia displays
its commitment to the struggle against drug abuse. The
suspicionless tests, according to respondents, signify that
candidates, if elected, will be fit to serve their constituents
free from the influence of illegal drugs. But Georgia asserts
no evidence of a drug problem among the State's elected
officials, those officials typically do not perform high-risk,

Opinion of the Court
safety-sensitive tasks, and the required certification immedi-ately aids no interdiction effort. The need revealed, in

short, is symbolic, not "special," as that term draws meaningfrom our case law.

In Von Raab, the Customs Service had defended its officer
drug-testing program in part as a way to demonstrate theagency's commitment to enforcement of the law. See Brief

for United States in Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, O. T.1988, No. 86-1879, pp. 35-36. The

Von Raab Court, however, did not rely on that justification. Indeed, if a need ofthe "set a good example" genre were sufficient to overwhelm

a Fourth Amendment objection, then the care this Courttook to explain why the needs in

Skinner, Von Raab, and
Vernonia ranked as "special" wasted many words in entirely
unnecessary, perhaps even misleading, elaborations.In a pathmarking dissenting opinion, Justice Brandeis recognized the importance of teaching by example: "Our Gov-ernment is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good
or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example." Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928). Justice
Brandeis explained in Olmstead why the Government set abad example when it introduced in a criminal proceeding evidence obtained through an unlawful Government wiretap:

"[I]t is . . . immaterial that the intrusion was in aid of
law enforcement. Experience should teach us to bemost on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent. Men born to freedom
are naturally alert to repel invasion of their liberty byevil-minded rulers. The greatest dangers to liberty

lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, wellmeaning but without understanding." Id., at 479.

However well meant, the candidate drug test Georgia has
devised diminishes personal privacy for a symbol's sake.
The Fourth Amendment shields society against that state
action.

We note, finally, matters this opinion does not treat.Georgia's singular drug test for candidates is not part of a

medical examination designed to provide certification of acandidate's general health, and we express no opinion on
such examinations. Nor do we touch on financial disclosurerequirements, which implicate different concerns and procedures. See, e. g., Barry v. City of New York, 712 F. 2d 1554(CA2 1983) (upholding city's financial disclosure law for
elected and appointed officials, candidates for city office, andcertain city employees); Plante v. Gonzalez, 575 F. 2d 1119
(CA5 1978) (upholding Florida's financial disclosure require-ments for certain public officers, candidates, and employees).
And we do not speak to drug testing in the private sector, adomain unguarded by Fourth Amendment constraints. See
United States v. Jacobsen, 466 U. S. 109, 113 (1984).We reiterate, too, that where the risk to public safety is
substantial and real, blanket suspicionless searches cali-brated to the risk may rank as "reasonable"--for example,
searches now routine at airports and at entrances to courtsand other official buildings. See

Von Raab, 489 U. S., at674-676, and n. 3. But where, as in this case, public safety

is not genuinely in jeopardy, the Fourth Amendment pre-cludes the suspicionless search, no matter how conveniently
arranged. * * *

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit is

Reversed.
Chief Justice Rehnquist, dissenting.
I fear that the novelty of this Georgia law has led theCourt to distort Fourth Amendment doctrine in order to

strike it down. The Court notes, impliedly turning up itsnose, that "Georgia was the first, and apparently remains the
only, State to condition candidacy for state office on a drug

test." Ante, at 309. But if we are to heed the oft-quotedwords of Justice Brandeis in his dissent in New State Ice Co.

v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 311 (1932)--"[i]t is one of thehappy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory;and try novel social and economic experiments without risk
to the rest of the country"--novelty itself is not a vice.These novel experiments, of course, must comply with the
United States Constitution; but their mere novelty shouldnot be a strike against them.

Few would doubt that the use of illegal drugs and abuseof legal drugs is one of the major problems of our society.
Cases before this Court involving drug use extend to numer-ous occupations--railway employees, Skinner v. Railway
Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U. S. 602 (1989), Border Patrolofficers, Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, 489 U. S. 656
(1989), high school students, Vernonia School Dist. 47J v.Acton, 515 U. S. 646 (1995), and machine operators, Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29 (1987). It would take abolder person than I to say that such widespread drug usage
could never extend to candidates for public office such asGovernor of Georgia. The Court says that "[n]othing in the
record hints that the hazards respondents broadly describeare real and not simply hypothetical for Georgia's polity."
Ante, at 319. But surely the State need not wait for a drugaddict, or one inclined to use drugs illegally, to run for or
actually become Governor before it installs a prophylacticmechanism. We held as much in Von Raab:

"First, petitioners argue that the program is unjustifiedbecause it is not based on a belief that testing will reveal
any drug use by covered employees. In pressing thisargument, petitioners point out that the Service's testing scheme was not implemented in response to any per-ceived drug problem among Customs employees . . . .

"Petitioners' first contention evinces an unduly nar-row view of the context in which the Service's testing

520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
program was implemented. Petitioners do not dispute,nor can there be doubt, that drug abuse is one of the

most serious problems confronting our society today.There is little reason to believe that American workplaces are immune from this pervasive social problem. . . ." 489 U. S., at 673-674.

The test under the Fourth Amendment, as these caseshave held, is whether the search required by the Georgia
statute is "reasonable." Today's opinion speaks of a "closelyguarded" class of permissible suspicionless searches which
must be justified by a "special need." But this term, as usedin

Skinner and Von Raab and on which the Court now relies,was used in a quite different sense than it is used by the

Court today. In Skinner and Von Raab it was used to de-scribe a basis for a search apart from the regular needs of
law enforcement, Skinner, supra, at 620; Von Raab, supra,at 669. The "special needs" inquiry as delineated there has
not required especially great "importan[ce]," ante, at 318, un-less one considers "the supervision of probationers," or the
"operation of a government office," Skinner, supra, at 620,to be especially "important." Under our precedents, if
there was a proper governmental purpose other than lawenforcement, there was a "special need," and the Fourth
Amendment then required the familiar balancing betweenthat interest and the individual's privacy interest.

Under normal Fourth Amendment analysis, the individu-al's expectation of privacy is an important factor in the equation. But here, the Court perversely relies on the fact thata candidate for office gives up so much privacy--"[c]andidates for public office . . . are subject to relentless scrutiny--by their peers, the public, and the press,"

ante, at 321--asa reason for sustaining a Fourth Amendment claim. The

Court says, in effect, that the kind of drug test for candidatesrequired by the Georgia law is unnecessary, because the
scrutiny to which they are already subjected by reason oftheir candidacy will enable people to detect any drug use on

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
their part. But this is a strange holding, indeed. Onemight just as easily say that the railroad employees in

Skinner, or the Customs officials in Von Raab, would be subjectedto the same sort of scrutiny from their fellow employees and

their supervisors. But the clear teaching of those cases is
that the government is not required to settle for that sort ofa vague and uncanalized scrutiny; if in fact preventing persons who use illegal drugs from concealing that fact fromthe public is a legitimate government interest, these cases
indicate that the government may require a drug test.The privacy concerns ordinarily implicated by urinalysis
drug testing are "negligible," Vernonia, supra, at 658, when
the procedures used in collecting and analyzing the urine
samples are set up "to reduce the intrusiveness" of the process, Skinner, supra, at 626. Under the Georgia law, the candidate may produce the test specimen at his own doctor's
office, which must be one of the least intrusive types of
urinalysis drug tests conceivable. But although the Court
concedes this, it nonetheless manages to count this factor
against the State, because with this kind of test the person
tested will have advance notice of its being given, and will
therefore be able to abstain from drug use during the necessary period of time. But one may be sure that if the test
were random--and therefore apt to ensnare more users--the
Court would then fault it for its intrusiveness. Cf. Von
Raab, 489 U. S., at 676, and n. 4.

In Von Raab, we described as "compelling" the Government interest "in ensuring that many of these covered employees do not use drugs even off duty, for such use creates
risks of bribery and blackmail against which the Government
is entitled to guard." Id., at 674 (emphasis added). The
risks of bribery and blackmail for high-level officials of state
government using illegal drugs would seem to be at least as
significant as those for off-duty Customs officials. Even
more important, however, is our treatment of the third class
of tested employees in Von Raab, those who "handle[d] `clas520US1 Unit: $U43 [09-10-99 17:24:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN

327Cite as: 520 U. S. 305 (1997)
Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
sified' materials." The Court relegates this discussion to afootnote,

ante, at 315, n. 3, and all but dismisses it. Although the lack of factual development of the record in Von
Raab prevented us from determining who "handle[d] `classified' material," we did consider the weight of the proffered
governmental interest:

"We readily agree that the Government has a compellinginterest in protecting truly sensitive information from

those who, `under compulsion of circumstances or forother reasons, . . . might compromise [such] information.'
Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U. S. 518, 528 (1988).
. . . We also agree that employees who seek promotionsto positions where they would handle sensitive information can be required to submit to a urine test under theService's screening program, especially if the positions
covered under this category require background investi-gations, medical examinations, or other intrusions that
may be expected to diminish their expectations of privacy in respect of a urinalysis test." 489 U. S., at 677.

Although petitioners might raise questions as to some ofthe other positions covered by the Georgia statute, there is

no question that, at least for positions like Governor andLieutenant Governor, identical concerns are implicated. In
short, when measured through the correct lens of our precedents in this area, the Georgia urinalysis test is a "reason-able" search; it is only by distorting these precedents that

the Court is able to reach the result it does.Lest readers expect the holding of this case to be extended
to any other case, the Court notes that the drug test here
is not a part of a medical examination designed to provide
certification of a candidate's general health. Ante, at 323.
It is all but inconceivable that a case involving that sort of
requirement could be decided differently than the present
case; the same sort of urinalysis would be involved. The
only possible basis for distinction is to say that the State has

Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting
a far greater interest in the candidate's "general health" thanit does with respect to his propensity to use illegal drugs.

But this is the sort of policy judgment that surely must beleft to legislatures, rather than being announced from on
high by the Federal Judiciary.Nothing in the Fourth Amendment or in any other part of
the Constitution prevents a State from enacting a statutewhose principal vice is that it may seem misguided or even
silly to the Members of this Court. I would affirm the judg-ment of the Court of Appeals.

Syllabus

BLESSING, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OFECONOMIC SECURITY

v. FREESTONE et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-1441. Argued January 6, 1997--Decided April 21, 1997
Respondents, five Arizona mothers whose children are eligible for state

child support services under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, filed
this 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 suit against petitioner, the director of the state
child support agency, claiming, among other things, that they properly
applied for child support services; that, despite their good faith efforts to
cooperate, the agency never took adequate steps to obtain child support
payments for them; that these omissions were largely attributable to
staff shortages and other structural defects in the State's program; and
that these systemic failures violated their individual rights under Title
IV-D to have all mandated services delivered in substantial compliance
with the title and its implementing regulations. They requested broad
relief, including a declaratory judgment that the Arizona program's operation violates Title IV-D provisions creating rights in them that are
enforceable through a $ 1983 action, and an injunction requiring the director to achieve substantial compliance with Title IV-D throughout all
programmatic operations. The District Court granted summary judgment for petitioner, but the Ninth Circuit reversed. Without distinguishing among the numerous provisions of the complex Title IV-D
program or the many rights those provisions might have created, the
latter court held that respondents had an enforceable individual right to
have the State achieve "substantial compliance" with Title IV-D. It
also disagreed with the District Court's conclusion that Congress had
foreclosed private Title IV-D enforcement actions by authorizing the
Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) to audit and cut
off funds to States whose programs do not substantially comply with
Title IV-D's requirements.

Held: Title IV-D does not give individuals a federal right to force a state

agency to substantially comply with Title IV-D. Pp. 340-349.

(a) A plaintiff seeking $ 1983 redress must assert the violation of a
federal right, not merely of federal law. Golden State Transit Corp. v.
Los Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 106. Three principal factors determine
whether a statutory provision creates a privately enforceable right: (1)
whether the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of the statute; (2)
whether the plaintiff's asserted interests are not so vague and amor520US2 Unit: $U44 [09-10-99 20:00:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
330 BLESSING v. FREESTONE

Syllabus
phous as to be beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce; and
(3) whether the statute imposes a binding obligation on the State. See,
e. g., Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498, 509. Even if a
plaintiff demonstrates such a right, however, there is only a rebuttable
presumption that it is enforceable under $ 1983. Dismissal is proper if
Congress specifically foreclosed a $ 1983 remedy, Smith v. Robinson, 468
U. S. 992, 1005, n. 9, 1003, either expressly, by forbidding recourse to

$ 1983 in the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating a comprehensive
enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual $ 1983 enforcement, Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S. 107, 133. Pp. 340-341.

(b) Respondents have not established that Title IV-D gives them individually enforceable federal rights. In prior cases, the Court has
been able to determine whether or not a statute created such rights
because the plaintiffs articulated, and lower courts evaluated, welldefined claims. See, e. g., Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and
Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418, 430. Here, respondents have not
identified with particularity the rights they claim, and the Ninth Circuit
has not engaged in the requisite methodical inquiry. That court erred
in apparently holding that individuals have an enforceable right to "substantial compliance" with Title IV-D in all respects. The statutory
"substantial compliance" requirement, see, e. g., 42 U. S. C. $ 609(a)(8)
(1994 ed., Supp. II), does not give rise to individual rights; it was not
intended to benefit individual children and custodial parents, but is simply a yardstick for the Secretary to measure the systemwide performance of a State's Title IV-D program, allowing her to increase the frequency of audits and reduce the State's federal grant upon a finding of
substantial noncompliance. The Court of Appeals also erred in taking
a blanket approach to determining whether Title IV-D creates rights:
It is readily apparent that many of the provisions of that multifaceted
statutory scheme, including its "substantial compliance" standard and
data processing, staffing, and organizational requirements, do not fit any
of the traditional criteria for identifying statutory rights. Although
this Court does not foreclose the possibility that some Title IV-D provisions give rise to individual rights, the Ninth Circuit did not separate
out the particular rights it believed arise from the statutory scheme, the
complaint is less than clear in this regard, and it is not certain whether
respondents sought any relief more specific than a declaration that their
"rights" were being violated and an injunction forcing petitioner to
"substantially comply" with all of Title IV-D's provisions. This defect
is best addressed by sending the case back for the District Court to
construe the complaint in the first instance, in order to determine exactly what rights, considered in their most concrete, specific form, respondents are asserting. Only by manageably breaking down the

determine whether any specific claim asserts an individual federal
right. Pp. 341-346.

(c) Petitioner's argument that Title IV-D's remedial scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate congressional intent to preclude

$ 1983 suits is rejected. Petitioner does not claim that any Title IV-D
provision expressly curtails $ 1983 actions, and she has failed to make
the difficult showing that allowing such actions to go forward in these
circumstances would be inconsistent with Congress' carefully tailored
scheme. That scheme is far more limited than those at issue in Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Assn., 453
U. S. 1, and Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, the only cases in which
the Court has found preclusion; in particular, Title IV-D contains no
private remedy--either judicial or administrative--through which aggrieved persons can seek redress. The only way that Title IV-D assures that States live up to their child support plans is through the
Secretary's oversight, but the Secretary's limited powers to audit and
cut federal funding are not comprehensive enough to foreclose $ 1983
liability. Pp. 346-348.

Opinion of the Court
under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming that they
had an enforceable individual right to have the State's program achieve "substantial compliance" with the requirements of Title IV-D. Without distinguishing among the numerous provisions of this complex program, the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that respondents had such
a right. We disagree that the statutory scheme can be analyzed so generally, and hold that Title IV-D does not give
individuals a federal right to force a state agency to substantially comply with Title IV-D. Accordingly, we vacate and
remand with instructions to remand to the District Court.

I
This controversy concerns an interlocking set of cooperative federal-state welfare programs. Arizona participates
in the federal Aid to Families with Dependent Children
(AFDC) program, which provides subsistence welfare benefits to needy families. Social Security Act, Title IV-A, 42
U. S. C. $$ 601-617. To qualify for federal AFDC funds, the
State must certify that it will operate a child support
enforcement program that conforms with the numerous
requirements set forth in Title IV-D of the Social Security
Act, 42 U. S. C. $$ 651-669b (1994 ed. and Supp. II),1 and will
do so pursuant to a detailed plan that has been approved
by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary).

$ 602(a)(2); see also $ 652(a)(3). The Federal Government
underwrites roughly two-thirds of the cost of the State's
child support efforts. $ 655(a). But the State must do more
than simply collect overdue support payments; it must also
establish a comprehensive system to establish paternity,

1 After the Court of Appeals rendered its decision, Congress amended
Title IV-D in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104-193, 110 Stat. 2105. Except where otherwise noted, we refer to the amended version of Title IV-D throughout
this opinion.

Opinion of the Court
locate absent parents, and help families obtain support orders. $$ 651, 654.

A State must provide these services free of charge to
AFDC recipients and, when requested, for a nominal fee to
children and custodial parents who are not receiving AFDC
payments. $$ 651, 654(4). AFDC recipients must assign
their child support rights to the State and fully cooperate
with the State's efforts to establish paternity and obtain support payments. Although the State may keep most of the
support payments that it collects on behalf of AFDC families
in order to offset the costs of providing welfare benefits, until
recently it only had to distribute the first $50 of each payment to the family. 42 U. S. C. $ 657(b)(1). The amended
version of Title IV-D replaces this $50 pass-through with
more generous distributions to families once they leave
welfare. 42 U. S. C. $ 657(a)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. II). NonAFDC recipients who request the State's aid are entitled
to have all collected funds passed through. $ 657(a)(3). In
all cases, the State must distribute the family's share of
collected support payments within two business days after
receipt. $ 654b(c)(1).

The structure of each State's Title IV-D agency, like
the services it provides, must conform to federal guidelines. For example, States must create separate units to administer the plan, $ 654(3), and to disburse collected funds,

$ 654(27), each of which must be staffed at levels set by the
Secretary, 45 CFR $ 303.20 (1995). If a State delegates its
disbursement function to local governments, it must reward
the most efficient local agencies with a share of federal
incentive payments. 42 U. S. C. $ 654(22). To maintain detailed records of all pending cases, as well as to generate
the various reports required by federal authorities, States
must set up computer systems that meet numerous federal specifications. $ 654a. Finally, in addition to setting up this administrative framework, each participating

Opinion of the Court
State must enact laws designed to streamline paternity andchild support actions. $$ 654(20), 666.

To oversee this complex federal-state enterprise, Congresscreated the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE)
within the Department of Health and Human Services(HHS). This agency is charged with auditing the States'
compliance with their federally approved plans. Auditsmust occur at least once every three years, or more often
if a State's performance falls below certain standards.$ 652(a)(4). If a State does not "substantially comply" with
the requirements of Title IV-D, the Secretary is authorizedto penalize the State by reducing its AFDC grant by up to
five percent. $ 609(a)(8). The Secretary has interpreted"substantial compliance" as: (a) full compliance with requirements that services be offered statewide and that certainrecipients be notified monthly of the support collected, as
well as with reporting, recordkeeping, and accounting rules;(b) 90 percent compliance with case opening and case closure
criteria; and (c) 75 percent compliance with most remainingprogram requirements. 45 CFR $ 305.20 (1995). The Secretary may suspend a penalty if the State implements anadequate corrective action plan, and if the program achieves
"substantial compliance," she may rescind the penalty en-tirely. 42 U. S. C. $ 609(c) (1994 ed., Supp. II).

II
Arizona's record of enforcing child support obligations isless than stellar, particularly compared with those of other

States. In a 1992 report, Arizona's Auditor General chroni-cled many of the State's problems. In the 1989-1990 fiscal
year, Arizona failed to collect enough child support paymentsand federal incentives to cover the administrative costs of its
Title IV-D program--1 of only 10 States to fall below thattarget. Arizona Auditor General, A Performance Audit of
the Arizona Department of Economic Security 2 (1992). TheAuditor General also pointed out that the cost effectiveness

336 BLESSING v. FREESTONE

Opinion of the Court
of Arizona's support enforcement efforts had been "mini-mal." For every dollar spent on enforcement, the State

collected barely two dollars--almost half the nationwideaverage. Ibid. In 1992, nearly three-quarters of Arizona's
275,000 child support cases were still in the earliest stagesof the enforcement process. In 42 percent of all cases, paternity had yet to be established. In a further 29 percent,the absent parent had been identified but his or her whereabouts were unknown. Id., at 12. Overall, the AuditorGeneral found that Arizona "obtains regular child support
payments for fewer than five percent of the parents itserves."

Id., at 9.Federal audits by OCSE have also identified shortcomings

in Arizona's child support system. In several reviews of theState's performance from 1984 to 1989, the Secretary found
that Arizona had not substantially complied with significantprogram requirements, and she repeatedly penalized the
State one percent of its AFDC grant. The State developeda corrective action plan after each failed audit, which
prompted the Secretary to suspend and--in every instancebut one--waive the one-percent reduction in Arizona's
AFDC funding.2

principally OCSE, Audit Division Report No. AZ-85-PR, Program Results Audit of the State of Arizona Child Support Enforcement Program,

to Linda Moore-Cannon, Director, Arizona Dept. of Economic Security

period between July 1, 1988, and December 31, 1988, due to the State's
failure to implement its Parent Locator Service in conformity with its
corrective action plan).

Opinion of the Court
Respondents are five Arizona mothers (some of whom re-ceive AFDC benefits) whose children are eligible for Title

IV-D child support services. They filed this lawsuit in theUnited States District Court for the District of Arizona
against the Director of the Arizona Department of EconomicSecurity, the state agency charged with providing child support services under Title IV-D. In a lengthy complaint, re-spondents claimed that they had properly applied for child
support services but that, despite their good faith efforts tocooperate, the agency never took adequate steps to obtain
child support payments from the fathers of their children.These omissions, respondents contended, were largely attributable to structural defects in the State's child support ef-forts: staff shortages, high caseloads, unmanageable backlogs, and deficiencies in the State's accounting methods andrecordkeeping. App. 11, 14-16. Respondents sought to
represent a class of all children and custodial parents resid-ing in Arizona who are or will be entitled to Title IV-D
services.Respondents claimed that the State's systemic failures violated their federal rights under Title IV-D. Invoking 42U. S. C. $ 1983, they asked the District Court to grant them
the following broad relief:

"Enter a declaratory judgment determining that opera-tion of the Arizona Title IV-D program violates controlling, substantive provisions of federal law creatingrights in plaintiffs and the class enforceable through an
action permitted by 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.
"Grant permanent (and as necessary and appropriate,
interlocutory) injunctions prohibiting continued adher-ence to the aforesaid pattern and practices and requiring

affirmative measures sufficient to achieve as well as sustain substantial compliance with federal law, throughoutall programmatic operations at issue." App. 42.

The Director immediately moved to dismiss the complaint
on several grounds, arguing primarily that Title IV-D cre520US2 Unit: $U44 [09-10-99 20:00:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
338 BLESSING v. FREESTONE

Opinion of the Court
ates no individual rights enforceable under $ 1983. The District Court treated this motion as one for summary judgment
and ruled in favor of the Director. Relying primarily on a
decision of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, Carelli
v. Howser, 923 F. 2d 1208 (1991), the District Court held that
Congress had foreclosed private actions to enforce Title
IV-D by authorizing the Secretary to audit and cut off funds
to States with programs that do not substantially comply
with Title IV-D's requirements.

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 68 F. 3d 1141 (1995). The majority identified
the three principal factors this Court has used to determine
whether a statute creates a privately enforceable right:
whether the plaintiff is one of the "intended beneficiaries of
the statute," whether the plaintiffs' asserted interests are
not so " `vague and amorphous' as to be `beyond the competence of the judiciary to enforce,' " and whether the statute
imposes a binding obligation on the State. Id., at 1147
(quoting Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Assn., 496 U. S. 498,
509 (1990)). Title IV-D, the Court of Appeals held, satisfied
each of these criteria. First, "needy families with children"
were the intended beneficiaries of Title IV-D. 68 F. 3d,
at 1150. Second, the majority held that the "plaintiffs'
asserted interest is not vague or amorphous, and it is
sufficiently concrete to be judicially enforceable" because
whether a State delivers the services required by Title IV-D
"to the degree required by law is judicially ascertainable."
Id., at 1149-1150. Finally, the Court of Appeals stated that
the statute imposes binding obligations because a State must
satisfy each of the requirements spelled out in Title IV-D
in order to receive AFDC funding. Although the majority
acknowledged that the requirement that a State remain in
"substantial compliance" with its plan might seem ambiguous
when divorced from context, the majority believed that the
"highly detailed requirements" of the statute and its imple520US2 Unit: $U44 [09-10-99 20:00:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

339Cite as: 520 U. S. 329 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
menting regulations adequately notified the State of the extent of its duties. Id., at 1148. Moreover, the Court of Appeals noted that "the statute . . . sets forth detailed criteria
for measuring compliance with the statute," for example,
generally requiring States to establish paternity in a given
percentage of all cases. Id., at 1149 (citing 42 U. S. C.

$ 652(g)). Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that
respondents could sue petitioner under $ 1983 to bring Arizona's child support enforcement program into substantial
compliance with federal law. 68 F. 3d, at 1150.

The Court of Appeals also disagreed with the District
Court's conclusion that Congress had implicitly foreclosed an
individual remedy under $ 1983 for violations of Title IV-D.
The majority noted that Title IV-D includes no provisions
for judicial enforcement that might supplant the $ 1983 remedy. Id., at 1153. Instead, the law simply gave the Secretary administrative oversight powers that were virtually indiscernible from those we had found insufficient to displace

$ 1983 liability in Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and
Housing Authority, 479 U. S. 418 (1987). The majority
expressed no opinion as to the appropriateness of either injunctive or declaratory relief, and left that question for the
District Court to answer in the first instance. 68 F. 3d, at
1156.

Judge Kleinfeld dissented, arguing that Congress placed
the power to enforce Title IV-D exclusively in the hands of
the Secretary. He contended that the " `substantial compliance' standard does not `unambiguously confer' enforceable
rights on any individual." Id., at 1157. At most, Title
IV-D called upon States "to try pretty hard, and do a pretty
good job, of enforcing child support, and come up with a plan
to try harder if the Secretary thinks they have not been trying hard enough." Ibid.

We granted certiorari to resolve disagreement among the
Courts of Appeals as to whether individuals may sue state

officials under $ 1983 for violations of Title IV-D.3 517 U. S.1186 (1996).

Section 1983 imposes liability on anyone who, under colorof state law, deprives a person "of any rights, privileges, or

immunities secured by the Constitution and laws." We haveheld that this provision safeguards certain rights conferred
by federal statutes. Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980).In order to seek redress through $ 1983, however, a plaintiff
must assert the violation of a federal right, not merely aviolation of federal law. Golden State Transit Corp. v. Los
Angeles, 493 U. S. 103, 106 (1989). We have traditionallylooked at three factors when determining whether a particular statutory provision gives rise to a federal right. First,Congress must have intended that the provision in question
benefit the plaintiff. Wright, 479 U. S., at 430. Second, theplaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so "vague and amorphous" that

3 Compare Wehunt v. Ledbetter, 875 F. 2d 1558 (CA11 1989) (holding that
Title IV-D was not enacted for the especial benefit of AFDC families, and
so it does not create enforceable rights under $ 1983), cert. denied, 494
U. S. 1027 (1990), with Carelli v. Howser, 923 F. 2d 1208 (CA6 1991) (holding that Title IV-D creates rights that are enforceable under $ 1983, but
that the Secretary's oversight power forecloses a $ 1983 remedy), with Albiston v. Maine Comm'r of Human Servs., 7 F. 3d 258 (CA1 1993) (holding
that AFDC recipients have an enforceable right to prompt disbursement
of their child support payments under Title IV-D), and with Howe v.
Ellenbecker, 8 F. 3d 1258 (CA8 1993) (holding that Title IV-D creates
rights that are enforceable under $ 1983), cert. denied, 511 U. S. 1005
(1994).

Petitioner makes two further arguments in her briefs on the merits.
She first contends that the Eleventh Amendment strips federal courts of
jurisdiction over a $ 1983 cause of action against state officials to enforce
Title IV-D. Next, she asks us to overrule Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S.
1 (1980), where we held that $ 1983 provides a remedy for violations of
federal statutes. We decline to address these questions which were neither raised nor decided below, and were not presented in the petition for
certiorari. This Court's Rule 14.1(a).

520US2 Unit: $U44 [09-10-99 20:00:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

341Cite as: 520 U. S. 329 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
its enforcement would strain judicial competence. Id., at
431-432. Third, the statute must unambiguously impose a
binding obligation on the States. In other words, the provision giving rise to the asserted right must be couched in
mandatory, rather than precatory, terms. Wilder, supra, at
510-511; see also Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.
Halderman, 451 U. S. 1, 17 (1981) (discussing whether Congress created obligations giving rise to an implied cause of
action).

Even if a plaintiff demonstrates that a federal statute creates an individual right, there is only a rebuttable presumption that the right is enforceable under $ 1983. Because our
inquiry focuses on congressional intent, dismissal is proper
if Congress "specifically foreclosed a remedy under $ 1983."
Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992, 1005, n. 9 (1984). Congress may do so expressly, by forbidding recourse to $ 1983 in
the statute itself, or impliedly, by creating a comprehensive
enforcement scheme that is incompatible with individual enforcement under $ 1983. Livadas v. Bradshaw, 512 U. S.
107, 133 (1994).

A

With these principles in mind, we turn first to the question
whether respondents have established that Title IV-D gives
them federal rights.

In their complaint, respondents argued that federal law
granted them "individual rights to all mandated services delivered in substantial compliance with Title IV-D and its implementing regulations." App. 41. They sought a broad injunction requiring the Director of Arizona's child support
agency to achieve "substantial compliance . . . throughout
all programmatic operations." Id., at 42. Attributing the
deficiencies in the State's program primarily to staff shortages and other structural defects, respondents essentially invited the District Court to oversee every aspect of Arizona's
Title IV-D program.

520US2 Unit: $U44 [09-10-99 20:00:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
342 BLESSING v. FREESTONE

Opinion of the Court
Without distinguishing among the numerous rights thatmight have been created by this federally funded welfare

program, the Court of Appeals agreed in sweeping termsthat "Title IV-D creates enforceable rights in families in
need of Title IV-D services." 68 F. 3d, at 1150. The Court
of Appeals did not specify exactly which "rights" it was pur-porting to recognize, but it apparently believed that federal

law gave respondents the right to have the State substan-tially comply with Title IV-D in all respects. We disagree.

As an initial matter, the lower court's holding that TitleIV-D "creates enforceable rights" paints with too broad a
brush. It was incumbent upon respondents to identify with
particularity the rights they claimed, since it is impossible to
determine whether Title IV-D, as an undifferentiated whole,
gives rise to undefined "rights." Only when the complaint
is broken down into manageable analytic bites can a court
ascertain whether each separate claim satisfies the various
criteria we have set forth for determining whether a federal
statute creates rights. See, e. g., Golden State, supra, at 106
(asking whether the "provision in question" was designed to
benefit the plaintiff).

In prior cases, we have been able to determine whether
or not a statute created a given right because the plaintiffs
articulated, and lower courts evaluated, well-defined claims.
In Wright, for example, we held that tenants of public housing projects had a right to have their utility costs included
within a rental payment that did not exceed 30 percent of
their income. We did not ask whether the federal housing
legislation generally gave rise to rights; rather, we focused
our analysis on a specific statutory provision limiting "rent"
to 30 percent of a tenant's income. 479 U. S., at 430. Similarly, in Wilder, we held that health care providers had an
enforceable right to reimbursement at "reasonable and adequate rates" as required by a particular provision in the
Medicaid statute. 496 U. S., at 511-512. And in Suter v.
Artist M., 503 U. S. 347 (1992), where we held that Title

520US2 Unit: $U44 [09-10-99 20:00:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN

343Cite as: 520 U. S. 329 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
IV-E of the Social Security Act did not give the plaintiffsthe right that they asserted, we again analyzed the claim in

very specific terms: whether children had a right to havestate authorities undertake "reasonable efforts to prevent
removal of children from their homes and to facilitate reunification of families where removal had occurred." Id., at 352(footnote omitted). Finally, in

Livadas, supra, at 134, we
discerned in the structure of the National Labor RelationsAct (NLRA) the very specific right of employees "to complete the collective-bargaining process and agree to an arbi-tration clause." See 512 U. S., at 133, n. 27 (explaining that
whether a claim founded on the NLRA is cognizable under

$ 1983 may depend on whether the claim stems from abridgment of a "protected individual interest"). We did not simply ask whether the NLRA created unspecified "rights."

The Court of Appeals did not engage in such a methodical
inquiry. As best we can tell, the Court of Appeals seemed
to think that respondents had a right to require the Director
of Arizona's child support agency to bring the State's program into substantial compliance with Title IV-D. But the
requirement that a State operate its child support program
in "substantial compliance" with Title IV-D was not intended to benefit individual children and custodial parents,
and therefore it does not constitute a federal right. Far
from creating an individual entitlement to services, the
standard is simply a yardstick for the Secretary to measure
the systemwide performance of a State's Title IV-D program. Thus, the Secretary must look to the aggregate services provided by the State, not to whether the needs of any
particular person have been satisfied. A State substantially
complies with Title IV-D when it provides most mandated
services (such as enforcement of support obligations) in only
75 percent of the cases reviewed during the federal audit
period. 45 CFR $ 305.20(a)(3)(iii) (1995). States must aim
to establish paternity in 90 percent of all eligible cases, but
may satisfy considerably lower targets so long as their

It isclear, then, that even when a State is in "substantial compliance" with Title IV-D, any individual plaintiff might still beamong the 10 or 25 percent of persons whose needs ultimately go unmet. Moreover, even upon a finding of substantial noncompliance, the Secretary can merely reduce theState's AFDC grant by up to five percent; she cannot, by

force of her own authority, command the State to take anyparticular action or to provide any services to certain individuals. In short, the substantial compliance standard is de-signed simply to trigger penalty provisions that increase the
frequency of audits and reduce the State's AFDC grant by a
maximum of five percent. As such, it does not give rise to
individual rights.

The Court of Appeals erred not only in finding that individuals have an enforceable right to substantial compliance,
but also in taking a blanket approach to determining
whether Title IV-D creates rights. It is readily apparent
that many other provisions of that multifaceted statutory
scheme do not fit our traditional three criteria for identifying
statutory rights. To begin with, many provisions, like the
"substantial compliance" standard, are designed only to
guide the State in structuring its systemwide efforts at enforcing support obligations. These provisions may ultimately benefit individuals who are eligible for Title IV-D
services, but only indirectly. For example, Title IV-D lays
out detailed requirements for the State's data processing
system. Among other things, this system must sort information into standardized data elements specified by the Secretary; transmit information electronically to the State's
AFDC system to monitor family eligibility for financial assistance; maintain the data necessary to meet federal reporting requirements; and provide for the electronic transfer of
funds for purposes of income withholding and interstate collections. 42 U. S. C. $ 654a (1994 ed., Supp. II); 45 CFR

$ 307.10 (1995). Obviously, these complex standards do not

Opinion of the Court
give rise to individualized rights to computer services.They are simply intended to improve the overall efficiency

of the States' child support enforcement scheme.The same reasoning applies to the staffing levels of the
state agency, which respondents seem to claim are inadequate. App. 11 (Complaint || 39) (alleging that delays in caseprocessing are attributable to "extraordinary staff shortages, inordinately high caseloads and unmanageable back-logs"). Title IV-D generally requires each participating
State to establish a separate child support enforcement unit"which meets such staffing and organizational requirements
as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe." 42 U. S. C.

$ 654(3). The regulations, in turn, simply provide that each
level of the State's organization must have "sufficient staff "
to fulfill specified functions. These mandates do not, however, give rise to federal rights. For one thing, the link between increased staffing and the services provided to any
particular individual is far too tenuous to support the notion
that Congress meant to give each and every Arizonan who
is eligible for Title IV-D the right to have the State Department of Economic Security staffed at a "sufficient" level.
Furthermore, neither the statute nor the regulation gives
any guidance as to how large a staff would be "sufficient."
Cf. Suter, 503 U. S., at 360 (finding requirement of "reasonable efforts" unenforceable where there was "[n]o further
statutory guidance . . . as to how `reasonable efforts' are to
be measured"). Enforcement of such an undefined standard
would certainly "strain judicial competence." Livadas, 512
U. S., at 132.

We do not foreclose the possibility that some provisions of
Title IV-D give rise to individual rights. The lower court
did not separate out the particular rights it believed arise
from the statutory scheme, and we think the complaint is less
than clear in this regard. For example, respondent Madrid
alleged that the state agency managed to collect some support payments from her ex-husband but failed to pass

Opinion of the Court
through the first $50 of each payment, to which she was pur-portedly entitled under the pre-1996 version of $ 657(b)(1).

App. 13 (Complaint || 48). Although $ 657 may give her afederal right to receive a specified portion of the money collected on her behalf by Arizona, she did not explicitly re-quest such relief in the complaint.

In any event, it is not at all apparent that respondentssought any relief more specific than a declaration that their
"rights" were being violated and an injunction forcing Arizo-na's child support agency to "substantially comply" with all
of the provisions of Title IV-D. We think that this defectis best addressed by sending the case back for the District
Court to construe the complaint in the first instance, in orderto determine exactly what rights, considered in their most
concrete, specific form, respondents are asserting. Only bymanageably breaking down the complaint into specific allegations can the District Court proceed to determine whetherany specific claim asserts an individual federal right.

B
Because we leave open the possibility that Title IV-D maygive rise to some individually enforceable rights, we pause

to consider petitioner's final argument that no remand iswarranted because the statute contains "a remedial scheme
that is `sufficiently comprehensive . . . to demonstrate con-gressional intent to preclude the remedy of suits under

$ 1983.' " Wilder, 496 U. S., at 521 (quoting Middlesex
County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea ClammersAssn., 453 U. S. 1, 20 (1981)). Because petitioner does not

claim that any provision of Title IV-D expressly curtails$ 1983 actions, she must make the difficult showing that
allowing $ 1983 actions to go forward in these circumstances
"would be inconsistent with Congress' carefully tailoredscheme."

Opinion of the Court
Only twice have we found a remedial scheme sufficiently
comprehensive to supplant $ 1983: in Sea Clammers, supra,
and Smith v. Robinson, 468 U. S. 992 (1984). In Sea Clammers, we focused on the "unusually elaborate enforcement
provisions" of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,
which placed at the disposal of the Environmental Protection
Agency a panoply of enforcement options, including noncompliance orders, civil suits, and criminal penalties. 453 U. S.,
at 13. We emphasized that several provisions of the Act authorized private persons to initiate enforcement actions.
Id., at 14, 20. We found it "hard to believe that Congress
intended to preserve the $ 1983 right of action when it created so many specific statutory remedies, including the two
citizen-suit provisions." Id., at 20. Likewise, in Smith, the
review scheme in the Education of the Handicapped Act permitted aggrieved individuals to invoke "carefully tailored"
local administrative procedures followed by federal judicial
review. 468 U. S., at 1009. We reasoned that Congress
could not possibly have wanted parents to skip these procedures and go straight to court by way of $ 1983, since
that would have "render[ed] superfluous most of the detailed
procedural protections outlined in the statute." Id., at
1011.

We have also stressed that a plaintiff 's ability to invoke

$ 1983 cannot be defeated simply by "[t]he availability of administrative mechanisms to protect the plaintiff 's interests."
Golden State, supra, at 106. Thus, in Wright, we rejected
the argument that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development's "generalized powers" to audit local public housing authorities, to enforce annual contributions contracts,
and to cut off federal funding demonstrated a congressional
intention to prevent public housing tenants from using $ 1983
to enforce their rights under the federal Housing Act. 479
U. S., at 428. We reached much the same conclusion in
Wilder, where the Secretary of Health and Human Services

520US2 Unit: $U44 [09-10-99 20:00:43] PAGES PGT: OPIN
348 BLESSING v. FREESTONE

Opinion of the Court
had power to reject state Medicaid plans or to withhold fed-eral funding to States whose plans did not comply with federal law. 496 U. S., at 521. Even though in both cases theseoversight powers were accompanied by limited state grievance procedures for individuals, we found that $ 1983 was
still available. Wright, supra, at 427-428; Wilder, supra,at 523.

The enforcement scheme that Congress created in TitleIV-D is far more limited than those in

Sea Clammers and
Smith. Unlike the federal programs at issue in those cases,Title IV-D contains no private remedy--either judicial or

administrative--through which aggrieved persons can seek
redress. The only way that Title IV-D assures that States
live up to their child support plans is through the Secretary's
oversight. The Secretary can audit only for "substantial
compliance" on a programmatic basis. Furthermore, up to
25 percent of eligible children and custodial parents can go
without most of the services enumerated in Title IV-D before the Secretary can trim a State's AFDC grant. These
limited powers to audit and cut federal funding closely resemble those powers at issue in Wilder and Wright. Although counsel for the Secretary suggested at oral argument
that the Secretary "has the same right under a contract as
any other party to seek specific performance," Tr. of Oral
Arg. 49, this possibility was not developed in the briefs.
Even assuming the Secretary's authority to sue for specific
performance, Title IV-D's administrative enforcement arsenal would not compare to those in Sea Clammers and Smith,
especially if, as the Government further contended, see Tr.
of Oral Arg. 49-50, no private actor would have standing to
force the Secretary to bring suit for specific performance.
To the extent that Title IV-D may give rise to individual
rights, therefore, we agree with the Court of Appeals that
the Secretary's oversight powers are not comprehensive
enough to close the door on $ 1983 liability. 68 F. 3d, at
1151-1156.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and thecase is remanded with instructions to remand to the District

Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy joins,concurring.

I agree with the Court that under the test set forth inWright v. Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority,
479 U. S. 418, 423 (1987), and Wilder v. Virginia HospitalAssn., 496 U. S. 498, 509 (1990), 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 does not
permit individual beneficiaries of Title IV-D of the SocialSecurity Act, as added, 88 Stat. 2351, and as amended, 42
U. S. C. $$ 651-669b (1994 ed., Supp. II), to bring suit chal-lenging a State's failure to achieve "substantial compliance"
with the requirements of Title IV-D. That conclusionmakes it unnecessary to reach the question whether $ 1983
ever authorizes the beneficiaries of a federal-state fundingand spending agreement--such as Title IV-D--to bring suit.

As we explained in Pennhurst State School and Hospitalv.

Halderman, 451 U. S. 1 (1981), such an agreement is "inthe nature of a contract,"

id., at 17: The State promises toprovide certain services to private individuals, in exchange

for which the Federal Government promises to give theState funds. In contract law, when such an arrangement is
made (A promises to pay B money, in exchange for which Bpromises to provide services to C), the person who receives
the benefit of the exchange of promises between the two oth-ers (C) is called a third-party beneficiary. Until relatively
recent times, the third-party beneficiary was generally re-garded as a stranger to the contract, and could not sue upon
it; that is to say, if, in the example given above, B broke hispromise and did not provide services to C, the only person
who could enforce the promise in court was the other party

to the contract, A. See 1 W. Story, A Treatise on the Lawof Contracts 549-550 (4th ed. 1856). This appears to have

been the law at the time $ 1983 was enacted. See Brief forCouncil of State Governments et al. as Amici Curiae 10-11,
and n. 6 (citing sources). If so, the ability of persons in re-spondents' situation to compel a State to make good on its
promise to the Federal Government was not a "righ[t] . . .secured by the . . . laws" under $ 1983. While it is of course
true that newly enacted laws are automatically embracedwithin $ 1983, it does not follow that the question of what
rights those new laws (or, for that matter, old laws) secureis to be determined according to modern notions rather than
according to the understanding of $ 1983 when it was en-acted. Allowing third-party beneficiaries of commitments
to the Federal Government to sue is certainly a vastexpansion.

It must be acknowledged that Wright and Wilder permit-ted beneficiaries of federal-state contracts to sue under

$ 1983, but the argument set forth above was not raised. Iam not prepared without further consideration to reject the
possibility that third-party-beneficiary suits simply do notlie. I join the Court's opinion because, in ruling against respondents under the Wright/Wilder test, it leaves that possi-bility open.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 95-1608. Argued December 4, 1996--Decided April 28, 1997
Most States ban multiple-party, or "fusion," candidacies for elected office.

Minnesota's laws prohibit an individual from appearing on the ballot as
the candidate of more than one party. When respondent, a chapter of
the national New Party, chose as its candidate for state representative
an individual who was already the candidate of another political party,
local election officials refused to accept the New Party's nominating

petition. The party filed suit against petitioners, Minnesota election
officials, contending that the State's antifusion laws violated its associational rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, but the Court of
Appeals reversed, finding that the fusion ban was unconstitutional because it severely burdened the party's associational rights and was not
narrowly tailored to advance Minnesota's valid interests in avoiding
intraparty discord and party splintering, maintaining a stable political
system, and avoiding voter confusion.

Held: Minnesota's fusion ban does not violate the First and Fourteenth

Amendments. Pp. 356-370.

(a) While the First Amendment protects the right of citizens to associate and to form political parties for the advancement of common political goals and ideas, Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v.
Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604, 616, States may enact reasonable regulations of parties, elections, and ballots to reduce election- and
campaign-related disorder, Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433.
When deciding whether a state election law violates First and Fourteenth Amendment associational rights, this Court must weigh the character and magnitude of the burden the State's rule imposes on those
rights against the interests the State contends justify that burden, and
consider the extent to which the State's concerns make the burden
necessary. Id., at 434. Regulations imposing severe burdens must be
narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest. Lesser
burdens, however, trigger less exacting review, and a State's important
regulatory interests will usually be enough to justify reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions. Ibid. No bright line separates permis520US2 Unit: $U45 [09-17-99 06:55:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements
on First Amendment freedoms. Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730.
Pp. 356-359.

(b) Minnesota's fusion ban does not severely burden the New Party's
associational rights. The State's laws do not restrict the ability of the
party and its members to endorse, support, or vote for anyone they like
or directly limit the party's access to the ballot. The party's preferred
candidate will still appear on the ballot, although as another party's
candidate. The laws are also silent on parties' internal structure, governance, and policymaking. Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, and Tashjian v. Republican Party of
Conn., 479 U. S. 208, distinguished. Instead, these provisions reduce
the universe of potential candidates who may appear on the ballot as
the party's nominee and limit, slightly, the party's ability to send a particularized message, to its candidate and to the voters, about the nature
of its support for the candidate. However, ballots are designed primarily to elect candidates, not to serve as forums for political expression.
See Burdick, supra, at 438. Pp. 359-363.

(c) Because Minnesota's fusion ban does not impose a severe burden
on the New Party's rights, the State is required to show, not that the
ban was narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests, but that
the State's asserted regulatory interests are "sufficiently weighty to justify the limitation" on the party's rights. Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S.
279, 288-289. Elaborate, empirical verification of weightiness is not required. See Munro v. Socialist Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 195-196.
Here, the burden is justified by "correspondingly weighty" valid state
interests in ballot integrity and political stability. States certainly
have an interest in protecting the integrity, fairness, and efficiency of
their ballots and election processes as means for electing public officials.
E. g., Bullock v. Carter, 405 U. S. 134, 145. Minnesota fears that a
candidate or party could easily exploit fusion as a way of associating
his or its name with popular slogans and catchphrases, transforming the
ballot from a means of choosing candidates to a billboard for political advertising. It is also concerned that fusion might enable minor parties, by nominating a major party's candidate, to bootstrap their way to
major-party status in the next election and circumvent the State's
nominating-petition requirement for minor parties, which is designed to
ensure that only bona fide minor and third parties are granted access to
the ballot. The State's strong interest in the stability of its political
systems, see, e. g., Eu, supra, at 226, does not permit it to completely

insulate the two-party system from minor parties' or independent candidates' competition and influence, e. g., Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S.
780, 802, and is not a paternalistic license for States to protect political

Opinion of the Court
parties from the consequences of their own internal disagreements, e. g.,
Eu, supra, at 227. However, it does permit the State to enact reasonable election regulations that may, in practice, favor the traditional twoparty system. Minnesota's fusion ban is far less burdensome than a
California law, upheld in Storer, 415 U. S., at 728, that denied ballot
positions to any independent candidate affiliated with a party at any
time during the year preceding the primary election, and it is justified
by similarly weighty state interests. The Court expresses no view on
the party's policy-based arguments concerning the wisdom of fusion.

Respondent is a chartered chapter of the national New

April 1994, Minnesota State Representative Andy Dawkins
was running unopposed in the Minnesota DemocraticFarmer-Labor Party's (DFL) primary.2 That same month,

the same office in the November 1994 general election. Neither Dawkins nor the DFL objected, and Dawkins signed
the required affidavit of candidacy for the New Party.
Minn. Stat. $ 204B.06 (1994). Minnesota, however, prohibits
fusion candidacies.3 Because Dawkins had already filed as
a candidate for the DFL's nomination, local election officials
refused to accept the New Party's nominating petition.4

nomination by more than one political party of the same candidate for the

Opinion of the Court
The New Party filed suit in United States District Court,contending that Minnesota's antifusion laws violated the party's associational rights under the First and FourteenthAmendments. The District Court granted summary judgment for the state defendants, concluding that Minnesota'sfusion ban was "a valid and non-discriminatory regulation of
the election process," and noting that "issues concerning themechanics of choosing candidates . . . are, in large part,
matters of policy best left to the deliberative bodies them-selves."

Twin Cities Area New Party v. McKenna, 863F. Supp. 988, 994 (D. Minn. 1994).

The Court of Appeals reversed. Twin Cities Area New
Party v. McKenna, 73 F. 3d 196, 198 (CA8 1996). First, thecourt determined that Minnesota's fusion ban "unquestionably" and "severe[ly]" burdened the New Party's "freedomto select a standard bearer who best represents the party's
ideologies and preferences" and its right to "broaden thebase of public participation in and support for [its] activities." Ibid. (citations and internal quotation marks omit-ted). The court then decided that Minnesota's absolute ban
on multiple-party nominations was "broader than necessaryto serve the State's asserted interests" in avoiding intraparty discord and party splintering, maintaining a stable po-litical system, and avoiding voter confusion, and that the
State's remaining concerns about multiple-party nominationwere "simply unjustified in this case."

Id., at 199-200. Thecourt noted, however, that the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had upheld Wisconsin's similar fusion ban in
Swamp v. Kennedy, 950 F. 2d 383, 386 (1991) (fusion ban didnot burden associational rights and, even if it did, the State's

interests justified the burden), cert. denied, 505 U. S. 1204(1992). Nonetheless, the court concluded that Minnesota's
fusion-ban provisions, Minn. Stat. $$ 204B.06, subd. 1(b), and
number of voters in the preceding state or county general election, whichever is less. $$ 204B.03, 204B.07-204B.08.

356 TIMMONS v. TWIN CITIES AREA NEW PARTY

Opinion of the Court
204B.04, subd. 2 (1994), were unconstitutional because they
severely burdened the New Party's associational rights and
were not narrowly tailored to advance Minnesota's valid interests. We granted certiorari, 517 U. S. 1219 (1996), and
now reverse.

Fusion was a regular feature of Gilded Age American
politics. Particularly in the West and Midwest, candidates
of issue-oriented parties like the Grangers, Independents,
Greenbackers, and Populists often succeeded through fusion
with the Democrats, and vice versa. Republicans, for their
part, sometimes arranged fusion candidacies in the South,
as part of a general strategy of encouraging and exploiting
divisions within the dominant Democratic Party. See generally Argersinger, "A Place on the Ballot": Fusion Politics
and Antifusion Laws, 85 Am. Hist. Rev. 287, 288-290 (1980).

Fusion was common in part because political parties,
rather than local or state governments, printed and distributed their own ballots. These ballots contained only the
names of a particular party's candidates, and so a voter could
drop his party's ticket in the ballot box without even knowing that his party's candidates were supported by other parties as well. But after the 1888 presidential election, which
was widely regarded as having been plagued by fraud, many
States moved to the "Australian ballot system." Under that
system, an official ballot, containing the names of all the candidates legally nominated by all the parties, was printed at
public expense and distributed by public officials at polling
places. Id., at 290-292; Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428,
446-447 (1992) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (States' move to
the Australian ballot system was a "progressive reform to
reduce fraudulent election practices"). By 1896, use of the
Australian ballot was widespread. During the same period,
many States enacted other election-related reforms, including bans on fusion candidacies. See Argersinger, supra, at

Opinion of the Court
288, 295-298. Minnesota banned fusion in 1901.5 This
trend has continued and, in this century, fusion has become
the exception, not the rule. Today, multiple-party candidacies are permitted in just a few States,6 and fusion plays
a significant role only in New York.7

358 TIMMONS v. TWIN CITIES AREA NEW PARTY

Opinion of the Court
U. S. 208, 214 (1986). As a result, political parties' govern-ment, structure, and activities enjoy constitutional protection. Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic Central
Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 230 (1989) (noting political party's "discretion in how to organize itself, conduct its affairs, and select its leaders"); Tashjian, supra, at 224 (Constitution pro-tects a party's "determination . . . of the structure which best

allows it to pursue its political goals").On the other hand, it is also clear that States may, and
inevitably must, enact reasonable regulations of parties,elections, and ballots to reduce election- and campaignrelated disorder. Burdick, supra, at 433 (" `[A]s a practical
matter, there must be a substantial regulation of elections if
they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order,
rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic process' ")
(quoting Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724, 730 (1974)); Tashjian, supra, at 217 (The Constitution grants States "broad
power to prescribe the `Time, Places and Manner of holding
Elections for Senators and Representatives,' Art. I, $ 4, cl. 1,
which power is matched by state control over the election
process for state offices").

When deciding whether a state election law violates First
and Fourteenth Amendment associational rights, we weigh
the " `character and magnitude' " of the burden the State's
rule imposes on those rights against the interests the State
contends justify that burden, and consider the extent to
which the State's concerns make the burden necessary.
Burdick, supra, at 434 (quoting Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460
U. S. 780, 789 (1983)). Regulations imposing severe burdens
on plaintiffs' rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a
compelling state interest. Lesser burdens, however, trigger
less exacting review, and a State's " `important regulatory
interests' " will usually be enough to justify " `reasonable,
nondiscriminatory restrictions.' " Burdick, supra, at 434
(quoting Anderson, supra, at 788); Norman, supra, at 288-
289 (requiring "corresponding interest sufficiently weighty

Opinion of the Court
to justify the limitation"). No bright line separates permis-sible election-related regulation from unconstitutional infringements on First Amendment freedoms. Storer, supra,at 730 ("[N]o litmus-paper test . . . separat[es] those restrictions that are valid from those that are invidious . . . . Therule is not self-executing and is no substitute for the hard
judgments that must be made").The New Party's claim that it has a right to select its own
candidate is uncontroversial, so far as it goes. See, e. g.,
Cousins v. Wigoda, 419 U. S. 477 (1975) (party, not State,has right to decide who will be State's delegates at party

convention). That is, the New Party, and not someone else,has the right to select the New Party's "standard bearer."
It does not follow, though, that a party is absolutely entitledto have its nominee appear on the ballot as that party's candidate. A particular candidate might be ineligible for office,8unwilling to serve, or, as here, another party's candidate.
That a particular individual may not appear on the ballot asa particular party's candidate does not severely burden that
party's associational rights. See Burdick, 504 U. S., at 440,n. 10 ("It seems to us that limiting the choice of candidates
to those who have complied with state election law require-ments is the prototypical example of a regulation that, while
it affects the right to vote, is eminently reasonable"); Anderson, 460 U. S., at 792, n. 12 ("Although a disaffiliation provi-sion may preclude . . . voters from supporting a particular

ineligible candidate, they remain free to support and pro-mote other candidates who satisfy the State's disaffiliation
requirements"); id., at 793, n. 15.The New Party relies on

Eu v. San Francisco CountyDemocratic Central Comm., supra, and Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., supra. In Eu, we struck down Califor8 See, e. g., Minn. Stat. $ 204B.06, subd. 1(c) (1994) (candidates must be
21 years of age or more upon assuming office and must have maintained
residence in the district from which they seek election for 30 days before
the general election).

Opinion of the Court
nia election provisions that prohibited political parties fromendorsing candidates in party primaries and regulated parties' internal affairs and structure. And in Tashjian, weheld that Connecticut's closed-primary statute, which required voters in a party primary to be registered party
members, interfered with a party's associational rights bylimiting "the group of registered voters whom the Party may

invite to participate in the basic function of selecting the Par-ty's candidates." 479 U. S., at 215-216 (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted). But while Tashjian and Euinvolved regulation of political parties' internal affairs and
core associational activities, Minnesota's fusion ban does not.
The ban, which applies to major and minor parties alike, simply precludes one party's candidate from appearing on the
ballot, as that party's candidate, if already nominated by another party. Respondent is free to try to convince Representative Dawkins to be the New Party's, not the DFL's,
candidate. See Swamp, 950 F. 2d, at 385 ("[A] party may
nominate any candidate that the party can convince to be
its candidate"). Whether the party still wants to endorse a
candidate who, because of the fusion ban, will not appear on
the ballot as the party's candidate, is up to the party.

The Court of Appeals also held that Minnesota's laws
"keep the New Party from developing consensual political
alliances and thus broadening the base of public participation
in and support for its activities." McKenna, 73 F. 3d, at
199. The burden on the party was, the court held, severe
because "[h]istory shows that minor parties have played a
significant role in the electoral system where multiple party
nomination is legal, but have no meaningful influence where
multiple party nomination is banned." Ibid. In the view
of the Court of Appeals, Minnesota's fusion ban forces members of the New Party to make a "no-win choice" between
voting for "candidates with no realistic chance of winning,
defect[ing] from their party and vot[ing] for a major party
candidate who does, or declin[ing] to vote at all." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court
But Minnesota has not directly precluded minor politicalparties from developing and organizing. Cf. Norman, 502

U. S., at 289 (statute "foreclose[d] the development of anypolitical party lacking the resources to run a statewide campaign"). Nor has Minnesota excluded a particular group ofcitizens, or a political party, from participation in the election
process. Cf. Anderson, supra, at 792-793 (filing deadline"places a particular burden on an identifiable segment of
Ohio's independent-minded voters"); Bullock v. Carter, 405U. S. 134 (1972) (striking down Texas statute requiring candidates to pay filing fees as a condition to having their namesplaced on primary-election ballots). The New Party remains free to endorse whom it likes, to ally itself with others,to nominate candidates for office, and to spread its message
to all who will listen. Cf. Eu, 489 U. S., at 223 (Californialaw curtailed right to "[f]ree discussion about candidates for
public office"); Colorado Republican Federal CampaignComm'n, 518 U. S., at 615 (restrictions on party's spending
impair its ability to "engage in direct political advocacy").The Court of Appeals emphasized its belief that, without
fusion-based alliances, minor parties cannot thrive. This isa predictive judgment which is by no means self-evident.

9

9 Between the First and Second World Wars, for example, various radical, agrarian, and labor-oriented parties thrived, without fusion, in the
Midwest. See generally R. Valelly, Radicalism in the States (1989). One
of these parties, Minnesota's Farmer-Labor Party, displaced the Democratic Party as the Republicans' primary opponent in Minnesota during
the 1930's. As one historian has noted: "The Minnesota Farmer-Labor
Party elected its candidates to the governorship on four occasions, to the
U. S. Senate in five elections, and to the U. S. House in twenty-five campaigns . . . . Never less than Minnesota's second strongest party, in 1936
Farmer-Laborites dominated state politics. . . . The Farmer-Labor Party
was a success despite its independence of America's two dominant national
parties and despite the sometimes bold anticapitalist rhetoric of its platforms." J. Haynes, Dubious Alliance 9 (1984). It appears that factionalism within the Farmer-Labor Party, the popular successes of New Deal
programs and ideology, and the gradual movement of political power from
the States to the National Government contributed to the party's de520US2 Unit: $U45 [09-17-99 06:55:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
362 TIMMONS v. TWIN CITIES AREA NEW PARTY

Opinion of the Court
But, more importantly, the supposed benefits of fusion tominor parties do not require that Minnesota permit it. See

Tashjian, supra, at 222 (refusing to weigh merits of closedand open primaries). Many features of our political system--e. g., single-member districts, "first past the post" elec-tions, and the high costs of campaigning--make it difficult
for third parties to succeed in American politics. BurnhamDeclaration, App. 12-13. But the Constitution does not require States to permit fusion any more than it requires themto move to proportional-representation elections or public
financing of campaigns. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55,75 (1980) (plurality opinion) ("Whatever appeal the dissenting opinion's view may have as a matter of political theory,it is not the law").

The New Party contends that the fusion ban burdens its"right . . . to communicate its choice of nominees on the ballot
on terms equal to those offered other parties, and the rightof the party's supporters and other voters to receive that
information," and insists that communication on the ballot ofa party's candidate choice is a "critical source of information
for the great majority of voters . . . who . . . rely upon party`labels' as a voting guide." Brief for Respondent 22-23.

It is true that Minnesota's fusion ban prevents the NewParty from using the ballot to communicate to the public that
it supports a particular candidate who is already anotherparty's candidate. In addition, the ban shuts off one possible
avenue a party might use to send a message to its preferredcandidate because, with fusion, a candidate who wins an
election on the basis of two parties' votes will likely knowmore--if the parties' votes are counted separately--about
the particular wishes and ideals of his constituency. We are
cline. See generally Haynes, supra; Valelly, supra; M. Gieske, Minnesota
Farmer-Laborism: The Third-Party Alternative (1979). Eventually, a
much-weakened Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democrats, forming what is now Minnesota's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, in 1944.

Opinion of the Court
unpersuaded, however, by the party's contention that it hasa right to use the ballot itself to send a particularized message, to its candidate and to the voters, about the nature ofits support for the candidate. Ballots serve primarily to
elect candidates, not as forums for political expression. See
Burdick, 504 U. S., at 438; id., at 445 (Kennedy, J., dissent-ing). Like all parties in Minnesota, the New Party is able

to use the ballot to communicate information about itself andits candidate to the voters, so long as that candidate is not
already someone else's candidate. The party retains greatlatitude in its ability to communicate ideas to voters and candidates through its participation in the campaign, and party
members may campaign for, endorse, and vote for their preferred candidate even if he is listed on the ballot as another
party's candidate. See Anderson, 460 U. S., at 788 ("[A]n
election campaign is an effective platform for the expression
of views on the issues of the day"); Illinois Bd. of Elections
v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U. S. 173, 186 (1979) ("[A]n
election campaign is a means of disseminating ideas").

In sum, Minnesota's laws do not restrict the ability of the
New Party and its members to endorse, support, or vote for
anyone they like. The laws do not directly limit the party's
access to the ballot. They are silent on parties' internal
structure, governance, and policymaking. Instead, these
provisions reduce the universe of potential candidates
who may appear on the ballot as the party's nominee only by
ruling out those few individuals who both have already
agreed to be another party's candidate and also, if forced to
choose, themselves prefer that other party. They also limit,
slightly, the party's ability to send a message to the voters
and to its preferred candidates. We conclude that the burdens Minnesota imposes on the party's First and Fourteenth
Amendment associational rights--though not trivial--are
not severe.

The Court of Appeals determined that Minnesota's fusion
ban imposed "severe" burdens on the New Party's associa520US2 Unit: $U45 [09-17-99 06:55:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tional rights, and so it required the State to show that theban was narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests. McKenna, 73 F. 3d, at 198. We disagree; given theburdens imposed, the bar is not so high. Instead, the State's
asserted regulatory interests need only be "sufficiently
weighty to justify the limitation" imposed on the party'srights.

Norman, 502 U. S., at 288-289; Burdick, supra, at
434 (quoting Anderson, supra, at 788). Nor do we requireelaborate, empirical verification of the weightiness of the

State's asserted justifications. See Munro v. Socialist
Workers Party, 479 U. S. 189, 195-196 (1986) ("Legislatures
. . . should be permitted to respond to potential deficiencies
in the electoral process with foresight rather than reactively,
provided that the response is reasonable and does not significantly impinge on constitutionally protected rights").

The Court of Appeals acknowledged Minnesota's interests
in avoiding voter confusion and overcrowded ballots, preventing party splintering and disruptions of the two-party
system, and being able to clearly identify the election winner. McKenna, supra, at 199-200. Similarly, the Seventh
Circuit, in Swamp, noted Wisconsin's "compelling" interests
in avoiding voter confusion, preserving the integrity of the
election process, and maintaining a stable political system.
950 F. 2d, at 386; cf. id., at 387-388 (Fairchild, J., concurring)
(State has a compelling interest in "maintaining the distinct
identity of parties"). Minnesota argues here that its fusion
ban is justified by its interests in avoiding voter confusion,
promoting candidate competition (by reserving limited ballot
space for opposing candidates), preventing electoral distortions and ballot manipulations, and discouraging party splintering and "unrestrained factionalism." Brief for Petitioners 41-50.

States certainly have an interest in protecting the integrity, fairness, and efficiency of their ballots and election processes as means for electing public officials. Bullock, 405
U. S., at 145 (State may prevent "frivolous or fraudulent

candidacies") (citing Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431, 442
(1971)); Eu, 489 U. S., at 231; Norman, supra, at 290 (States
have an interest in preventing "misrepresentation"); Rosario
v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S. 752, 761 (1973). Petitioners contend
that a candidate or party could easily exploit fusion as a way
of associating his or its name with popular slogans and catchphrases. For example, members of a major party could decide that a powerful way of "sending a message" via the ballot would be for various factions of that party to nominate
the major party's candidate as the candidate for the newly
formed "No New Taxes," "Conserve Our Environment," and
"Stop Crime Now" parties. In response, an opposing major
party would likely instruct its factions to nominate that
party's candidate as the "Fiscal Responsibility," "Healthy
Planet," and "Safe Streets" parties' candidate.

Whether or not the putative "fusion" candidates' names
appeared on one or four ballot lines, such maneuvering would
undermine the ballot's purpose by transforming it from a
means of choosing candidates to a billboard for political advertising. The New Party responds to this concern, ironically enough, by insisting that the State could avoid such
manipulation by adopting more demanding ballot-access
standards rather than prohibiting multiple-party nomination.
Brief for Respondent 38. However, as we stated above, because the burdens the fusion ban imposes on the party's associational rights are not severe, the State need not narrowly
tailor the means it chooses to promote ballot integrity. The
Constitution does not require that Minnesota compromise
the policy choices embodied in its ballot-access requirements
to accommodate the New Party's fusion strategy. See Minn.
Stat. $ 204B.08, subd. 3 (1994) (signature requirements for
nominating petitions); Rosario, supra, at 761-762 (New
York's time limitation for enrollment in a political party was
part of an overall scheme aimed at the preservation of the
integrity of the State's electoral process).

520US2 Unit: $U45 [09-17-99 06:55:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
366 TIMMONS v. TWIN CITIES AREA NEW PARTY

Opinion of the Court
Relatedly, petitioners urge that permitting fusion wouldundercut Minnesota's ballot-access regime by allowing minor

parties to capitalize on the popularity of another party's can-didate, rather than on their own appeal to the voters, in
order to secure access to the ballot. Brief for Petitioners
45-46. That is, voters who might not sign a minor party'snominating petition based on the party's own views and candidates might do so if they viewed the minor party as just
another way of nominating the same person nominated by
one of the major parties. Thus, Minnesota fears that fusion
would enable minor parties, by nominating a major party's
candidate, to bootstrap their way to major-party status in
the next election and circumvent the State's nominatingpetition requirement for minor parties. See Minn. Stat.

$$ 200.02, subd. 7 (defining "major party"), and 204D.13 (1994)
(describing ballot order for major and other parties). The
State surely has a valid interest in making sure that minor
and third parties who are granted access to the ballot are
bona fide and actually supported, on their own merits, by
those who have provided the statutorily required petition or
ballot support. Anderson, 460 U. S., at 788, n. 9; Storer, 415
U. S., at 733, 746.

States also have a strong interest in the stability of their
political systems.10 Eu, supra, at 226; Storer, supra, at 736.

10 The dissents state that we may not consider "what appears to be the
true basis for [our] holding--the interest in preserving the two-party system," post, at 377 (opinion of Stevens, J.), because Minnesota did not
defend this interest in its briefs and "expressly rejected" it at oral argument, post, at 378; see also post, at 382-383 (opinion of Souter, J.). In
fact, at oral argument, the State contended that it has an interest in the
stability of its political system and that, even if certain election-related
regulations, such as those requiring single-member districts, tend to work
to the advantage of the traditional two-party system, the "States do have
a permissible choice . . . there, as long as they don't go so far as to close
the door to minor part[ies]." Tr. of Oral Arg. 27; see also Brief for Petitioners 46-47 (discussing State's interest in avoiding " `splintered parties
and unrestrained factionalism' ") (quoting Storer, 415 U. S., at 736). We
agree.

Opinion of the Court
This interest does not permit a State to completely insulate
the two-party system from minor parties' or independent
candidates' competition and influence, Anderson, supra, at
802; Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23 (1968), nor is it a paternalistic license for States to protect political parties from the
consequences of their own internal disagreements. Eu,
supra, at 227; Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 224. That said, the
States' interest permits them to enact reasonable election
regulations that may, in practice, favor the traditional twoparty system, see Burnham Declaration, App. 12 (American
politics has been, for the most part, organized around two
parties since the time of Andrew Jackson), and that temper
the destabilizing effects of party splintering and excessive
factionalism. The Constitution permits the Minnesota Legislature to decide that political stability is best served
through a healthy two-party system. See Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U. S. 62, 107 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) ("The stabilizing effects of such a [two-party] system are obvious"); Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U. S. 109, 144-145
(1986) (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("There can be little doubt
that the emergence of a strong and stable two-party system
in this country has contributed enormously to sound and effective government"); Branti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507, 532
(1980) (Powell, J., dissenting) ("Broad-based political parties
supply an essential coherence and flexibility to the American
political scene"). And while an interest in securing the
perceived benefits of a stable two-party system will not

justify unreasonably exclusionary restrictions, see Williams,
supra, at 31-32, States need not remove all of the many
hurdles third parties face in the American political arena
today.

In Storer, we upheld a California statute that denied ballot
positions to independent candidates who had voted in the
immediately preceding primary elections or had a registered
party affiliation at any time during the year before the same

Opinion of the Court
primary elections. 415 U. S., at 728.11 After surveying the
relevant case law, we "ha[d] no hesitation in sustaining" the
party-disaffiliation provisions. Id., at 733. We recognized
that the provisions were part of a "general state policy aimed
at maintaining the integrity of . . . the ballot," and noted
that the provision did not discriminate against independent
candidates. Ibid. We concluded that while a "State need
not take the course California has, . . . California apparently believes with the Founding Fathers that splintered
parties and unrestrained factionalism may do significant
damage to the fabric of government. See The Federalist
No. 10 (Madison). It appears obvious to us that the one-year
disaffiliation provision furthers the State's interest in the
stability of its political system." 415 U. S., at 736; see also
Lippitt v. Cipollone, 404 U. S. 1032 (1972) (affirming, without
opinion, district-court decision upholding statute banning
party-primary candidacies of those who had voted in another
party's primary within last four years).12

11 A similar provision applied to party candidates, and imposed a "flat
disqualification upon any candidate seeking to run in a party primary if
he has been `registered as affiliated with a political party other than that
political party the nomination of which he seeks within 12 months immediately prior to the filing of the declaration.' " Another provision stated
that "no person may file nomination papers for a party nomination and an
independent nomination for the same office . . . ." Storer, 415 U. S., at 733.

12 Justice Stevens insists that New York's experience with fusion politics undermines Minnesota's contention that its fusion ban promotes political stability. Post, at 376, n. 4, 381, n. 12 (dissenting opinion). California's experiment with cross-filing, on the other hand, provides some
justification for Minnesota's concerns. In 1946, for example, Earl Warren
was the nominee of both major parties, and was therefore able to run
unopposed in California's general election. It appears to be widely accepted that California's cross-filing system stifled electoral competition
and undermined the role of distinctive political parties. See B. Hyink,
S. Brown, & D. Provost, Politics and Government in California 76 (12th
ed. 1989) (California's cross-filing law "undermined party responsibility
and cohesiveness"); D. Mazmanian, Third Parties in Presidential Elections
134 (1974) (cross-filing "diminish[ed] the role of political parties and

Opinion of the Court
Our decision in Burdick v. Takushi, supra, is also relevant.
There, we upheld Hawaii's ban on write-in voting against a
claim that the ban unreasonably infringed on citizens' First
and Fourteenth Amendment rights. In so holding, we rejected the petitioner's argument that the ban "deprive[d]
him of the opportunity to cast a meaningful ballot," emphasizing that the function of elections is to elect candidates and
that "we have repeatedly upheld reasonable, politically neutral regulations that have the effect of channeling expressive
activit[ies] at the polls." 504 U. S., at 437-438.

Minnesota's fusion ban is far less burdensome than the disaffiliation rule upheld in Storer, and is justified by similarly
weighty state interests. By reading Storer as dealing only
with "sore-loser candidates," Justice Stevens, in our view,

fails to appreciate the case's teaching. Post, at 377 (dissenting opinion). Under the California disaffiliation statute at
issue in Storer, any person affiliated with a party at any
time during the year leading up to the primary election was
absolutely precluded from appearing on the ballot as an independent or as the candidate of another party. Minnesota's
fusion ban is not nearly so restrictive; the challenged provisions say nothing about the previous party affiliation of
would-be candidates but only require that, in order to appear
on the ballot, a candidate not be the nominee of more than
one party. California's disaffiliation rule limited the field of
candidates by thousands; Minnesota's precludes only a handful who freely choose to be so limited. It is also worth noting that while California's disaffiliation statute absolutely
banned many candidacies, Minnesota's fusion ban only prohibits a candidate from being named twice.

We conclude that the burdens Minnesota's fusion ban imposes on the New Party's associational rights are justified
by "correspondingly weighty" valid state interests in ballot

work[ed] against the efforts of minority factions to gain recognition and a
hearing in the electoral arena").

integrity and political stability.13 In deciding that Minneso-ta's fusion ban does not unconstitutionally burden the New

In Minnesota, the Twin Cities Area New Party (Party) isa recognized minor political party entitled by state law to
have the names of its candidates for public office appear onthe state ballots. In April 1994, Andy Dawkins was qualified to be a candidate for election to the Minnesota Legisla-ture as the representative of House District 65A. With
Dawkins' consent, the Party nominated him as its candidatefor that office. In my opinion the Party and its members
had a constitutional right to have their candidate's name ap-pear on the ballot despite the fact that he was also the nominee of another party.The Court's conclusion that the Minnesota statute prohibiting multiple-party candidacies is constitutional rests onthree dubious premises: (1) that the statute imposes only a

this supposed interest was discussed below, 73 F. 3d, at 199-200, and in
the parties' briefs before this Court, Brief for Petitioners 41-44; Brief for
Respondent 34-39, it plays no part in our analysis today.

minor burden on the Party's right to choose and to supportthe candidate of its choice; (2) that the statute significantly

serves the State's asserted interests in avoiding ballot ma-nipulation and factionalism; and (3) that, in any event, the
interest in preserving the two-party system justifies the im-position of the burden at issue in this case. I disagree with
each of these premises. I

The members of a recognized political party unquestion-ably have a constitutional right to select their nominees for
public office and to communicate the identity of their nomi-nees to the voting public. Both the right to choose and the
right to advise voters of that choice are entitled to the high-est respect.

The Minnesota statutes place a significant burden on bothof those rights. The Court's recital of burdens that the statute does not inflict on the Party, ante, at 363, does nothingto minimize the severity of the burdens that it does impose.
The fact that the Party may nominate its second choicesurely does not diminish the significance of a restriction that
denies it the right to have the name of its first choice appearon the ballot. Nor does the point that it may use some of
its limited resources to publicize the fact that its first choiceis the nominee of some other party provide an adequate substitute for the message that is conveyed to every person whoactually votes when a party's nominees appear on the ballot.

As to the first point, the State contends that the fusionban in fact limits by only a few candidates the range of individuals a party may nominate, and that the burden is there-fore quite small. But the

number of candidates removedfrom the Party's reach cannot be the determinative factor.

The ban leaves the Party free to nominate any eligible candi-date except the particular " `standard bearer who best represents the party's ideologies and preferences.' " Eu v. San
Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214,224 (1989).

372 TIMMONS v. TWIN CITIES AREA NEW PARTY

Stevens, J., dissenting
The Party could perhaps choose to expend its resourcessupporting a candidate who was not in fact the best representative of its members' views. But a party's choice of acandidate is the most effective way in which that party can
communicate to the voters what the party represents and,
thereby, attract voter interest and support.1 Political par-ties "exist to advance their members' shared political beliefs," and "in the context of particular elections, candidatesare necessary to make the party's message known and effective, and vice versa." Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Comm. v. Federal Election Comm'n, 518 U. S. 604,
629 (1996) (Kennedy, J., dissenting). See also Anderson v.
Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 821 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) ("Political parties have, or at least hope to have, acontinuing existence, representing particular philosophies.

Each party has an interest in finding the best candidate to
advance its philosophy in each election").

The State next argues that--instead of nominating a
second-choice candidate--the Party could remove itself from

1 The burden on the Party's right to nominate its first-choice candidate,
by limiting the Party's ability to convey through its nominee what the
Party represents, risks impinging on another core element of any political
party's associational rights--the right to "broaden the base of public participation in and support for its activities." Tashjian v. Republican
Party of Conn., 479 U. S. 208, 214 (1986). The Court of Appeals relied
substantially on this right in concluding that the fusion ban impermissibly
burdened the New Party, but its focus was somewhat different. See Twin
Cities Area New Party v. McKenna, 73 F. 3d 196, 199 (CA8 1996). A
fusion ban burdens the right of a minor party to broaden its base of support because of the political reality that the dominance of the major parties
frequently makes a vote for a minor party or independent candidate a
"wasted" vote. When minor parties can nominate a candidate also nominated by a major party, they are able to present their members with an
opportunity to cast a vote for a candidate who will actually be elected.
Although this aspect of a party's effort to broaden support is distinct from
the ability to nominate the candidate who best represents the party's
views, it is important to note that the party's right to broaden the base of
its support is burdened in both ways by the fusion ban.

the ballot altogether, and publicly endorse the candidate ofanother party. But the right to be on the election ballot

is precisely what separates a political party from any otherinterest group.

2 The Court relies on the fact that the Party

remains free "to spread its message to all who will listen,"
ante, at 361, through forums other than the ballot. Giventhe limited resources available to most minor parties, and

the less-than-universal interest in the messages of third par-ties, it is apparent that the Party's message will, in this manner, reach a much smaller audience than that composed of allvoters who can read the ballot in the polling booth.

The majority rejects as unimportant the limits that thefusion ban may impose on the Party's ability to express its
political views, ante, at 362-363, relying on our decision in
Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 445 (1992), in which wenoted that "the purpose of casting, counting, and recording

votes is to elect public officials, not to serve as a generalforum for political expression." But in

Burdick we concluded simply that an individual voter's interest in express-ing his disapproval of the single candidate running for office

in a particular election did not require the State to financeand provide a mechanism for tabulating write-in votes. Our
conclusion that the ballot is not principally a forum for the
individual expression of political sentiment through the cast-ing of a vote does not justify the conclusion that the ballot

serves no expressive purpose for the parties who place candi-dates on the ballot. Indeed, the long-recognized right to
choose a " `standard bearer who best represents the party'sideologies and preferences,' "

Eu, 489 U. S., at 224, is inescapably an expressive right. "To the extent that party labels

issued by an official party organization carries more weight than one issued by a newspaper or a labor union." Eu v. San Francisco County
Democratic Central Comm., 489 U. S. 214, 228, n. 18 (1989). Given this
reality, I cannot agree with the majority's implicit equation of the right to
endorse with the right to nominate.

Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn., 479 U. S.208, 220 (1986).

In this case, and presumably in most cases, the burdenof a statute of this kind is imposed upon the members
of a minor party, but its potential impact is much broader.Popular candidates like Andy Dawkins sometimes receive
nationwide recognition. Fiorello LaGuardia, Earl Warren,Ronald Reagan, and Franklin D. Roosevelt are names that
come readily to mind as candidates whose reputations andpolitical careers were enhanced because they appeared on
election ballots as fusion candidates. See Note, Fusion andthe Associational Rights of Minor Political Parties, 95 Colum.
L. Rev. 683 (1995). A statute that denied a political partythe right to nominate any of those individuals for high office
simply because he had already been nominated by anotherparty would, in my opinion, place an intolerable burden on
political expression and association.

II
Minnesota argues that the statutory restriction on theParty's right to nominate the candidate of its choice is justified by the State's interests in avoiding voter confusion, pre-venting ballot clutter and manipulation, encouraging candidate competition, and minimizing intraparty factionalism.None of these rationales can support the fusion ban because
the State has failed to explain how the ban actually servesthe asserted interests.

I believe that the law significantly abridges First Amend-ment freedoms and that the State therefore must shoulder a
correspondingly heavy burden of justification if the law is tosurvive judicial scrutiny. But even accepting the majority's
view that the burdens imposed by the law are not weighty,

Stevens, J., dissenting
the State's asserted interests must at least bear some plausible relationship to the burdens it places on political parties.
See Anderson, 460 U. S., at 789. Although the Court today
suggests that the State does not have to support its asserted
justifications for the fusion ban with evidence that they have
any empirical validity, ante, at 364, we have previously
required more than a bare assertion that some particular
state interest is served by a burdensome election requirement. See, e. g., Eu, 489 U. S., at 226 (rejecting California's
argument that the State's endorsement ban protected political stability because the State "never adequately explain[ed]
how banning parties from endorsing or opposing primary
candidates advances that interest"); Anderson, 460 U. S.,
at 789 (evaluating a State's interests, we examine "the extent
to which those interests make it necessary to burden the
plaintiff 's rights"); Norman v. Reed, 502 U. S. 279, 288-

289 (1992) ("corresponding interest" must be "sufficiently
weighty to justify the limitation").3

While the State describes some imaginative theoretical
sources of voter confusion that could result from fusion
candidacies, in my judgment the argument that the burden
on First Amendment interests is justified by this concern is
meritless and severely underestimates the intelligence of the

3 In any event, the parade of horribles that the majority appears to believe might visit Minnesota should fusion candidacies be allowed is fantastical, given the evidence from New York's experience with fusion. See
Brief for Conservative Party of New York et al. as Amici Curiae 20-25.
Thus, the evidence that actually is available diminishes, rather than
strengthens, Minnesota's claims. The majority asserts, ante, at 368-369,
n. 12, that California's cross-filing system, in place during the first half of
this century, provides a compelling counterexample. But cross-filing,
which "allowed candidates to file in the primary of any or all parties without specifying party affiliation," D. Mazmanian, Third Parties in Presidential Elections 132-133 (1974) (hereinafter Mazmanian), is simply not the
same as fusion politics, and the problems suffered in California do not
provide empirical support for Minnesota's position.

typical voter.4 We have noted more than once that "[a]State's claim that it is enhancing the ability of its citizenry

to make wise decisions by restricting the flow of informationto them must be viewed with some skepticism." Eu, 489
U. S., at 228; Tashjian, 479 U. S., at 221; Anderson, 460 U. S.,at 798.

The State's concern about ballot manipulation, readily ac-cepted by the majority, is similarly farfetched. The possibility that members of the major parties will begin to createdozens of minor parties with detailed, issue-oriented titles
for the sole purpose of nominating candidates under thosetitles, see

ante, at 365, is entirely hypothetical. The major-ity dismisses out-of-hand the Party's argument that the risk

of this type of ballot manipulation and crowding is more eas-ily averted by maintaining reasonably stringent requirements for the creation of minor parties. Ibid. In fact,though, the Party's point merely illustrates the idea that a
State can place some kinds--but not every kind--of limita-tion on the abilities of small parties to thrive. If the State
wants to make it more difficult for any group to achieve thelegal status of being a political party, it can do so within
reason and still not run up against the First Amendment."The State has the undoubted right to require candidates to
make a preliminary showing of substantial support in orderto qualify for a place on the ballot, because it is both wasteful
and confusing to encumber the ballot with the names of friv-olous candidates."

Anderson, 460 U. S., at 788-789, n. 9.See also Jenness v. Fortson, 403 U. S. 431, 442 (1971). But

once the State has established a standard for achieving partystatus, forbidding an acknowledged party to put on the ballot its chosen candidate clearly frustrates core associationalrights.

Stevens, J., dissenting
The State argues that the fusion ban promotes politicalstability by preventing intraparty factionalism and party

raiding. States do certainly have an interest in maintaininga stable political system. Eu, 489 U. S., at 226. But the
State has not convincingly articulated how the fusion banwill prevent the factionalism it fears. Unlike the law at
issue in Storer v. Brown, 415 U. S. 724 (1974), for example,this law would not prevent sore-loser candidates from defecting with a disaffected segment of a major party and runningas an opposition candidate for a newly formed minor party.
Nor does this law, like those aimed at requiring parties toshow a modicum of support in order to secure a place on
the election ballot, prevent the formation of numerous smallparties. Indeed, the activity banned by Minnesota's law is
the formation of coalitions, not the division and dissensionof "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism." Id.,
at 736.As for the State's argument that the fusion ban encourages
candidate competition, this claim treats "candidates" as fun-gible goods, ignoring entirely each party's interest in nominating not just any candidate, but the candidate who bestrepresents the party's views. Minnesota's fusion ban simply
cannot be justified with reference to this or any of theabove-mentioned rationales. I turn, therefore, to what appears to be the true basis for the Court's holding--the inter-est in preserving the two-party system.

III
Before addressing the merits of preserving the two-partysystem as a justification for Minnesota's fusion ban, I should

note that, in my view, it is impermissible for the Court toconsider this rationale. Minnesota did not argue in its

to secure access to the ballot." Ante, at 366. What the majority appears
unwilling to accept is that Andy Dawkins was the Party's chosen candidate. The Party was not trying to capitalize on his status as someone
else's candidate, but to identify him as their own choice.

briefs that the preservation of the two-party system sup-ported the fusion ban, and indeed, when pressed at oral argument on the matter, the State expressly rejected this ration-ale. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26. Our opinions have been explicit
in their willingness to consider only the particular interests
put forward by a State to support laws that impose any sortof burden on First Amendment rights. See

Anderson, 460
U. S., at 789 (the Court will "identify and evaluate the pre-cise interests put forward by the State as justifications for

the burden imposed by its rule"); id., at 817 (Rehnquist, J.,dissenting) (state laws that burden First Amendment rights
are upheld when they are " `tied to a particularized legiti-mate purpose' ") (quoting

Rosario v. Rockefeller, 410 U. S.
752, 762 (1973)); Burdick, 504 U. S., at 434.

Even if the State had put forward this interest to supportits laws, it would not be sufficient to justify the fusion ban.

In most States, perhaps in all, there are two and only twomajor political parties. It is not surprising, therefore, that
most States have enacted election laws that impose burdenson the development and growth of third parties. The law at
issue in this case is undeniably such a law. The fact that thelaw was both intended to disadvantage minor parties and has
had that effect is a matter that should weigh against, rather
than in favor of, its constitutionality.6

6 Indeed, "[a] burden that falls unequally on new or small political
parties or on independent candidates impinges, by its very nature, on associational choices protected by the First Amendment." Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 793-794 (1983). I do not think it is irrelevant that
when antifusion laws were passed by States all over the Nation in the
latter part of the 1800's, these laws, characterized by the majority as
"reforms," ante, at 356, were passed by "the parties in power in state
legislatures . . . to squelch the threat posed by the opposition's combined
voting force." McKenna, 73 F. 3d, at 198. See Argersinger, "A Place on
the Ballot": Fusion Politics and Antifusion Laws, 85 Am. Hist. Rev. 287,

with exclusive reference to the original purpose behind their passage,

Stevens, J., dissenting
Our jurisprudence in this area reflects a certain tension:On the one hand, we have been clear that political stability

is an important state interest and that incidental burdens onthe formation of minor parties are reasonable to protect that
interest, see Storer, 415 U. S., at 736; on the other, we havestruck down state elections laws specifically because they
give "the two old, established parties a decided advantageover any new parties struggling for existence,"

Williams v.Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, 31 (1968).
7 Between these boundaries,

we have acknowledged that there is "no litmus-paper test forseparating those restrictions that are valid from those that

are invidious . . . . The rule is not self-executing and isno substitute for the hard judgments that must be made."
Storer, 415 U. S., at 730.Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the States from
maintaining single-member districts with winner-take-allvoting arrangements. And these elements of an election
system do make it significantly more difficult for third par-ties to thrive. But these laws are different in two respects
from the fusion bans at issue here. First, the method bywhich they hamper third-party development is not one that
impinges on the associational rights of those third parties;minor parties remain free to nominate candidates of their
choice, and to rally support for those candidates. The smallparties' relatively limited likelihood of ultimate success on
election day does not deprive them of the right to try. Sec-ond, the establishment of single-member districts correlates

Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U. S. 60, 70-71 (1983), this
history does provide some indication of the kind of burden the States
themselves believed they were imposing on the smaller parties' effective
association.

7 In Anderson, the State argued that its interest in political stability

justified the early filing deadline for Presidential candidates at issue in
the case. We recognized that the "asserted interest in political stability
amounts to a desire to protect existing political parties from competition,"
and rejected that interest. 460 U. S., at 801-802.

directly with the States' interests in political stability. Sys-tems of proportional representation, for example, may tend

toward factionalism and fragile coalitions that diminish legis-lative effectiveness. In the context of fusion candidacies,
the risks to political stability are extremely attenuated.8 Ofcourse, the reason minor parties so ardently support fusion
politics is because it allows the parties to build up a greaterbase of support, as potential minor party members realize
that a vote for the smaller party candidate is not necessarily
a "wasted" vote. Eventually, a minor party might gathersufficient strength that--were its members so inclined--it

could successfully run a candidate not endorsed by any majorparty, and legislative coalition building will be made more
difficult by the presence of third-party legislators. But the
risks to political stability in that scenario are speculative atbest.

9

In some respects, the fusion candidacy is the best marriage
of the virtues of the minor party challenge to entrenched
viewpoints 10 and the political stability that the two-party

8 Even in a system that allows fusion, a candidate for election must assemble majority support, so the State's concern cannot logically be about
risks to political stability in the particular election in which the fusion
candidate is running.

9 In fact, Minnesota's expressed concern that fusion candidacies would

stifle political diversity because minor parties would not put additional
names on the ballot seems directly contradictory to the majority's imposed
interest in the stable two-party system. The tension between the Court's
rationale for its decision and the State's actually articulated interests is
one of the reasons I do not believe the Court can legitimately consider
interests not relied on by the State, especially in a context where the
burden imposed and the interest justifying it must have some relationship.

of conscience, as an ideological governor to keep major parties from speeding off into an abyss of mindlessness, and even just as a technique

party would have to be invented if it did not come into existence regularly enough." A. Bickel, Reform and Continuity 80 (1971); see also

system provides. The fusion candidacy does not threaten todivide the legislature and create significant risks of factionalism, which is the principal risk proponents of the two-partysystem point to. But it does provide a means by which voters with viewpoints not adequately represented by the plat-forms of the two major parties can indicate to a particular
candidate that--in addition to his support for the majorparty views--he should be responsive to the views of the
minor party whose support for him was demonstrated wherepolitical parties demonstrate support--on the ballot.

The strength of the two-party system--and of each of itsmajor components--is the product of the power of the ideas,
the traditions, the candidates, and the voters that constitutethe parties.

11 It demeans the strength of the two-party system to assume that the major parties need to rely on lawsthat discriminate against independent voters and minor parties in order to preserve their positions of power.12 Indeed,
S. Rosenstone, R. Behr, & E. Lazarus, Third Parties in America: Citizen
Response to Major Party Failure 4-9 (1984).

11 The Court of Appeals recognized that fusion politics could have an

important role in preserving this value when it struck down the fusion
ban. "[R]ather than jeopardizing the integrity of the election system,
consensual multiple party nomination may invigorate it by fostering more
competition, participation, and representation in American politics." McKenna, 73 F. 3d, at 199.

12 The experience in New York with fusion politics provides considerable

evidence that neither political stability nor the ultimate strength of the
two major parties is truly risked by the existence of successful minor
parties. More generally, "the presence of one or even two significant
third parties has not led to a proliferation of parties, nor to the destruction
of basic democratic institutions." Mazmanian 69; see also The Supreme
Court, 1982 Term--Independent Candidates and Minority Parties, 97
Harv. L. Rev. 1, 162 (1983) ("American political stability does not depend
on a two-party oligopoly. . . . [H]istorical experience in this country demonstrate[s] that minor parties and independent candidacies are compatible
with long-term political stability. Moreover, there is no reason to believe
that eliminating restrictions on political minorities would change the basic
structure of the two-party system in this country").

it is a central theme of our jurisprudence that the entire
electorate, which necessarily includes the members of the
major parties, will benefit from robust competition in ideas

In my opinion legislation that would otherwise be unconstitutional because it burdens First Amendment interests
and discriminates against minor political parties cannot survive simply because it benefits the two major parties. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

Justice Souter, dissenting.
I join Parts I and II of Justice Stevens's dissent, agreeing as I do that none of the concerns advanced by the State
suffices to justify the burden of the challenged statutes on
respondent's First Amendment interests. I also agree with
Justice Stevens's view, set out in the first paragraph of
Part III, that the State does not assert the interest in preserving "the traditional two-party system" upon which the
majority repeatedly relies in upholding Minnesota's statutes,
see, e. g., ante, at 367 ("The Constitution permits the Minnesota Legislature to decide that political stability is best
served through a healthy two-party system"). Actually,
Minnesota's statement of the "important regulatory concerns
advanced by the State's ban on ballot fusion," Brief for Petitioners 40, contains no reference whatsoever to the "twoparty system," nor even any explicit reference to "political
stability" generally. See id., at 40-50.

To be sure, the State does assert its intention to prevent
"party splintering," id., at 46-50, which may not be separable in the abstract from a desire to preserve political stabil520US2 Unit: $U45 [09-17-99 06:55:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ity.1 But in fact the State has less comprehensive concerns;the primary dangers posed by what it calls "major-party

splintering and factionalism," id., at 47, are said to be thoseof "turn[ing] the general election ballot into a forum for
venting intraparty squabbles," ibid., and reducing electionsto "a thinly disguised ballot-issue campaign,"

id., at 49. No-where does the State even intimate that the splintering it

wishes to avert might cause or hasten the demise of the two-party system. In these circumstances, neither the State's
point about "splintering," nor its tentative reference to "po-litical stability" at oral argument, n. 1, infra, may fairly be
assimilated to the interest posited by the Court of preserv-ing the "two-party system." Accordingly, because I agree
with Justice Stevens, ante, at 378, that our election casesrestrict our consideration to "the precise interests put forward by the State as justifications for the burden imposed byits rule,"

Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U. S. 780, 789 (1983),2 Iwould judge the challenged statutes only on the interests the

State has raised in their defense and would hold themunconstitutional.

I am, however, unwilling to go the further distance ofconsidering and rejecting the majority's "preservation of
the two-party system" rationale. For while Minnesota hasmade no such argument before us, I cannot discount the possibility of a forceful one. There is considerable consensusthat party loyalty among American voters has declined
significantly in the past four decades, see, e. g., W. Crotty,American Parties in Decline 26-34 (2d ed. 1984); Jensen,

The Last Party System: Decay of Consensus, 1932-1980,in The Evolution of American Electoral Systems 219-225,

Surely the majority is right that States "have a stronginterest in the stability of their political systems," ante, at

threat to the two-party scheme, there might well be a suffi-cient predicate for recognizing the constitutionality of the
state action presented by this case. Right now, however, noState has attempted even to make this argument, and I
would therefore leave its consideration for another day.

RICHARDS v. WISCONSIN
certiorari to the supreme court of wisconsin

No. 96-5955. Argued March 24, 1997--Decided April 28, 1997
In Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927, this Court held that the Fourth

Amendment incorporates the common-law requirement that police
knock on a dwelling's door and announce their identity and purpose
before attempting forcible entry, recognized that the flexible reasonableness requirement should not be read to mandate a rigid announcement
rule that ignores countervailing law enforcement interests, id., at 934,
and left it to the lower courts to determine the circumstances under
which an unannounced entry is reasonable. Id., at 936. Officers in
Madison, Wisconsin, obtained a warrant to search petitioner Richards'
motel room for drugs and related paraphernalia, but the Magistrate refused to give advance authorization for a "no-knock" entry. The officer
who knocked on Richards' door was dressed, and identified himself, as
a maintenance man. Upon opening the door, Richards also saw a uniformed officer and quickly closed the door. The officers kicked down
the door, caught Richards trying to escape, and found cash and cocaine
in the bathroom. In denying Richards' motion to suppress the evidence
on the ground that the officers did not knock and announce their presence before forcing entry, the trial court found that they could gather
from Richards' strange behavior that he might try to destroy evidence
or escape and that the drugs' disposable nature further justified their
decision not to knock and announce. The State Supreme Court affirmed, concluding that Wilson did not preclude the court's pre-Wilson
per se rule that police officers are never required to knock and announce
when executing a search warrant in a felony drug investigation because
of the special circumstances of today's drug culture.

Held:

1. The Fourth Amendment does not permit a blanket exception to the
knock-and-announce requirement for felony drug investigations. While
the requirement can give way under circumstances presenting a threat
of physical violence or where officers believe that evidence would be
destroyed if advance notice were given, 514 U. S., at 936, the fact that
felony drug investigations may frequently present such circumstances
cannot remove from the neutral scrutiny of a reviewing court the reasonableness of the police decision not to knock and announce in a particular case. Creating exceptions to the requirement based on the culture surrounding a general category of criminal behavior presents at

Syllabus
least two serious concerns. First, the exception contains considerable
overgeneralization that would impermissibly insulate from judicial review cases in which a drug investigation does not pose special risks.
Second, creating an exception in one category can, relatively easily, be
applied to others. If a per se exception were allowed for each criminal
activity category that included a considerable risk of danger to officers
or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce requirement would
be meaningless. The court confronted with the question in each case
has a duty to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the
particular entry justified dispensing with the requirement. A "noknock" entry is justified when the police have a reasonable suspicion
that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the
effective investigation of the crime. This standard strikes the appropriate balance between the legitimate law enforcement concerns at issue
in the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy interests
affected by no-knock entries. Cf. Maryland v. Buie, 494 U. S. 325,
337. Pp. 391-395.

2. Because the evidence in this case establishes that the decision not
to knock and announce was a reasonable one under the circumstances,
the officers' entry into the motel room did not violate the Fourth
Amendment. That the Magistrate had originally refused to issue a noknock warrant means only that at the time the warrant was requested
there was insufficient evidence for a no-knock entry. However, the officers' decision to enter the room must be evaluated as of the time of
entry. Pp. 395-396.

Opinion of the Court
drug investigation. In so doing, it reaffirmed a pre-Wilsonholding and concluded that Wilson did not preclude this per

se rule. We disagree with the court's conclusion that theFourth Amendment permits a blanket exception to the
knock-and-announce requirement for this entire category ofcriminal activity. But because the evidence presented to
support the officers' actions in this case establishes that thedecision not to knock and announce was a reasonable one
under the circumstances, we affirm the judgment of the Wis-consin court.

I
On December 31, 1991, police officers in Madison, Wiscon-sin, obtained a warrant to search Steiney Richards' motel

room for drugs and related paraphernalia. The search war-rant was the culmination of an investigation that had uncovered substantial evidence that Richards was one of severalindividuals dealing drugs out of hotel rooms in Madison.
The police requested a warrant that would have given ad-vance authorization for a "no-knock" entry into the motel
room, but the Magistrate explicitly deleted those portions ofthe warrant. App. 7, 9.

The officers arrived at the motel room at 3:40 a.m. OfficerPharo, dressed as a maintenance man, led the team. With
him were several plainclothes officers and at least one manin uniform. Officer Pharo knocked on Richards' door and,
responding to the query from inside the room, stated that hewas a maintenance man. With the chain still on the door,
Richards cracked it open. Although there is some disputeas to what occurred next, Richards acknowledges that when
he opened the door he saw the man in uniform standingbehind Officer Pharo. Brief for Petitioner 6. He quickly
slammed the door closed and, after waiting two or three sec-onds, the officers began kicking and ramming the door to
gain entry to the locked room. At trial, the officers testifiedthat they identified themselves as police while they were
kicking the door in. App. 40. When they finally did break

Opinion of the Court
into the room, the officers caught Richards trying to escapethrough the window. They also found cash and cocaine hidden in plastic bags above the bathroom ceiling tiles.Richards sought to have the evidence from his motel room
suppressed on the ground that the officers had failed to
knock and announce their presence prior to forcing entry intothe room. The trial court denied the motion, concluding

that the officers could gather from Richards' strange behav-ior when they first sought entry that he knew they were
police officers and that he might try to destroy evidence orto escape.

Id., at 54. The judge emphasized that the easily
disposable nature of the drugs the police were searching for
further justified their decision to identify themselves as they
crossed the threshold instead of announcing their presence
before seeking entry. Id., at 55. Richards appealed the
decision to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and that court

affirmed. 201 Wis. 2d 845, 549 N. W. 2d 218 (1996).

The Wisconsin Supreme Court did not delve into the
events underlying Richards' arrest in any detail, but accepted the following facts: "[O]n December 31, 1991, police
executed a search warrant for the motel room of the defendant seeking evidence of the felonious crime of Possession
with Intent to Deliver a Controlled Substance in violation of
Wis. Stat. $ 161.41(1m) (1991-92). They did not knock and
announce prior to their entry. Drugs were seized." Id., at
849, 549 N. W. 2d, at 220.

Assuming these facts, the court proceeded to consider
whether our decision in Wilson required the court to abandon its decision in State v. Stevens, 181 Wis. 2d 410, 511 N. W.

2d 591 (1994), cert. denied, 515 U. S. 1102 (1995), which held
that "when the police have a search warrant, supported by
probable cause, to search a residence for evidence of delivery
of drugs or evidence of possession with intent to deliver
drugs, they necessarily have reasonable cause to believe exigent circumstances exist" to justify a no-knock entry. 201
Wis. 2d, at 852, 549 N. W. 2d, at 221. The court concluded

520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
390 RICHARDS v. WISCONSIN

Opinion of the Court
that nothing in Wilson's acknowledgment that the knock-and-announce rule was an element of the Fourth Amendment

"reasonableness" requirement would prohibit application ofa per se exception to that rule in a category of cases. 201
Wis. 2d, at 854-855, 549 N. W. 2d, at 220.In reaching this conclusion, the Wisconsin court found it
reasonable--after considering criminal conduct surveys,newspaper articles, and other judicial opinions--to assume
that all felony drug crimes will involve "an extremely highrisk of serious if not deadly injury to the police as well as
the potential for the disposal of drugs by the occupants priorto entry by the police."

Id., at 847-848, 549 N. W. 2d, at 219.Notwithstanding its acknowledgment that in "some cases,

police officers will undoubtedly decide that their safety, thesafety of others, and the effective execution of the warrant
dictate that they knock and announce," id., at 863, 549 N. W.2d, at 225, the court concluded that exigent circumstances
justifying a no-knock entry are always present in felony drugcases. Further, the court reasoned that the violation of privacy that occurs when officers who have a search warrantforcibly enter a residence without first announcing their
presence is minimal, given that the residents would ulti-mately be without authority to refuse the police entry. The
principal intrusion on individual privacy interests in such asituation, the court concluded, comes from the issuance of the
search warrant, not the manner in which it is executed. Id.,at 864-865, 549 N. W. 2d, at 226. Accordingly, the court determined that police in Wisconsin do not need specific infor-mation about dangerousness, or the possible destruction of
drugs in a particular case, in order to dispense with theknock-and-announce requirement in felony drug cases.

1

1 Several other state courts--in cases that predate our decision in Wilson--have adopted similar rules, concluding that simple probable cause to
search a home for narcotics always allows the police to forgo the knockand-announce requirement. See, e. g., People v. Lujan, 484 P. 2d 1238,
1241 (Colo. 1971) (en banc); Henson v. State, 236 Md. 519, 523-524, 204 A.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Abrahamson concurred in the judgment because,in her view, the facts found by the trial judge justified a

no-knock entry. Id., at 866-868, 549 N. W. 2d, at 227. Spe-cifically, she noted that Richards' actions in slamming the
door when he saw the uniformed man standing behind Offi-cer Pharo indicated that he already knew that the people
knocking on his door were police officers. Under these cir-cumstances, any further announcement of their presence
would have been a useless gesture. Id., at 868-869, n. 3, 549N. W. 2d, at 228, n. 3. While agreeing with the outcome,
Justice Abrahamson took issue with her colleagues' affirma-tion of the blanket exception to the knock-and-announce requirement in drug felony cases. She observed that the con-stitutional reasonableness of a search has generally been a
matter left to the court, rather than to the officers who con-ducted the search, and she objected to the creation of a blanket rule that insulated searches in a particular category ofcrime from the neutral oversight of a reviewing judge. Id.,
at 868-875, 549 N. W. 2d, at 228-230.

II
We recognized in Wilson that the knock-and-announce re-quirement could give way "under circumstances presenting

a threat of physical violence," or "where police officers havereason to believe that evidence would likely be destroyed if
advance notice were given." 514 U. S., at 936. It is indis-putable that felony drug investigations may frequently involve both of these circumstances.2 The question we must

(1965) (similar rule for searches related to gambling operations), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 963 (1966).

2 This Court has encountered before the links between drugs and violence, see, e. g., Michigan v. Summers, 452 U. S. 692, 702 (1981), and the
likelihood that drug dealers will attempt to dispose of drugs before police
seize them, see, e. g., Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 28, n. 3 (1963).

392 RICHARDS v. WISCONSIN

Opinion of the Court
resolve is whether this fact justifies dispensing with caseby-case evaluation of the manner in which a search was
executed.3

The Wisconsin court explained its blanket exception as necessitated by the special circumstances of today's drug culture, 201 Wis. 2d, at 863-866, 549 N. W. 2d, at 226-227, and
the State asserted at oral argument that the blanket exception was reasonable in "felony drug cases because of the convergence in a violent and dangerous form of commerce of
weapons and the destruction of drugs." Tr. of Oral Arg.
26. But creating exceptions to the knock-and-announce rule
based on the "culture" surrounding a general category of
criminal behavior presents at least two serious concerns.4

3 Although our decision in Wilson did not address this issue directly, it
is instructive that in that case--which involved a felony drug investigation--we remanded to the state court for further factual development to
determine whether the no-knock entry was reasonable under the circumstances of the case. Two amicus briefs in Wilson suggested that we
adopt just the sort of per se rule the Wisconsin court propounded here.
Brief for Americans for Effective Law Enforcement, Inc., et al. as Amici
Curiae 10-11, Brief for Wayne County, Michigan, as Amicus Curiae 39-
46, in Wilson v. Arkansas, O. T. 1994, No. 5707. Although the respondent
did not argue for a categorical rule, the petitioner, in her reply brief, did
address the arguments put forward by the amicus briefs, Reply Brief for
Petitioner in Wilson v. Arkansas, O. T. 1994, No. 5707, p. 11, and amici
supporting the petitioner also presented arguments against a categorical
rule. Brief for American Civil Liberties Union et al. as Amici Curiae in
Wilson v. Arkansas, O. T. 1994, No. 5707, p. 29, n. 44. Thus, while the
prospect of a categorical rule was one to which we were alerted in Wilson,
we did not choose to adopt such a rule at that time.

4 It is always somewhat dangerous to ground exceptions to constitutional

protections in the social norms of a given historical moment. The purpose
of the Fourth Amendment's requirement of reasonableness "is to preserve
that degree of respect for the privacy of persons and the inviolability of
their property that existed when the provision was adopted--even if a
later, less virtuous age should become accustomed to considering all sorts
of intrusion `reasonable.' " Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U. S. 366, 380
(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring).

393Cite as: 520 U. S. 385 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
First, the exception contains considerable overgeneraliza-tion. For example, while drug investigation frequently does

pose special risks to officer safety and the preservation ofevidence, not every drug investigation will pose these risks
to a substantial degree. For example, a search could be con-ducted at a time when the only individuals present in a residence have no connection with the drug activity and thuswill be unlikely to threaten officers or destroy evidence. Or
the police could know that the drugs being searched for wereof a type or in a location that made them impossible to destroy quickly. In those situations, the asserted governmen-tal interests in preserving evidence and maintaining safety
may not outweigh the individual privacy interests intrudedupon by a no-knock entry.

5 Wisconsin's blanket rule impermissibly insulates these cases from judicial review.A second difficulty with permitting a criminal-category exception to the knock-and-announce requirement is that the

5 The State asserts that the intrusion on individual interests effectuated
by a no-knock entry is minimal because the execution of the warrant itself
constitutes the primary intrusion on individual privacy and that the individual privacy interest cannot outweigh the generalized governmental interest in effective and safe law enforcement. Brief for Respondent 21-24.
See also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16 ("occupants' privacy
interest is necessarily limited to the brief interval between the officers'
announcement and their entry"). While it is true that a no-knock entry
is less intrusive than, for example, a warrantless search, the individual
interests implicated by an unannounced, forcible entry should not be unduly minimized. As we observed in Wilson v. Arkansas, 514 U. S. 927,
930-932 (1995), the common law recognized that individuals should be
provided the opportunity to comply with the law and to avoid the destruction of property occasioned by a forcible entry. These interests are not
inconsequential.

Additionally, when police enter a residence without announcing their
presence, the residents are not given any opportunity to prepare themselves for such an entry. The State pointed out at oral argument that, in
Wisconsin, most search warrants are executed during the late night and
early morning hours. Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. The brief interlude between
announcement and entry with a warrant may be the opportunity that an
individual has to pull on clothes or get out of bed.

520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
394 RICHARDS v. WISCONSIN

Opinion of the Court
reasons for creating an exception in one category can,relatively easily, be applied to others. Armed bank robbers,

for example, are, by definition, likely to have weapons, andthe fruits of their crime may be destroyed without too much
difficulty. If a per se exception were allowed for each
category of criminal investigation that included a consider-able--albeit hypothetical--risk of danger to officers or destruction of evidence, the knock-and-announce element of theFourth Amendment's reasonableness requirement would be
meaningless.Thus, the fact that felony drug investigations may frequently present circumstances warranting a no-knock entry
cannot remove from the neutral scrutiny of a reviewing court
the reasonableness of the police decision not to knock and
announce in a particular case. Instead, in each case, it is
the duty of a court confronted with the question to determine whether the facts and circumstances of the particular
entry justified dispensing with the knock-and-announce
requirement.

In order to justify a "no-knock" entry, the police must have
a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their
presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction
of evidence. This standard--as opposed to a probable-cause
requirement--strikes the appropriate balance between the
legitimate law enforcement concerns at issue in the execution of search warrants and the individual privacy interests
affected by no-knock entries. Cf. Maryland v. Buie, 494
U. S. 325, 337 (1990) (allowing a protective sweep of a house
during an arrest where the officers have "a reasonable belief
based on specific and articulable facts that the area to be
swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the
arrest scene"); Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 30 (1968) (requiring
a reasonable and articulable suspicion of danger to justify a
patdown search). This showing is not high, but the police

395Cite as: 520 U. S. 385 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
should be required to make it whenever the reasonablenessof a no-knock entry is challenged.

III
Although we reject the Wisconsin court's blanket excep-tion to the knock-and-announce requirement, we conclude

that the officers' no-knock entry into Richards' motel roomdid not violate the Fourth Amendment. We agree with the
trial court, and with Justice Abrahamson, that the circum-stances in this case show that the officers had a reasonable
suspicion that Richards might destroy evidence if given fur-ther opportunity to do so.

6

The judge who heard testimony at Richards' suppressionhearing concluded that it was reasonable for the officers executing the warrant to believe that Richards knew, after open-ing the door to his motel room the first time, that the men
seeking entry to his room were the police. App. 54. Oncethe officers reasonably believed that Richards knew who
they were, the court concluded, it was reasonable for themto force entry immediately given the disposable nature of the
drugs. Id., at 55.In arguing that the officers' entry was unreasonable, Richards places great emphasis on the fact that the Magistrate whosigned the search warrant for his motel room deleted the
portions of the proposed warrant that would have given theofficers permission to execute a no-knock entry. But this
fact does not alter the reasonableness of the officers' deci-sion, which must be evaluated as of the time they entered
the motel room. At the time the officers obtained the war-rant, they did not have evidence sufficient, in the judgment
of the Magistrate, to justify a no-knock warrant. Of course,

6 We note that the attorneys general of 26 States, the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico, and the Territory of Guam filed an amicus brief taking the
position that the officers' decision was reasonable under the specific facts
of this case, but rejecting Wisconsin's per se rule. See Brief for Ohio et
al. as Amici Curiae.

520US2 Unit: $U46 [09-10-99 18:36:58] PAGES PGT: OPIN
396 RICHARDS v. WISCONSIN

Opinion of the Court
the Magistrate could not have anticipated in every particu-lar the circumstances that would confront the officers when

they arrived at Richards' motel room.7 These actual cir-cumstances--petitioner's apparent recognition of the officers
combined with the easily disposable nature of the drugs--justified the officers' ultimate decision to enter without first
announcing their presence and authority.Accordingly, although we reject the blanket exception to
the knock-and-announce requirement for felony drug investi-gations, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is
affirmed.

It is so ordered.

7 A number of States give magistrate judges the authority to issue "noknock" warrants if the officers demonstrate ahead of time a reasonable
suspicion that entry without prior announcement will be appropriate in a
particular context. See, e. g., 725 Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, $ 5/108-8 (1992);
Neb. Rev. Stat. $ 29-411 (1995); Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, $ 1228 (Supp. 1997);
S. D. Codified Laws $ 23A-35-9 (1988); Utah Code Ann. $ 77-23-210 (1995).
But see State v. Arce, 83 Ore. App. 185, 730 P. 2d 1260 (1986) (magistrate
has no authority to abrogate knock-and-announce requirement); State v.
Bamber, 630 So. 2d 1048 (Fla. 1994) (same).

The practice of allowing magistrates to issue no-knock warrants seems
entirely reasonable when sufficient cause to do so can be demonstrated
ahead of time. But, as the facts of this case demonstrate, a magistrate's
decision not to authorize a no-knock entry should not be interpreted to
remove the officers' authority to exercise independent judgment concerning the wisdom of a no-knock entry at the time the warrant is being
executed.

BOARD OF THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS OFBRYAN COUNTY, OKLAHOMA

v. BROWN et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 95-1100. Argued November 5, 1996--Decided April 28, 1997
Jill Brown (hereinafter respondent) brought this 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 damages action against petitioner county, alleging, among other things, that
its Deputy Burns had arrested her with excessive force, and that it was
liable for her injuries because its Sheriff Moore had hired Burns without
adequately reviewing his background. Burns had pleaded guilty to
various driving infractions and other misdemeanors, including assault
and battery. Moore, whom the county stipulated was its Sheriff's Department policymaker, testified that he had obtained Burns' driving and
criminal records, but had not closely reviewed either before hiring
Burns. The District Court denied the county's motions for judgment
as a matter of law, which asserted that a policymaker's single hiring
decision could not give rise to $ 1983 municipal liability. Respondent
prevailed following a jury trial, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, holding
that the county was properly found liable based on Moore's decision to
hire Burns.

Held: The county is not liable for Sheriff Moore's isolated decision to hire

Burns without adequate screening, because respondent has not demonstrated that the decision reflected a conscious disregard for a high risk
that Burns would use excessive force in violation of respondent's federally protected right. Pp. 402-416.

(a) A municipality may not be held liable under $ 1983 solely because
it employs a tortfeasor, see, e. g., Monell v. New York City Dept. of
Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 692. Instead, the plaintiff must identify a
municipal "policy" or "custom" that caused the injury. See, e. g., Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469, 480-481. Contrary to respondent's
contention, a "policy" giving rise to liability cannot be established
merely by identifying a policymaker's conduct that is properly attributable to the municipality. The plaintiff must also demonstrate that,
through its deliberate conduct, the municipality was the "moving force"
behind the injury alleged. See Monell, supra, at 694. That is, a plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite
degree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between
the municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights. Pp. 402-404.

Syllabus
(b) Respondent's claim that a policymaker's single facially lawful hiring decision can trigger municipal liability presents difficult problems of
proof. This Court has recognized a $ 1983 cause of action based on a
single decision attributable to a municipality only where the evidence
that the municipality had acted and that the plaintiff had suffered a
deprivation of federal rights also proved fault and causation. See, e. g.,
Pembaur, supra, at 481. In relying heavily on Pembaur, respondent
blurs the distinction between $ 1983 cases that present no difficult fault
and causation questions and those that do. Claims such as the present,
which do not involve an allegation that the municipal action itself violated federal law or directed or authorized the deprivation of federal
rights, require application of rigorous culpability and causation standards in order to ensure that the municipality is not held liable solely for
its employees' actions. In Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, for example,
the Court held that a plaintiff seeking to establish municipal liability on
the theory that a facially lawful municipal action--there, an allegedly
inadequate training program--has led an employee to violate a plaintiff's rights must demonstrate that the municipal action was not simply
negligent, but was taken with "deliberate indifference" as to its known
or obvious consequences. Id., at 388. Respondent's reliance on Canton for an analogy between failure-to-train cases and inadequate screening cases is not persuasive. In leaving open the possibility that municipal liability could be triggered by evidence of a single violation of
federal rights, accompanied by a showing that the municipality has
failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting
an obvious potential for such a violation, id., at 390, and n. 10, the Canton Court simply hypothesized that, in this narrow range of circumstances, the violation may be a highly predictable consequence of the
failure to train and thereby justify a finding of "deliberate indifference"
by policymakers. Predicting the consequence of a single hiring decision, even one based on an inadequate assessment of a record, is far
more difficult. Only where adequate scrutiny of the applicant's background would lead a reasonable policymaker to conclude that the plainly
obvious consequence of the decision to hire the applicant would be the
deprivation of a third party's federally protected right can the official's
failure to adequately scrutinize the applicant's background constitute
"deliberate indifference." Neither the District Court nor the Court of
Appeals directly tested whether Burns' background made his use of
excessive force in making an arrest a plainly obvious consequence of

the hiring decision. Pp. 404-412.

(c) Even assuming without deciding that proof of a single instance of
inadequate screening could ever trigger municipal liability, Moore's failure to scrutinize Burns' record cannot constitute "deliberate indiffer520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ence" to respondent's federally protected right to be free from the use
of excessive force. To test the link between Moore's action and respondent's injury, it must be asked whether a full review of Burns' record reveals that Moore should have concluded that Burns' use of excessive force would be a plainly obvious consequence of his decision to hire
Burns. Respondent's showing on this point was inadequate because the
primary infractions on which she relies to prove Burns' propensity for
violence arose from a single college fight. A full review of Burns' record might well have led Moore to conclude that Burns was an extremely
poor deputy candidate, but he would not necessarily have reached that
decision because Burns' use of excessive force would have been a plainly
obvious consequence of the decision to hire him. The District Court
therefore erred in submitting the inadequate screening theory to the
jury. Pp. 412-415.

excessive force in arresting her, and that the county itselfwas liable for her injuries based on its sheriff 's hiring and

the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment against the countyon the basis of the hiring claim alone. 67 F. 3d 1174 (1995).
We granted certiorari. We conclude that the Court of Ap-peals' decision cannot be squared with our recognition that,

deprivation of federal rights. Monell v. New York City

I
In the early morning hours of May 12, 1991, Jill Brown(hereinafter respondent) and her husband were driving from

Grayson County, Texas, to their home in Bryan County, Okla-homa. After crossing into Oklahoma, they approached a
police checkpoint. Mr. Brown, who was driving, decided toavoid the checkpoint and return to Texas. After seeing the
Browns' truck turn away from the checkpoint, Bryan CountyDeputy Sheriff Robert Morrison and Reserve Deputy Stacy
Burns pursued the vehicle. Although the parties' versionsof events differ, at trial both deputies claimed that their

patrol car reached speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour.Mr. Brown testified that he was unaware of the deputies'
attempts to overtake him. The chase finally ended fourmiles south of the police checkpoint.

After he got out of the squad car, Deputy Sheriff Morrisonpointed his gun toward the Browns' vehicle and ordered the
Browns to raise their hands. Reserve Deputy Burns, whowas unarmed, rounded the corner of the vehicle on the passenger's side. Burns twice ordered respondent from the ve-hicle. When she did not exit, he used an "arm bar" technique, grabbing respondent's arm at the wrist and elbow,

Opinion of the Court
pulling her from the vehicle, and spinning her to the ground.Respondent's knees were severely injured, and she later

underwent corrective surgery. Ultimately, she may needknee replacements.

Respondent sought compensation for her injuries under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 and state law from Burns, Bryan County Sher-iff B. J. Moore, and the county itself. Respondent claimed,

among other things, that Bryan County was liable for Burns'alleged use of excessive force based on Sheriff Moore's decision to hire Burns, the son of his nephew. Specifically, re-spondent claimed that Sheriff Moore had failed to adequately
review Burns' background. Burns had a record of driving
infractions and had pleaded guilty to various driving-related
and other misdemeanors, including assault and battery, resisting arrest, and public drunkenness. Oklahoma law does
not preclude the hiring of an individual who has committed
a misdemeanor to serve as a peace officer. See Okla. Stat.,
Tit. 70, $ 3311(D)(2)(a) (1991) (requiring that the hiring
agency certify that the prospective officer's records do not
reflect a felony conviction). At trial, Sheriff Moore testified
that he had obtained Burns' driving record and a report
on Burns from the National Crime Information Center, but
had not closely reviewed either. Sheriff Moore authorized
Burns to make arrests, but not to carry a weapon or to operate a patrol car.

In a ruling not at issue here, the District Court dismissed
respondent's $ 1983 claim against Sheriff Moore prior to trial.
App. 28. Counsel for Bryan County stipulated that Sheriff
Moore "was the policy maker for Bryan County regarding
the Sheriff 's Department." Id., at 30. At the close of respondent's case and again at the close of all of the evidence,
Bryan County moved for judgment as a matter of law. As
to respondent's claim that Sheriff Moore's decision to hire
Burns triggered municipal liability, the county argued that a
single hiring decision by a municipal policymaker could not
give rise to municipal liability under $ 1983. Id., at 59-60.

Opinion of the Court
The District Court denied the county's motions. The court
also overruled the county's objections to jury instructions on
the $ 1983 claim against the county. Id., at 125-126, 132.

To resolve respondent's claims, the jury was asked to
answer several interrogatories. The jury concluded that
Stacy Burns had arrested respondent without probable cause
and had used excessive force, and therefore found him liable
for respondent's injuries. It also found that the "hiring policy" and the "training policy" of Bryan County "in the case
of Stacy Burns as instituted by its policymaker, B. J. Moore,"
were each "so inadequate as to amount to deliberate indifference to the constitutional needs of the Plaintiff." Id., at 135.
The District Court entered judgment for respondent on the
issue of Bryan County's $ 1983 liability. The county appealed on several grounds, and the Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit affirmed. 67 F. 3d 1174 (1995). The court
held, among other things, that Bryan County was properly
found liable under $ 1983 based on Sheriff Moore's decision
to hire Burns. Id., at 1185. The court addressed only those
points that it thought merited review; it did not address the
jury's determination of county liability based on inadequate
training of Burns, id., at 1178, nor do we. We granted certiorari, 517 U. S. 1154 (1996), to decide whether the county
was properly held liable for respondent's injuries based on
Sheriff Moore's single decision to hire Burns. We now
reverse.

Title 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 provides in relevant part:

"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to
be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other
person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation
of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the
Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party in520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
jured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other properproceeding for redress."

We held in Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,436 U. S., at 689, that municipalities and other local governmental bodies are "persons" within the meaning of $ 1983.We also recognized that a municipality may not be held liable
under $ 1983 solely because it employs a tortfeasor. Ourconclusion rested partly on the language of $ 1983 itself. In
light of the statute's imposition of liability on one who "sub-jects [a person], or causes [that person] to be subjected," to
a deprivation of federal rights, we concluded that it "cannotbe easily read to impose liability vicariously on governing
bodies solely on the basis of the existence of an employer-employee relationship with a tortfeasor."

Id., at 692. Ourconclusion also rested upon the statute's legislative history.

As stated in Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469, 479(1986), "while Congress never questioned its power to impose civil liability on municipalities for their own illegal acts,Congress did doubt its constitutional power to impose such
liability in order to oblige municipalities to control the con-duct of

others" (citing Monell, supra, at 665-683). We haveconsistently refused to hold municipalities liable under a theory of respondeat superior. See Oklahoma City v. Tuttle,471 U. S. 808, 818 (1985) (plurality opinion);

id., at 828 (opin-ion of Brennan, J.); Pembaur, supra, at 478-479; St. Louis v.

Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112, 122 (1988) (plurality opinion); id.,at 137 (opinion of Brennan, J.); Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S.
378, 392 (1989).Instead, in Monell and subsequent cases, we have required
a plaintiff seeking to impose liability on a municipality under$ 1983 to identify a municipal "policy" or "custom" that
caused the plaintiff 's injury. See Monell, supra, at 694;
Pembaur, supra, at 480-481; Canton, supra, at 389. Locat-ing a "policy" ensures that a municipality is held liable only

for those deprivations resulting from the decisions of its dulyconstituted legislative body or of those officials whose acts

Opinion of the Court
may fairly be said to be those of the municipality. Monell,
supra, at 694. Similarly, an act performed pursuant to a
"custom" that has not been formally approved by an appro-priate decisionmaker may fairly subject a municipality to liability on the theory that the relevant practice is so widespread as to have the force of law. 436 U. S., at 690-691(citing

Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 167-168
(1970)).The parties join issue on whether, under

Monell and subsequent cases, a single hiring decision by a county sheriffcan be a "policy" that triggers municipal liability. Relying

on our decision in Pembaur, respondent claims that a single
act by a decisionmaker with final authority in the relevant
area constitutes a "policy" attributable to the municipality
itself. So long as a $ 1983 plaintiff identifies a decision properly attributable to the municipality, respondent argues,
there is no risk of imposing respondeat superior liability.
Whether that decision was intended to govern only the situation at hand or to serve as a rule to be applied over time is
immaterial. Rather, under respondent's theory, identification of an act of a proper municipal decisionmaker is all that
is required to ensure that the municipality is held liable only
for its own conduct. The Court of Appeals accepted respondent's approach.

As our $ 1983 municipal liability jurisprudence illustrates,
however, it is not enough for a $ 1983 plaintiff merely to identify conduct properly attributable to the municipality. The
plaintiff must also demonstrate that, through its deliberate
conduct, the municipality was the "moving force" behind the
injury alleged. That is, a plaintiff must show that the municipal action was taken with the requisite degree of culpability and must demonstrate a direct causal link between the
municipal action and the deprivation of federal rights.

Where a plaintiff claims that a particular municipal action
itself violates federal law, or directs an employee to do so,
resolving these issues of fault and causation is straightfor520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ward. Section 1983 itself "contains no state-of-mind re-quirement independent of that necessary to state a violation"

of the underlying federal right. Daniels v. Williams, 474U. S. 327, 330 (1986). In any $ 1983 suit, however, the plaintiff must establish the state of mind required to prove the
underlying violation. Accordingly, proof that a municipali-ty's legislative body or authorized decisionmaker has intentionally deprived a plaintiff of a federally protected rightnecessarily establishes that the municipality acted culpably.
Similarly, the conclusion that the action taken or directed bythe municipality or its authorized decisionmaker itself violates federal law will also determine that the municipal action was the moving force behind the injury of which the
plaintiff complains.

Sheriff Moore's hiring decision was itself legal, and Sheriff
Moore did not authorize Burns to use excessive force. Respondent's claim, rather, is that a single facially lawful hiring
decision can launch a series of events that ultimately cause
a violation of federal rights. Where a plaintiff claims that
the municipality has not directly inflicted an injury, but nonetheless has caused an employee to do so, rigorous standards
of culpability and causation must be applied to ensure that
the municipality is not held liable solely for the actions of its
employee. See Canton, supra, at 391-392; Tuttle, supra, at
824 (plurality opinion). See also Springfield v. Kibbe, 480
U. S. 257, 270-271 (1987) (per curiam) (dissent from dismissal of writ as improvidently granted).

In relying heavily on Pembaur, respondent blurs the distinction between $ 1983 cases that present no difficult questions of fault and causation and those that do. To the extent
that we have recognized a cause of action under $ 1983 based
on a single decision attributable to a municipality, we have
done so only where the evidence that the municipality had
acted and that the plaintiff had suffered a deprivation of federal rights also proved fault and causation. For example,
Owen v. Independence, 445 U. S. 622 (1980), and Newport v.

520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
406 BOARD OF COMM'RS OF BRYAN CTY. v. BROWN

Opinion of the Court
Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247 (1981), involved formal de-cisions of municipal legislative bodies. In

Owen, the city
council allegedly censured and discharged an employee with-out a hearing. 445 U. S., at 627-629, 633, and n. 13. In

Fact
Concerts, the city council canceled a license permitting a concert following a dispute over the performance's content.453 U. S., at 252. Neither decision reflected implementation

of a generally applicable rule. But we did not question thateach decision, duly promulgated by city lawmakers, could
trigger municipal liability if the decision itself were found tobe unconstitutional. Because fault and causation were obvious in each case, proof that the municipality's decision was
unconstitutional would suffice to establish that the municipality itself was liable for the plaintiff 's constitutional injury.

Similarly, Pembaur v. Cincinnati concerned a decision by
a county prosecutor, acting as the county's final decisionmaker, 475 U. S., at 485, to direct county deputies to forcibly
enter petitioner's place of business to serve capiases upon
third parties. Relying on Owen and Newport, we concluded
that a final decisionmaker's adoption of a course of action
"tailored to a particular situation and not intended to control
decisions in later situations" may, in some circumstances,
give rise to municipal liability under $ 1983. 475 U. S., at
481. In Pembaur, it was not disputed that the prosecutor
had specifically directed the action resulting in the deprivation of petitioner's rights. The conclusion that the decision
was that of a final municipal decisionmaker and was therefore properly attributable to the municipality established
municipal liability. No questions of fault or causation arose.

Claims not involving an allegation that the municipal action itself violated federal law, or directed or authorized the
deprivation of federal rights, present much more difficult
problems of proof. That a plaintiff has suffered a deprivation of federal rights at the hands of a municipal employee
will not alone permit an inference of municipal culpability
and causation; the plaintiff will simply have shown that the

520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

407Cite as: 520 U. S. 397 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
employee acted culpably. We recognized these difficulties in
Canton v. Harris, where we considered a claim that inadequate training of shift supervisors at a city jail led to a depri-vation of a detainee's constitutional rights. We held that,

quite apart from the state of mind required to establish the
underlying constitutional violation--in that case, a violationof due process, 489 U. S., at 388-389, n. 8--a plaintiff seeking

to establish municipal liability on the theory that a faciallylawful municipal action has led an employee to violate a
plaintiff 's rights must demonstrate that the municipal actionwas taken with "deliberate indifference" as to its known or
obvious consequences. Id., at 388. A showing of simple or
even heightened negligence will not suffice.

We concluded in Canton that an "inadequate training"
claim could be the basis for $ 1983 liability in "limited circumstances." Id., at 387. We spoke, however, of a deficient
training "program," necessarily intended to apply over time
to multiple employees. Id., at 390. Existence of a "program" makes proof of fault and causation at least possible
in an inadequate training case. If a program does not prevent constitutional violations, municipal decisionmakers may
eventually be put on notice that a new program is called for.
Their continued adherence to an approach that they know or
should know has failed to prevent tortious conduct by employees may establish the conscious disregard for the consequences of their action--the "deliberate indifference"--necessary to trigger municipal liability. Id., at 390, n. 10 ("It
could . . . be that the police, in exercising their discretion, so
often violate constitutional rights that the need for further
training must have been plainly obvious to the city policymakers, who, nevertheless, are `deliberately indifferent' to
the need"); id., at 397 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and
dissenting in part) ("[M]unicipal liability for failure to train
may be proper where it can be shown that policymakers
were aware of, and acquiesced in, a pattern of constitutional
violations . . ."). In addition, the existence of a pattern of

520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN
408 BOARD OF COMM'RS OF BRYAN CTY. v. BROWN

Opinion of the Court
tortious conduct by inadequately trained employees maytend to show that the lack of proper training, rather than a

one-time negligent administration of the program or factorspeculiar to the officer involved in a particular incident, is the
"moving force" behind the plaintiff 's injury. See id., at
390-391.Before trial, counsel for Bryan County stipulated that

Sheriff Moore "was the policy maker for Bryan County re-garding the Sheriff 's Department." App. 30. Indeed, the
county sought to avoid liability by claiming that its Board ofCommissioners participated in no policy decisions regarding
the conduct and operation of the office of the Bryan County
Sheriff. Id., at 32. Accepting the county's representations
below, then, this case presents no difficult questions concerning whether Sheriff Moore has final authority to act for the
municipality in hiring matters. Cf. Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491 U. S. 701 (1989); St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112 (1988). Respondent does not claim that
she can identify any pattern of injuries linked to Sheriff
Moore's hiring practices. Indeed, respondent does not contend that Sheriff Moore's hiring practices are generally defective. The only evidence on this point at trial suggested
that Sheriff Moore had adequately screened the backgrounds
of all prior deputies he hired. App. 106-110. Respondent
instead seeks to trace liability to what can only be described
as a deviation from Sheriff Moore's ordinary hiring practices.
Where a claim of municipal liability rests on a single decision,
not itself representing a violation of federal law and not directing such a violation, the danger that a municipality will
be held liable without fault is high. Because the decision
necessarily governs a single case, there can be no notice to
the municipal decisionmaker, based on previous violations of
federally protected rights, that his approach is inadequate.
Nor will it be readily apparent that the municipality's action
caused the injury in question, because the plaintiff can point
to no other incident tending to make it more likely that the

520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

409Cite as: 520 U. S. 397 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
plaintiff 's own injury flows from the municipality's action,rather than from some other intervening cause.

In Canton, we did not foreclose the possibility that evi-dence of a single violation of federal rights, accompanied by
a showing that a municipality has failed to train its employees to handle recurring situations presenting an obvious po-tential for such a violation, could trigger municipal liability.

489 U. S., at 390, and n. 10 ("[I]t may happen that in light ofthe duties assigned to specific officers or employees the need
for more or different training is so obvious . . . that the poli-cymakers of the city can reasonably be said to have been
deliberately indifferent to the need"). Respondent purports
to rely on Canton, arguing that Burns' use of excessive force
was the plainly obvious consequence of Sheriff Moore's failure to screen Burns' record. In essence, respondent claims
that this showing of "obviousness" would demonstrate both
that Sheriff Moore acted with conscious disregard for the
consequences of his action and that the Sheriff 's action directly caused her injuries, and would thus substitute for the
pattern of injuries ordinarily necessary to establish municipal culpability and causation.

The proffered analogy between failure-to-train cases and
inadequate screening cases is not persuasive. In leaving
open in Canton the possibility that a plaintiff might succeed
in carrying a failure-to-train claim without showing a pattern
of constitutional violations, we simply hypothesized that, in
a narrow range of circumstances, a violation of federal rights
may be a highly predictable consequence of a failure to equip
law enforcement officers with specific tools to handle recurring situations. The likelihood that the situation will recur
and the predictability that an officer lacking specific tools to
handle that situation will violate citizens' rights could justify
a finding that policymakers' decision not to train the officer
reflected "deliberate indifference" to the obvious consequence of the policymakers' choice--namely, a violation of a
specific constitutional or statutory right. The high degree

410 BOARD OF COMM'RS OF BRYAN CTY. v. BROWN

Opinion of the Court
of predictability may also support an inference of causation--that the municipality's indifference led directly to the very

consequence that was so predictable.Where a plaintiff presents a $ 1983 claim premised upon
the inadequacy of an official's review of a prospective applicant's record, however, there is a particular danger that amunicipality will be held liable for an injury not directly

caused by a deliberate action attributable to the municipalityitself. Every injury suffered at the hands of a municipal employee can be traced to a hiring decision in a "but-for" sense:But for the municipality's decision to hire the employee, the
plaintiff would not have suffered the injury. To prevent municipal liability for a hiring decision from collapsing into respondeat superior liability, a court must carefully test the
link between the policymaker's inadequate decision and the
particular injury alleged.

In attempting to import the reasoning of Canton into the
hiring context, respondent ignores the fact that predicting
the consequence of a single hiring decision, even one based
on an inadequate assessment of a record, is far more difficult
than predicting what might flow from the failure to train a
single law enforcement officer as to a specific skill necessary
to the discharge of his duties. As our decision in Canton
makes clear, "deliberate indifference" is a stringent standard
of fault, requiring proof that a municipal actor disregarded a
known or obvious consequence of his action. Unlike the risk
from a particular glaring omission in a training regimen, the
risk from a single instance of inadequate screening of an applicant's background is not "obvious" in the abstract; rather,
it depends upon the background of the applicant. A lack of
scrutiny may increase the likelihood that an unfit officer will
be hired, and that the unfit officer will, when placed in a
particular position to affect the rights of citizens, act improperly. But that is only a generalized showing of risk. The
fact that inadequate scrutiny of an applicant's background
would make a violation of rights more likely cannot alone

Opinion of the Court
give rise to an inference that a policymaker's failure to scru-tinize the record of a particular applicant produced a specific

constitutional violation. After all, a full screening of an ap-plicant's background might reveal no cause for concern at all;
if so, a hiring official who failed to scrutinize the applicant's
background cannot be said to have consciously disregardedan obvious risk that the officer would subsequently inflict a

particular constitutional injury.We assume that a jury could properly find in this case that
Sheriff Moore's assessment of Burns' background was inade-quate. Sheriff Moore's own testimony indicated that he did
not inquire into the underlying conduct or the disposition of
any of the misdemeanor charges reflected on Burns' record
before hiring him. But this showing of an instance of inadequate screening is not enough to establish "deliberate indifference." In layman's terms, inadequate screening of an applicant's record may reflect "indifference" to the applicant's
background. For purposes of a legal inquiry into municipal
liability under $ 1983, however, that is not the relevant "indifference." A plaintiff must demonstrate that a municipal
decision reflects deliberate indifference to the risk that a violation of a particular constitutional or statutory right will
follow the decision. Only where adequate scrutiny of an applicant's background would lead a reasonable policymaker to
conclude that the plainly obvious consequence of the decision
to hire the applicant would be the deprivation of a third party's federally protected right can the official's failure to adequately scrutinize the applicant's background constitute "deliberate indifference."

Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals directly tested the link between Burns' actual background and
the risk that, if hired, he would use excessive force. The
District Court instructed the jury on a theory analogous to
that reserved in Canton. The court required respondent to
prove that Sheriff Moore's inadequate screening of Burns'
background was "so likely to result in violations of constitu520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
tional rights" that the Sheriff could "reasonably [be] said
to have been deliberately indifferent to the constitutional
needs of the Plaintiff." App. 123 (emphasis added). The
court also instructed the jury, without elaboration, that respondent was required to prove that the "inadequate hiring
. . . policy directly caused the Plaintiff 's injury." Ibid.

As discussed above, a finding of culpability simply cannot
depend on the mere probability that any officer inadequately
screened will inflict any constitutional injury. Rather, it
must depend on a finding that this officer was highly likely
to inflict the particular injury suffered by the plaintiff. The
connection between the background of the particular applicant and the specific constitutional violation alleged must be
strong. What the District Court's instructions on culpability, and therefore the jury's finding of municipal liability,
failed to capture is whether Burns' background made his use
of excessive force in making an arrest a plainly obvious consequence of the hiring decision. The Court of Appeals' affirmance of the jury's finding of municipal liability depended
on its view that the jury could have found that "inadequate
screening of a deputy could likely result in the violation of
citizens' constitutional rights." 67 F. 3d, at 1185 (emphasis
added). Beyond relying on a risk of violations of unspecified
constitutional rights, the Court of Appeals also posited that
Sheriff Moore's decision reflected indifference to "the public's welfare." Id., at 1184.

Even assuming without deciding that proof of a single instance of inadequate screening could ever trigger municipal
liability, the evidence in this case was insufficient to support
a finding that, in hiring Burns, Sheriff Moore disregarded a
known or obvious risk of injury. To test the link between
Sheriff Moore's hiring decision and respondent's injury, we
must ask whether a full review of Burns' record reveals that
Sheriff Moore should have concluded that Burns' use of excessive force would be a plainly obvious consequence of the

Opinion of the Court
hiring decision.1 On this point, respondent's showing wasinadequate. To be sure, Burns' record reflected various

misdemeanor infractions. Respondent claims that the rec-ord demonstrated such a strong propensity for violence that
Burns' application of excessive force was highly likely. Theprimary charges on which respondent relies, however, are
those arising from a fight on a college campus where Burnswas a student. In connection with this single incident,
Burns was charged with assault and battery, resisting arrest,and public drunkenness.

1 In suggesting that our decision complicates this Court's $ 1983 municipal liability jurisprudence by altering the understanding of culpability,
Justice Souter and Justice Breyer misunderstand our approach.
Post, at 422; post, at 430, 433-434. We do not suggest that a plaintiff in
an inadequate screening case must show a higher degree of culpability
than the "deliberate indifference" required in Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S.
378 (1989); we need not do so, because, as discussed below, respondent has
not made a showing of deliberate indifference here. See infra this page
and 414. Furthermore, in assessing the risks of a decision to hire a particular individual, we draw no distinction between what is "so obvious" or
"so likely to occur" and what is "plainly obvious." The difficulty with the
lower courts' approach is that it fails to connect the background of the
particular officer hired in this case to the particular constitutional violation
the respondent suffered. Supra, at 412. Ensuring that lower courts link
the background of the officer to the constitutional violation alleged does
not complicate our municipal liability jurisprudence with degrees of "obviousness," but seeks to ensure that a plaintiff in an inadequate screening
case establishes a policymaker's deliberate indifference--that is, conscious
disregard for the known and obvious consequences of his actions.

2 Justice Souter implies that Burns' record reflected assault and battery charges arising from more than one incident. Post, at 428. There
has never been a serious dispute that a single misdemeanor assault and
battery conviction arose out of a single campus fight. Nor did petitioner's
expert testify that the record reflected any assault charge without a disposition, see 9 Record 535-536, although Justice Souter appears to suggest otherwise, post, at 428-429, n. 6.

In fact, respondent's own expert witness testified that Burns' record
reflected a single assault conviction. 7 Record 318; see also id., at 320.
Petitioner has repeatedly so claimed. See, e. g., Suggestion for Rehearing
En Banc in No. 93-5376 (CA5), p. 12 ("Burns had one misdemeanor assault

guilty to those charges, Burns also pleaded guilty to variousdriving-related offenses, including nine moving violations

and a charge of driving with a suspended license. In addi-tion, Burns had previously pleaded guilty to being in actual
physical control of a vehicle while intoxicated.The fact that Burns had pleaded guilty to traffic offenses
and other misdemeanors may well have made him an ex-tremely poor candidate for reserve deputy. Had Sheriff
Moore fully reviewed Burns' record, he might have come toprecisely that conclusion. But unless he would necessarily
have reached that decision because Burns' use of excessiveforce would have been a plainly obvious consequence of the
hiring decision, Sheriff Moore's inadequate scrutiny ofBurns' record cannot constitute "deliberate indifference" to
respondent's federally protected right to be free from a useof excessive force.

Justice Souter's reading of the case is that the jury be-lieved that Sheriff Moore in fact read Burns' entire record.
Post, at 426-427. That is plausible, but it is also irrelevant.It is not sufficient for respondent to show that Sheriff Moore
read Burns' record and therefore hired Burns with knowl-edge of his background. Such a decision may reflect indifconviction stemming from a campus fight"); Pet. for Rehearing of Substituted Opinion in No. 93-5376 (CA5), p. 11 (same); 3 Record 927 (Brief in
Support of Defendants' Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict

of "one campus fight").

Respondent has not once contested this characterization. See, e. g., 3

Cross-Appellant Brown et al. in No. 93-5376 (CA5), pp. 3-4; Brief in Opposition 1. Indeed, since the characterization is reflected in the county's
petition for certiorari, under this Court's Rule 15(2) respondent would
have had an obligation in her brief in opposition to correct "any perceived
misstatement" in the petition. She did not. Involvement in a single fraternity fracas does not demonstrate "a proclivity to violence against the
person." Post, at 429, n. 6.

ference to Burns' record, but what is required is deliberate
indifference to a plaintiff 's constitutional right. That is,
whether Sheriff Moore failed to examine Burns' record, partially examined it, or fully examined it, Sheriff Moore's hiring decision could not have been "deliberately indifferent"
unless in light of that record Burns' use of excessive force
would have been a plainly obvious consequence of the hiring
decision. Because there was insufficient evidence on which
a jury could base a finding that Sheriff Moore's decision to
hire Burns reflected conscious disregard of an obvious risk
that a use of excessive force would follow, the District Court
erred in submitting respondent's inadequate screening claim
to the jury.

III

Cases involving constitutional injuries allegedly traceable
to an ill-considered hiring decision pose the greatest risk
that a municipality will be held liable for an injury that it
did not cause. In the broadest sense, every injury is traceable to a hiring decision. Where a court fails to adhere to
rigorous requirements of culpability and causation, municipal
liability collapses into respondeat superior liability. As we
recognized in Monell and have repeatedly reaffirmed, Congress did not intend municipalities to be held liable unless
deliberate action attributable to the municipality directly
caused a deprivation of federal rights. A failure to apply
stringent culpability and causation requirements raises serious federalism concerns, in that it risks constitutionalizing
particular hiring requirements that States have themselves
elected not to impose. Cf. Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S., at
392. Bryan County is not liable for Sheriff Moore's isolated
decision to hire Burns without adequate screening, because
respondent has not demonstrated that his decision reflected
a conscious disregard for a high risk that Burns would use
excessive force in violation of respondent's federally pro520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

tected right. We therefore vacate the judgment of theCourt of Appeals and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

In Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469, 480 (1986), weheld a municipality liable under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for harm

caused by the single act of a policymaking officer in a matterwithin his authority but not covered by a policy previously
identified. The central question presented here is whetherthat rule applies to a single act that itself neither violates
nor commands a violation of federal law. The answer is yesif the single act amounts to deliberate indifference to a substantial risk that a violation of federal law will result. Withsignificant qualifications, the Court assumes so, too, in theory, but it raises such skeptical hurdles to reaching any suchconclusion in practice that it virtually guarantees its disposition of this case: it holds as a matter of law that the sheriff 'sact could not be thought to reflect deliberate indifference to
the risk that his subordinate would violate the Constitutionby using excessive force. I respectfully dissent as much
from the level of the Court's skepticism as from its reversalof the judgment.

Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961),insofar as Monroe had held $ 1983 inapplicable to governments beneath the state level ("municipal," for short). Monell, supra, at 663. At the same time that we decided Con-gress meant municipalities to be persons subject to $ 1983,

however, we also concluded that municipal liability under thestatute could not be based on the traditional theory of
respondeat superior. 436 U. S., at 691. We said that for

520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Souter, J., dissenting
purposes of $ 1983 an act could not be attributed to a municipality merely because it was an act of a municipal agent performed in the course of exercising a power delegated to the
municipality by local law, and we reasoned instead that "it is
[only] when execution of a government's policy or custom,
whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or
acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the
injury that the government as an entity is responsible under

$ 1983." Id., at 694; see Pembaur, supra, at 480.

In assigning municipal liability under Monell, we accordingly distinguish an act of a municipal agent without independent authority to establish policy from the act of one
authorized to set policy under local law, and we likewise
distinguish the acts of lower level employees depending on
whether they do or do not implement or manifest a policy
set by those with the authority to set it. The act of the
municipality is the act only of an authorized policymaker or
of an employee following the policymaker's lead. "The `official policy' requirement was intended to distinguish acts of
the municipality from acts of employees of the municipality,
and thereby make clear that municipal liability is limited to
action for which the municipality is actually responsible."
Pembaur, supra, at 479-480.

While this overview indicates that the policy requirement
may be satisfied in more than one way, there are in fact three
alternatives discernible in our prior cases. It is certainly
met when the appropriate officer or entity promulgates a
generally applicable statement of policy and the subsequent
act complained of is simply an implementation of that policy.
Monell exemplified these circumstances, where city agencies
had issued a rule requiring pregnant employees to take
unpaid leaves of absence before any medical need arose.
Monell, supra, at 660-661.

We have also held the policy requirement satisfied where
no rule has been announced as "policy" but federal law has

been violated by an act of the policymaker itself. In thissituation, the choice of policy and its implementation are one,

and the first or only action will suffice to ground municipalliability simply because it is the very policymaker who is
acting. See Pembaur, supra, at 480-481; cf. Newport v. Fact
Concerts, Inc., 453 U. S. 247, 250-252 (1981) (implicitly as-suming that a policymaker's single act can sustain $ 1983 action); Owen v. Independence, 445 U. S. 622, 625-630 (1980)(same). It does not matter that the policymaker may have
chosen "a course of action tailored [only] to a particular sit-uation and not intended to control decisions in later situations," Pembaur, 475 U. S., at 481; if the decision to adopt
that particular course of action is intentionally made by the
authorized policymaker, "it surely represents an act of official government `policy' " and "the municipality is equally
responsible whether that action is to be taken only once or
to be taken repeatedly," ibid.

We have, finally, identified a municipal policy in a third
situation, even where the policymaker has failed to act affirmatively at all, so long as the need to take some action to
control the agents of the government "is so obvious, and the
inadequacy [of existing practice] so likely to result in the
violation of constitutional rights, that the policymake[r] . . .
can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent
to the need." Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390 (1989).
Where, in the most obvious example, the policymaker sits on
his hands after repeated, unlawful acts of subordinate officers and that failure "evidences a `deliberate indifference' to
the rights of [the municipality's] inhabitants," id., at 389, the
policymaker's toleration of the subordinates' behavior establishes a policy-in-practice just as readily attributable to
the municipality as the one-act policy-in-practice described
above. Such a policy choice may be inferred even without a
pattern of acts by subordinate officers, so long as the need
for action by the policymaker is so obvious that the failure
to act rises to deliberate indifference. Id., at 390, n. 10.

Souter, J., dissenting
Deliberate indifference is thus treated, as it is elsewhere
in the law,1 as tantamount to intent, so that inaction by a
policymaker deliberately indifferent to a substantial risk of
harm is equivalent to the intentional action that setting policy presupposes. Compare Pembaur, supra, at 483 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.) ("deliberate choice" by policymaker), and Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 823
(1985) (plurality opinion of Rehnquist, J.) (" `policy' generally implies a course of action consciously chosen"), with
Canton, supra, at 389 ("Only where a municipality's failure
to train its employees . . . evidences a `deliberate indifference'
to the rights of its inhabitants can . . . a shortcoming be . . .
city `policy or custom' . . . actionable under $ 1983").

Under this prior law, Sheriff Moore's failure to screen out
his 21-year-old great-nephew Burns on the basis of his criminal record, and the decision instead to authorize Burns to act
as a deputy sheriff, constitutes a policy choice attributable
to Bryan County under $ 1983. There is no serious dispute
that Sheriff Moore is the designated policymaker for implementing the sheriff 's law enforcement powers and recruiting
officers to exercise them, or that he "has final authority to
act for the municipality in hiring matters." Ante, at 408.
As the authorized policymaker, Sheriff Moore is the county

for purposes of $ 1983 municipal liability arising from thesheriff 's department's exercise of law enforcement authority.

As I explain in greater detail below, it was open to the juryto find that the sheriff knew of the record of his nephew's
violent propensity, but hired him in deliberate indifferenceto the risk that he would use excessive force on the job, as
in fact he later did. That the sheriff 's act did not itself com-mand or require commission of a constitutional violation (like
the order to perform an unlawful entry and search in Pembaur) is not dispositive under $ 1983, for we have expresslyrejected the contention that "only unconstitutional policies

are actionable" under $ 1983, Canton, supra, at 387, and havenever suggested that liability under the statute is otherwise
limited to policies that facially violate other federal law.The sheriff 's policy choice creating a substantial risk of a
constitutional violation therefore could subject the county toliability under existing precedent.

II
At the level of theory, at least, the Court does not disagree,and it assumes for the sake of deciding the case that a single,

facially neutral act of deliberate indifference by a policy-maker could be a predicate to municipal liability if it led to
an unconstitutional injury inflicted by subordinate officers.See

ante, at 412. At the level of practice, however, the tenorof the Court's opinion is decidedly different: it suggests that

2 Given the sheriff's position as law enforcement policymaker, it is simply off the point to suggest, as the Court does, that there is some significance in either the fact that Sheriff Moore's failure to screen may have
been a "deviation" from his ordinary hiring practices or that a pattern
of injuries resulting from his past practices is absent. See ante, at 408.
Pembaur made clear that a single act by a designated policymaker is sufficient to establish a municipal policy, see Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S.
469, 480-481 (1986), and Canton explained, as the Court recognizes, see
ante, at 409, that evidence of a single violation of federal rights can trigger
municipal liability under $ 1983, see Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390,
n. 10 (1989). See Part II-B, infra.

the trial court insufficiently appreciated the specificity of therisk to which such indifference must be deliberate in order

to be actionable; it expresses deep skepticism that such ap-preciation of risk could ever reasonably be attributed to the
policymaker who has performed only a single unsatisfactory,but not facially unconstitutional, act; and it finds the record
insufficient to make any such showing in this case. TheCourt is serially mistaken. This case presents no occasion
to correct or refine the District Court's jury instructions onthe degree of risk required for deliberate indifference; the
Court's skepticism converts a newly demanding formulationof the standard of fault into a virtually categorical impossibility of showing it in a case like this; and the record in thiscase is perfectly sufficient to support the jury's verdict even
on the Court's formulation of the high degree of risk thatmust be shown.

A
The Court is certainly correct in emphasizing the need toshow more than mere negligence on the part of the policymaker, for at the least the element of deliberateness requiresboth subjective appreciation of a risk of unconstitutional
harm, and a risk substantial enough to justify the heightenedresponsibility that deliberate indifference generally entails.
The Court goes a step further, however, in requiring thatthe "particular" harmful consequence be "plainly obvious" to
the policymaker, ante, at 411, a characterization of deliberateindifference adapted from dicta set forth in a footnote in
Canton, see 489 U. S., at 390, n. 10. Canton, as mentionedabove, held that a municipal policy giving rise to liability
under $ 1983 may be inferred even when the policymaker hasfailed to act affirmatively at all, so long as a need to control
the agents of the government "is so obvious, and the inade-quacy [of existing practice] so likely to result in the violation
of constitutional rights, that the policymake[r] . . . can reason-ably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the
need." Id., at 390. While we speculated in Canton that

Souter, J., dissenting
"[i]t could . . . be that the police, in exercising their discretion, so often violate constitutional rights that the need for
further training must have been plainly obvious to the city
policymakers, who, nevertheless, are `deliberately indifferent' to the need," see id., at 390, n. 10, we did not purport to
be defining the fault of deliberate indifference universally as
the failure to act in relation to a "plainly obvious consequence" of harm. Nor did we, in addressing the requisite
risk that constitutional violations will occur, suggest that the
deliberate indifference necessary to establish municipal liability must be, as the Court says today, indifference to the
particular constitutional violation that in fact occurred.

The Court's formulation that deliberate indifference exists
only when the risk of the subsequent, particular constitutional violation is a plainly obvious consequence of the hiring decision, see ante, at 411, while derived from Canton, is
thus without doubt a new standard. See post, at 433-434
(Breyer, J., dissenting). As to the "particular" violation,
the Court alters the understanding of deliberate indifference
as set forth in Canton, where we spoke of constitutional violations generally.3 As to "plainly obvious consequence," the
Court's standard appears to be somewhat higher, for example, than the standard for "reckless" fault in the criminal law,
where the requisite indifference to risk is defined as that
which "consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the material element exists or will result . . . [and]
involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that
a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation." See American Law Institute, Model Penal Code

$ 2.02(2)(c) (1985).

3 The Court's embellishment on the deliberate indifference standard is,
in any case, no help in resolving this case because there has never been
any suggestion that Deputy Burns's criminal background, including
charges of assault and battery, indicated that he would commit a constitutional violation different from the one he in fact committed.

That said, it is just possible that our prior understandingof the requisite degree of fault and the standard as the Court

now states it may in practice turn out to amount to muchthe same thing, but I would have preferred an argument
addressing the point before ruling on it. There was, how-ever, no such argument here for the simple reason that petitioner never asked that deliberate indifference be defined tooccur only when the particular constitutional injury was the
plainly obvious consequence of the policymaker's act. Peti-tioner merely asked the District Court to instruct the jury
to determine whether Sheriff Moore acted with "consciousindifference," see 2 Record 342, and made no objection to the
District Court's charge that "Sheriff B. J. Moore would haveacted with deliberate indifference in adopting an otherwise
constitutional hiring policy for a deputy sheriff if the needfor closer scrutiny of Stacy Burns' background was so obvious and the inadequacy of the scrutiny given so likelyto result in violations of constitutional rights, that Sheriff
B. J. Moore can be reasonably said to have been deliberatelyindifferent to the constitutional needs of the Plaintiff." 10
Record 800-801. If, as it appears, today's standard doesraise the threshold of municipal liability, it does so quite independently of any issue posed or decided in the trial court.

B
The Court's skepticism that the modified standard of faultcan ever be met in a single-act case of inadequate screening

without a patently unconstitutional policy, ante, at 412-414,both reveals the true value of the assumption that in theory
there might be municipal liability in such a case, and dictatesthe result of the Court's review of the record in the case
before us. It is skepticism gone too far.It is plain enough that a facially unconstitutional policy is
likely to produce unconstitutional injury, see, e. g., Pembaur,475 U. S., at 480-481;

Monell, 436 U. S., at 660-661, and obvi-ous, too, that many facially neutral policy decisions evince

no such clear portents. Written standards for hiring lawenforcement personnel might be silent on the significance of

a prior criminal record without justifying much worry aboutemploying axe murderers (who are unlikely to apply) or subjecting the public to attacks by someone with a 30-year-old
assault conviction (who has probably grown up). But a poli-cymaker need not mandate injury to be indifferent to its risk

when obvious, and, because a particular hiring decision mayraise a very high probability of harm down the line, it simply
ignores the issue before us to lump together in one presump-tively benign category every singular administrative act of
a policymaker that does not expressly command or constitute
unconstitutional behavior. Thus, a decision to give law enforcement authority to a scofflaw who had recently engaged
in criminal violence presents a very different risk from hiring someone who once drove an overweight truck. While
the decision to hire the violent scofflaw may not entail harm
to others as unquestionably as an order to "go out and
rough-up some suspects," it is a long way from neutral in the
risk it creates.

While the Court should rightly be skeptical about predicating municipal or individual liability merely on a failure to
adopt a crime-free personnel policy or on a particular decision to hire a guilty trucker, why does it extend that valid
skepticism to the quite unsound point of doubting liability
for hiring the violent scofflaw? The Court says it fears that
the latter sort of case raises a danger of liability without
fault, ante, at 408. But if the Court means fault generally
(as distinct from the blame imputed on classic respondeat
superior doctrine), it need only recall that whether a particular violent scofflaw is violent enough or scoffing enough to
implicate deliberate indifference will depend on applying

the highly demanding standard the Court announces: plainly
obvious consequence of particular injury. It is the high
threshold of deliberate indifference that will ensure that
municipalities be held liable only for considered acts with

substantial risks. That standard will distinguish single-actcases with only a mild portent of injury from single-act cases

with a plainly obvious portent, and from cases in which theharm is only the latest in a series of injuries known to have
followed from the policymaker's action. The Court hasfenced off the slippery slope.

A second stated reason of the skeptical majority is that,because municipal liability under

Monell cannot rest on re-spondeat superior, ante, at 410, 415, "a court must carefully

test the link between the policymaker's inadequate decisionand the particular injury alleged," ante, at 410. But that is
simply to say that the tortious act must be proximatelycaused by the policymaker. The policy requirement is the
restriction that bars straightforward respondeat superior li-ability, and the need to "test the link" is merely the need to
apply the law that defines what a cognizable link is. Therestriction on imputed fault that saves municipalities from
liability has no need of categorical immunization in single-act cases.

In short, the Court's skepticism is excessive in ignoringthe fact that some acts of a policymaker present substantial
risks of unconstitutional harm even though the acts are notunconstitutional per se. And the Court's purported justifications for its extreme skepticism are washed out by thevery standards employed to limit liability.

C
For demonstrating the extreme degree of the Court's in-hospitality to single-act municipal liability, this is a case on

point, for even under the "plainly obvious consequence" rulethe evidence here would support the verdict. There is no
dispute that before the incident in question the sheriff or-dered a copy of his nephew's criminal record. While the
sheriff spoke euphemistically on the witness stand of a "driv-ing record," the scope of the requested documentation included crimes beyond motor vehicle violations and the sher520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

said he was sure he had noticed charges of driving with asuspended license; and he said that he had taken the trouble
to make an independent search for any outstanding warrantfor Burns's arrest. As he put it, however, he somehow failed
to "notice" charges of assault and battery or the list of of-fenses so long as to point either to contempt for law or to

employ his relative was an act of mere negligence or poorjudgment. He did not even claim, for example, that he

thought any assault must have been just a youthful pecca-dillo magnified out of proportion by the criminal charge, or
that he had evaluated the assault as merely eccentric behav-ior in a young man of sound character, or that he was convinced that wild youth had given way to discretion. Therebeing no such evidence of reasonable but mistaken judgment,
the jury could readily have found that the sheriff knew hisnephew's proven propensities, that he thought the thrust of
the evidence was so damaging that he would lie to protecthis reputation and the county treasury, and that he simply
chose to put a family member on the payroll (the third rela-tive, in fact

5) disregarding the risk to the public.

At trial, petitioner's expert witness stated during cross-examination that Burns's rap sheet listed repeated traffic violations, including driving while intoxicated and driving witha suspended license, resisting arrest, and more than one
charge of assault and battery. The witness further testifiedthat Burns pleaded guilty to assault and battery and other
charges 16 months before he was hired by Sheriff Moore.6

5 Burns is the son of Sheriff Moore's nephew and Burns's grandfather
had been involved with the sheriff's department for 16 years. See 67
F. 3d 1174, 1184 (CA5 1995).

6 The Court points out that Burns had only one conviction for assault

and battery, that respondent has never claimed otherwise, and that her
expert witness so testified. See ante, at 413-414, n. 2. This is entirely
correct. But the issue here is not what might have been learned by thoroughly investigating Burns's behavior; the issue is the sufficiency of the
evidence to support the jury's finding that the sheriff acted with deliberate
indifference when he hired Burns. Specifically, assuming the jury found
that the sheriff looked at Burns's criminal record, an assumption the Court
acknowledges is "plausible," see ante, at 414, what does the evidence show
that the sheriff learned from this examination? The criminal record was
not itself introduced into evidence in written form, but it was, in relevant
part, read to the jury by petitioner's expert witness Ken Barnes. According to Barnes's testimony, this criminal record's list of numerous charges
included four references to assault and battery, two of which the witness

Respondent's expert witness testified that Burns's arrestrecord showed a "blatant disregard for the law and problems

that may show themselves in abusing the public or usingexcessive force," 7 Record 316, and petitioner's own expert
agreed that Burns's criminal history should have caused con-cern. When asked if he would have hired Burns, he replied
that it was "doubtful." 9 Record 537. On this evidence, thejury could have found that the string of arrests and convictions revealed "that Burns had [such] a propensity for vio-lence and a disregard for the law," see 67 F. 3d, at 1184, n. 20,
that his subsequent resort to excessive force was the plainlyobvious consequence of hiring him as a law enforcement
officer authorized to employ force in performing his duties.

III
The county escapes from liability through the Court's un-toward application of an enhanced fault standard to a record

of inculpatory evidence showing a contempt for constitu-tional obligations as blatant as the nepotism that apparently
occasioned it. The novelty of this escape shows something
said were duplicative, though he conceded this was not necessarily so.
See 9 Record 532-533. The upshot was that if the jury found that the
sheriff looked at the written record, it could have found that he read four
separate references to assault and battery charges. That is not to say
that four assaults necessarily occurred, but only that the record refers
four times to such charges before listing one conviction for assault and
battery. Barnes also testified that the record does not contain a disposition for all the charges listed, and that a sheriff reviewing such a record
should have investigated further to determine the disposition of such
charges. See id., at 536.

In my judgment, the evidence would have been sufficient (under the
majority's test) if it had shown no more than one complaint and conviction
for assault and battery, given the mixture of charges of resisting an officer,
public drunkenness, and multiple traffic offenses over a 4-month period
ending only 16 months before Burns was hired. The inference to be
drawn would have been that a repeatedly lawless young man had shown
a proclivity to violence against the person. But, as it turns out, the evidentiary record is ostensibly more damaging than that.

unsuspected (by me, at least) until today. Despite argu-ments that

Monell's policy requirement was an erroneous
reading of $ 1983, see Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S., at834 (

Stevens, J., dissenting), I had not previously thought
that there was sufficient reason to unsettle the precedent of
Monell. Now it turns out, however, that Monell is hardlysettled. That being so,

Justice Breyer's powerful call to
reexamine $ 1983 municipal liability afresh finds support inthe Court's own readiness to rethink the matter.

I respectfully dissent.
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

In Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436U. S. 658 (1978), this Court said that municipalities cannot be

held liable for constitutional torts under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983
"on a respondeat superior theory," but they can be held liable "when execution of " a municipality's "policy or custom
. . . inflicts the injury." 436 U. S., at 691, 694. That statement has produced a highly complex body of interpretive
law. Today's decision exemplifies the law's complexity, for
it distinguishes among a municipal action that "itself violates
federal law," ante, at 404, an action that "intentionally deprive[s] a plaintiff of a federally protected right," ante, at
405, and one that "has caused an employee to do so," ibid.
It then elaborates this Court's requirement that a consequence be "so likely" to occur that a policymaker could "reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent" with
respect to it, Canton v. Harris, 489 U. S. 378, 390 (1989) (emphasis added), with an admonition that the unconstitutional
consequence must be "plainly obvious," ante, at 411. The
majority fears that a contrary view of prior precedent would
undermine Monell's basic distinction. That concern, however, rather than leading us to spin ever finer distinctions as
we try to apply Monell's basic distinction between liability
that rests upon policy and liability that is vicarious, suggests

Breyer, J., dissenting
that we should reexamine the legal soundness of that basicdistinction itself.

I believe that the legal prerequisites for reexamination ofan interpretation of an important statute are present here.
The soundness of the original principle is doubtful. The
original principle has generated a body of interpretive lawthat is so complex that the law has become difficult to apply.

Factual and legal changes have divorced the law from thedistinction's apparent original purposes. And there may be
only a handful of individuals or groups that have significantlyrelied upon perpetuation of the original distinction. If all
this is so, later law has made the original distinction, not
simply wrong, but obsolete and a potential source of confusion. Cf., e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.,
433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977) (reexamining Sherman Act's interpretation set forth in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &
Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967)); Hubbard v. United States, 514 U. S.
695, 697-715 (1995) (reexamining interpretation of 18 U. S. C.

$ 1001 set forth in United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503
(1955)); Monell, supra, at 664-690, 695-701 (reexamining interpretation of 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 set forth in Monroe v. Pape,
365 U. S. 167 (1961)). See also United States v. Gaudin, 515
U. S. 506, 521-522 (1995).

First, consider Monell's original reasoning. The Monell
"no vicarious liability" principle rested upon a historical
analysis of $ 1983 and upon $ 1983's literal language--language that imposes liability upon (but only upon) any "person." Justice Stevens has clearly explained why neither
of these rationales is sound. Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471
U. S. 808, 834-844 (1985) (dissenting opinion); Pembaur v.
Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469, 489-491 (1986) (opinion concurring
in part and concurring in judgment). Essentially, the history on which Monell relied consists almost exclusively of
the fact that the Congress that enacted $ 1983 rejected an
amendment (called the Sherman amendment) that would
have made municipalities vicariously liable for the maraud520US2 Unit: $U47 [09-10-99 18:49:09] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing acts of private citizens. Monell, supra, at 666-667, 694.Cf.

Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491 U. S. 701,
726-729 (1989) (plurality opinion). That fact, as Justice
Stevens and others have pointed out, does not argue
against vicarious liability for the act of municipal employees--particularly since municipalities, at the time, were vi-cariously liable for many of the acts of their employees. See

Tuttle, supra, at 836, n. 8 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (citingcases);

Pembaur, supra, at 489-490 (Stevens, J., concurring
in part and concurring in judgment). See also, e. g.,Kramer & Sykes, Municipal Liability Under $ 1983: A Legal

and Economic Analysis, 1987 S. Ct. Rev. 249, 256-265; Mead,
42 U. S. C. $ 1983 Municipal Liability: The Monell Sketch Becomes a Distorted Picture, 65 N. C. L. Rev. 517, 535-537
(1987). But see Welch & Hofmeister, Praprotnik, Municipal
Policy and Policymakers: The Supreme Court's Constriction
of Municipal Liability, 13 S. Ill. U. L. J. 857, 881 (1989) (adopting Monell's reading of the legislative history).

Without supporting history, it is difficult to find $ 1983's
words "[e]very person" inconsistent with respondeat superior liability. In 1871 "bodies politic and corporate," such as
municipalities, were "person[s]." See Act of Feb. 25, ch. 71,

$ 2, 16 Stat. 431 (repealed 1939); Monell, supra, at 688-689.
Section 1983 requires that the "person" either "subjec[t]" or
"caus[e]" a different person "to be subjected" to a "deprivation" of a right. As a purely linguistic matter, a municipality, which can act only through its employees, might be said
to have "subject[ed]" a person or to have "cause[d]" that
person to have been "subjected" to a loss of rights when a
municipality's employee acts within the scope of his or her
employment. See Restatement (Second) of Agency $ 219
(1957); W. Landes & R. Posner, The Economic Structure of
Tort Law 120-121 (1987). Federal courts on occasion have
interpreted the word "person" or the equivalent in other
statutes as authorizing forms of vicarious liability. See,
e. g., American Telephone and Telegraph Co. v. Winback and

A & P Trucking Co., 358 U. S. 121, 124-125 (1958) (criminal
statute). See also Tuttle, supra, at 835 (Stevens, J.,dissenting).

Second, Monell's basic effort to distinguish between vicar-ious liability and liability derived from "policy or custom"
has produced a body of law that is neither readily under-standable nor easy to apply. Today's case provides a good
example. The District Court in this case told the jury itmust find (1) Sheriff Moore's screening "

so likely to result in
violations of constitutional rights" that he could "reasonably
[be] said to have been deliberately indifferent to the consti-tutional needs of the Plaintiff " and (2) that the "inadequate

hiring . . . policy directly caused the Plaintiff 's injury."App. 123a (emphasis added). This instruction comes close
to repeating this Court's language in Canton v. Harris. In
Canton, the Court said (of the city's failure to train officers
in the use of deadly force):

"[I]n light of the duties assigned to specific officers or
employees the need for more or different training is soobvious, and the inadequacy

so likely to result in the
violation of constitutional rights, that the policymakersof the city can

reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need." 489 U. S., at 390 (emphasis added).

The majority says that the District Court and the Court of
Appeals did not look closely enough at the specific facts of
this case. It also adds that the harm must be a "plainly
obvious consequence" of the "decision to hire" Burns. Ante,
at 411. But why elaborate Canton's instruction in this way?
The Court's verbal formulation is slightly different; and that
being so, a lawyer or judge will ignore the Court's precise

Breyer, J., dissenting
words at his or her peril. Yet those words, while addingcomplexity, do not seem to reflect a difference that significantly helps one understand the difference between "vicari-ous" liability and "policy." Cf.

ante, at 421-422 (Souter, J.,
dissenting). Even if the Court means only that the record
evidence does not meet Canton's standard, it will be difficultfor juries, and for judges, to understand just why that is so.

It will be difficult for them to apply today's elaboration of
Canton--except perhaps in the limited context of police
force hiring decisions that are followed by a recruit's uncon-stitutional conduct.

Consider some of the other distinctions that this Court has
had to make as it has sought to distinguish liability based
upon policymaking from liability that is "vicarious." It has
proved necessary, for example, to distinguish further,
between an exercise of policymaking authority and an
exercise of delegated discretionary policy-implementing authority. See St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112, 126-127
(1988) (plurality opinion). Compare Tuttle, 471 U. S., at 817
(plurality opinion), with Canton, supra, at 389-390. Without some such distinction, "municipal liability [might] collaps[e] into respondeat superior," ante, at 410, for the law
would treat similarly (and hold municipalities responsible
for) both a police officer's decision about how much force to
use when making a particular arrest and a police chief 's decision about how much force to use when making a particular
kind of arrest. But the distinction is not a clear one. It
requires federal courts to explore state and municipal law
that distributes different state powers among different local
officials and local entities. Praprotnik, supra, at 125-126,
127-131 (plurality opinion); Jett, supra, at 737-738. That
law is highly specialized; it may or may not say just where
policymaking authority lies, and it can prove particularly difficult to apply in light of the Court's determination that a
decision can be "policymaking" even though it applies only
to a single instance. Pembaur, 475 U. S., at 481. See also

It is not surprising that results have sometimes provedinconsistent. Compare

ante, at 408 (sheriff was final policymaker in hiring matters), with Greensboro Professional Fire
Fighters Assn., Local 3157 v. Greensboro, 64 F. 3d 962, 965-
966 (CA4 1995) (fire chief was not policymaker with respect
to hiring and firing), and Harris v. Pagedale, 821 F. 2d 499,

charges of sexual assault), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 986 (1987),
with Wilson v. Chicago, 6 F. 3d 1233, 1240-1241 (CA7 1993)
(municipal policymaker was not deliberately indifferent to
charges of abuse of pretrial detainees), cert. denied, 511 U. S.
1088 (1994). See also Auriemma v. Rice, 957 F. 2d 397, 400-
401 (CA7 1992) (describing confusion in courts).

Nor does the location of "policymaking" authority pose
the only conceptually difficult problem. Lower courts must

also decide whether a failure to make policy was "deliberately indifferent," rather than "grossly negligent." Canton, supra, at 388, n. 7. And they must decide, for example, whether it matters that some such failure occurred in
the officer-training, rather than the officer-hiring, process.
Ante, at 409-410.

Given the basic Monell principle, these distinctions may
be necessary, for without them, the Court cannot easily avoid
a "municipal liability" that "collaps[es] into respondeat superior." Ante, at 410. But a basic legal principle that requires so many such distinctions to maintain its legal life
may not deserve such longevity. See Mead, 65 N. C. L. Rev.,
at 542 (describing the "confusion and uncertainty" in the
lower courts "caused by the Monell Court's choice of the

policy or custom causation requirement"); Schuck, supra, at1783 (noting the "extraordinary unpredictability of the `official policy' test").Finally, relevant legal and factual circumstances may have
changed in a way that affects likely reliance upon Monell's
liability limitation. The legal complexity just describedmakes it difficult for municipalities to predict just when they

will be held liable based upon "policy or custom." Moreover,their potential liability is, in a sense, greater than that of
individuals, for they cannot assert the "qualified immunity"defenses that individuals may raise.

Owen v. Independence,
445 U. S. 622 (1980). Further, many States have statutes
that appear to, in effect, mimic respondeat superior by authorizing indemnification of employees found liable under

$ 1983 for actions within the scope of their employment.
See, e. g., Conn. Gen. Stat. $ 7-465 (1997); Idaho Code $ 6-903
(1990); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 745, $ 10/2-302 (1994); Kan. Stat.
Ann. $ 75-6109 (1989); Minn. Stat. $ 466.07 (1994); Mont. Code
Ann. $ 2-9-305 (1994); Nev. Rev. Stat. $ 41.0349 (1989); N. H.
Rev. Stat. Ann. $ 29-A:2 (1988); N. D. Cent. Code $ 32-12.1-
04(4) (Supp. 1993); Okla. Stat., Tit. 51, $ 162 (Supp. 1995); 42
Pa. Cons. Stat. $ 8548 (1982); S. D. Codified Laws $ 3-19-1

112A-11 (1992); Wis. Stat. $ 895.46 (1993-1994). These statutes--valuable to government employees as well as to civil
rights victims--can provide for payments from the government that are similar to those that would take place in the
absence of Monell's limitations. To the extent that they do
so, municipal reliance upon the continuation of Monell's "policy" limitation loses much of its significance.

Any statement about reliance, of course, must be tentative,
as we have not heard argument on the matter. We do not
know the pattern of indemnification: how often, and to what
extent, States now indemnify their employees, and which of
their employees they indemnify. I also realize that there
may be other reasons, constitutional and otherwise, that I

have not discussed that argue strongly for reaffirmation ofMonell's holding. See, e. g., Gerhardt, The Monell Legacy:

Balancing Federalism Concerns and Municipal Accountabil-ity under Section 1983, 62 S. Cal. L. Rev. 539 (1989) (discussing federalism); Nahmod, Constitutional Accountability inSection 1983 Litigation, 68 Iowa L.

Nonetheless, for the reasons I have set forth, I believethe case for reexamination is a strong one. Today's decision
underscores this need. Consequently, I would ask for fur-ther argument that would focus upon the continued viability
of Monell's distinction between vicarious municipal liabilityand municipal liability based upon policy and custom.

COURT OF THE THREE AFFILIATED TRIBES

OF THE FORT BERTHOLD INDIAN

RESERVATION, et al. v. A-1

CONTRACTORS et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 95-1872. Argued January 7, 1997--Decided April 28, 1997
Vehicles driven by petitioner Fredericks and respondent Stockert collided

on a portion of a North Dakota state highway that runs through the
Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The 6.59-mile stretch of highway
within the reservation is open to the public, affords access to a federal
water resource project, and is maintained by North Dakota under a
federally granted right-of-way that lies on land held by the United
States in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes and their members. Neither driver is a member of the Tribes or an Indian, but Fredericks is
the widow of a deceased tribal member and has five adult children who
are also members. The truck driven by Stockert belonged to his employer, respondent A-1 Contractors, a non-Indian-owned enterprise
with its principal place of business outside the reservation. At the
time, A-1 was under a subcontract with LCM Corporation, a corporation wholly owned by the Tribes, to do landscaping within the reservation. The record does not show whether Stockert was engaged in subcontract work at the time of the accident. Fredericks filed a personal
injury action in Tribal Court against Stockert and A-1, and Fredericks'
adult children filed a loss-of-consortium claim in the same lawsuit. The
Tribal Court ruled that it had jurisdiction over Fredericks' claim and
therefore denied respondents' motion to dismiss, and the Northern
Plains Intertribal Court of Appeals affirmed. Respondents then commenced this action in the Federal District Court against Fredericks, her
adult children, the Tribal Court, and Tribal Judge Strate, seeking a
declaratory judgment that, as a matter of federal law, the Tribal Court
lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Fredericks' claims; respondents also
sought an injunction against further Tribal Court proceedings. Relying particularly on National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe,
471 U. S. 845, and Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9, the District Court dismissed the action, determining that the Tribal Court had
civil jurisdiction over Fredericks' complaint against respondents. The

Syllabus
en banc Eighth Circuit reversed, concluding that the controlling precedent was Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544, and that, under Montana, the Tribal Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the
dispute.

Held: When an accident occurs on a public highway maintained by the

State pursuant to a federally granted right-of-way over Indian reservation land, a civil action against allegedly negligent nonmembers falls
within state or federal regulatory and adjudicatory governance; absent
a statute or treaty authorizing the tribe to govern the conduct of nonmembers driving on the State's highway, tribal courts may not exercise
jurisdiction in such cases. This Court expresses no view on the governing law or proper forum when an accident occurs on a tribal road within
a reservation. Pp. 445-460.

(a) Absent express authorization by federal statute or treaty, tribal
jurisdiction over nonmembers' conduct exists only in limited circumstances. In Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191, the Court held
that tribes lack criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians. Later, in Montana v. United States, the Court set forth the general rule that, absent
a different congressional direction, Indian tribes lack civil authority
over the conduct of nonmembers on non-Indian land within a reservation, subject to exceptions relating to (1) the activities of nonmembers
who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its members and (2)
nonmember conduct that threatens or directly affects the tribe's political
integrity, economic security, health, or welfare. 450 U. S., at 564-567.
Pp. 445-448.

(b) Montana controls this case. Contrary to petitioners' contention,
National Farmers and Iowa Mutual do not establish a rule converse to
Montana's. Neither case establishes that tribes presumptively retain
adjudicatory authority over claims against nonmembers arising from occurrences anywhere within a reservation. Rather, these cases prescribe a prudential, nonjurisdictional exhaustion rule requiring a federal
court in which tribal-court jurisdiction is challenged to stay its hand, as
a matter of comity, until after the tribal court has had an initial and full
opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction. See 471 U. S., at 857;
480 U. S., at 20, n. 14; see also id., at 16, n. 8. This exhaustion rule, as
explained in National Farmers, 471 U. S., at 855-856, reflects the more
extensive jurisdiction tribal courts have in civil cases than in criminal
proceedings and the corresponding need to inspect relevant statutes,
treaties, and other materials in order to determine tribal adjudicatory
authority. National Farmers' exhaustion requirement does not conflict
with Montana, in which the Court made plain that the general rule and
exceptions there announced govern only in the absence of a delegation

Syllabus
of tribal authority by treaty or statute. See 450 U. S., at 557-563.
Read in context, the Court's statement in Iowa Mutual, 480 U. S., at 18,
that "[c]ivil jurisdiction over [the] activities [of non-Indians on reservation lands] presumptively lies in the tribal courts," addresses only situations in which tribes possess authority to regulate nonmembers' activities. As to nonmembers, a tribe's adjudicative jurisdiction does not
exceed its legislative jurisdiction, absent congressional direction enlarging tribal-court jurisdiction. Pp. 448-453.

(c) It is unavailing to argue, as petitioners do, that Montana does not
govern this case because the land underlying the accident scene is held
in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes and their members. Petitioners
are correct that Montana and the cases following its instruction--Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S.
408, and South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679--all involved alienated, non-Indian-owned reservation land. However, the right-of-way
North Dakota acquired for its highway renders the 6.59-mile stretch
here at issue equivalent, for nonmember governance purposes, to such
alienated, non-Indian land. The right-of-way was granted to facilitate
public access to a federal water resource project, forms part of the
State's highway, and is open to the public. Traffic on the highway is
subject to the State's control. The granting instrument details only one
specific reservation to Indian landowners, the right to construct necessary crossings, and the Tribes expressly reserved no other right to exercise dominion or control over the right-of-way. Rather, they have consented to, and received payment for, the State's use of the stretch at
issue, and so long as that stretch is maintained as part of the State's
highway, they cannot assert a landowner's right to occupy and exclude.
Pp. 454-456.

(d) Petitioners refer to no treaty or federal statute authorizing the
Three Affiliated Tribes to entertain highway-accident tort suits of the
kind Fredericks commenced against A-1 and Stockert. Nor have they
shown that Fredericks' tribal-court action qualifies under either of the
exceptions to Montana's general rule. The tortious conduct alleged
by Fredericks does not fit within the first exception for "activities of
nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its
members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases, or other arrangements," 450 U. S., at 565, particularly when measured against the
conduct at issue in the cases cited by Montana, id., at 565-566, as fitting
within the exception, Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 223; Morris v.
Hitchcock, 194 U. S. 384; Buster v. Wright, 135 F. 947, 950; and Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, 152-
154. This dispute is distinctly nontribal in nature, arising between two
non-Indians involved in a run-of-the-mill highway accident. Although

A-1 was engaged in subcontract work on the reservation, and therefore
had a "consensual relationship" with the Tribes, Fredericks was not a
party to the subcontract, and the Tribes were strangers to the accident.
Montana's second exception, concerning conduct that "threatens or has
some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or
the health or welfare of the tribe," 450 U. S., at 566, is also inapplicable.
The cases cited by Montana as stating this exception each raised the
question whether a State's (or Territory's) exercise of authority would
trench unduly on tribal self-government. Fisher v. District Court of
Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U. S. 382, 386; Williams, 358
U. S., at 220; Montana Catholic Missions v. Missoula County, 200 U. S.
118, 128-129; and Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264, 273. Opening the
Tribal Court for Fredericks' optional use is not necessary to protect
tribal self-government; and requiring A-1 and Stockert to defend
against this commonplace state highway accident claim in an unfamiliar
court is not crucial to the Tribes' political integrity, economic security,
or health or welfare. Pp. 456-459.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the adjudicatory authority of tribalcourts over personal injury actions against defendants who

are not tribal members. Specifically, we confront this ques-tion: When an accident occurs on a portion of a public highway maintained by the State under a federally grantedright-of-way over Indian reservation land, may tribal courts
entertain a civil action against an allegedly negligent driverand the driver's employer, neither of whom is a member of
the tribe?Such cases, we hold, fall within state or federal regulatory
and adjudicatory governance; tribal courts may not entertainclaims against nonmembers arising out of accidents on state
highways, absent a statute or treaty authorizing the tribe togovern the conduct of nonmembers on the highway in question. We express no view on the governing law or properforum when an accident occurs on a tribal road within a
reservation. I

In November 1990, petitioner Gisela Fredericks and re-spondent Lyle Stockert were involved in a traffic accident on
a portion of a North Dakota state highway running throughthe Fort Berthold Indian Reservation. The highway strip
crossing the reservation is a 6.59-mile stretch of road, opento the public, affording access to a federal water resource
project. North Dakota maintains the road under a right-oflows: Grant Woods of Arizona, Daniel E. Lungren of California, Gale A.

way granted by the United States to the State's HighwayDepartment; the right-of-way lies on land held by the United

States in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes (Mandan,Hidatsa, and Arikara) and their members.

The accident occurred when Fredericks' automobile col-lided with a gravel truck driven by Stockert and owned
by respondent A-1 Contractors, Stockert's employer. A-1Contractors, a non-Indian-owned enterprise with its principal place of business outside the reservation, was at the timeunder a subcontract with LCM Corporation, a corporation
wholly owned by the Tribes, to do landscaping work relatedto the construction of a tribal community building. A-1
Contractors performed all work under the subcontractwithin the boundaries of the reservation.

1 The record does

not show whether Stockert was engaged in subcontract workat the time of the accident. Neither Stockert nor Fredericks is a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes or an Indian.Fredericks, however, is the widow of a deceased member
of the Tribes and has five adult children who are tribalmembers.

2

Fredericks sustained serious injuries in the accident andwas hospitalized for 24 days. In May 1991, she sued respondents A-1 Contractors and Stockert, as well as A-1 Con-tractors' insurer, in the Tribal Court for the Three Affiliated
Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation. In the same law-suit, Fredericks' five adult children filed a loss-of-consortium

1 Respondents state that the subcontract had forum-selection and
choice-of-law provisions selecting Utah state courts and Utah law for dispute resolution. See Brief for Respondents 2. Petitioners do not contest
this point, but the subcontract is not part of the record in this case.

2 The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit stated that petitioner

Fredericks resides on the reservation. See 76 F. 3d 930, 932 (1996) (en
banc). Respondents assert, however, that there is an unresolved factual
dispute regarding Fredericks' residence at the time of the accident. See
Brief for Respondents 1-2, n. 2; Brief in Opposition 3, n. 4. Under our
disposition of the case, Fredericks' residence at the time of the accident
is immaterial.

claim. Together, Fredericks and her children sought dam-ages exceeding $13 million. App. 8-10.

Respondents and the insurer made a special appearancein the Tribal Court to contest that court's personal and
subject-matter jurisdiction. The Tribal Court ruled that ithad authority to adjudicate Gisela Fredericks' case, and
therefore denied respondents' motion to dismiss the action.
Id., at 24-25.3 Respondents appealed the Tribal Court's ju-risdictional ruling to the Northern Plains Intertribal Court

of Appeals, which affirmed. Id., at 36. Thereafter, pursu-ant to the parties' stipulation, the Tribal Court dismissed the
insurer from the suit. See id., at 38-40.Before Tribal Court proceedings resumed, respondents
commenced this action in the United States District Courtfor the District of North Dakota. Naming as defendants
Fredericks, her adult children, the Tribal Court, and TribalJudge William Strate, respondents sought a declaratory
judgment that, as a matter of federal law, the Tribal Courtlacked jurisdiction to adjudicate Fredericks' claims. The respondents also sought an injunction against further proceed-ings in the Tribal Court. See

id., at 41-45.Relying particularly on this Court's decisions in

NationalFarmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe, 471 U. S. 845 (1985),

and Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. LaPlante, 480 U. S. 9 (1987), theDistrict Court determined that the Tribal Court had civil
jurisdiction over Fredericks' complaint against A-1 Contrac-tors and Stockert; accordingly, on cross-motions for summary
judgment, the District Court dismissed the action. App.54-67. On appeal, a divided panel of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. App. 68-90. The Eighth Circuit granted rehearing en banc and, in
an 8-to-4 decision, reversed the District Court's judgment.

3 Satisfied that it could adjudicate Gisela Fredericks' claims, the Tribal
Court declined to address her adult children's consortium claim, App. 25;
thus, no ruling on that claim is here at issue.

76 F. 3d 930 (1996). The Court of Appeals concluded thatour decision in Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544

(1981), was the controlling precedent, and that, under Mon-tana, the Tribal Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction
over the dispute.4We granted certiorari, 518 U. S. 1056 (1996), and now
affirm. II

Our case law establishes that, absent express authoriza-tion by federal statute or treaty, tribal jurisdiction over the
conduct of nonmembers exists only in limited circumstances.In

Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe, 435 U. S. 191 (1978), theCourt held that Indian tribes lack criminal jurisdiction over

non-Indians.5 Montana v. United States, decided threeyears later, is the pathmarking case concerning tribal civil
authority over nonmembers. Montana concerned the au-thority of the Crow Tribe to regulate hunting and fishing by
non-Indians on lands within the Tribe's reservation owned infee simple by non-Indians. The Court said in

Montana thatthe restriction on tribal criminal jurisdiction recognized in

Oliphant rested on principles that support a more "generalproposition." 450 U. S., at 565. In the main, the Court
explained, "the inherent sovereign powers of an Indiantribe"--those powers a tribe enjoys apart from express provision by treaty or statute--"do not extend to the activities

4 Petitioner Fredericks has commenced a similar lawsuit in a North Dakota state court "to protect her rights against the running of the State's
six-year statute of limitations." Reply Brief 6, n. 2. Respondents assert
that they have answered the complaint and "are prepared to proceed in
that forum." Brief for Respondents 8, n. 6. Respondents also note, without contradiction, that the state forum "is physically much closer by road
to the accident scene . . . than [is] the tribal courthouse." Ibid.

5 In Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 684-685 (1990), we held that Indian

tribes also lack criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians. Shortly
after our decision in Duro, Congress provided for tribal criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians. See 25 U. S. C. $ 1301(2).

of nonmembers of the tribe." Ibid. The Montana opinionadded, however, that in certain circumstances, even where

Congress has not expressly authorized it, tribal civil jurisdic-tion may encompass nonmembers:

"To be sure, Indian tribes retain inherent sovereignpower to exercise some forms of civil jurisdiction over
non-Indians on their reservations, even on non-Indianfee lands. A tribe may regulate, through taxation, licensing, or other means, the activities of nonmemberswho enter consensual relationships with the tribe or its
members, through commercial dealing, contracts, leases,
or other arrangements. A tribe may also retain inher-ent power to exercise civil authority over the conduct of

non-Indians on fee lands within its reservation whenthat conduct threatens or has some direct effect on the
political integrity, the economic security, or the healthor welfare of the tribe."

Id., at 565-566 (citations and
footnote omitted).

The term "non-Indian fee lands," as used in this passage and
throughout the Montana opinion, refers to reservation landacquired in fee simple by non-Indian owners. See

id., at
548.

Montana thus described a general rule that, absent a different congressional direction, Indian tribes lack civil authority over the conduct of nonmembers on non-Indian landwithin a reservation, subject to two exceptions: The first exception relates to nonmembers who enter consensual rela-tionships with the tribe or its members; the second concerns
activity that directly affects the tribe's political integrity,
economic security, health, or welfare. The Montana Court
recognized that the Crow Tribe retained power to limit or
forbid hunting or fishing by nonmembers on land still owned
by or held in trust for the Tribe. Id., at 557. The Court
held, however, that the Tribe lacked authority to regulate
hunting and fishing by non-Indians on land within the Tribe's

reservation owned in fee simple by non-Indians. Id., at

Petitioners and the United States as amicus curiae urge
that Montana does not control this case. They maintain
that the guiding precedents are National Farmers and Iowa
Mutual, and that those decisions establish a rule converse
to Montana's. Whatever Montana may instruct regarding
regulatory authority, they insist, tribal courts retain adjudicatory authority in disputes over occurrences inside a reservation, even when the episode-in-suit involves nonmembers,
unless a treaty or federal statute directs otherwise. Petitioners, further supported by the United States, argue, alternately, that Montana does not cover lands owned by, or held

6 Montana's statement of the governing law figured prominently in
Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S.
408 (1989), and in South Dakota v. Bourland, 508 U. S. 679 (1993). The
Court held in Brendale, 6 to 3, that the Yakima Indian Nation lacked
authority to zone nonmembers' land within an area of the Tribe's reservation open to the general public; almost half the land in the area was owned
in fee by nonmembers. The Court also held, 5 to 4, that the Tribe retained authority to zone fee land in an area of the reservation closed to
the general public. No opinion garnered a majority. Justice White, writing for four Members of the Court, concluded that, under Montana, the
Tribe lacked authority to zone fee land in both the open and closed areas
of the reservation. 492 U. S., at 422-432. Justice Stevens, writing for
two Justices, concluded that the Tribe retained zoning authority over nonmember land only in the closed area. Id., at 443-444. Justice Blackmun,
writing for three Justices, concluded that, under Montana's second exception, the Tribe retained authority to zone fee land in both the open and
the closed areas. Id., at 456-459.

In Bourland, the Court considered whether the Cheyenne River Sioux
Tribe could regulate hunting and fishing by non-Indians in an area within
the Tribe's reservation, but acquired by the United States for the operation of a dam and a reservoir. We determined, dominantly, that no treaty
or statute reserved to the Tribe regulatory authority over the area, see
508 U. S., at 697, and we left for resolution on remand the question
whether either Montana exception applied, see 508 U. S., at 695-696; see
also 39 F. 3d 868, 869-870 (CA8 1994) (decision of divided panel on remand
that neither Montana exception justified regulation by the Tribe).

in trust for, a tribe or its members. Montana holds sway,petitioners say, only with respect to alienated reservation

land owned in fee simple by non-Indians. We address thesearguments in turn.

A
We begin with petitioners' contention that National
Farmers and Iowa Mutual broadly confirm tribal-court civiljurisdiction over claims against nonmembers arising from occurrences on any land within a reservation. We read ourprecedent differently.

National Farmers and Iowa Mu-tual, we conclude, are not at odds with, and do not displace,

Montana. Both decisions describe an exhaustion ruleallowing tribal courts initially to respond to an invocation of
their jurisdiction; neither establishes tribal-court adjudica-tory authority, even over the lawsuits involved in those
cases. Accord, Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands
of Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408, 427, n. 10 (1989) (opinion ofWhite, J.).

National Farmers involved a federal-court challenge to atribal court's jurisdiction over a personal injury action initiated on behalf of a Crow Indian minor against a Montanaschool district. The accident-in-suit occurred when the
minor was struck by a motorcycle in an elementary schoolparking lot. The school occupied land owned by the State
within the Crow Indian Reservation. See 471 U. S., at 847.The school district and its insurer sought a federal-court injunction to stop proceedings in the Crow Tribal Court. See
id., at 848. The District Court granted the injunction, butthe Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that federal courts

lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to entertain such a case.See

id., at 848-849.We reversed the Court of Appeals' judgment and held that

federal courts have authority to determine, as a matter "aris-ing under" federal law, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1331, whether a tribal
court has exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction. See 471U. S., at 852-853. We further held, however, that the fed520US2 Unit: $U48 [09-10-99 18:53:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

449Cite as: 520 U. S. 438 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
eral suit was premature. Ordinarily, we explained, a federal
court should stay its hand "until after the Tribal Court has
had a full opportunity to determine its own jurisdiction."
Id., at 857. Finding no cause for immediate federal-court
intervention,7 we remanded the case, leaving initially to the
District Court the question "[w]hether the federal action
should be dismissed, or merely held in abeyance pending . . .
further Tribal Court proceedings." Ibid.

Petitioners underscore the principal reason we gave in National Farmers for the exhaustion requirement there stated.
Tribal-court jurisdiction over non-Indians in criminal cases
is categorically restricted under Oliphant, we observed,
while in civil matters "the existence and extent of a tribal
court's jurisdiction will require a careful examination of
tribal sovereignty, the extent to which that sovereignty has
been altered, divested, or diminished, as well as a detailed
study of relevant statutes, Executive Branch policy as embodied in treaties and elsewhere, and administrative or judicial decisions." 471 U. S., at 855-856 (footnote omitted).

The Court's recognition in National Farmers that tribal
courts have more extensive jurisdiction in civil cases than
in criminal proceedings, and of the need to inspect relevant
statutes, treaties, and other materials, does not limit Montana's instruction. As the Court made plain in Montana,
the general rule and exceptions there announced govern only
in the absence of a delegation of tribal authority by treaty
or statute. In Montana itself, the Court examined the treaties and legislation relied upon by the Tribe and explained

7 The Court indicated in National Farmers that exhaustion is not an
unyielding requirement:

"We do not suggest that exhaustion would be required where an assertion of tribal jurisdiction `is motivated by a desire to harass or is conducted
in bad faith,' or where the action is patently violative of express jurisdictional prohibitions, or where exhaustion would be futile because of the
lack of an adequate opportunity to challenge the court's jurisdiction." 471
U. S., at 856, n. 21 (citation omitted).

Opinion of the Court
why those measures did not aid the Tribe's case. See 450U. S., at 557-563. Only after and in light of that examination did the Court address the Tribe's assertion of "inherentsovereignty," and formulate, in response to that assertion,
Montana's general rule and exceptions to it. In sum, we do
not extract from National Farmers anything more than aprudential exhaustion rule, in deference to the capacity of

tribal courts "to explain to the parties the precise basis foraccepting [or rejecting] jurisdiction." 471 U. S., at 857.

Iowa Mutual involved an accident in which a member ofthe Blackfeet Indian Tribe was injured while driving a cattle
truck within the boundaries of the reservation. 480 U. S.,
at 11. The injured member was employed by a Montana
corporation that operated a ranch on reservation land owned
by Blackfeet Indians residing on the reservation. See ibid.
The driver and his wife, also a Tribe member, sued in the
Blackfeet Tribal Court, naming several defendants: the Montana corporation that employed the driver; the individual
owners of the ranch; the insurer of the ranch; and an independent insurance adjuster representing the insurer. See
ibid. Over the objection of the insurer and the insurance
adjuster--both companies not owned by members of the
Tribe--the Tribal Court determined that it had jurisdiction
to adjudicate the case. See id., at 12.

Thereafter, the insurer commenced a federal-court action
against the driver, his wife, the Montana corporation, and
the ranch owners. See ibid. Invoking federal jurisdiction

$ 1332, the insurer alleged that it had no duty to defend or
indemnify the Montana corporation or the ranch owners because the injuries asserted by the driver and his wife fell
outside the coverage of the applicable insurance policies.
See 480 U. S., at 12-13. The Federal District Court dismissed the insurer's action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. See id., at
13-14.

Opinion of the Court
We reversed. Holding that the District Court haddiversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction over the insurer's complaint, we remanded, as in National Farmers, for a determi-nation whether "the federal action should be stayed pending
further Tribal Court proceedings or dismissed." 480 U. S.,
at 20, n. 14. The Court recognized in Iowa Mutual that theexhaustion rule stated in

National Farmers was "prudential," not jurisdictional. 480 U. S., at 20, n. 14; see also id.,at 16, n. 8 (stating that "[e]xhaustion is required as a matter

of comity, not as a jurisdictional prerequisite"). Respect fortribal self-government made it appropriate "to give the
tribal court a `full opportunity to determine its own jurisdic-tion.' "

Id., at 16 (quoting National Farmers, 471 U. S., at
857). That respect, the Court reasoned, was equally in
order whether federal-court jurisdiction rested on $ 1331(federal question) or on $ 1332 (diversity of citizenship). 480

U. S., at 17-18. Elaborating on the point, the Court stated:

"Tribal authority over the activities of non-Indians on
reservation lands is an important part of tribal sover-eignty. See

Montana v. United States, 450 U. S. 544,
565-566 (1981); Washington v. Confederated Tribes of
Colville Indian Reservation, 447 U. S. 134, 152-153
(1980); Fisher v. District Court [of Sixteenth Judicial
Dist. of Mont.], 424 U. S. [382,] 387-389 [(1976)]. Civil
jurisdiction over such activities presumptively lies in thetribal courts unless affirmatively limited by a specific

treaty provision or federal statute. . . . In the absence
of any indication that Congress intended the diversitystatute to limit the jurisdiction of the tribal courts, we

decline petitioner's invitation to hold that tribal sovereignty can be impaired in this fashion." Id., at 18.

Petitioners and the United States fasten upon the Court's
statement that "[c]ivil jurisdiction over such activities
presumptively lies in the tribal courts." Read in context,
however, this language scarcely supports the view that the

520US2 Unit: $U48 [09-10-99 18:53:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
452 STRATE v. A-1 CONTRACTORS

Opinion of the Court
Montana rule does not bear on tribal-court adjudicatory
authority in cases involving nonmember defendants.

The statement stressed by petitioners and the United
States was made in refutation of the argument that "Congress intended the diversity statute to limit the jurisdiction
of the tribal courts." 480 U. S., at 18. The statement is
preceded by three informative citations. The first citation
points to the passage in Montana in which the Court advanced "the general proposition that the inherent sovereign
powers of an Indian tribe do not extend to the activities of
nonmembers of the tribe," 450 U. S., at 565, with two prime
exceptions, id., at 565-566. The case cited second is Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 447
U. S. 134 (1980), a decision the Montana Court listed as illustrative of the first Montana exception, applicable to "nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the tribe
or its members," 450 U. S., at 565-566; the Court in Colville
acknowledged inherent tribal authority to tax "non-Indians
entering the reservation to engage in economic activity," 447
U. S., at 153. The third case noted in conjunction with the
Iowa Mutual statement is Fisher v. District Court of Sixteenth Judicial Dist. of Mont., 424 U. S. 382 (1976) (per curiam), a decision the Montana Court cited in support of the
second Montana exception, covering on-reservation activity
of nonmembers bearing directly "on the political integrity,
the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe."
450 U. S., at 566. The Court held in Fisher that a tribal
court had exclusive jurisdiction over an adoption proceeding
when all parties were members of the tribe and resided on
its reservation. See 424 U. S., at 383, 389. State-court jurisdiction over such matters, the Court said, "plainly would
interfere with the powers of self-government conferred upon
the . . . Tribe and exercised through the Tribal Court." Id.,
at 387. The Court observed in Fisher that state courts
may not exercise jurisdiction over disputes arising out of

520US2 Unit: $U48 [09-10-99 18:53:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

453Cite as: 520 U. S. 438 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
on-reservation conduct--even over matters involving nonIndians--if doing so would " `infring[e] on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by
them.' " Id., at 386 (citation omitted).

In light of the citation of Montana, Colville, and Fisher,
the Iowa Mutual statement emphasized by petitioners does
not limit the Montana rule. In keeping with the precedent
to which Iowa Mutual refers, the statement stands for nothing more than the unremarkable proposition that, where
tribes possess authority to regulate the activities of nonmembers, "[c]ivil jurisdiction over [disputes arising out of]
such activities presumptively lies in the tribal courts." 480
U. S., at 18.

Recognizing that our precedent has been variously interpreted, we reiterate that National Farmers and Iowa Mutual enunciate only an exhaustion requirement, a "prudential
rule," see Iowa Mutual, 480 U. S., at 20, n. 14, based on comity, see id., at 16, n. 8. These decisions do not expand or
stand apart from Montana's instruction on "the inherent
sovereign powers of an Indian tribe." 450 U. S., at 565.
While Montana immediately involved regulatory authority,
the Court broadly addressed the concept of "inherent sovereignty." Id., at 563. Regarding activity on non-Indian fee
land within a reservation, Montana delineated--in a main
rule and exceptions--the bounds of the power tribes retain
to exercise "forms of civil jurisdiction over non-Indians."
Id., at 565. As to nonmembers, we hold, a tribe's adjudicative jurisdiction does not exceed its legislative jurisdiction.
Absent congressional direction enlarging tribal-court jurisdiction, we adhere to that understanding. Subject to controlling provisions in treaties and statutes, and the two exceptions identified in Montana, the civil authority of Indian
tribes and their courts with respect to non-Indian fee lands
generally "do[es] not extend to the activities of nonmembers
of the tribe." Ibid.

Opinion of the Court

B
We consider next the argument that Montana does not
govern this case because the land underlying the scene of
the accident is held in trust for the Three Affiliated Tribes
and their members. Petitioners and the United States point
out that in Montana, as in later cases following Montana's
instruction--Brendale v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of
Yakima Nation, 492 U. S. 408 (1989), and South Dakota v.
Bourland, 508 U. S. 679 (1993), described supra, at 447,
n. 6--the challenged tribal authority related to nonmember
activity on alienated, non-Indian reservation land. We "can
readily agree," in accord with Montana, 450 U. S., at 557,
that tribes retain considerable control over nonmember conduct on tribal land.8 On the particular matter before us,
however, we agree with respondents: The right-of-way
North Dakota acquired for the State's highway renders the
6.59-mile stretch equivalent, for nonmember governance purposes,9 to alienated, non-Indian land.

Congress authorized grants of rights-of-way over Indian
lands in 1948 legislation. Act of Feb. 5, 1948, ch. 45, 62 Stat.
17, 25 U. S. C. $$ 323-328. A grant over land belonging to a
tribe requires "consent of the proper tribal officials," $ 324,

8 Petitioners note in this regard the Court's unqualified recognition in
Montana that "the Tribe may prohibit nonmembers from hunting or fishing on land belonging to the Tribe or held by the United States in trust for
the Tribe." 450 U. S., at 557. The question addressed was "the power of
the Tribe to regulate non-Indian fishing and hunting on reservation land
owned in fee by nonmembers of the Tribe." Ibid.; see Brief for Petitioners 15-16.

9 For contextual treatment of rights-of-way over Indian land, compare

18 U. S. C. $ 1151 (defining "Indian country" in criminal law chapter generally to include "rights-of-way running through [a] reservation") with

$$ 1154(c) and 1156 (term "Indian country," as used in sections on dispensation and possession of intoxicants, "does not include . . . rights-of-way
through Indian reservations").

and the payment of just compensation, $ 325.10 The grantinvolved in this case was made, pursuant to the federal statute, in 1970. Its purpose was to facilitate public access toLake Sakakawea, a federal water resource project under the
control of the Army Corps of Engineers.In the granting instrument, the United States conveyed to
North Dakota "an easement for a right-of-way for the re-alignment and improvement of North Dakota State Highway
No. 8 over, across and upon [specified] lands." App. to Brieffor Respondents 1. The grant provides that the State's
"easement is subject to any valid existing right or adverseclaim and is without limitation as to tenure, so long as said
easement shall be actually used for the purpose . . . speci-fied." Id., at 3. The granting instrument details only one
specific reservation to Indian landowners:

"The right is reserved to the Indian land owners, theirlessees, successors, and assigns to construct crossings of

the right-of-way at all points reasonably necessary tothe undisturbed use and occupan[cy] of the premises affected by the right-of-way; such crossings to be con-structed and maintained by the owners or lawful occupants and users of said lands at their own risk and saidoccupants and users to assume full responsibility for
avoiding, or repairing any damage to the right-of-way,which may be occasioned by such crossings." Id., at
3-4.
Apart from this specification, the Three Affiliated Tribes ex-pressly reserved no right to exercise dominion or control

over the right-of-way.Forming part of the State's highway, the right-of-way is
open to the public, and traffic on it is subject to the State's

10 Rights-of-way granted over lands of individual Indians also require
payment of compensation, 25 U. S. C. $ 325, and ordinarily require consent
of the individual owners, see $ 324 (describing circumstances in which
rights-of-way may be granted without the consent of owners).

Opinion of the Court
control.11 The Tribes have consented to, and received pay-ment for, the State's use of the 6.59-mile stretch for a public

highway. They have retained no gatekeeping right. Solong as the stretch is maintained as part of the State's highway, the Tribes cannot assert a landowner's right to occupyand exclude. Cf.

Bourland, 508 U. S., at 689 (regarding res-ervation land acquired by the United States for operation of

a dam and a reservoir, Tribe's loss of "right of absolute andexclusive use and occupation . . . implies the loss of regulatory jurisdiction over the use of the land by others"). Wetherefore align the right-of-way, for the purpose at hand,
with land alienated to non-Indians. Our decision in Montana, accordingly, governs this case.

III
Petitioners and the United States refer to no treaty orstatute authorizing the Three Affiliated Tribes to entertain

highway-accident tort suits of the kind Fredericks com-menced against A-1 Contractors and Stockert. Rather,
petitioners and the United States ground their defense oftribal-court jurisdiction exclusively on the concept of retained or inherent sovereignty. Montana, we have ex-plained, is the controlling decision for this case. To prevail
here, petitioners must show that Fredericks' tribal-court ac-tion against nonmembers qualifies under one of Montana's
two exceptions.The first exception to the Montana rule covers "activities
of nonmembers who enter consensual relationships with the

11 We do not here question the authority of tribal police to patrol roads
within a reservation, including rights-of-way made part of a state highway,
and to detain and turn over to state officers nonmembers stopped on the
highway for conduct violating state law. Cf. State v. Schmuck, 121
Wash. 2d 373, 390, 850 P. 2d 1332, 1341 (en banc) (recognizing that a limited
tribal power "to stop and detain alleged offenders in no way confers an
unlimited authority to regulate the right of the public to travel on the
Reservation's roads"), cert. denied, 510 U. S. 931 (1993).

Opinion of the Court
tribe or its members, through commercial dealing, contracts,leases, or other arrangements." 450 U. S., at 565. The tortious conduct alleged in Fredericks' complaint does not fitthat description. The dispute, as the Court of Appeals said,
is "distinctly non-tribal in nature." 76 F. 3d, at 940. It
"arose between two non-Indians involved in [a] run-of-the-mill [highway] accident."

Ibid. Although A-1 was engaged in subcontract work on the Fort Berthold Reservation,and therefore had a "consensual relationship" with the

Tribes, "Gisela Fredericks was not a party to the subcon-tract, and the [T]ribes were strangers to the accident."
Ibid.

Montana's list of cases fitting within the first exception,
see 450 U. S., at 565-566, indicates the type of activities the
Court had in mind: Williams v. Lee, 358 U. S. 217, 223 (1959)
(declaring tribal jurisdiction exclusive over lawsuit arising
out of on-reservation sales transaction between nonmember
plaintiff and member defendants); Morris v. Hitchcock, 194
U. S. 384 (1904) (upholding tribal permit tax on nonmemberowned livestock within boundaries of the Chickasaw Nation);
Buster v. Wright, 135 F. 947, 950 (CA8 1905) (upholding
Tribe's permit tax on nonmembers for the privilege of conducting business within Tribe's borders; court characterized
as "inherent" the Tribe's "authority . . . to prescribe the
terms upon which noncitizens may transact business within
its borders"); Colville, 447 U. S., at 152-154 (tribal authority
to tax on-reservation cigarette sales to nonmembers "is a
fundamental attribute of sovereignty which the tribes retain
unless divested of it by federal law or necessary implication
of their dependent status"). Measured against these cases,
the Fredericks-Stockert highway accident presents no "consensual relationship" of the qualifying kind.

The second exception to Montana's general rule concerns
conduct that "threatens or has some direct effect on the political integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare of the tribe." 450 U. S., at 566. Undoubtedly, those

Opinion of the Court
who drive carelessly on a public highway running through areservation endanger all in the vicinity, and surely jeopardize the safety of tribal members. But if Montana's secondexception requires no more, the exception would severely
shrink the rule. Again, cases cited in Montana indicate the
character of the tribal interest the Court envisioned.The Court's statement of

Montana's second exceptional
category is followed by citation of four cases, ibid.; each ofthose cases raised the question whether a State's (or Territory's) exercise of authority would trench unduly on tribalself-government. In two of the cases, the Court held that a
State's exercise of authority would so intrude, and in two,
the Court saw no impermissible intrusion.

The Court referred first to the decision recognizing the
exclusive competence of a tribal court over an adoption proceeding when all parties belonged to the Tribe and resided
on its reservation. See Fisher, 424 U. S., at 386; supra, at
452-453. Next, the Court listed a decision holding a tribal
court exclusively competent to adjudicate a claim by a nonIndian merchant seeking payment from tribe members for
goods bought on credit at an on-reservation store. See Williams, 358 U. S., at 220 ("[A]bsent governing Acts of Congress, the question [of state-court jurisdiction over onreservation conduct] has always been whether the state
action infringed on the right of reservation Indians to make
their own laws and be ruled by them."). Thereafter, the
Court referred to two decisions dealing with objections to a
county or territorial government's imposition of a property
tax on non-Indian-owned livestock that grazed on reservation land; in neither case did the Court find a significant
tribal interest at stake. See Montana Catholic Missions v.
Missoula County, 200 U. S. 118, 128-129 (1906) ("the Indians'
interest in this kind of property [livestock], situated on their
reservations, was not sufficient to exempt such property,
when owned by private individuals, from [state or territorial]
taxation"); Thomas v. Gay, 169 U. S. 264, 273 (1898) ("[terri520US2 Unit: $U48 [09-10-99 18:53:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
torial] tax put upon the cattle of [non-Indian] lessees is tooremote and indirect to be deemed a tax upon the lands or

privileges of the Indians").Read in isolation, the Montana rule's second exception can
be misperceived. Key to its proper application, however, isthe Court's preface: "Indian tribes retain their inherent
power [to punish tribal offenders,] to determine tribal mem-bership, to regulate domestic relations among members, and
to prescribe rules of inheritance for members. . . . But [atribe's inherent power does not reach] beyond what is necessary to protect tribal self-government or to control internalrelations." 450 U. S., at 564. Neither regulatory nor adjudicatory authority over the state highway accident at issueis needed to preserve "the right of reservation Indians to
make their own laws and be ruled by them." Williams, 358U. S., at 220. The Montana rule, therefore, and not its
exceptions, applies to this case.Gisela Fredericks may pursue her case against A-1 Contractors and Stockert in the state forum open to all who sus-tain injuries on North Dakota's highway.

12 Opening the

Tribal Court for her optional use is not necessary to protecttribal self-government; and requiring A-1 and Stockert to

defend against this commonplace state highway accidentclaim in an unfamiliar court

13 is not crucial to "the political

integrity, the economic security, or the health or welfare ofthe [Three Affiliated Tribes]." Montana, 450 U. S., at 566.

14

12 See supra, at 445, n. 4.
13 Within the federal system, when nonresidents are the sole defendants

in a suit filed in state court, the defendants ordinarily may remove the
case to federal court. See 28 U. S. C. $ 1441.

14 When, as in this case, it is plain that no federal grant provides for

tribal governance of nonmembers' conduct on land covered by Montana's
main rule, it will be equally evident that tribal courts lack adjudicatory
authority over disputes arising from such conduct. As in criminal proceedings, state or federal courts will be the only forums competent to
adjudicate those disputes. See National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v.
Crow Tribe, 471 U. S. 845, 854 (1985). Therefore, when tribal-court juris520US2 Unit: $U48 [09-10-99 18:53:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 96-203. Argued February 25, 1997--Decided May 12, 1997
Petitioner Johnson testified before a federal grand jury, investigating,

inter alia, the disposition of proceeds from her boyfriend's alleged drug
trafficking, that she had obtained tens of thousands of dollars to improve
her home from a box of cash given her late mother by one Talcott.
Subsequently, she was charged with violating 18 U. S. C. $ 1623, which
proscribes "knowingly mak[ing] any false material declaration" under
oath before a grand jury. At her trial, it was revealed that her boyfriend had negotiated the purchase of her home and had an interest in
a corporation whose checks had been used to help pay for the property,
and that Talcott had died several years before the time he allegedly
gave her mother the money. Johnson did not object when, in accordance with then-extant Circuit precedent, the judge instructed the jury
that materiality was a question for him to decide, and that he had determined that her statements were material. Johnson was convicted of
perjury, but before her appeal, this Court ruled, in United States v.
Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, that the materiality of a false statement must be
decided by a jury rather than a trial judge. On appeal, Johnson's claim
that her conviction was invalid under Gaudin was reviewed by the Eleventh Circuit pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b),
which allows plain errors affecting substantial rights to be noticed even
though no objection has been made. Following the analysis outlined in
United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, the court assumed, arguendo, that
the District Court's failure to submit materiality to the jury constituted
"error" that was "clear or obvious." However, it concluded that any
such error did not affect "substantial rights" because its independent
review of the record showed that there was "overwhelming" evidence
of materiality and that no reasonable juror could conclude that Johnson's
false statements about the money's source were not material to the
grand jury's investigation.

Held: The trial court's action in this case was not "plain error" of the sort

which an appellate court may notice under Rule 52(b).

(a) Since $ 1623's text leaves no doubt that materiality is an element
of perjury, Gaudin dictates that materiality in this case be decided by
the jury, not the court. Johnson's failure to timely assert that right
before the trial court ordinarily would result in forfeiture of the right

520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
462 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Syllabus
pursuant to Rule 30. However, Rule 52(b) mitigates Rule 30 and, contrary to Johnson's argument, governs her direct appeal. The Olano
test for applying Rule 52(b) requires that there be (1) error, (2) that is
plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If these three conditions
are met, an appellate court may exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Pp. 465-466.

(b) The first prong of Olano is satisfied here, as Gaudin must be applied to Johnson's case on direct review. See Griffith v. Kentucky, 479
U. S. 314, 328. The second prong is met as well. In a case such as
this--where the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary
to the law at the time of appeal--it is sufficient that the error be plain
at the time of appellate consideration. Even assuming that the third
prong is also satisfied, a court must still determine whether the forfeited
error meets the fourth prong before it may exercise its discretion to
correct the error. In this case the fourth question must be answered
in the negative. Materiality was essentially uncontroverted at trial and
has remained so on appeal. Johnson has presented no plausible argument that her false statement under oath--lying about the source of
the money she used to improve her home--was somehow not material to the grand jury investigation. It would be the reversal of her
conviction, not the failure to notice the error, that would seriously
affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. Pp. 466-470.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.*

In this case the trial court itself decided the issue of mate-riality in a perjury prosecution, rather than submitting it
to the jury as our decision in United States v. Gaudin, 515U. S. 506 (1995), now requires. No objection was made by
the petitioner, Joyce B. Johnson, and we hold that the court'saction in this case was not "plain error" of the sort which an
appellate court may notice under Federal Rule of CriminalProcedure 52(b).

In the late 1980's, a federal investigation into the cocaineand marijuana trafficking of Earl James Fields revealed that
he and his partner had amassed some $10 million from theirillicit activities. Following the money trail, federal authorities subpoenaed Johnson, Fields' long-time girlfriend, to tes-tify before a federal grand jury. Johnson, who is the mother
of a child by Fields, earned about $34,000 a year at the Flor-ida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. She
testified before the grand jury that she owned five pieces ofreal property, including her house. That house was purchased by Johnson in 1991 for $75,600, and in the next twoyears she added sufficient improvements to it that in 1993
it was appraised at $344,800. When asked the source of herhome improvement funds, Johnson stated that she had put
$80,000 to $120,000 into her house, all of which had comefrom a box of cash given her late mother by one Gerald Talcott in 1985 or 1986.On the basis of this testimony, Johnson was indicted for
perjury under 18 U. S. C. $ 1623. At trial, it was revealedthat Fields had negotiated the original purchase of Johnson's
home and that Johnson had paid for the property with eightdifferent cashier's checks, including two from a corporation
in which Fields had an interest. It was also established thatGerald Talcott had died in April 1982, several years before

464 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
the time Johnson claimed he had given her mother the boxfull of cash.

At the close of Johnson's trial, and in accordance withthen-extant Circuit precedent, see,

e. g., United States v.
Molinares, 700 F. 2d 647, 653 (CA11 1983), the District Judge
instructed the jury that the element of materiality was aquestion for the judge to decide, and that he had determined

that her statements were material. App. 72. Johnson didnot object to this instruction. Indeed, when the prosecution
had presented evidence concerning materiality during thetrial, she had then objected, on the ground that materiality
was a matter for the judge, and not the jury, to decide. Id.,at 61. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and Johnson
was sentenced to 30 months' imprisonment, three years' supervised release, and a $30,000 fine.After Johnson was convicted, but before her appeal to the

Court of Appeals, we decided United States v. Gaudin,
supra, which held that the materiality of a false statement
must be submitted to the jury rather than decided by thetrial judge. On her appeal, Johnson argued that the trial

judge's failure to submit materiality to the jury rendered herconviction invalid under

Gaudin.
Because Johnson had failed to object to the trial judge's
deciding materiality, the Court of Appeals for the EleventhCircuit reviewed for plain error. Rule 52(b) of the Federal

Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:

"Plain Error. Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were notbrought to the attention of the court."

Following our analysis in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S.
725 (1993), the Court of Appeals assumed, arguendo, that
the District Court's failure to submit materiality to the jury
constituted "error" that was "clear or obvious," but concluded nonetheless that any such error did not affect the
"substantial rights" of the defendant. That conclusion was

Opinion of the Court
based on the court's independent review of the record anddetermination that there was "overwhelming" evidence of

materiality and that "[n]o reasonable juror could concludethat Johnson's false statements about the source of the
money . . . were not material to the grand jury's investiga-tion." App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a ( judgt. order reported at
82 F. 3d 429 (CA11 1996)). Due to the conflict between thisdecision and the Ninth Circuit's en banc decision in

UnitedStates v. Keys, 95 F. 3d 874 (1996), we granted certiorari.

519 U. S. 989 (1996). We now affirm.

I
Title 18 U. S. C. $ 1623 proscribes "knowingly mak[ing] anyfalse material declaration" under oath before a grand jury.

Although we merely assumed in Gaudin that materiality isan element of making a false statement under 18 U. S. C.

$ 1001, and although we recently held that materiality is notan element of making a false statement to a federally insured
bank under 18 U. S. C. $ 1014, United States v. Wells, 519U. S. 482 (1997), there is no doubt that materiality is an element of perjury under $ 1623. The statutory text expresslyrequires that the false declaration be "material." Gaudin
therefore dictates that materiality be decided by the jury,not the court.

Petitioner, however, did not object to the trial court'streatment of materiality. Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure provides: "No party may assign as errorany portion of the [ jury] charge or omission therefrom unless
that party objects thereto before the jury retires to considerits verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which that party
objects and the grounds of the objection." This Rule is sim-ply the embodiment of the "familiar" principle that a right
" `may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by thefailure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal
having jurisdiction to determine it.' " Olano, supra, at 731(quoting Yakus v. United States, 321 U. S. 414, 444 (1944)).

466 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
The Rule is mitigated, however, by Rule 52(b), which allowsplain errors affecting substantial rights to be noticed even

though there was no objection.Petitioner argues that she need not fall within the "limited" and "circumscribed" strictures of Olano, because theerror she complains of here is "structural," and so is outside
Rule 52(b) altogether. But the seriousness of the errorclaimed does not remove consideration of it from the ambit
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. None of thecases discussing "structural error," upon which petitioner relies, were direct appeals from judgments of conviction in thefederal system. Several came from state courts which had
considered the claimed error under their own rules. SeeGideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279 (1991); Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508U. S. 275 (1993). Others came here by way of federal habeas
challenges to state convictions. See Vasquez v. Hillery, 474U. S. 254 (1986); McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U. S. 168 (1984).
None of them were subject to the provisions of Rule 52.But it is that Rule which by its terms governs direct appeals from judgments of conviction in the federal system,and therefore governs this case. We cautioned against any
unwarranted expansion of Rule 52(b) in United States v.
Young, 470 U. S. 1 (1985), because it "would skew the Rule's`careful balancing of our need to encourage all trial participants to seek a fair and accurate trial the first time aroundagainst our insistence that obvious injustice be promptly redressed,' " id., at 15 (quoting United States v. Frady, 456U. S. 152, 163 (1982)). Even less appropriate than an unwarranted expansion of the Rule would be the creation out ofwhole cloth of an exception to it, an exception which we have
no authority to make. See Carlisle v. United States, 517U. S. 416, 425-426 (1996).

II
We therefore turn to apply here Rule 52(b) as outlined inOlano. Under that test, before an appellate court can cor520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN

467Cite as: 520 U. S. 461 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
rect an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) "error,"
(2) that is "plain," and (3) that "affect[s] substantial rights."
507 U. S., at 732. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error " ` "seriously affect[s] the
fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings." ' " Ibid. (quoting United States v. Young, supra, at
15, in turn quoting United States v. Atkinson, 297 U. S. 157,
160 (1936)).

A

There is no doubt that if petitioner's trial occurred today,
the failure to submit materiality to the jury would be error
under Gaudin. Under Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U. S. 314
(1987), a "new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions
is to be applied retroactively to all cases . . . pending on
direct review . . . , with no exception for cases in which the
new rule constitutes a `clear break' with the past." Id., at
328. Because petitioner is still on direct review, Griffith
requires that we apply Gaudin retroactively. Accordingly,
under Gaudin there was "error," and the first prong of
Olano is satisfied.

B

The second prong is more difficult. Olano explained that
the word "plain" is "synonymous with `clear' or, equivalently,
`obvious.' " 507 U. S., at 734. But Olano refrained from deciding when an error must be plain to be reviewable. "At a
minimum," Olano concluded, the error must be plain "under
current law." Ibid. In the case with which we are faced

today, the error is certainly clear under "current law," but it
was by no means clear at the time of trial.

The Government contends that for an error to be "plain,"
it must have been so both at the time of trial and at the time
of appellate consideration. In this case, it says, petitioner
should have objected to the court's deciding the issue of materiality, even though near-uniform precedent both from this

520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
468 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Court and from the Courts of Appeals held that courseproper.

1 Petitioner, on the other hand, urges that such a

rule would result in counsel's inevitably making a long andvirtually useless laundry list of objections to rulings that

were plainly supported by existing precedent. We agreewith petitioner on this point, and hold that in a case such as
this--where the law at the time of trial was settled andclearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal--it is enough
that an error be "plain" at the time of appellate consider-ation. Here, at the time of trial it was settled that the issue
of materiality was to be decided by the court, not the jury;by the time of appellate consideration, the law had changed,
and it is now settled that materiality is an issue for the jury.The second part of the Olano test is therefore satisfied.

C
But even though the error be "plain," it must also "affec[t]substantial rights." It is at this point that petitioner's argument that the failure to submit an element of the offense tothe jury is "structural error" becomes relevant. She contends in effect that if an error is so serious as to defyharmless-error analysis, it must also "affec[t] substantial
rights." A "structural" error, we explained in Arizona v.
Fulminante, is a "defect affecting the framework withinwhich the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the

trial process itself," 499 U. S., at 310. We have found struc-tural errors only in a very limited class of cases: See Gideon

v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963) (a total deprivation of theright to counsel); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510 (1927) (lack

of an impartial trial judge); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254(1986) (unlawful exclusion of grand jurors of defendant's

508 U. S. 275 (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instructionto jury).

It is by no means clear that the error here fits within thislimited class of cases. Sullivan v. Louisiana, the case most
closely on point, held that the erroneous definition of "rea-sonable doubt" vitiated all of the jury's findings because one
could only speculate what a properly charged jury mighthave done.

Id., at 280. The failure to submit materialityto the jury, as in this case, can just as easily be analogized

to improperly instructing the jury on an element of the of-fense, e. g., Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391 (1991); Carella v.
California, 491 U. S. 263 (1989) (per curiam); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497 (1987); Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570 (1986),an error which is subject to harmless-error analysis, as it can

be to failing to give a proper reasonable-doubt instructionaltogether. Cf. California v. Roy, 519 U. S. 2, 5 (1996)
(per curiam) ("The specific error at issue here--an error inthe instruction that defined the crime--is . . . as easily characterized as a `misdescription of an element' of the crime, asit is characterized as an error of `omission' ").

D
But we need not decide that question because, even assum-ing that the failure to submit materiality to the jury "affec[ted] substantial rights," it does not meet the final re-quirement of

Olano. When the first three parts of Olanoare satisfied, an appellate court must then determine

whether the forfeited error " `seriously affect[s] the fairness,integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings' " before

520US2 Unit: $U49 [09-10-99 18:55:27] PAGES PGT: OPIN
470 JOHNSON v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
it may exercise its discretion to correct the error. Olano,507 U. S., at 736 (quoting

Atkinson, 297 U. S., at 160).
In this case that question must be answered in the nega-tive. As the Court of Appeals noted, the evidence supporting materiality was "overwhelming." App. to Pet. for Cert.
9a. Materiality was essentially uncontroverted at trial 2 andhas remained so on appeal. The grand jury here was investigating petitioner's long-time boyfriend's alleged cocaineand marijuana trafficking and the "disposition of money
which was proceeds of this cocaine and [marijuana] distri-bution activity, including the possible concealment of such
proceeds as investments in real estate." App. 5-6. Beforethe Eleventh Circuit and in her briefing before this Court,
petitioner has presented no plausible argument that the falsestatement under oath for which she was convicted--lying
about the source of the tens of thousands of dollars she used
to improve her home--was somehow not material to thegrand jury investigation.

On this record there is no basis for concluding that the
error "seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity or public
reputation of judicial proceedings." Indeed, it would be the
reversal of a conviction such as this which would have that
effect. "Reversal for error, regardless of its effect on the
judgment, encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process
and bestirs the public to ridicule it." R. Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error 50 (1970). No "miscarriage of justice"
will result here if we do not notice the error, Olano, supra,
at 736, and we decline to do so. The judgment of the Court
of Appeals is therefore Affirmed.

2 The Government represents--and petitioner has not disputed--that
the sum total of petitioner's argument at trial concerning materiality consisted of the following conclusory sentence: " `I would argue that the element of materiality has been insufficiently proven and that the Court
ought to grant a judgment of acquittal.' " Brief for United States 5 (quoting trial transcript); see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, n. 5.

RENO, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. BOSSIER PARISHSCHOOL BOARD

et al.

appeal from the united states district court for thedistrict of columbia

No. 95-1455. Argued December 9, 1996--Decided May 12, 1997*
Appellee Bossier Parish School Board (Board) is subject to the preclearance requirements of $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (Act) and
must therefore obtain the approval of either the United States Attorney
General or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia
before implementing any changes to a voting "qualification, prerequisite,
standard, practice, or procedure." Based on the 1990 census, the Board
redrew its 12 single-member districts, adopting the redistricting plan
that the Attorney General had recently precleared for use in elections
of the parish's primary governing body (the Jury plan). In doing so,
the Board rejected a plan proposed by the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which would have created
two majority-black districts. The Attorney General objected to preclearance, finding that the NAACP plan, which had not been available
when the Jury plan was originally approved, demonstrated that black
residents were sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to
constitute a majority in two districts; that, compared with this alternative, the Board's plan unnecessarily limited the opportunity for minority voters to elect their candidates of choice and thereby diluted
their voting strength in violation of $ 2 of the Act; and that the Attorney General must withhold preclearance where necessary to prevent
a clear $ 2 violation. The Board then filed this action with the District Court, and appellant Price and others intervened as defendants.
A three-judge panel granted the preclearance request, rejecting appellants' contention that a voting change's failure to satisfy $ 2 constituted
an independent reason to deny preclearance under $ 5 and their related
argument that a court must still consider evidence of a $ 2 violation as
evidence of discriminatory purpose under $ 5.

Held:

1. Preclearance under $ 5 may not be denied solely on the basis that
a covered jurisdiction's new voting "standard, practice, or procedure"
violates $ 2. This Court has consistently understood $ 5 and $ 2 to com*Together with No. 95-1508, Price et al. v. Bossier Parish School Board

Syllabus
bat different evils and, accordingly, to impose very different duties upon
the States. See Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 883 (plurality opinion).
Section 5 freezes election procedures in a covered jurisdiction until that
jurisdiction proves that its proposed changes do not have the purpose,
and will not have the effect, of denying or abridging the right to vote
on account of race. See Beer v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 140. It is
designed to combat only those effects that are retrogressive. Retrogression, by definition, requires a comparison of a jurisdiction's new voting plan with its existing plan, see Holder, supra, at 883 (plurality opinion), and necessarily implies that the jurisdiction's existing plan is the
benchmark against which the "effect" of voting changes is measured.
Section 2, on the other hand, applies in all jurisdictions and uses as its
benchmark for comparison in vote dilution claims a hypothetical, undiluted plan. Making compliance with $ 5 contingent upon compliance
with $ 2, as appellants urge, would, for all intents and purposes, replace
the standards for $ 5 with those for $ 2, thus contradicting more than 20
years of precedent interpreting $ 5. See, e. g., Beer, supra. Appellants' contentions that their reading of $ 5 is supported by the Beer decision, by the Attorney General's regulations, and by public policy considerations are rejected. Pp. 476-485.

2. Evidence showing that a jurisdiction's redistricting plan dilutes minorities' voting power may be relevant to establish a jurisdiction's "intent to retrogress" under $ 5, so there is no need to decide today whether
such evidence is relevant to establish other types of discriminatory intent or whether $ 5's purpose inquiry ever extends beyond the search
for retrogressive intent. Because this Court cannot say with confidence
that the District Court considered the evidence proffered to show that
the Board's reapportionment plan was dilutive, this aspect of that court's
holding must be vacated. Pp. 486-490.

(a) Section 2 evidence may be "relevant" within the meaning of
Federal Rule of Evidence 401, for the fact that a plan has a dilutive
impact makes it "more probable" that the jurisdiction adopting that plan
acted with an intent to retrogress than "it would be without the evidence." This does not, of course, mean that evidence of a plan's dilutive
impact is dispositive of the $ 5 purpose inquiry. Indeed, if it were, $ 2
would be effectively incorporated into $ 5, a result this Court finds unsatisfactory. In conducting their inquiry into a jurisdiction's motivation
in enacting voting changes, courts should look for guidance to Arlington
Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252,
which sets forth a framework for examining discriminatory purpose.
Pp. 486-489.

(b) This Court is unable to determine whether the District Court
deemed irrelevant all evidence of the dilutive impact of the redistricting

plan adopted by the Board. While some language in its opinion is consistent with today's holding that the existence of less dilutive options
was at least relevant to the purpose inquiry, the District Court also
appears to have endorsed the notion that dilutive impact evidence is
irrelevant even to an inquiry into retrogressive intent. The District
Court will have the opportunity to apply the Arlington Heights test on
remand as well as to address appellants' additional arguments that it
erred in refusing to consider evidence that the Board was in violation
of an ongoing injunction to remedy any remaining vestiges of a dual
school system. Pp. 489-490.

474 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.

Opinion of the Court
Justice O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court.
Today we clarify the relationship between $ 2 and $ 5 ofthe Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, 439, as amended,

42 U. S. C. $$ 1973, 1973c. Specifically, we decide two ques-tions: (i) whether preclearance must be denied under $ 5
whenever a covered jurisdiction's new voting "standard,practice, or procedure" violates $ 2; and (ii) whether evidence
that a new "standard, practice, or procedure" has a dilutiveimpact is always irrelevant to the inquiry whether the covered jurisdiction acted with "the purpose . . . of denying orabridging the right to vote on account of race or color" under

$ 5. We answer both in the negative.

I
Appellee Bossier Parish School Board (Board) is a jurisdic-tion subject to the preclearance requirements of $ 5 of the

Voting Rights Act of 1965, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, and musttherefore obtain the approval of either the United States Attorney General or the United States District Court for theDistrict of Columbia before implementing any changes to a
voting "qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or pro-cedure." The Board has 12 members who are elected from
single-member districts by majority vote to serve 4-yearterms. When the 1990 census revealed wide population disparities among its districts, see App. to Juris. Statement 93a(Stipulations of Fact and Law || 82), the Board decided to
redraw the districts to equalize the population distribution.During this process, the Board considered two redistricting plans. It considered, and initially rejected, the redis-tricting plan that had been recently adopted by the Bossier
Parish Police Jury, the parish's primary governing body (theJury plan), to govern its own elections. Just months before,
the Attorney General had precleared the Jury plan, whichalso contained 12 districts. Id., at 88a (Stipulations || 68).
None of the 12 districts in the Board's existing plan or in theJury plan contained a majority of black residents. Id., at

Opinion of the Court
93a (Stipulations || 82) (under 1990 population statistics inthe Board's existing districts, the three districts with highest

black concentrations contain 46.63%, 43.79%, and 30.13%black residents, respectively);

id., at 85a (Stipulations || 59)
(population statistics for the Jury plan, with none of the
plan's 12 districts containing a black majority). Because theBoard's adoption of the Jury plan would have maintained the

status quo regarding the number of black-majority districts,the parties stipulated that the Jury plan was not "retrogressive." Id., at 141a (Stipulations || 252) ("The . . . plan is notretrogressive to minority voting strength compared to the
existing benchmark plan . . ."). Appellant George Price,
president of the local chapter of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), presented the
Board with a second option--a plan that created two districts each containing not only a majority of black residents,
but a majority of voting-age black residents. Id., at 98a
(Stipulations || 98). Over vocal opposition from local residents, black and white alike, the Board voted to adopt the
Jury plan as its own, reasoning that the Jury plan would
almost certainly be precleared again and that the NAACP
plan would require the Board to split 46 electoral precincts.

But the Board's hopes for rapid preclearance were dashed
when the Attorney General interposed a formal objection to
the Board's plan on the basis of "new information" not available when the Justice Department had precleared the plan
for the Police Jury--namely, the NAACP's plan, which demonstrated that "black residents are sufficiently numerous and
geographically compact so as to constitute a majority in two
single-member districts." Id., at 155a-156a (Attorney General's August 30, 1993, objection letter). The objection letter asserted that the Board's plan violated $ 2 of the Act, 42
U. S. C. $ 1973, because it "unnecessarily limit[ed] the opportunity for minority voters to elect their candidates of choice,"

alternative. Relying on 28 CFR $ 51.55(b)(2) (1996), which

Opinion of the Court
provides that the Attorney General shall withhold pre-clearance where "necessary to prevent a clear violation of

amended Section 2 [42 U. S. C. $ 1973]," the Attorney Gen-eral concluded that the Board's redistricting plan warranted
a denial of preclearance under $ 5. App. to Juris. Statement157a. The Attorney General declined to reconsider the
decision. Ibid.The Board then filed this action seeking preclearance
under $ 5 in the District Court for the District of Columbia.Appellant Price and others intervened as defendants. The
three-judge panel granted the Board's request for preclear-ance, over the dissent of one judge. 907 F. Supp. 434, 437
(1995). The District Court squarely rejected the appellants'contention that a voting change's alleged failure to satisfy $ 2
constituted an independent reason to deny preclearanceunder $ 5: "We hold, as has every court that has considered
the question, that a political subdivision that does not violateeither the `effect' or the `purpose' prong of section 5 cannot
be denied preclearance because of an alleged section 2 viola-tion."

Id., at 440-441. Given this holding, the DistrictCourt quite properly expressed no opinion on whether the

Jury plan in fact violated $ 2, and its refusal to reach outand decide the issue in dicta does not require us, as

Justice
Stevens insists, to "assume that the record discloses a `clearviolation' of $ 2." See post, at 499 (opinion dissenting in part

and concurring in part). That issue has yet to be decidedby any court. The District Court did, however, reject appellants' related argument that a court "must still considerevidence of a section 2 violation as evidence of discriminatory purpose under section 5." Id., at 445. We noted prob-able jurisdiction on June 3, 1996. 517 U. S. 1232.

417, 2d Sess., p. 4 (1982); South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383U. S. 301, 308 (1966). Two of the weapons in the Federal

Government's formidable arsenal are $ 5 and $ 2 of the Act.Although we have consistently understood these sections to
combat different evils and, accordingly, to impose very different duties upon the States, see Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S.874, 883 (1994) (plurality opinion) (noting how the two sections "differ in structure, purpose, and application"), appel-lants nevertheless ask us to hold that a violation of $ 2 is an
independent reason to deny preclearance under $ 5. Unlike
Justice Stevens, post, at 502-503, and n. 5 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part), we entertain little doubtthat the Department of Justice or other litigants would

"routinely" attempt to avail themselves of this new reason
for denying preclearance, so that recognizing $ 2 violationsas a basis for denying $ 5 preclearance would inevitably make

compliance with $ 5 contingent upon compliance with $ 2.Doing so would, for all intents and purposes, replace the
standards for $ 5 with those for $ 2. Because this would con-tradict our longstanding interpretation of these two sections
of the Act, we reject appellants' position.Section 5, 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, was enacted as

"a response to a common practice in some jurisdictionsof staying one step ahead of the federal courts by passing new discriminatory voting laws as soon as the oldones had been struck down. . . . Congress therefore decided, as the Supreme Court held it could, `to shift the
advantage of time and inertia from the perpetrators ofthe evil to its victim,' by `freezing election procedures

in the covered areas unless the changes can be shown
to be nondiscriminatory.' " Beer v. United States, 425
U. S. 130, 140 (1976) (quoting H. R. Rep. No. 94-196,
pp. 57-58 (1970)).

In light of this limited purpose, $ 5 applies only to certain
States and their political subdivisions. Such a covered ju520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

risdiction may not implement any change in a voting "quali-fication, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure" unless it first obtains either administrative preclearance of thatchange from the Attorney General or judicial preclearance
from the District Court for the District of Columbia. 42
U. S. C. $ 1973c. To obtain judicial preclearance, the juris-diction bears the burden of proving that the change "does

not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denyingor abridging the right to vote on account of race or color."
Ibid.; City of Rome v. United States, 446 U. S. 156, 183, n. 18(1980) (covered jurisdiction bears burden of proof). Because

$ 5 focuses on "freez[ing] election procedures," a plan has an
impermissible "effect" under $ 5 only if it "would lead to a
retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect
to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise." Beer,
supra, at 141.

Retrogression, by definition, requires a comparison of a
jurisdiction's new voting plan with its existing plan. See
Holder, supra, at 883 (plurality opinion) ("Under $ 5, then,
the proposed voting practice is measured against the existing voting practice to determine whether retrogression
would result from the proposed change"). It also necessarily implies that the jurisdiction's existing plan is the benchmark against which the "effect" of voting changes is measured. In Beer, for example, we concluded that the city of
New Orleans' reapportionment of its council districts, which
created one district with a majority of voting-age blacks
where before there had been none, had no discriminatory
"effect." 425 U. S., at 141-142 ("It is thus apparent that a
legislative reapportionment that enhances the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the
electoral franchise can hardly have the `effect' of diluting or
abridging the right to vote on account of race within the
meaning of $ 5"). Likewise, in City of Lockhart v. United
States, 460 U. S. 125 (1983), we found that the city's new charter had no retrogressive "effect" even though it maintained

Opinion of the Court
the city's prior practice of electing its council members atlarge from numbered posts, and instituted a new practice of
electing two of the city's four council members every year
(instead of electing all the council members every two years).
While each practice could "have a discriminatory effect
under some circumstances," id., at 135, the fact remained
that "[s]ince the new plan did not increase the degree of discrimination against [the city's Mexican-American population], it was entitled to $ 5 preclearance [because it was not
retrogressive]," id., at 134 (emphasis added).

Section 2, on the other hand, was designed as a means
of eradicating voting practices that "minimize or cancel out
the voting strength and political effectiveness of minority
groups," S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 28. Under this broader mandate, $ 2 bars all States and their political subdivisions from
maintaining any voting "standard, practice, or procedure"
that "results in a denial or abridgement of the right . . . to
vote on account of race or color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(a). A
voting practice is impermissibly dilutive within the meaning
of $ 2

"if, based on the totality of the circumstances, it is
shown that the political processes leading to nomination
or election in the State or political subdivision are not
equally open to participation by [members of a class
defined by race or color] in that its members have less
opportunity than other members of the electorate to
participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973(b).

A plaintiff claiming vote dilution under $ 2 must initially establish that: (i) "[the racial group] is sufficiently large and
geographically compact to constitute a majority in a singlemember district"; (ii) the group is "politically cohesive"; and
(iii) "the white majority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable
it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred candidate."

Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 50-51 (1986); Growe v.
Emison, 507 U. S. 25, 40 (1993). The plaintiff must also
demonstrate that the totality of the circumstances supportsa finding that the voting scheme is dilutive.

Johnson v. De
Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1011 (1994); see Gingles, supra, at
44-45 (listing factors to be considered by a court in assessingthe totality of the circumstances). Because the very concept

of vote dilution implies--and, indeed, necessitates--the ex-istence of an "undiluted" practice against which the fact of
dilution may be measured, a $ 2 plaintiff must also postulatea reasonable alternative voting practice to serve as the
benchmark "undiluted" voting practice. Holder v. Hall, 512
U. S., at 881 (plurality opinion); id., at 950-951 (Blackmun,
J., dissenting).

Appellants contend that preclearance must be denied
under $ 5 whenever a covered jurisdiction's redistricting plan
violates $ 2. The upshot of this position is to shift the focus
of $ 5 from nonretrogression to vote dilution, and to change
the $ 5 benchmark from a jurisdiction's existing plan to a
hypothetical, undiluted plan.

But $ 5, we have held, is designed to combat only those
effects that are retrogressive. See supra, at 477-479. To
adopt appellants' position, we would have to call into question more than 20 years of precedent interpreting $ 5. See,
e. g., Beer, supra; City of Lockhart, supra. This we decline
to do. Section 5 already imposes upon a covered jurisdiction
the difficult burden of proving the absence of discriminatory
purpose and effect. See, e. g., Elkins v. United States, 364
U. S. 206, 219 (1960) ("[A]s a practical matter it is never easy
to prove a negative"). To require a jurisdiction to litigate
whether its proposed redistricting plan also has a dilutive
"result" before it can implement that plan--even if the Attorney General bears the burden of proving that "result"--is to
increase further the serious federalism costs already implicated by $ 5. See Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 926 (1995)
(noting the "federalism costs exacted by $ 5 preclearance").

Opinion of the Court
Appellants nevertheless contend that we should adopttheir reading of $ 5 because it is supported by our decision

in Beer, by the Attorney General's regulations, and by con-siderations of public policy. In

Beer, we held that $ 5 prohibited only retrogressive effects and further observed that "an
ameliorative new legislative apportionment cannot violate$ 5 unless the new apportionment itself so discriminates on

the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution." 425U. S., at 141. Although there had been no allegation that
the redistricting plan in Beer "so . . . discriminate[d] on thebasis of race or color as to be unconstitutional," we cited in
dicta a few cases to illustrate when a redistricting plan might
be found to be constitutionally offensive. Id., at 142, n. 14.
Among them was our decision in White v. Regester, 412 U. S.
755 (1973), in which we sustained a vote dilution challenge,
brought under the Equal Protection Clause, to the use of
multimember election districts in two Texas counties. Appellants argue that "[b]ecause vote dilution standards under
the Constitution and Section 2 were generally coextensive
at the time Beer was decided, Beer's discussion meant that
practices that violated Section 2 would not be entitled to
preclearance under Section 5." Brief for Federal Appellant 36-37.

Even assuming, arguendo, that appellants' argument had
some support in 1976, it is no longer valid today because
the applicable statutory and constitutional standards have
changed. Since 1980, a plaintiff bringing a constitutional
vote dilution challenge, whether under the Fourteenth or
Fifteenth Amendment, has been required to establish that
the State or political subdivision acted with a discriminatory
purpose. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 62 (1980) (plurality opinion) ("Our decisions . . . have made clear that action by a State that is racially neutral on its face violates the
Fifteenth Amendment only if motivated by a discriminatory
purpose"); id., at 66 ("[O]nly if there is purposeful discrimination can there be a violation of the Equal Protection

Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment"); see also Arlington
Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429
U. S. 252, 265 (1977) ("Proof of racially discriminatory intentor purpose is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause"). When Congress amended $ 2 in 1982, it
clearly expressed its desire that $ 2 not have an intent com-ponent, see S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 2 ("Th[e 1982] amendment

is designed to make clear that proof of discriminatory intentis not required to establish a violation of Section 2"). Because now the Constitution requires a showing of intent that$ 2 does not, a violation of $ 2 is no longer

a fortiori a violation of the Constitution. Congress itself has acknowledged
this fact. See id., at 39 ("The Voting Rights Act is the best
example of Congress' power to enact implementing legislation that goes beyond the direct prohibitions of the Constitution itself ").

Justice Stevens argues that the subsequent divergence
of constitutional and statutory standards is of no moment
because, in his view, we "did not [in Beer] purport to distinguish between challenges brought under the Constitution
and those brought under the [Voting Rights] statute." Post,
at 504 (opinion dissenting in part and concurring in part).
Our citation to White, he posits, incorporated White's standard into our exception for nonretrogressive apportionments
that violate $ 5, whether or not that standard continued to
coincide with the constitutional standard. In essence, Justice Stevens reads Beer as creating an exception for nonretrogressive apportionments that so discriminate on the
basis of race or color as to violate any federal law that happens to coincide with what would have amounted to a constitutional violation in 1976. But this reading flatly contradicts the plain language of the exception we recognized,
which applies solely to apportionments that "so discriminat[e] on the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution." Beer, supra, at 141 (emphasis added). We cited
White, not for itself, but because it embodied the current

520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
constitutional standard for a violation of the Equal Protec-tion Clause. See also 425 U. S., at 143, n. 14 (noting that

New Orleans' plan did "not remotely approach a violation ofthe

constitutional standards enunciated in" White and other
cited cases (emphasis added)). When White ceased to represent the current understanding of the Constitution, a viola-tion of its standard--even though that standard was later

incorporated in $ 2--no longer constituted grounds for denialof preclearance under

Beer.
Appellants' next claim is that we must defer to the At-torney General's regulations interpreting the Act, one of

which states:

"In those instances in which the Attorney General
concludes that, as proposed, the submitted change isfree of discriminatory purpose and retrogressive effect,

but also concludes that a bar to implementation ofthe change is necessary to prevent a clear violation of
amended Section 2, the Attorney General shall withhold
Section 5 preclearance." 28 CFR $ 51.55(b)(2) (1996).

Although we normally accord the Attorney General's con-struction of the Act great deference, "we only do so if Congress has not expressed its intent with respect to the ques-tion, and then only if the administrative interpretation is
reasonable." Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502 U. S.
491, 508 (1992). Given our longstanding interpretation of $ 5,see

supra, at 477-479, 480-482 and this page, which Congress
has declined to alter by amending the language of $ 5, Arkansas Best Corp. v. Commissioner, 485 U. S. 212, 222, n. 7 (1988)
(placing some weight on Congress' failure to express disfavor
with our 25-year interpretation of a tax statute), we believe
Congress has made it sufficiently clear that a violation of $ 2
is not grounds in and of itself for denying preclearance under

$ 5. That there may be some suggestion to the contrary in
the Senate Report to the 1982 Voting Rights Act amendments, S. Rep. No. 97-417, supra, at 12, n. 31, does not

Opinion of the Court
change our view. With those amendments, Congress, amongother things, renewed $ 5 but did so without changing its

applicable standard. We doubt that Congress would departfrom the settled interpretation of $ 5 and impose a demonstrably greater burden on the jurisdictions covered by $ 5,
see supra, at 480, by dropping a footnote in a Senate Reportinstead of amending the statute itself. See

Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U. S. 552, 567 (1988) ("Quite obviously, reenactingprecisely the same language would be a strange way to make

a change"). See also City of Lockhart v. United States, 460U. S. 125 (1983) (reaching its holding over Justice Marshall's
dissent, which raised the argument now advanced by appel-lants regarding this passage in the Senate Report).

Nor does the portion of the House Report cited by Justice
Stevens unambiguously call for the incorporation of $ 2 into$ 5. That portion of the Report states:

"[M]any voting and election practices currently in effect are outside the scope of [$ 5] . . . because they were
in existence before 1965. . . . Under the Voting RightsAct, whether a discriminatory practice or procedure is

of recent origin affects only the mechanism that triggersrelief, i. e., litigation [under $ 2] or preclearance [under

$ 5]." H. R. Rep. No. 97-227, p. 28 (1981).
The obvious thrust of this passage is to establish that pre1965 discriminatory practices are not free from scrutinyunder the Act just because they need not be precleared

under $ 5: Such practices might still violate $ 2. But to saythat pre-1965 practices can be reached solely by $ 2 is not to
say that all post-1965 changes that might violate $ 2 may be
reached by both $ 2 and $ 5 or that "the substantive standards for $ 2 and $ 5 [are] the same," see post, at 506 (opinion
dissenting in part and concurring in part). Our ultimate conclusion is also not undercut by statements found in the "postenactment legislative record," see post, at 506, n. 9, given
that "the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous

520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one." United
States v. Price, 361 U. S. 304, 313 (1960). We therefore decline to give these sources controlling weight.Appellants' final appeal is to notions of public policy.

They assert that if the district court or Attorney General
examined whether a covered jurisdiction's redistricting planviolates $ 2 at the same time as ruling on preclearance under

$ 5, there would be no need for two separate actions and judi-cial resources would be conserved. Appellants are undoubtedly correct that adopting their interpretation of $ 5 wouldserve judicial economy in those cases where a $ 2 challenge
follows a $ 5 proceeding. But this does not always happen,
and the burden on judicial resources might actually increase
if appellants' position prevailed because $ 2 litigation would
effectively be incorporated into every $ 5 proceeding.

Appellants lastly argue that preclearance is an equitable
remedy, obtained through a declaratory judgment action in
district court, see 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, or through the exercise
of the Attorney General's discretion, see 28 CFR $ 51.52(a)
(1996). A finding that a redistricting plan violates $ 2 of the
Act, they contend, is an equitable "defense," on the basis of
which a decisionmaker should, in the exercise of its equitable discretion, be free to deny preclearance. This argument,
however, is an attempt to obtain through equity that which
the law--i. e., the settled interpretation of $ 5--forbids. Because "it is well established that `[c]ourts of equity can no
more disregard statutory and constitutional requirements
and provisions than can courts of law,' " INS v. Pangilinan,
486 U. S. 875, 883 (1988) (citing Hedges v. Dixon County, 150
U. S. 182, 192 (1893)), this argument must fail.

Of course, the Attorney General or a private plaintiff remains free to initiate a $ 2 proceeding if either believes that
a jurisdiction's newly enacted voting "qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure" may violate that section. All we hold today is that preclearance under $ 5 may
not be denied on that basis alone.

Opinion of the Court

III
Appellants next contend that evidence showing that ajurisdiction's redistricting plan dilutes the voting power of

minorities is at least relevant in a $ 5 proceeding becauseit tends to prove that the jurisdiction enacted its plan with
a discriminatory "purpose." The District Court, reasoningthat "[t]he line [between $ 2 and $ 5] cannot be blurred by
allowing a defendant to do indirectly what it cannot do di-rectly," 907 F. Supp., at 445, rejected this argument and held
that it "will not permit section 2 evidence to prove discrimi-natory purpose under section 5," ibid. Because we hold that
some of this "$ 2 evidence" may be relevant to establish ajurisdiction's "intent to retrogress" and cannot say with confidence that the District Court considered the evidence prof-fered to show that the Board's reapportionment plan was
dilutive, we vacate this aspect of the District Court's hold-ing and remand. In light of this conclusion, we leave open
for another day the question whether the $ 5 purpose in-quiry ever extends beyond the search for retrogressive intent. See Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v. Thompson, 490U. S. 454, 465, n. 5 (1989) (declining to decide an issue that
"is not necessary to our decision"). Reserving this questionis particularly appropriate when, as in this suit, it was not
squarely addressed by the decision below or in the parties'briefs on appeal. See Brief for Federal Appellant 23; Brief
for Appellant Price et al. 31-33, 34-35; Brief for Appellee42-43. But in doing so, we do not, contrary to

Justice
Stevens' view, see post, at 499 (opinion dissenting in partand concurring in part), necessarily assume that the Board

enacted the Jury plan with some nonretrogressive, but nev-ertheless discriminatory, "purpose." The existence of such
a purpose, and its relevance to $ 5, are issues to be decidedon remand.

Although $ 5 warrants a denial of preclearance if a coveredjurisdiction's voting change "ha[s] the purpose [or] . . . the
effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account

520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
of race or color," 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c, we have consistentlyinterpreted this language in light of the purpose underlying

$ 5--"to insure that no voting-procedure changes would bemade that would lead to a retrogression in the position of
racial minorities." Beer, 425 U. S., at 141. Accordingly, we
have adhered to the view that the only "effect" that violates$ 5 is a retrogressive one.

Ibid.; City of Lockhart, 460 U. S.,
at 134.Evidence is "relevant" if it has "any tendency to make the

existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determina-tion of the action more probable or less probable than it
would be without the evidence." Fed. Rule Evid. 401. As
we observed in Arlington Heights, 429 U. S., at 266, the impact of an official action is often probative of why the action
was taken in the first place since people usually intend the
natural consequences of their actions. Thus, a jurisdiction
that enacts a plan having a dilutive impact is more likely to
have acted with a discriminatory intent to dilute minority
voting strength than a jurisdiction whose plan has no such
impact. A jurisdiction that acts with an intent to dilute minority voting strength is more likely to act with an intent
to worsen the position of minority voters--i. e., an intent to
retrogress--than a jurisdiction acting with no intent to dilute. The fact that a plan has a dilutive impact therefore
makes it "more probable" that the jurisdiction adopting that
plan acted with an intent to retrogress than "it would be
without the evidence." To be sure, the link between dilutive
impact and intent to retrogress is far from direct, but "the
basic standard of relevance . . . is a liberal one," Daubert
v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579, 587
(1993), and one we think is met here.

That evidence of a plan's dilutive impact may be relevant
to the $ 5 purpose inquiry does not, of course, mean that such
evidence is dispositive of that inquiry. In fact, we have previously observed that a jurisdiction's single decision to choose
a redistricting plan that has a dilutive impact does not, with520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

out more, suffice to establish that the jurisdiction acted witha discriminatory purpose.

Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 914,
n. 6 (1996) ("[W]e doubt that a showing of discriminatoryeffect under $ 2, alone, could support a claim of discriminatory purpose under $ 5"). This is true whether the jurisdiction chose the more dilutive plan because it better comportedwith its traditional districting principles, see

Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S., at 922 (rejecting argument that a jurisdiction'sfailure to adopt the plan with the greatest possible number

of majority black districts establishes that it acted with adiscriminatory purpose);

Shaw, supra, at 912-913 (same), or
if it chose the plan for no reason at all. Indeed, if a plan's
dilutive impact were dispositive, we would effectively incorporate $ 2 into $ 5, which is a result we find unsatisfactory
no matter how it is packaged. See Part II, supra.

As our discussion illustrates, assessing a jurisdiction's motivation in enacting voting changes is a complex task requiring a "sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct
evidence as may be available." Arlington Heights, 429
U. S., at 266. In conducting this inquiry, courts should look
to our decision in Arlington Heights for guidance. There,
we set forth a framework for analyzing "whether invidious
discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor" in a government body's decisionmaking. Ibid. In addition to serving
as the framework for examining discriminatory purpose in
cases brought under the Equal Protection Clause for over
two decades, see, e. g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 644 (1993)
(citing Arlington Heights standard in context of Equal Protection Clause challenge to racial gerrymander of districts);
Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U. S. 613, 618 (1982) (evaluating vote
dilution claim under Equal Protection Clause using Arlington Heights test); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 70-74 (same), the Arlington Heights framework has also been used, at least in
part, to evaluate purpose in our previous $ 5 cases. See
Pleasant Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462, 469-470
(1987) (considering city's history in rejecting annexation of

black neighborhood and its departure from normal proce-dures when calculating costs of annexation alternatives); see

also Busbee v. Smith, 549 F. Supp. 494, 516-517 (DC 1982),summarily aff 'd, 459 U. S. 1166 (1983) (referring to

Arlington
Heights test); Port Arthur v. United States, 517 F. Supp. 987,
1019, aff 'd, 459 U. S. 159 (1982) (same).The "important starting point" for assessing discriminatory intent under Arlington Heights is "the impact of theofficial action whether it `bears more heavily on one race
than another.' " 429 U. S., at 266 (citing Washington v.
Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 242 (1976)). In a $ 5 case, "impact"
might include a plan's retrogressive effect and, for the reasons discussed above, its dilutive impact. Other considerations relevant to the purpose inquiry include, among other
things, "the historical background of the [ jurisdiction's] decision"; "[t]he specific sequence of events leading up to the
challenged decision"; "[d]epartures from the normal procedural sequence"; and "[t]he legislative or administrative history, especially . . . [any] contemporary statements by members of the decisionmaking body." 429 U. S., at 266-268.

We are unable to determine from the District Court's opinion in this action whether it deemed irrelevant all evidence
of the dilutive impact of the redistricting plan adopted by
the Board. At one point, the District Court correctly stated
that "the adoption of one nonretrogressive plan rather than
another nonretrogressive plan that contains more majorityblack districts cannot by itself give rise to the inference of discriminatory intent." 907 F. Supp., at 450 (emphasis added).
This passage implies that the District Court believed that
the existence of less dilutive options was at least relevant to,
though not dispositive of, its purpose inquiry. While this
language is consistent with our holding today, see supra, at
486-488, the District Court also declared that "we will not
permit section 2 evidence to prove discriminatory purpose
under section 5," supra, at 486. With this statement, the
District Court appears to endorse the notion that evidence

of dilutive impact is irrelevant even to an inquiry into retro-gressive intent, a notion we reject. See supra, at 486-488.

The Board contends that the District Court actually "pre-sumed that white majority districts had [a dilutive] effect,"
Brief for Appellee 35, and "cut directly to the dispositivequestion `started' by the existence of [a dilutive] impact: did
the Board have `legitimate, nondiscriminatory motives' foradopting its plan[?]"

Id., at 33. Even if the Board werecorrect, the District Court gave no indication that it was

assuming the plan's dilutive effect, and we hesitate to attrib-ute to the District Court a rationale it might not have employed. Because we are not satisfied that the District Court
considered evidence of the dilutive impact of the Board's re-districting plan, we vacate this aspect of the District Court's

opinion. The District Court will have the opportunity toapply the

Arlington Heights test on remand as well as to
address appellants' additional arguments that it erred in re-fusing to consider evidence that the Board was in violation

of an ongoing injunction "to `remedy any remaining vestigesof [a] dual [school] system,' " 907 F. Supp., at 449, n. 18.

Although I continue to adhere to the views I expressed in
Holder v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 891 (1994) (opinion concurring
in judgment), I join today's opinion because it is consistentwith our vote dilution precedents. I fully anticipate, however, that as a result of today's holding, all of the problemswe have experienced in $ 2 vote dilution cases will now be
replicated and, indeed, exacerbated in the $ 5 retrogression
inquiry.I have trouble, for example, imagining a reapportionment

change that could not be deemed "retrogressive" under our

vote dilution jurisprudence by a court inclined to find it so.We have held that a reapportionment plan that "enhances

the position of racial minorities" by increasing the numberof majority-minority districts does not "have the `effect' of
diluting or abridging the right to vote on account of race
within the meaning of $ 5." Beer v. United States, 425 U. S.130, 141 (1976). But in so holding we studiously avoided

addressing one of the necessary consequences of increasingmajority-minority districts: Such action

necessarily decreases the level of minority influence in surrounding dis-tricts, and to that extent "dilutes" the vote of minority voters in those other districts, and perhaps dilutes the influenceof the minority group as a whole. See,

e. g., Hays v. Louisiana, 936 F. Supp. 360, 364, n. 17 (WD La. 1996) (three-judge
court) (noting that plaintiffs' expert "argues convincinglythat our plan, with its one black majority and three influence

districts, empowers more black voters statewide than does"a plan with two black-majority districts and five "bleached"
districts in which minority influence was reduced in order tocreate the second black-majority district); cf.

Johnson v. De
Grandy, 512 U. S. 997, 1007 (1994) (noting that dilution canoccur by "fragmenting the minority voters among several

districts . . . or by packing them into one or a small number
of districts to minimize their influence in the districts next
door").

Under our vote dilution jurisprudence, therefore, a court
could strike down any reapportionment plan, either because
it did not include enough majority-minority districts or because it did (and thereby diluted the minority vote in the
remaining districts). A court could presumably even strike
down a new reapportionment plan that did not significantly
alter the status quo at all, on the theory that such a plan did
not measure up to some hypothetical ideal. With such an
indeterminate "rule," $ 5 ceases to be primarily a prophylactic tool in the important war against discrimination in voting,
and instead becomes the means whereby the Federal Government, and particularly the Department of Justice, usurps

the legitimate political judgments of the States. And suchan empty "rule" inevitably forces the courts to make political

judgments regarding which type of apportionment bestserves supposed minority interests--judgments that the
courts are ill equipped to make.I can at least find some solace in the belief that today's
opinion will force us to confront, with a renewed sense ofurgency, this fundamental inconsistency that lies at the heart
of our vote dilution jurisprudence.Beyond my general objection to our vote dilution precedent, the one portion of the majority opinion with which Idisagree is the majority's new suggestion that preclearance
standards established by the Department of Justice are "nor-mally" entitled to deference. See ante, at 483.* Section 5
sets up alternative routes for preclearance, and the primaryroute specified is through the District Court for the District
of Columbia, not through the Attorney General's office. See42 U. S. C. $ 1973c (generally requiring District Court preclearance, with a proviso that covered jurisdictions may obtain preclearance by the Attorney General in lieu of DistrictCourt preclearance, but providing no authority for the Attorney General to preclude judicial preclearance). Requiringthe District Court to defer to adverse preclearance decisions
by the Attorney General based upon the very preclearancestandards she articulates would essentially render the independence of the District Court preclearance route a nullity.Moreover, given our own "longstanding interpretation of

$ 5," see ante, at 483, deference to the particular preclearanceregulation addressed in this action would be inconsistent
with another of the Attorney General's regulations, whichprovides: "In making determinations [under $ 5] the Attorney General will be guided by the relevant decisions of the

whether the Department's interpretation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,
as opposed to its articulation of standards applicable to its own preclearance determinations, is entitled to deference. The regulation at issue
here only purports to be the latter.

Supreme Court of the United States and of other Federal
courts." 28 CFR $ 51.56 (1996). Thus, while I agree with
the majority's decision not to defer to the Attorney General's
standards, I would reach that result on different grounds.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins,
concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.

I join Parts I and II of the majority opinion, and Part III
insofar as it is not inconsistent with this opinion. I write
separately to express my disagreement with one aspect of
the majority opinion. The majority says that we need not
decide "whether the $ 5 purpose inquiry ever extends beyond
the search for retrogressive intent." Ante, at 486. In my
view, we should decide the question, for otherwise the District Court will find it difficult to evaluate the evidence that
we say it must consider. Cf. post, at 508 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part). Moreover, the answer to the question is that the "purpose" inquiry does extend beyond the search for retrogressive intent. It includes
the purpose of unconstitutionally diluting minority voting
strength.

The language of $ 5 itself forbids a change in "any voting
qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice,
or procedure with respect to voting," where that change
either (1) has the "purpose" or (2) will have the "effect" of
"denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or
color." 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. These last few words reiterate
in context the language of the Fifteenth Amendment itself:
"The right of citizens . . . to vote shall not be denied or
abridged . . . on account of race [or] color . . . ." This use
of constitutional language indicates that one purpose forbidden by the statute is a purpose to act unconstitutionally.
And a new plan enacted with the purpose of unconstitutionally diluting minority votes is an unconstitutional plan.

494 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.

Opinion of Breyer, J.
Of course, the constitutional language also applies to $ 5'sprohibition that rests upon "effects." The Court assumes,

in its discussion of "effects," that the $ 5 word "effects" doesnot now embody a

purely constitutional test, whether or not
it ever did so. See ante, at 478; City of Rome v. United
States, 446 U. S. 156, 173, 177 (1980). And that fact, here, isbeside the point. The separate argument about the meaning

of the word "effect" concerns how far beyond the Constitu-tion's requirements Congress intended that word to reach.
The argument about "purpose" is simply whether Congressintended the word to reach

as far as the Constitution itself,
embodying those purposes that, in relevant context, the Constitution itself would forbid. I can find nothing in the
Court's discussion that shows that Congress intended to restrict the meaning of the statutory word "purpose" short of
what the Constitution itself requires. And the Court has
previously expressly indicated that minority vote dilution is
a harm that $ 5 guards against. Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U. S. 544, 569 (1969).

Consider a hypothetical example that will clarify the precise legal question here at issue. Suppose that a covered
jurisdiction is choosing between two new voting plans, A and
B. Neither plan is retrogressive. Plan A violates every
traditional districting principle, but from the perspective of
minority representation, it maintains the status quo, thereby
meeting the "effects" test of $ 5. See ante, at 478-479. Plan
B is basically consistent with traditional districting principles and it also creates one or two new majority-minority
districts (in a State where the number of such districts is
significantly less than proportional to minority voting age
population). Suppose further that the covered jurisdiction
adopts Plan A. Without any other proposed evidence or justification, ordinary principles of logic and human experience
suggest that the jurisdiction would likely have adopted Plan
A with "the purpose . . . of denying or abridging the right
to vote on account of race or color." $ 1973c. It is reason520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

able to assume that the Constitution would forbid the use ofsuch a plan. See

Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U. S. 613, 617 (1982)
(Fourteenth Amendment covers vote dilution claims); Mobile, 446 U. S., at 66 (plurality opinion) (same). And compare id., at 62-63 (intentional vote dilution may be illegal
under the Fifteenth Amendment) and Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, 346 (1960) (Fifteenth Amendment covers
municipal boundaries drawn to exclude blacks), with Mobile, supra, at 84, n. 3 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment)
(Mobile plurality said that Fifteenth Amendment does notreach vote dilution);

Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U. S. 146, 159
(1993) ("This Court has not decided whether the Fifteenth
Amendment applies to vote-dilution claims . . ."); Shaw v.
Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 645 (1993) (endorsing the Gomillion
concurrence's Fourteenth Amendment approach); and Beer
v. United States, 425 U. S. 130, 142, n. 14 (1976). Then, to
read $ 5's "purpose" language to require approval of Plan A,
even though the jurisdiction cannot provide a neutral explanation for its choice, would be both to read $ 5 contrary to
its plain language and also to believe that Congress would
have wanted a $ 5 court (or the Attorney General) to approve
an unconstitutional plan adopted with an unconstitutional
purpose.

In light of this example, it is not surprising that this Court
has previously indicated that the purpose part of $ 5 prohibits a plan adopted with the purpose of unconstitutionally diluting minority voting strength, whether or not the plan is
retrogressive in its effect. In Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899
(1996), for example, the Court doubted "that a showing of
discriminatory effect under $ 2, alone, could support a claim
of discriminatory purpose under $ 5." Id., at 914, n. 6 (emphasis added). The word "alone" suggests that the evidence
of a discriminatory effect there at issue--evidence of dilution--could be relevant to a discriminatory purpose claim.
And if so, the more natural understanding of $ 5 is that an
unlawful purpose includes more than simply a purpose to

retrogress. Otherwise, dilution would either dispositivelyshow an unlawful discriminatory effect (if retrogressive) or

it would almost always be irrelevant (if not retrogressive).Either way, it would not normally have much to do with unlawful purpose. See also the discussions in Richmond v.
United States, 422 U. S. 358, 378-379 (1975) (annexation plandid not have an impermissible dilutive effect but the Court

remanded for a determination of whether there was an im-permissible $ 5 purpose);

Pleasant Grove v. United States,
479 U. S. 462, 471-472, and n. 11 (1987) (purpose to minimize
future black voting strength is impermissible under $ 5);
Port Arthur v. United States, 459 U. S. 159, 168 (1982) (a plan
adopted for a discriminatory purpose is invalid under $ 5
even if it "might otherwise be said to reflect the political
strength of the minority community"); post, at 507-508 (Stevens, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part).

Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900 (1995), also implicitly assumed that $ 5's "purpose" stretched beyond the purely retrogressive. There, the Justice Department pointed out that
Georgia made a choice between two redistricting plans, one
of which (call it Plan A) had more majority-black districts
than the other (call it Plan B). The Department argued that
the fact that Georgia chose Plan B showed a forbidden $ 5
discriminatory purpose. The Court rejected this argument,
but the reason that the majority gave for that rejection is
important. The Court pointed out that Plan B embodied
traditional state districting principles. It reasoned that
"[t]he State's policy of adhering to other districting principles instead of creating as many majority-minority districts
as possible does not support an inference" of an unlawful
discriminatory purpose. Id., at 924. If the only relevant
"purpose" were a retrogressive purpose, this reasoning, with
its reliance upon traditional districting principles, would
have been beside the point. The Court would have concerned itself only with Georgia's intent to worsen the position of minorities, not with the reasons why Georgia could

Opinion of Stevens, J.
have adopted one of two potentially ameliorative plans. In-deed, the Court indicated that an ameliorative plan would

run afoul of the $ 5 purpose test if it violated the Constitu-tion. Ibid. See also Shaw v. Hunt, supra, at 912-913.

In sum, the Court today should make explicit an assump-tion implicit in its prior cases. Section 5 prohibits a covered
State from making changes in its voting practices and proce-dures where those changes have the

unconstitutional "pur-pose" of unconstitutionally diluting minority voting strength.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Souter joins,dissenting in part and concurring in part.
In my view, a plan that clearly violates $ 2 is not entitledto preclearance under $ 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
The majority's contrary view would allow the Attorney Gen-eral of the United States to place her stamp of approval on
a state action that is in clear violation of federal law. Itwould be astonishing if Congress had commanded her to
do so. In fact, however, Congress issued no such command.Surely no such command can be found in the text of $ 5 of
the Voting Rights Act.1 Moreover, a fair review of the text

1 As originally enacted, $ 5 provided:
"Sec. 5. Whenever a State or political subdivision with respect to
which the prohibitions set forth in section 4(a) are in effect shall enact or
seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or
standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that
in force or effect on November 1, 1964, such State or subdivision may
institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such qualification, prerequisite,
standard, practice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will not
have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of
race or color, and unless and until the court enters such judgment no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure: Provided, That such
qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be enforced without such proceeding if the qualification, prerequisite, standard,
practice, or procedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer or
other appropriate official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney Gen520US2 Unit: $U50 [09-10-99 19:05:07] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Stevens, J.
and the legislative history of the 1982 amendment to $ 2 ofthat Act indicates that Congress intended the Attorney General to deny preclearance under $ 5 whenever it was clearthat a new voting practice was prohibited by $ 2. This does
not mean that she must make an independent inquiry intopossible violations of $ 2 whenever a request for preclearance
is made. It simply means that, as her regulations provide,she must refuse preclearance when "necessary to prevent a
clear violation of amended section 2." 28 CFR $ 51.55(b)(2)(1996).

It is, of course, well settled that the Attorney Generalmust refuse to preclear a new election procedure in a covered
jurisdiction if it will "lead to a retrogression in the positionof racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of
the electoral franchise." Beer v. United States, 425 U. S.130, 141 (1976). A retrogressive effect or a retrogressive
purpose is a sufficient basis for denying a preclearance re-quest under $ 5. Today, however, the Court holds that retrogression is the only kind of effect that will justify denialof preclearance under $ 5,

ante, at 476-485, and it assumesthat "the $ 5 purpose inquiry [never] extends beyond the

search for retrogressive intent." Ante, at 486. While Iagree that this action must be remanded even under the
Court's miserly interpretation of $ 5, I disagree with theCourt's holding/assumption that $ 5 is concerned only with
retrogressive effects and purposes.Before explaining my disagreement with the Court, I
think it important to emphasize the three factual predicatesthat underlie our analysis of the issues. First, we assume

eral and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty
days after such submission, except that neither the Attorney General's
failure to object nor a declaratory judgment entered under this section
shall bar a subsequent action to enjoin enforcement of such qualification,
prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure. Any action under this section shall be heard and determined by a court of three judges in accordance with the provisions of section 2284 of title 28 of the United States
Code [28 U. S. C. $ 2284] and any appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court."

that the plan submitted by the Bossier Parish School Board(Board) was not "retrogressive" because it did not make matters any worse than they had been in the past. None of the12 districts had ever had a black majority and a black person
had never been elected to the Board. App. to Juris. State-ment 67a. Second, because the majority in both the District
Court and this Court found that even clear violations of $ 2must be precleared and thus found it unnecessary to discuss
whether $ 2 was violated in this action, we may assume thatthe record discloses a "clear violation" of $ 2. This means
that, in the language of $ 2, it is perfectly clear that "thepolitical processes leading to nomination or election [to positions on the Board] are not equally open to participation bymembers of [the African-American race] in that its members
have less opportunity than other members of the electorateto . . . elect representatives of their choice." 42 U. S. C.

$ 1973(b).2 Third, if the Court is correct in assuming thatthe purpose inquiry under $ 5 may be limited to evidence of
"retrogressive intent," it must also be willing to assume thatthe documents submitted in support of the request for preclearance clearly establish that the plan was adopted for thespecific purpose of preventing African-Americans from obtaining representation on the Board. Indeed, for the pur-pose of analyzing the legal issues, we must assume that

purpose. The adoption of the Police Jury plan bearsheavily on the black community because it denies its

members a reasonable opportunity to elect a candidateof their choice. The history of discrimination by the
Bossier School System and the Parish itself demon-strates the Board's continued refusal to address the concerns of the black community in Bossier Parish. Thesequence of events leading up to the adoption of the
plan illustrate the Board's discriminatory purpose. TheSchool Board's substantive departures from traditional
districting principles is similarly probative of discrimi-natory motive. Three School Board members have acknowledged that the Board is hostile to black represen-tation. Moreover, some of the purported rationales for
the School Board's decision are flat-out untrue, and oth-ers are so glaringly inconsistent with the facts of the
case that they are obviously pretexts." 907 F. Supp.434, 463 (DC 1995).

If the purpose and the effect of the Board's plan were simplyto maintain the discriminatory status quo as described by
Judge Kessler, the plan would not have been retrogressive.But, as I discuss below, that is not a sufficient reason for
concluding that it complied with $ 5.

I
In the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress enacted a com-plex scheme of remedies for racial discrimination in voting.

As originally enacted, $ 2 of the Act was "an uncontroversialprovision" that "simply restated" the prohibitions against
such discrimination "already contained in the FifteenthAmendment," Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 61 (1980) (plurality opinion). Like the constitutional prohibitions againstdiscriminatory districting practices that were invalidated in
cases like Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960), and
White v. Regester, 412 U. S. 755 (1973), $ 2 was made applica-ble to every State and political subdivision in the country.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
Section 5, on the other hand, was highly controversial be-cause it imposed novel, extraordinary remedies in certain

areas where discrimination had been most flagrant. SeeSouth Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S. 301, 334-335 (1966).

3

Jurisdictions like Bossier Parish in Louisiana are covered by$ 5 because their history of discrimination against AfricanAmericans was a matter of special concern to Congress. Be-cause these jurisdictions had resorted to various strategies
to avoid complying with court orders to remedy discrimina-tion, "Congress had reason to suppose that [they] might try
similar maneuvers in the future in order to evade the reme-dies for voting discrimination contained in the Act itself."
Id., at 335. Thus Congress enacted $ 5, not to maintain thediscriminatory status quo, but to stay ahead of efforts by the
most resistant jurisdictions to undermine the Act's purposeof "rid[ding] the country of racial discrimination." Id., at
315 ("The heart of the Act is a complex scheme of stringentremedies aimed at areas where voting discrimination has
been most flagrant").In areas of the country lacking a history of pervasive discrimination, Congress presumed that voting practices weregenerally lawful. Accordingly, the burden of proving a violation of $ 2 has always rested on the party challenging thevoting practice. The situation is dramatically different in
covered jurisdictions. In those jurisdictions, $ 5 flatly pro-hibits the adoption of any new voting procedure unless the
State or political subdivision institutes an action in the Fed-eral District Court for the District of Columbia and obtains
a declaratory judgment that the change will not have a dis-criminatory purpose or effect. See 42 U. S. C. $ 1973c. The
burden of proving compliance with the Act rests on the juris-diction. A proviso to $ 5 gives the Attorney General the
authority to allow the new procedure to go into effect, but

3 Section 4 of the Act sets forth the formula for identifying the jurisdictions in which such discrimination had occurred, see South Carolina v.
Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 317-318.

like the immigration statutes that give her broad discre-tion to waive deportation of undesirable aliens, it does not

expressly impose any limit on her discretion to refuse pre-clearance. See ibid. The Attorney General's discretion is,
however, cabined by regulations that are presumptivelyvalid if they "are reasonable and do not conflict with the
Voting Rights Act itself," Georgia v. United States, 411 U. S.526, 536 (1973). Those regulations provide that preclearance will generally be granted if a proposed change "is free
of discriminatory purpose and retrogressive effect"; theyalso provide, however, that in "those instances" in which the

Attorney General concludes "that a bar to implementation
of the change is necessary to prevent a clear violation ofamended section 2," preclearance shall be withheld.

is no basis for the Court's speculation that litigants would so

with $ 2," ibid. Nor do the regulations require the jurisdiction to assume the burden of proving the absence of vote

4 Title 28 CFR $ 51.55 (1996) provides:
"Consistency with constitutional and statutory requirements.

"(a) Consideration in general. In making a determination the Attorney General will consider whether the change is free of discriminatory
purpose and retrogressive effect in light of, and with particular attention
being given to, the requirements of the 14th, 15th, and 24th amendments
to the Constitution, 42 U. S. C. 1971(a) and (b), sections 2, 4(a), 4(f)(2),
4(f)(4), 201, 203(c), and 208 of the Act, and other constitutional and statutory provisions designed to safeguard the right to vote from denial or
abridgment on account of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.

will not preclude any legal action under section 2 by the Attorney General if implementation of the change subsequently demonstrates that such
action is appropriate.

would clearly violate $ 2 is challenged, the burden on thatissue, as in any $ 2 challenge, should rest on the Attorney

General.5The Court does not suggest that this regulation is inconsistent with the text of $ 5. Nor would this be persuasive,since the language of $ 5 forbids preclearance of any voting

130 (1976), and City of Lockhart v. United States, 460 U. S.125 (1983), do hold (as the current regulations provide) that

proof that a change is not retrogressive is normally sufficientto justify preclearance under $ 5. In neither case, however,
was the Court confronted with the question whether thatshowing would be sufficient if the proposed change was so
discriminatory that it clearly violated some other federal law.

5 Thus, I agree with those courts that have found that the jurisdiction
is not required to prove that its proposed change will not violate $ 2 in
order to receive preclearance. See Arizona v. Reno, 887 F. Supp. 318, 321
(DC 1995). Although several three-judge District Courts have concluded
that $ 2 standards should not be incorporated into $ 5, none has held that
preclearance should be granted when there is a clear violation of $ 2;
rather, they appear simply to have determined that a $ 2 inquiry is not
routinely required in a $ 5 case. See, e. g., Georgia v. Reno, 881 F. Supp.
7, 12-14 (DC 1994); New York v. United States, 874 F. Supp. 394, 398-399
(DC 1994); cf. Burton v. Sheheen, 793 F. Supp. 1329, 1350 (SC 1992) (holding that although courts are not "obligated to completely graft" $ 2 standards onto $ 5, "[i]t would be incongruous for the court to adopt a plan
which did not comport with the standards and guidelines of $ 2").

504 RENO v. BOSSIER PARISH SCHOOL BD.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In fact, in Beer--which held that a legislative reapportion-ment enhancing the position of African-American voters did

not have a discriminatory effect--the Court stated that "anameliorative new legislative apportionment cannot violate

$ 5 unless the new apportionment itself so discriminates onthe basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution." 425
U. S., at 141.6 Thus, to the extent that the Beer Court ad-dressed the question at all, it suggested that certain nonretrogressive changes that were nevertheless discriminatoryshould not be precleared.

The Court discounts the significance of the "unless" clausebecause it refers to a constitutional violation rather than a
statutory violation. According to the Court's reading, the
Beer dictum at most precludes preclearance of changes thatviolate the Constitution rather than changes that violate $ 2.

This argument is unpersuasive. As the majority notes, the
Beer Court cites White v. Regester, 412 U. S., at 766, whichfound unconstitutional a reapportionment scheme that gave

African-American residents "less opportunity than did otherresidents in the district to participate in the political processes and to elect legislators of their choice." Because, in1976, when

Beer was decided, the $ 2 standard was coexten-sive with the constitutional standard, Beer did not purport

to distinguish between challenges brought under the Consti-tution and those brought under the statute. Rather Beer's
dictum suggests that any changes that violate the standardestablished in White v. Regester should not be precleared.

7

6 In Lockhart the Court disavowed reliance on the ameliorative character of the change reviewed in Beer, see 460 U. S., at 134, n. 10. It left
open the question whether Congress had altered the Beer standard when
it amended $ 2 in 1982, 460 U. S., at 133, n. 9, and said nothing about the
possible significance of a violation of a constitutional or statutory prohibition against vote dilution.

7 In response to this dissent, the majority contends that, at most, Beer

v. United States, 425 U. S. 130 (1976), allows denial of preclearance for
those changes that violate the Constitution. See ante, at 482-483. Thus,
the majority apparently concedes that our "settled interpretation," ante,

Opinion of Stevens, J.
As the Court recognizes, ante, at 481-482, the law haschanged in two respects since the announcement of the Beer

dictum. In 1980, in what was perceived by Congress to bea change in the standard applied in White v. Regester, a plurality of this Court concluded that discriminatory purpose isan essential element of a constitutional vote dilution challenge. See Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S., at 62. In reactionto that decision, in 1982 Congress amended $ 2 by placing in
the statute the language used in the White opinion to de-scribe what is commonly known as the "results" standard for
evaluating vote dilution challenges. See 96 Stat. 134 (nowcodified at 42 U. S. C. $$ 1973(a)-(b));

Thornburg v. Gingles,478 U. S. 30, 35 (1986).
8 Thus Congress preserved, as a matter of statutory law, the very same standard that the Courthad identified in Beer as an exception to the general rule

requiring preclearance of nonretrogressive changes. Be-cause in 1975

Beer required denial of preclearance for votingplans that violated the White standard, it follows that Congress, in preserving the White standard, intended also thatthe Attorney General should continue to refuse to preclear
plans violating that standard.That intent is confirmed by the legislative history of the
1982 Act. The Senate Report states:

"Under the rule of Beer v. United States, 425 U. S.130 (1976), a voting change which is ameliorative is not

objectionable unless the change `itself so discriminateson the basis of race or color as to violate the Constitution.' 425 U. S. at 141; see also 142 n. 14 (citing to thedilution cases from Fortson v. Dorsey[, 379 U. S. 433
(1965),] through White v. Regester). In light of theamendment to section 2, it is intended that a section 5
objection also follow if a new voting procedure itself so
at 484, of $ 5 supports a denial of preclearance for at least some nonretrogressive changes.

8 The amended version of $ 2 tracks the language in White v. Regester,

412 U. S. 755, 766 (1973).

discriminates as to violate section 2." S. Rep. No. 97-417, p. 12, n. 31 (1982).

The House Report conveys the same message in differentlanguage. It unequivocally states that whether a discriminatory practice or procedure was in existence before 1965(and therefore only subject to attack under $ 2) or is the
product of a recent change (and therefore subject to preclear-ance under $ 5) "affects only the mechanism that triggers relief." H. R. Rep. No. 97-227, p. 28 (1981). This statementplainly indicates that the Committee understood the substantive standards for $ 2 and $ 5 violations to be the same when-ever a challenged practice in a covered jurisdiction represents a change subject to the dictates of $ 5.9 Thus, it isreasonable to assume that Congress, by endorsing the "unless" clause in Beer, contemplated the denial of preclearancefor any change that clearly violates amended $ 2. The majority, by belittling this legislative history, abrogates Con9 The postenactment legislative record also supports the Attorney General's interpretation of $ 5. In 1985, the Attorney General first proposed
regulations requiring a denial of preclearance "based upon violation of
Section 2 if there is clear and convincing evidence of such a violation."
50 Fed. Reg. 19122, 19131. Congress held oversight hearings in which
several witnesses, including the Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights
Division, testified that clear violations of $ 2 should not be precleared.
See Oversight Hearings before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Proposed Changes
to Regulations Governing Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 99th Cong.,
1st Sess., 47, 149, 151-152 (1985). Following these hearings, the House
Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights issued a Report in which it concluded "that it is a proper interpretation of the legislative history of the 1982 amendments to use Section 2 standards in the
course of making Section 5 determinations." Subcommittee on Civil and
Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Voting
Rights Act: Proposed Section 5 Regulations, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., Ser.

direct evidence of the enacting Congress' intent, it does constitute an informed expert opinion concerning the validity of the Attorney General's
regulation.

gress' effort, in enacting the 1982 amendments, "to broadenthe protection afforded by the Voting Rights Act." Chisom

v. Roemer, 501 U. S. 380, 404 (1991).Despite this strong evidence of Congress' intent, the majority holds that no deference to the Attorney General's reg-ulation is warranted. The Court suggests that had Congress wished to alter "our longstanding interpretation" of$ 5, Congress would have made this clear.

Ante, at 483.But nothing in our "settled interpretation" of $ 5, ante, at

484, is inconsistent with the Attorney General's reading ofthe statute. To the contrary, our precedent actually indicates that nonretrogressive plans that are otherwise discrim-inatory under

White v. Regester should not be precleared.As neither the language nor the legislative history of $ 5 can

be said to conflict with the view that changes that clearlyviolate $ 2 are not entitled to preclearance, there is no legitimate basis for refusing to defer to the Attorney General'sregulation. See Presley v. Etowah County Comm'n, 502
U. S. 491, 508 (1992). II

In Part III of its opinion the Court correctly concludesthat this action must be remanded for further proceedings
because the District Court erroneously refused to considercertain evidence that is arguably relevant to whether the
Board has proved an absence of discriminatory purposeunder $ 5. Because the Court appears satisfied that the
disputed evidence may be probative of an " `intent to retro-gress,' " it concludes that it is unnecessary to decide
"whether the $ 5 purpose inquiry ever extends beyond thesearch for retrogressive intent."

Ante, at 486. For tworeasons, I think it most unwise to reverse on such a narrow

ground.First, I agree with

Justice Breyer, see ante, at 493,that there is simply no basis for imposing this limitation on

the purpose inquiry. None of our cases have held that $ 5'spurpose test is limited to retrogressive intent. In Pleasant

Grove v. United States, 479 U. S. 462, 469-472 (1987), for in-stance, we found that the city had failed to prove that its

annexation of certain white areas lacked a discriminatorypurpose. Despite the fact that the annexation lacked a retrogressive effect, we found it was subject to $ 5 preclearance.
Ibid.; see also id., at 474-475 (Powell, J., dissenting) (con-tending that the majority erred in holding that a discriminatory purpose could be found even though there was no intent"to have a retrogressive effect"). Furthermore, limiting the

$ 5 purpose inquiry to retrogressive intent is inconsistentwith the basic purpose of the Act. Assume, for example,
that the record unambiguously disclosed a long history of
deliberate exclusion of African-Americans from participating
in local elections, including a series of changes each of which
was adopted for the specific purpose of maintaining the status quo. None of those changes would have been motivated
by an "intent to regress," but each would have been motivated by a "discriminatory purpose" as that term is commonly understood. Given the long-settled understanding
that $ 5 of the Act was enacted to prevent covered jurisdictions from "contriving new rules of various kinds for the
sole purpose of perpetuating voting discrimination," South
Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U. S., at 335, it is inconceivable
that Congress intended to authorize preclearance of changes
adopted for the sole purpose of perpetuating an existing
pattern of discrimination.

Second, the Court's failure to make this point clear can
only complicate the task of the District Court on remand.
If that court takes the narrow approach suggested by the
Court, another appeal will surely follow; if a majority ultimately agrees with my view of the issue, another remand
will then be necessary. On the other hand, if the District
Court does not limit its consideration to evidence of retrogressive intent, and if it therefore rules against the Board,
appellees will bring the action back and the Court would
then have to resolve the issue definitively.

Opinion of Stevens, J.
In sum, both the interest in orderly procedure and the factthat a correct answer to the issue is pellucidly clear should

be sufficient to persuade the Court to state definitively that$ 5 preclearance should be denied if Judge Kessler's evaluation of the record is correct.Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment insofar as it
remands the action for further proceedings, I dissent fromthe decision insofar as it fails to authorize proceedings in
accordance with the views set forth above.

INTER-MODAL RAIL EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATION

et al. v. ATCHISON, TOPEKA & SANTA FERAILWAY CO.,

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-491. Argued March 17, 1997--Decided May 12, 1997
As employees of respondent Santa Fe Terminal Services, Inc. (SFTS), a

wholly owned subsidiary of respondent The Atchison, Topeka and Santa
Fe Railway Co. (ATSF), the individual petitioners were entitled, among
other things, to pension, health, and welfare benefits under SFTSTeamsters Union collective bargaining agreements. The resulting benefit plans were subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (ERISA). Ultimately ATSF bid the work being done by
petitioners to respondent In-Terminal Services (ITS) and terminated
SFTS employees who declined to continue employment with ITS. The
ITS-Teamsters pension and welfare benefit plans were less generous
than the SFTS-Teamsters plans. Petitioners filed suit, alleging that
the terminations violated $ 510 of ERISA, which makes it unlawful to
"discharge . . . a [plan] participant . . . for the purpose of interfering
with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become
entitled under the plan." (Emphasis added.) The District Court
granted respondents' motion to dismiss. Concluding that $ 510 only
prohibits interference with the attainment of rights that are capable of
"vesting," the Court of Appeals reinstated petitioners' claim for interference with pension benefits, but affirmed the dismissal of their claim
for interference with welfare benefits, which do not vest.

Held: The Court of Appeals' holding that $ 510 bars interference only with

vested rights is contradicted by $ 510's plain language, whose use of the
word "plan" all but forecloses that position. ERISA defines "plan" to
include an "employee welfare benefit plan," 29 U. S. C. $ 1002(3), even
though welfare plans are exempted from its stringent vesting requirements, see $ 1051(1). Had Congress intended to confine $ 510's protection to "vested" rights, it could have easily substituted "pension plan"
for "plan" or "nonforfeitable right" for "any right." The flexibility an
employer enjoys to unilaterally amend or eliminate its welfare benefit
plan, see Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 78, does
not justify a departure from $ 510's plain language. Such flexibility
helps employers avoid the complicated administration and increased cost
of vested plans, and encourages them to offer more generous benefits at
the outset, since they can reduce benefits should economic conditions

Opinion of the Court
sour. Section 510 counterbalances this flexibility by requiring employers to follow a plan's formal amendment process, thus ensuring that
employers do not "circumvent the provision of promised benefits."
Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133, 143. Any tension that
might exist between an employer's amendment power and a participant's $ 510 rights is the product of a careful balance of competing interests, not the type of "absurd or glaringly unjust" result, Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs,
519 U. S. 248, 261, that would warrant departure from $ 510's plain language. On remand, the Court of Appeals should have the first opportunity to evaluate respondents' remaining arguments, including their argument that petitioners were eligible to receive welfare benefits under
the SFTS-Teamsters plan at the time they were discharged and, thus,
cannot state a $ 510 claim. Pp. 514-517.

ATCHISON, T. & S. F. R. CO.

Opinion of the Court

"discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminateagainst a participant or beneficiary [of an employee benefit

plan] for the purpose of interfering with the attainment ofany right to which such participant may become entitled
under the plan." 29 U. S. C. $ 1140. The Court of Appealsfor the Ninth Circuit held that $ 510 only prohibits interference with the attainment of rights that are capable of "vest-ing," as that term is defined in ERISA. We disagree.

I
The individual petitioners are former employees of re-spondent Santa Fe Terminal Services, Inc. (SFTS), a wholly

owned subsidiary of respondent The Atchison, Topeka andSanta Fe Railway Co. (ATSF), which was responsible for
transferring cargo between railcars and trucks at ATSF'sHobart Yard in Los Angeles, California. While petitioners
were employed by SFTS, they were entitled to retirementbenefits under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974, 88 Stat.
1312, as amended, 45 U. S. C. $ 231 et seq., and to pension,health, and welfare benefits under collective bargaining
agreements involving SFTS and the Teamsters Union.SFTS provided its workers with pension, health, and welfare
benefits through employee benefit plans subject to ERISA'scomprehensive regulations.

In January 1990, ATSF entered into a formal "ServiceAgreement" with SFTS to have SFTS do the same "intermodal" work it had done at the Hobart Yard for the previous15 years without a contract. Seven weeks later, ATSF exercised its right to terminate the newly formed agreement andopened up the Hobart Yard work for competitive bidding.
Respondent In-Terminal Services (ITS) was the successfulbidder, and SFTS employees who declined to continue employment with ITS were terminated. ITS, unlike SFTS,was not obligated to make contributions to the Railroad Retirement Account under the Railroad Retirement Act. ITSalso provided fewer pension and welfare benefits under its

collective bargaining agreement with the Teamsters Unionthan had SFTS. Workers who continued their employment

with ITS "lost their Railroad Retirement Act benefits" and"suffered a substantial reduction in Teamsters benefits." 80
F. 3d 348, 350 (CA9 1996) (per curiam).

Petitioners sued respondents SFTS, ATSF, and ITS in theUnited States District Court for the Central District of California, alleging that respondents had violated $ 510 ofERISA by "discharg[ing]" petitioners "for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of . . . right[s] to which" theywould have "become entitled" under the ERISA pension and
welfare plans adopted pursuant to the SFTS-Teamsters collective bargaining agreement. See App. to Pet. for Cert.
29a, Complaint || 33. Had SFTS remained their employer,
petitioners contended, they would have been entitled to assert claims for benefits under the SFTS-Teamsters benefit
plans, at least until the collective bargaining agreement that
gave rise to those plans expired. The substitution of ITS
for SFTS, however, precluded them from asserting those
claims and relegated them to asserting claims under the less
generous ITS-Teamsters benefit plans. According to petitioners, the substitution "interfer[ed] with the attainment"
of their "right" to assert those claims and violated $ 510.
Respondents moved to dismiss these $ 510 claims, and the
District Court granted the motion.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed in
part and reversed in part. 80 F. 3d 348 (1996). The court
reinstated petitioners' claim under $ 510 for interference
with their pension benefits, concluding that $ 510 " `protects
plan participants from termination motivated by an employer's desire to prevent a pension from vesting.' " Id., at 350-
351 (quoting Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133,
143 (1990)). But the Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of petitioners' claim for interference with their welfare benefits. "Unlike pension benefits," the Court of Appeals observed, "welfare benefits do not vest." 80 F. 3d, at

351. As a result, the Court of Appeals noted, "employersremain free to unilaterally amend or eliminate [welfare]

plans," and "employees have no present `right' to future, an-ticipated welfare benefits.' " Ibid. (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted). Because the "existence of apresent `right' is [a] prerequisite to section 510 relief," the
Court of Appeals concluded that $ 510 did not state a causeof action for interference with welfare benefits.

Ibid. Wegranted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of

Appeals on this issue,* 519 U. S. 1003 (1996), and now vacatethe decision below and remand.

II
The Court of Appeals' holding that $ 510 bars interferenceonly with vested rights is contradicted by the plain language

of $ 510. As noted above, that section makes it unlawful to"discharge . . . a [plan] participant or beneficiary . . . for the
purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right towhich such participant may become entitled under

the plan."29 U. S. C. $ 1140 (emphasis added). ERISA defines a "plan"

to include both "an employee welfare benefit plan [and] anemployee pension benefit plan," $ 1002(3), and specifically
exempts "employee welfare benefit plan[s]" from its strin-gent vesting requirements, see $ 1051(1). Because a "plan"
includes an "employee welfare benefit plan," and becausewelfare plans offer benefits that do not "vest" (at least insofar as ERISA is concerned), Congress' use of the word "plan"in $ 510 all but forecloses the argument that $ 510's interfer*See Shahid v. Ford Motor Co., 76 F. 3d 1404, 1411 (CA6 1996) (holding

Opinion of the Court
ence clause applies only to "vested" rights. Had Congressintended to confine $ 510's protection to "vested" rights, it

could have easily substituted the term "pension plan," see 29U. S. C. $ 1002(2), for "plan," or the term "nonforfeitable"
right, see $ 1002(19), for "any right." But $ 510 draws no
distinction between those rights that "vest" under ERISAand those that do not.

The right that an employer or plan sponsor may enjoy insome circumstances to unilaterally amend or eliminate its
welfare benefit plan does not, as the Court of Appeals appar-ently thought, justify a departure from $ 510's plain language.
It is true that ERISA itself "does not regulate the substantive content of welfare-benefit plans." Metropolitan Life
Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724, 732 (1985). Thus,
unless an employer contractually cedes its freedom, see, e. g.,
Adcox v. Teledyne, Inc., 21 F. 3d 1381, 1389 (CA6), cert. denied, 513 U. S. 871 (1994), it is "generally free under ERISA,
for any reason at any time, to adopt, modify, or terminate
[its] welfare pla[n]." Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. Schoonejongen, 514 U. S. 73, 78 (1995).

The flexibility an employer enjoys to amend or eliminate
its welfare plan is not an accident; Congress recognized that
"requir[ing] the vesting of these ancillary benefits would seriously complicate the administration and increase the cost
of plans." S. Rep. No. 93-383, p. 51 (1973). Giving employers this flexibility also encourages them to offer more generous benefits at the outset, since they are free to reduce benefits should economic conditions sour. If employers were
locked into the plans they initially offered, "they would err
initially on the side of omission." Heath v. Varity Corp., 71
F. 3d 256, 258 (CA7 1995). Section 510 counterbalances this
flexibility by ensuring that employers do not "circumvent the
provision of promised benefits." Ingersoll-Rand Co., supra,
at 143 (citing S. Rep. No. 93-127, pp. 35-36 (1973); H. R. Rep.
No. 93-533, p. 17 (1973)). In short, "$ 510 helps to make
promises credible." Heath, supra, at 258. An employer

Opinion of the Court

may, of course, retain the unfettered right to alter its prom-ises, but to do so it must follow the formal procedures set

forth in the plan. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1102(b)(3) (requiring planto "provide a procedure for amending such plan");

Schoonejongen, supra, at 78 (observing that the "cognizable claim
[under ERISA] is that the company did not [amend its wel-fare benefit plan] in a permissible manner"). Adherence to

these formal procedures "increases the likelihood that pro-posed plan amendments, which are fairly serious events,
are recognized as such and given the special considerationthey deserve."

Schoonejongen, supra, at 82. The formal
amendment process would be undermined if $ 510 did not
apply because employers could "informally" amend their
plans one participant at a time. Thus, the power to amend
or abolish a welfare benefit plan does not include the power
to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against" the plan's participants and beneficiaries "for
the purpose of interfering with [their] attainment of . . .
right[s] . . . under the plan." To be sure, when an employer
acts without this purpose, as could be the case when making
fundamental business decisions, such actions are not barred
by $ 510. But in the case where an employer acts with a
purpose that triggers the protection of $ 510, any tension
that might exist between an employer's power to amend the
plan and a participant's rights under $ 510 is the product of
a careful balance of competing interests, and is most surely
not the type of "absurd or glaringly unjust" result, Ingalls
Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, 519 U. S. 248, 261 (1997), that would warrant
departure from the plain language of $ 510.

Respondents argue that the Court of Appeals' decision
must nevertheless be affirmed because $ 510, when applied
to benefits that do not "vest," only protects an employee's
right to cross the "threshold of eligibility" for welfare benefits. See Brief for Respondent Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railway Co. et al. 18. In other words, argue respondents,

Opinion of the Court
an employee who is eligible to receive benefits under anERISA welfare benefit plan has already "attain[ed]" her

"right[s]" under the plan, so that any subsequent actionstaken by an employer cannot, by definition, "interfer[e]" with
the "attainment of . . . right[s]" under the plan. Accordingto respondents, petitioners were eligible to receive welfare
benefits under the SFTS-Teamsters plan at the time theywere discharged, so they cannot state a claim under $ 510.
The Court of Appeals' approach precluded it from evaluatingthis argument, and others presented to us, and we see no
reason not to allow it the first opportunity to consider thesematters on remand.

We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appealsand remand the case for further proceedings consistent with
this opinion. It is so ordered.

LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARY, SECRETARY, FLORIDADEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 96-5658. Argued January 15, 1997--Decided May 12, 1997
In the sentencing phase of the trial at which petitioner Lambrix was convicted on two counts of first-degree murder, the Florida state-court jury
rendered an advisory verdict recommending death sentences on both
counts. Finding numerous aggravating circumstances in connection
with both murders, and no mitigating circumstances as to either, the
trial court sentenced Lambrix to death on both counts. After his conviction and sentence were upheld on direct and collateral review by the
Florida courts, he filed a habeas petition in the Federal District Court,
which rejected all of his claims. While his appeal was pending before
the Eleventh Circuit, this Court decided in Espinosa v. Florida, 505
U. S. 1079, that if the sentencing judge in a "weighing" State (i. e., a
State such as Florida that requires specified aggravating circumstances
to be weighed against any mitigating circumstances at a capital trial's
sentencing phase) is required to give deference to a jury's advisory sentencing recommendation, then neither the jury nor the judge is constitutionally permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances. Since
one of Lambrix's claims was that his sentencing jury was improperly
instructed on the "especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel" aggravator,
Espinosa had obvious relevance to his habeas petition. The Eleventh
Circuit held its proceedings in abeyance to permit Lambrix to present
his Espinosa claim to the Florida Supreme Court, which rejected the
claim without considering its merits on the ground that the claim was
procedurally barred. Without even acknowledging the procedural bar,
the Eleventh Circuit denied relief, ruling that Espinosa announced a
"new rule" which cannot be applied retroactively on federal habeas
under Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288.

Held:

1. Although the question whether a federal court should resolve a
claim of procedural bar before considering a claim of Teague bar has
not previously been presented, the Court's opinions--most particularly,
Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722--suggest that the procedural bar
issue should ordinarily be considered first. The Court nonetheless
chooses not to resolve this case on the procedural bar ground. Lambrix
asserts several reasons why procedural bar does not apply, the validity

of which is more appropriately determined by the lower federal courts,
which are more familiar with the procedural practices of the States in
which they sit. Rather than prolong this litigation by a remand, the
Court proceeds to decide the question presented. Pp. 522-525.

2. A prisoner whose conviction became final before Espinosa is foreclosed from relying on that decision in a federal habeas proceeding.
Pp. 525-540.

(a) To apply Teague, a federal habeas court must: (1) determine the
date on which the defendant's conviction became final; (2) survey the
legal landscape as it existed on that date to determine whether a state
court then considering the defendant's claim would have felt compelled
by existing precedent to conclude that the rule the defendant seeks was
constitutionally required; and (3) if not, consider whether the relief
sought falls within one of two narrow exceptions to nonretroactivity.
Pp. 525-527.

(b) A survey of the legal landscape as of the date that Lambrix's
conviction became final shows that Espinosa was not dictated by thenexisting precedent, but announced a "new rule" as defined in Teague.
It is significant that Espinosa, supra, at 1082, cited only a single case
in support of its central conclusion, Baldwin v. Alabama, 472 U. S. 372,
382, and introduced that lone citation with a "cf."--an introductory signal indicating authority that supports the point in dictum or by analogy.
Baldwin states, on the page that Espinosa cites, 472 U. S., at 382, that
the defendant's Espinosa-like argument "conceivably might have merit"
in circumstances not present in that case. The decisions relied on most
heavily by Lambrix--Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420; Maynard v.
Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356; and Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738--
do not dictate the result ultimately reached in Espinosa. Rather, a
close examination of the Florida death penalty scheme, in light of cases
such as Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S. 242, 253 (joint opinion); id., at
260-261 (White, J., concurring in judgment); and Spaziano v. Florida,
468 U. S. 447, 451, 466, indicates that a reasonable jurist considering the
matter at the time Lambrix's sentence became final could have reached
a result different from Espinosa. That conclusion is confirmed by Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653-654. The fact that Espinosa was
handed down as a per curiam without oral argument is insignificant,
since the decision followed by just three weeks Sochor v. Florida, 504
U. S. 527, in which the identical issue was fully briefed and argued, but
could not be decided for jurisdictional reasons. Pp. 527-539.

(c) Espinosa's new rule does not fall within either of the exceptions
to this Court's nonretroactivity doctrine. The first exception plainly
has no application, since Espinosa neither decriminalizes a class of conduct nor prohibits the imposition of capital punishment on a particular

class of persons. E. g., Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 494-495. Lambrix does not contend that the second exception--for watershed rules
of criminal procedure implicating the criminal proceeding's fundamental
fairness and accuracy--applies to Espinosa errors, and Sawyer v. Smith,
497 U. S. 227, 241-244, makes clear that it does not. Pp. 539-540.

We granted certiorari in this case to consider whether aprisoner whose conviction became final before our decision

in Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam),is foreclosed from relying on that decision in a federal habeas

I
On February 5, 1983, Cary Michael Lambrix and his girl-friend, Frances Smith, met Clarence Moore and Aleisha

Bryant at a local tavern. The two couples returned to Lam-brix's trailer for dinner, where Lambrix killed Moore and
Bryant in brutal fashion. Lambrix was convicted on twocounts of first-degree murder. In the sentencing phase of
trial, the jury rendered an advisory verdict recommending

Opinion of the Court
that the trial court sentence Lambrix to death on bothcounts. The trial court, after finding five aggravating circumstances in connection with the murder of Moore, fouraggravating circumstances in connection with the murder of
Bryant, and no mitigating circumstances as to either murder,
sentenced Lambrix to death on both counts. Lambrix's con-viction and sentence were upheld on direct appeal by the

Florida Supreme Court. Lambrix v. State, 494 So. 2d 1143(1986).

After the Florida courts denied his repeated efforts to ob-tain collateral relief,

Lambrix v. Dugger, 529 So. 2d 1110
(Fla. 1988); Lambrix v. State, 534 So. 2d 1151 (Fla. 1988);
Lambrix v. State, 559 So. 2d 1137 (Fla. 1990), Lambrix filed
a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254 in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of Florida; that court rejected all of his claims.
While Lambrix's appeal was pending before the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, this Court decided Espinosa
v. Florida, supra, which held that if the sentencing judge
in a "weighing" State (i. e., a State that requires specified
aggravating circumstances to be weighed against any mitigating circumstances at the sentencing phase of a capital
trial) is required to give deference to a jury's advisory sentencing recommendation, then neither the jury nor the judge
is constitutionally permitted to weigh invalid aggravating
circumstances. Since Florida is such a State, and since
one of Lambrix's claims was that his sentencing jury was
improperly instructed on the "especially heinous, atrocious,
or cruel" (HAC) aggravator, Espinosa had obvious relevance
to his habeas petition. Rather than address this issue in
the first instance, however, the Eleventh Circuit held its
proceedings in abeyance to permit Lambrix to present his
Espinosa claim to the Florida state courts.

The Florida Supreme Court rejected Lambrix's Espinosa
claim without considering its merits on the ground that the
claim was procedurally barred. Lambrix v. Singletary, 641

Opinion of the Court
So. 2d 847 (1994). That court explained that although Lam-brix had properly preserved his Espinosa objection at trial

by requesting a limiting instruction on the HAC aggravator,he had failed to raise the issue on direct appeal. 641 So. 2d,
at 848. The Florida Supreme Court also rejected Lambrix'sclaim that the procedural bar should be excused because his
appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to raise the for-feited issue, explaining that this claim was itself procedurally
barred and was, in any event, meritless. Id., at 848-849.After the Florida Supreme Court entered judgment
against Lambrix, the Eleventh Circuit adjudicated his ha-beas petition. Without even acknowledging the procedural
bar--which was expressly raised and argued by the State--the Court of Appeals proceeded to address the Espinosa
claim, and determined that Espinosa announced a new rulewhich cannot be applied retroactively on federal habeas
under Teague v. Lane, supra. 72 F. 3d 1500, 1503 (1996).We granted certiorari. 519 U. S. 958 (1996).

II
Before turning to the question presented in this case, wepause to consider the State's contention that Lambrix's Espinosa claim is procedurally barred because he failed to con-tend that the jury was instructed with a vague HAC aggravator on his direct appeal to the Florida Supreme Court.According to the State, the Florida Supreme Court "has consistently required that an Espinosa issue must have beenobjected to at trial and pursued on direct appeal in order to
be reviewed in postconviction proceedings." Brief for Re-spondent 30, citing

Chandler v. Dugger, 634 So. 2d 1066, 1069(Fla. 1994),

Opinion of the Court
rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal
question and adequate to support the judgment." See also
Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255, 262 (1989). We in fact lack
jurisdiction to review such independently supported judgments on direct appeal: Since the state-law determination
is sufficient to sustain the decree, any opinion of this Court
on the federal question would be purely advisory. Herb v.
Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945); see also Sochor v.
Florida, 504 U. S. 527, 533-534, and n. (1992). The "independent and adequate state ground" doctrine is not technically jurisdictional when a federal court considers a state
prisoner's petition for habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U. S. C.

$ 2254, since the federal court is not formally reviewing a
judgment, but is determining whether the prisoner is "in
custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties
of the United States." We have nonetheless held that the
doctrine applies to bar consideration on federal habeas of
federal claims that have been defaulted under state law.
Coleman, supra, at 729-730, 750; see also Wainwright v.
Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81, 82 (1977), discussing Brown v. Allen,
344 U. S. 443, 486-487 (1953), and Ex parte Spencer, 228 U. S.
652 (1913); Harris, supra, at 262.

Application of the "independent and adequate state
ground" doctrine to federal habeas review is based upon
equitable considerations of federalism and comity. It "ensures that the States' interest in correcting their own mistakes is respected in all federal habeas cases." Coleman,
501 U. S., at 732. "[A] habeas petitioner who has failed to
meet the State's procedural requirements for presenting his
federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance." Ibid. If
the "independent and adequate state ground" doctrine were
not applied, a federal district court or court of appeals would
be able to review claims that this Court would have been
unable to consider on direct review. See id., at 730-731.

524 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARY

Opinion of the Court
We have never had occasion to consider whether a federal
court should resolve a State's contention that a petitioner's
claim is procedurally barred before considering whether his
claim is Teague barred. Our opinions, however--most particularly, Coleman--certainly suggest that the proceduralbar issue should ordinarily be considered first. It was speculated at oral argument that the Court of Appeals may have
resolved the Teague issue without first considering procedural bar because our opinions have stated that the Teague
retroactivity decision is to be made as a "threshold matter."
E. g., Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S. 302, 329 (1989); Caspari v.
Bohlen, 510 U. S. 383, 389 (1994). That simply means, however, that the Teague issue should be addressed "before considering the merits of [a] claim." 510 U. S., at 389. It does
not mean that the Teague inquiry is antecedent to consideration of the general prerequisites for federal habeas corpus
which are unrelated to the merits of the particular claim--
such as the requirement that the petitioner be "in custody,"
see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(a), or that the state-court judgment
not be based on an independent and adequate state ground.
Constitutional issues are generally to be avoided, and as
even a cursory review of this Court's new-rule cases reveals
(including our discussion in Part IV, infra), the Teague inquiry requires a detailed analysis of federal constitutional
law. See, e. g., Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S. 227, 233-241
(1990); Penry, supra, at 316-319; Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S.
333, 339-344 (1993); Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S. 484, 488-494
(1990).

We are somewhat puzzled that the Eleventh Circuit, after
having held proceedings in abeyance while petitioner
brought his claim in state court, did not so much as mention
the Florida Supreme Court's determination that Lambrix's
Espinosa claim was procedurally barred. The State of Florida raised that point before both the District Court and the
Court of Appeals, going so far as to reiterate it in a postjudg520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ment Motion for Clarification and/or Modification of Opinionbefore the Court of Appeals, reprinted at App. 176. A

State's procedural rules are of vital importance to the or-derly administration of its criminal courts; when a federal
court permits them to be readily evaded, it undermines thecriminal justice system. We do not mean to suggest that
the procedural-bar issue must invariably be resolved first;only that it ordinarily should be. Judicial economy might
counsel giving the Teague question priority, for example, ifit were easily resolvable against the habeas petitioner,
whereas the procedural-bar issue involved complicated issuesof state law. Cf. 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(2) (permitting a federal
court to deny a habeas petition on the merits notwithstand-ing the applicant's failure to exhaust state remedies).

Despite our puzzlement at the Court of Appeals' failure toresolve this case on the basis of procedural bar, we hesitate
to resolve it on that basis ourselves. Lambrix asserts sev-eral reasons why his claim is not procedurally barred, which
seem to us insubstantial but may not be so; as we have re-peatedly recognized, the courts of appeals and district courts
are more familiar than we with the procedural practices ofthe States in which they regularly sit, see,

e. g., Rummel v.Estelle, 445 U. S. 263, 267, n. 7 (1980); County Court of Ulster

Cty. v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 153-154 (1979). Rather thanprolong this litigation by a remand, we proceed to decide the
case on the Teague grounds that the Court of Appeals used.

III
Florida employs a three-stage sentencing procedure.First, the jury weighs statutorily specified aggravating

circumstances against any mitigating circumstances, andrenders an "advisory sentence" of either life imprisonment
or death. Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(2) (Supp. 1992). Second, thetrial court weighs the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and enters a sentence of life imprisonment or death;

520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
526 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARY

Opinion of the Court
if the latter, its findings must be set forth in writing.$ 921.141(3). The jury's advisory sentence is entitled to

"great weight" in the trial court's determination, Tedder v.
State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975), but the court has an
independent obligation to determine the appropriate punishment, Ross v. State, 386 So. 2d 1191, 1197 (Fla. 1980). Third,the Florida Supreme Court automatically reviews all cases

in which the defendant is sentenced to death. $ 921.141(4).Lambrix's jury, which was instructed on five aggravating
circumstances, recommended that he be sentenced to deathfor each murder. The trial court found five aggravating circumstances as to Moore's murder and four as to Bryant's,
including that each murder was "especially heinous and atrocious"; it found no mitigating circumstances as to either murder; it concluded that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating, and sentenced Lambrix to death on
each count. App. 20-21. Although Lambrix failed to raise
any claims concerning the sentencing procedure on direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court agreed with the trial court's
findings as to the aggravating circumstances. Lambrix v.
State, 494 So. 2d, at 1148.

Lambrix contends that the jury's consideration of the HAC
aggravator violated the Eighth Amendment because the jury
instructions concerning this circumstance failed to provide
sufficient guidance to limit the jury's discretion. Like the
Eleventh Circuit, see 72 F. 3d, at 1503, we assume, arguendo,
that this was so. Lambrix further contends (and this is at
the heart of the present case) that the trial court's independent weighing did not cure this error. Prior to our opinion
in Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992), the State had
contended that Lambrix was not entitled to relief because
the sentencing judge properly found and weighed a narrowed
HAC aggravator. In Espinosa, however, we established the
principle that if a "weighing" State requires the sentencing
trial judge to give deference to a jury's advisory recommendation, neither the judge nor the jury is constitutionally per520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

527Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
mitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances. Lam-brix seeks the benefit of that principle; the State contends

that it constitutes a new rule under Teague and thus cannotbe relied on in a federal habeas corpus proceeding.

1

In Teague we held that, in general, "new constitutionalrules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those

cases which have become final before the new rules are an-nounced." 489 U. S., at 310-311. To apply

Teague, a fed-eral court engages in a three-step process. First, it determines the date upon which the defendant's conviction becamefinal. See Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U. S., at 390. Second, it
must " `[s]urve[y] the legal landscape as it then existed,' Gra-ham v. Collins, [506 U. S. 461, 468 (1993)], and `determine
whether a state court considering [the defendant's] claimat the time his conviction became final would have felt
compelled by existing precedent to conclude that the rule[he] seeks was required by the Constitution,'

Saffle v. Parks,494 U. S. 484, 488 (1990)." Ibid. Finally, if the court determines that the habeas petitioner seeks the benefit of a newrule, the court must consider whether the relief sought falls
within one of the two narrow exceptions to nonretroactivity.See

Gilmore v. Taylor, 508 U. S., at 345.

IV
Lambrix's conviction became final on November 24, 1986,when his time for filing a petition for certiorari expired.

Thus, our first and principal task is to survey the legallandscape as of that date, to determine whether the rule
later announced in Espinosa was dictated by then-existingprecedent--whether, that is, the unlawfulness of Lambrix's

1 Lambrix also contends that the trial court itself failed to apply a properly narrowed HAC aggravator. We decline to consider this contention
because it is not fairly within the question presented, which asked only
whether Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), bars relief based upon Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam), Pet. for Cert. i.

Opinion of the Court
conviction was apparent to all reasonable jurists. See, e. g.,Graham v. Collins, 506 U. S. 461, 477 (1993); Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407, 415 (1990); id., at 417-418 (Brennan,J., dissenting).

In Espinosa, we determined that the Florida capital juryis, in an important respect, a cosentencer with the judge.
As we explained: "Florida has essentially split the weighingprocess in two. Initially, the jury weighs aggravating and
mitigating circumstances, and the result of that weighingprocess is then in turn weighed within the trial court's process of weighing aggravating and mitigating circumstances."505 U. S., at 1082. We then concluded that the jury's consideration of a vague aggravator tainted the trial court's sen-tence because the trial court gave deference to the jury verdict (and thus indirectly weighed the vague aggravator) inthe course of weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Ibid. We reasoned that this indirect weigh-ing created the same risk of arbitrariness as the direct
weighing of an invalid aggravating factor. Ibid.2In our view, Espinosa was not dictated by precedent, but

announced a new rule which cannot be used as the basis forfederal habeas corpus relief. It is significant that Espinosa
itself did not purport to rely upon any controlling precedent.3

2 Our description of the holding of Espinosa in the preceding paragraph
of text is so clear that we are at a loss to explain Justice Stevens's
impression that we accord Espinosa the "novel interpretation" that "the
constitutional error in the jury instruction will `automatically render a
defendant's sentence unconstitutional.' " Post, at 541 (dissenting opinion)
(quoting infra, at 530). The sentence from which the phrase quoted by
Justice Stevens is wrenched (so violently that the word "not" which
precedes it is omitted) is not discussing the holding of Espinosa; indeed,
it does not even mention Espinosa; nor does the entire paragraph or the
previous or subsequent paragraphs.

3 Justice Stevens maintains that this statement is proved wrong by

Espinosa's citation of Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980), and Tedder
v. State, 322 So. 2d 908 (Fla. 1975). Post, at 541, n. 2. This is wordplay.
While those two cases can be called "controlling authority" in the sense
that the two propositions they established (that an instruction to the

520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

529Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
The opinion cited only a single case, Baldwin v. Alabama,472 U. S. 372, 382 (1985), in support of its central conclusion

that indirect weighing of an invalid aggravator "creates thesame potential for arbitrariness" as direct weighing of an
invalid aggravator. Espinosa, 505 U. S., at 1082. And it in-troduced that lone citation with a "cf."--an introductory signal which shows authority that supports the point in dictumor by analogy, not one that "controls" or "dictates" the result.

Baldwin itself contains further evidence that Espinosa setforth a new rule.

Baldwin considered the constitutionalityof Alabama's death sentencing scheme, in which the jury was

required to "fix the punishment at death" if it found the de-fendant guilty of an aggravated offense, whereupon the trial
court would conduct a sentencing hearing at which it woulddetermine a sentence of death or of life imprisonment. 472
U. S., at 376. The defendant contended that because thejury's mandatory sentence would have been unconstitutional
standing alone, see Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S.280, 288-305 (1976) (plurality opinion), it was impermissible
for the trial court to consider that verdict in determining itsown sentence. We did not reach that contention because we
concluded that under Alabama law the jury's verdict formedno part of the trial judge's sentencing calculus. Id., at 382.
We noted, however, on the page of the opinion that Espinosacited, that the defendant's "argument conceivably might
have merit if the judge actually were required to considerthe jury's `sentence' as a recommendation as to the sentence
the jury believed would be appropriate, cf. Proffitt v. Florsentencing jury which fails to define the HAC aggravator violates the
Eighth Amendment, and that the Florida sentencing judge must give
great weight to the jury's recommendation) were among the "givens" from
which any decision in Espinosa had to be derived, they assuredly were
not "controlling authority" in the sense we obviously intend: that they
compel the outcome in Espinosa. They do not answer the definitive question: whether the jury's advisory verdict taints the trial court's sentence,
that is, whether indirect weighing of an invalid factor creates the same
potential for arbitrariness as direct weighing.

ida, 428 U. S. 242 (1976), and if the judge were obligatedto accord some deference to it."

Baldwin, 472 U. S., at 382
(emphasis added); see also id., at 386, n. 8 ("express[ing] noview" on the same point). This highly tentative expression,

far from showing that Baldwin "dictate[s]" the result in
Espinosa, see Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U. S., at 235, suggestsjust the opposite. Indeed, in

Baldwin the Chief Justice,
who believed that Alabama's scheme did contemplate thatthe trial judge would consider the jury's "sentence," nonetheless held the scheme constitutional. 472 U. S., at 392(opinion concurring in judgment).

The Supreme Court decisions relied upon most heavily by
petitioner are Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420 (1980); Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988); and Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990). In Godfrey, we held that
Georgia's "outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible and inhuman" aggravator was impermissibly vague, reasoning that
there was nothing in the words "outrageously or wantonly
vile, horrible and inhuman" "that implies any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death
sentence," and concluded that these terms alone "gave the
jury no guidance." 446 U. S., at 428-429 (plurality opinion).
Similarly, in Maynard v. Cartwright, applied retroactively to
February 1985 in Stringer v. Black, 503 U. S. 222 (1992), we
held that Oklahoma's HAC aggravator, which is identically
worded to Florida's HAC aggravator, was impermissibly
vague because the statute gave no more guidance than the
vague aggravator at issue in Godfrey and the sentencing jury
was not given a limiting instruction. 486 U. S., at 363-364.

Although Godfrey and Maynard support the proposition
that vague aggravators must be sufficiently narrowed to
avoid arbitrary imposition of the death penalty, these cases,
and others, demonstrate that the failure to instruct the sentencing jury properly with respect to the aggravator does
not automatically render a defendant's sentence unconstitutional. We have repeatedly indicated that a sentencing

531Cite as: 520 U. S. 518 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
jury's consideration of a vague aggravator can be cured byappellate review. Thus, in

Godfrey itself, we were less concerned about the failure to instruct the jury properly thanwe were about the Georgia Supreme Court's failure to narrow the facially vague aggravator on appeal. Had the Georgia Supreme Court applied a narrowing construction of theaggravator, we would have rejected the Eighth Amendment

challenge to Godfrey's death sentence, notwithstanding thefailure to instruct the jury on that narrowing construction.
Godfrey, supra, at 431-432. Likewise in Maynard, westressed that the vague HAC aggravator had not been sufficiently limited on appeal by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal
Appeals "to cure the unfettered discretion of the jury." 486
U. S., at 364.

We reached a similar conclusion in Clemons v. Mississippi,
applied retroactively to February 1985 in Stringer. Clemons considered the question whether the sentencer's weighing of a vague HAC aggravator rendered that sentence unconstitutional in a "weighing" State. The sentencing jury
in Clemons, as in Maynard, was given a HAC instruction
that was unconstitutionally vague. We held that "the Federal Constitution does not prevent a state appellate court
from upholding a death sentence that is based in part on
an invalid or improperly defined aggravating circumstance
either by reweighing of the aggravating and mitigating
evidence or by harmless-error review." Clemons, supra,
at 741, 745; see also Stringer, supra, at 230.

The principles of the above-described cases do not dictate
the result we ultimately reached in Espinosa. Florida, unlike Oklahoma, see Maynard, supra, at 360, had given its
facially vague HAC aggravator a limiting construction sufficient to satisfy the Constitution. See Proffitt v. Florida,
428 U. S., at 255-256 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and
Stevens, JJ.); id., at 260 (White, J., concurring in judgment).
Thus, unlike the sentencing juries in Clemons, Maynard,
and Godfrey, who were not instructed with a properly lim520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN
532 LAMBRIX v. SINGLETARY

Opinion of the Court
ited aggravator, the sentencing trial judge in Espinosa didfind the HAC aggravator under a properly limited construction. See Espinosa, 505 U. S., at 1082, citing Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639, 653 (1990).4 A close examination of the
Florida death penalty scheme persuades us that a reasonablejurist considering Lambrix's sentence in 1986 could have

reached a conclusion different from the one Espinosa announced in 1992. There were at least three different, butsomewhat related, approaches that would have suggested a

different outcome:(1)

The mere cabining of the trial court's discretion
would avoid arbitrary imposition of the death penalty, and
thus avoid unconstitutionality. In Proffitt v. Florida,
supra, we upheld the Florida death penalty scheme againstthe contention that it resulted in arbitrary imposition of the

death penalty, see Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U. S. 153, 188 (1976),

because "trial judges are given specific and detailed guidance
to assist them in deciding whether to impose a death penalty
or imprisonment for life" and because the Florida Supreme

4 Justice Stevens's dissent says that "[g]iven that the judge's instruction to the jury failed to narrow the HAC aggravator, there is no reason
to believe that [the trial judge] appropriately narrowed the [HAC] factor
in his . . . deliberations." Post, at 545. Our cases establish that there
is always a "reason to believe" that, which we consider fully adequate:
"Trial judges are presumed to know the law and to apply it in making
their decisions. If the [State] Supreme Court has narrowed the definition
of the [HAC] aggravating circumstance, we presume that [state] trial
judges are applying the narrower definition." Walton v. Arizona, 497
U. S., at 653. Without abandoning our precedent, the most Justice Stevens can argue is that the ordinary presumption is overcome by failure
to instruct. The factual support for such an argument is questionable:
Judges fail to instruct juries about rules of law they are aware of all the
time. Moreover, if the argument were correct, the holding in Espinosa
itself would have been unnecessary: We could have simply said there
(as Justice Stevens would have us say here) that the failure to instruct
on the narrowing construction displayed the judge's ignorance of the
narrowing construction. Instead, of course, Espinosa cited the passage
from Walton quoted above. Espinosa, 505 U. S., at 1082.

Opinion of the Court
Court reviewed sentences for consistency. Proffitt, 428 U. S.,at 253 ( joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and

Stevens, JJ.);
id., at 260-261 (opinion of White, J., joined by the Chief Jus-tice and

Rehnquist, J.). (In Proffitt itself, incidentally, the
jury had not been instructed on an appropriately narrowed
HAC aggravator, see Proffitt v. Wainwright, 685 F. 2d 1227,1264, n. 57 (CA11 1982), cert. denied, 464 U. S. 1002 (1983).)

From what was said in Proffitt it would, as the en banc Elev-enth Circuit noted, "sensibly follow that the judge's proper
review of the sentence cures any risk of arbitrariness occa-sioned by the jury's consideration of an unconstitutionally
vague aggravating circumstance." Glock v. Singletary, 65
F. 3d 878, 886 (1995), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 888 (1996). It
could have been argued, of course, as Justice Stevens contends, see post, at 543 (dissenting opinion), that prior constitutional error by a sentencing-determining jury would make
a difference, but both the conclusion and the premise of that
argument were debatable: not only whether it would make
a difference, but even (as the succeeding point demonstrates)
whether there was any constitutional error by a sentencingdetermining jury.

(2) There was no error for the trial judge to cure, since
under Florida law the trial court, not the jury, was the sentencer. In Espinosa we concluded, in effect, that the jury
was at least in part a cosentencer along with the trial court.
That determination can fairly be traced to our opinion in
Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527 (1992), decided just three
weeks earlier, where we explained that under Florida law
the trial court "is at least a constituent part of `the sentencer,' " implying that the jury was that as well. Id., at
535-536. That characterization is in considerable tension
with our pre-1986 view. In Proffitt, for example, after considering Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908 (Fla. 1975), on which
Espinosa primarily relied, the Court determined that the
trial court was the sentencer. E. g., 428 U. S., at 249 ( joint
opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) ("[T]he actual

Opinion of the Court
sentence is determined by the trial judge" (emphasis added));
id., at 251 (the trial court is "[t]he sentencing authority in
Florida"); id., at 252 ("[T]he sentence is determined by thejudge rather than by the jury");

id., at 260 (White, J., concurring in judgment). We even distinguished the Florida
scheme from the Georgia scheme on the ground that "inFlorida the sentence is determined by the

trial judge rather
than by the jury." Id., at 252 ( joint opinion) (emphasisadded). Some eight years later, just two years before petitioner's conviction became final, we continued to describe thejudge as

the sentencer. See Spaziano v. Florida, 468 U. S.
447 (1984); see also Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 952-954
(1983) (plurality opinion); id., at 962 (Stevens, J., concurring
in judgment). (Although he now believes the jury is a cosentencer, at the time Lambrix's conviction became final
Justice Stevens had explained that "the sentencing authority [is] the jury in Georgia, the judge in Florida." Ibid.)
It would not have been unreasonable to rely on what we had
said in Proffitt, Spaziano, and Barclay--that the trial court
was the sentencer--and to conclude that where the sentencer
considered properly narrowed aggravators there was simply
no error under Godfrey or Maynard. The Florida Supreme
Court and the Eleventh Circuit held precisely that in 1989,
see Smalley v. State, 546 So. 2d 720, 722; Bertolotti v. Dugger, 883 F. 2d 1503, 1526-1527, cert. denied, 497 U. S. 1032
(1990); and in 1985 the Eleventh Circuit foresaw the possibility of such a holding: "[Spaziano's] reasoning calls into
question whether any given error in such a merely `advisory'
proceeding should be considered to be of constitutional magnitude." Proffitt v. Wainwright, 756 F. 2d 1500, 1502.

(3) The trial court's weighing of properly narrowed aggravators and mitigators was sufficiently independent of
the jury to cure any error in the jury's consideration of a

vague aggravator. Although the Florida Supreme Court had
interpreted its statute--which provided that the judge was
the sentencer, Fla. Stat. $ 921.141(3) (Supp. 1992), and that the

520US2 Unit: $U52 [09-10-99 19:18:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
jury rendered merely an "advisory sentence," $ 921.141(2)--asrequiring the trial judge to give "great weight" to a jury's

advisory recommendation, Tedder v. State, supra, that courtnonetheless emphasized that the trial court must "independently weigh the evidence in aggravation and mitigation," andthat "[u]nder no combination of circumstances can th[e]
[ jury's] recommendation usurp the judge's role by limitinghis discretion."

Eutzy v. State, 458 So. 2d 755, 759 (Fla.1984), cert. denied, 471 U. S. 1045 (1985). In one case, the

Florida Supreme Court vacated a sentence because the trialcourt had given "undue weight to the jury's recommendation of death and did not make an independent judgment ofwhether or not the death penalty should be imposed."

Rossv. State, 386 So. 2d 1191, 1197 (1980) (emphasis added). In

Spaziano v. Florida, supra, we acknowledged that the Flor-ida trial court conducts "its own weighing of the aggravating
and mitigating circumstances," id., at 451, and that "[r]egard-less of the jury's recommendation, the trial judge is required
to conduct an independent review of the evidence and tomake his own findings regarding aggravating and mitigating
circumstances," id., at 466 (emphasis added); see also Proffitt, 428 U. S., at 251.5 Given these precedents, it was rea5 Justice Stevens accuses us of "simply ignoring the reasoning in
Tedder." Post, at 543 (dissenting opinion). We have of course not done
so. See supra, at 526, 533-534 and this page. Justice Stevens, however, fails to discuss, or indeed even mention, the cases interpreting
Tedder that contradict the dissent's view--cases in both this Court and
the Florida Supreme Court repeatedly emphasizing the trial judge's obligation to make an independent assessment and weighing of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. He relies, for example, upon the
Florida Supreme Court's decision in Riley v. Wainwright, 517 So. 2d 656
(1987), see post, at 541, n. 3 (a decision rendered after Lambrix's conviction
became final and hence not technically relevant). But subsequent to that
case the Florida Supreme Court summarized its jurisprudence as follows:
"Our case law contains many instances where a trial judge's override
of a jury recommendation of life has been upheld. Notwithstanding the
jury recommendation, whether it be for life imprisonment or death, the
judge is required to make an independent determination, based on the

Opinion of the Court
sonable to think that the trial court's review would at least
constitute the sort of "reweighing" that would satisfy Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738 (1990), see also Stringer, 503
U. S., at 237. In fact, given the view of some Members of
this Court that appellate reweighing was inconsistent with
the Eighth Amendment, see, e. g., Cabana v. Bullock, 474
U. S. 376, 400-401, 404 (1986) (Blackmun, J., dissenting,
joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ.); Clemons, supra, at
769-772 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and
Stevens, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part), it
would have been reasonable to think that trial-court reweighing was preferable. As one Court of Appeals was
prompted to note, "Clemons's holding, which arguably points
in the opposite direction from Espinosa, indicates that even
in 1990 Espinosa's result would not have been dictated by
precedent." Glock v. Singletary, 65 F. 3d, at 887 (en banc).

That Espinosa announced a new rule is strongly confirmed
by our decision in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990).
Although decided after petitioner's conviction became final,
Walton is a particularly good proxy for what a reasonable
jurist would have thought in 1986, given that the only relevant cases decided by this Court in the interim were Maynard and Clemons, the holdings of both of which, we later

aggravating and mitigating factors. Moreover, this procedure has been
previously upheld against constitutional challenge." Grossman v. State,
525 So. 2d 833, 840 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added; citations omitted). "It is
clear . . . that the prosecutor correctly stated the law in Florida: the
judge is the sentencing authority and the jury's role is merely advisory."
Id., at 839. It is not our burden, of course, to establish that these statements in Grossman, or in the other cases we rely upon, were accurate; as
we later determined, they were wrong and the dissent's (current) reading
of Tedder is correct. But the question before us is whether a reasonable
jurist could have disagreed with the dissent's interpretation of Tedder at
the time of Lambrix's conviction. In treating as relevant to that question
only that portion of precedent vindicated by later decisions, Justice Stevens "endues the jurist with prescience, not reasonableness." Stringer
v. Black, 503 U. S. 222, 244 (1992) (Souter, J., dissenting).

Opinion of the Court
held, were compelled by the law in 1985, see Stringer, supra.In Walton, we rejected a claim that Arizona's HAC aggravator failed sufficiently to channel the sentencer's discretion.Summarizing Godfrey and Maynard, we explained that "in
neither case did the state appellate court, in reviewing thepropriety of the death sentence, purport to affirm the death
sentence by applying a limiting definition," and this, we said,"w[as] crucial to the conclusion we reached in

Maynard."Walton, supra, at 653. This reasoning suggests that even

following Maynard, a weighing-state death sentence wouldsatisfy the Eighth Amendment so long as the vague aggravator was narrowed at some point in the process. Addition-ally, in the course of our opinion, we characterized

Clemonsas follows:

"[E]ven if a trial judge fails to apply the narrowing con-struction or applies an improper construction, the Constitution does not necessarily require that a state appel-late court vacate a death sentence based on that factor.
Rather, as we held in Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S.738 (1990), a state appellate court may itself determine

whether the evidence supports the existence of the ag-gravating circumstance as properly defined

or the courtmay eliminate consideration of the factor altogether and

determine whether any remaining aggravating circum-stances are sufficient to warrant the death penalty."
Walton, supra, at 653-654 (emphasis added).
Our use of the disjunctive suggests that as late as 1990, if aFlorida trial court determined that the defendant's conduct

fell within the narrowed HAC aggravator, the sentencewould satisfy the Eighth Amendment irrespective of
whether the trial court reweighed the aggravating and miti-gating factors.

6 The holdings in Stringer, Maynard, Clem6 Justice Stevens is thus simply wrong in stating that we have confused appellate application of a limiting construction with a trial court's
deference to a tainted jury recommendation, see post, at 545 (dissenting

Opinion of the Court
ons, and Godfrey cannot be thought to suggest otherwise,because there was no indication in those cases that the state

courts had found the facts of the crimes to fall within appro-priately narrowed definitions of the aggravators. Before
Espinosa, we had never invalidated a death sentence wherea court found the challenged aggravator to be within the
appellate court's narrowed definition of a facially vagueaggravator.

Most of Justice Stevens's dissent is devoted to makinga forceful case that

Espinosa was a reasonable interpreta-tion of prior law--perhaps even the most reasonable one.

But the Teague inquiry--which is applied to Supreme Courtdecisions that are, one must hope,

usually the most reason-able interpretation of prior law--requires more than that.

It asks whether Espinosa was dictated by precedent--i. e.,whether no other interpretation was reasonable. We think
it plain from the above that a jurist considering all the rele-vant material (and not, like

Justice Stevens's dissent, con-sidering only the material that favors the

Espinosa result)could reasonably have reached a conclusion contrary to our

holding in that case. Indeed, both before and after Lambrix's conviction became final, every court decision we areaware of did so. See,

e. g., Smalley v. State, 546 So. 2d, at
722; Proffitt v. Wainwright, 756 F. 2d, at 1502; Bertolotti v.
Dugger, 883 F. 2d, at 1527; Sanchez-Velasco v. State, 570 So.
2d 908, 916 (Fla. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U. S. 929 (1991).It has been suggested that

Espinosa was not a new rule
because our decision was handed down as a per curiam without oral argument. See, e. g., Glock v. Singletary, 65 F. 3d,at 896, n. 11 (en banc) (Tjoflat, C. J., dissenting). Whatever

opinion). Walton indicated that our precedents provided two distinct
and permissible routes to satisfy the Eighth Amendment where the sentencer considered a vague aggravator: a court's finding of the aggravator
under a proper limiting construction, or independent reweighing of the
circumstances.

Opinion of the Court
inference of established law a summary, per curiam disposi-tion might normally carry is precluded by the peculiar circumstances surrounding the summary per curiam in Es-pinosa. Just three weeks prior to our issuance of Espinosa,
we had decided a case that raised the identical issue, and inwhich that issue had been fully briefed and argued; we found
ourselves without jurisdiction to decide the point, however,because the defendant had failed to preserve his objection in
the state courts. See Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S., at 533-534. It is obvious on the face of the matter that

Espinosawas only in the most technical sense an "unargued" case: We

used that case, which was pending on petition for certiorariwhen

Sochor was decided, as the vehicle for resolving a fullyargued point without consuming additional resources.

V
Since we have determined that Espinosa announced a newrule under Teague, there remains only the task of determining whether that new rule nonetheless falls within one of thetwo exceptions to our nonretroactivity doctrine. "The first
exception permits the retroactive application of a new ruleif the rule places a class of private conduct beyond the power
of the State to proscribe, see Teague, 489 U. S., at 311, oraddresses a `substantive categorical guarante[e] accorded by
the Constitution,' such as a rule `prohibiting a certain cate-gory of punishment for a class of defendants because of their
status or offense.' " Saffle v. Parks, 494 U. S., at 494 (quot-ing

Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U. S., at 329, 330). Plainly, thisexception has no application to this case. Espinosa "neither

decriminalize[s] a class of conduct nor prohibit[s] the imposi-tion of capital punishment on a particular class of persons."
494 U. S., at 495.

The second exception is for " `watershed rules of criminalprocedure' implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding." Ibid. (quoting Teague,

Stevens, J., dissenting
supra, at 311). Lambrix does not contend that this exception applies to Espinosa errors, and our opinion in Sawyer
v. Smith, 497 U. S., at 241-244, makes it quite clear that
that is so.

* * *

For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is Affirmed.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

Two propositions of law supported our holding in Espinosa
v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam): First, in a
capital sentencing proceeding in a State where the sentencer weighs aggravating and mitigating circumstances,
the Eighth Amendment is violated by a jury instruction
that fails to define the "especially heinous, atrocious, or
cruel" (HAC) aggravating circumstance. Second, in a Florida sentencing proceeding the trial court must give " `great
weight' " to the jury's recommendation, whether it be for life
or death. Id., at 1082. For these reasons, we concluded
in Espinosa that constitutional error that taints the jury's
recommendation presumptively taints the judge's sentence
as well. Ibid. The two propositions supporting the Espinosa holding were well established when that case was
decided. The first proposition dates back to 1980 when we
decided Godfrey v. Georgia, 446 U. S. 420, 428-429,1 and
the second was announced by the Florida Supreme Court in

1 Godfrey, of course, held that Georgia's "outrageously or wantonly vile,
horrible and inhuman" aggravating factor failed to adequately channel the
jury's discretion. See 446 U. S., at 428-429. We found the "heinous, atrocious or cruel" aggravator unconstitutional in Maynard v. Cartwright, 486
U. S. 356, 359 (1988), and subsequently noted that application of Godfrey
to the HAC instruction did not create a new rule. See Stringer v. Black,
503 U. S. 222, 228-229 (1992).

Stevens, J., dissenting
1975 in Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910.2 Thus I agreewith Chief Judge Tjoflat that our per curiam opinion in Espinosa amounted to "nothing more than an application ofwell-settled principles. . . . In declaring the Florida HAC
instruction unconstitutional, the Court simply applied thelaw as announced initially in

Godfrey and later reaffirmed inMaynard [v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988]). The Court's

conclusion--that the invalid instruction may have tainted thejury's death penalty recommendation and the trial judge's
sentence--merely acknowledged what the Supreme Courtof Florida has been holding for years." Glock v. Singletary,
65 F. 3d 878, 896 (CA11 1995) (dissenting opinion) (footnotesomitted).

3

Today the Court reaches the conclusion that Espinosa an-nounced a new rule by placing a novel interpretation on its

holding. The majority apparently construes Espinosa asholding that the constitutional error in the jury instruction
will "automatically render a defendant's sentence unconstitu-tional."

Ante, at 530.4 The Court suggests that our hold-ings in Godfrey, Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U. S. 356 (1988),

and Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 745 (1990)--that

2 These two "controlling precedents," both of which were cited in the
Espinosa opinion, provided sufficient support for its holding. Thus the
Court is simply mistaken when it asserts that "Espinosa itself did not
purport to rely upon any controlling precedent." Ante, at 528.

3 Tedder, of course, was not an isolated decision. In Riley v. Wainwright, 517 So. 2d 656 (Fla. 1987), the State Supreme Court put the point
succinctly: "If the jury's recommendation, upon which the judge must rely,
results from an unconstitutional procedure, then the entire sentencing
process necessarily is tainted by that procedure." Id., at 659. The Riley
court relied on a pre-Tedder decision stating that the advisory opinion of
the jury "is an integral part of the death sentencing process." 517 So. 2d,
at 657 (citing Lamadline v. State, 303 So. 2d 17, 20 (Fla. 1974)).

4 Responding to this dissent in n. 2, ante, at 528, the Court states that

the clause I have quoted was not intended to describe the Court's understanding of the holding in Espinosa. If that be so, the relevance of this
portion of the Court's opinion, including its reliance on Godfrey and Maynard, is opaque, at best.

Stevens, J., dissenting
an appellate court could cure a sentencing jury's weighing ofan invalid aggravator--might have led a reasonable jurist

down a road different from the one the Court followed inEspinosa.

5 But in holding that a trial judge's sentence may

be infected by the jury's consideration of an invalid aggra-vating factor,

Espinosa did not address the entirely separatequestion of whether the jury's error could be cured or considered harmless either at the trial or the appellate level.Indeed, in subsequent proceedings the Supreme Court of
Florida did conclude that the error in Espinosa's case washarmless and upheld his sentence of death. See Espinosa
v. State, 626 So. 2d 165, 167 (1993) (ruling that Espinosa'sHAC instruction claim was procedurally barred because he
had challenged the HAC factor rather than the instructionitself and, alternatively, that any error in the instruction
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt), cert. denied, 511U. S. 1152 (1994), and affirmed Espinosa's sentence. Our decision in Espinosa did not create a new rule prohibiting trialcourts from curing a jury's error, rather it held that "if a
weighing State decides to place capital sentencing authorityin two actors rather than one, neither actor must be permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances." 505 U. S.,at 1082. This holding is a logical consequence of applying
Godfrey to Florida's sentencing scheme.In a sinuous, difficult to follow argument, the Court suggests that three hypothetical propositions of law somehowdemonstrate that the narrow holding in

Espinosa was notdictated by Godfrey and Tedder. First, the Court posits

that a reasonable jurist might have believed that "[t]he merecabining of the trial court's discretion" was alone enough to
avoid constitutional error. Ante, at 532 (emphasis deleted).

5 The Court also relies heavily on a passage in our opinion in Walton v.
Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), noting that a trial judge's failure to apply a
narrowing construction to an invalid aggravator " `does not necessarily
require that a state appellate court vacate a death sentence based on that
factor.' " Ante, at 537.

Stevens, J., dissenting
A critical part of that "cabining," however, is Florida's re-quirement that a properly instructed jury must have an opportunity to recommend a life sentence, and that the judgemust give great weight to that recommendation. The role
of the jury is to provide one of the cabin's four walls. The
fact that three walls remain standing hardly excuses an errorthat removed the wall represented by the jury's recommendation. At the time of petitioner's sentencing, the FloridaSupreme Court recognized the jury's critical role, and, when
error occurred before the jury, did not hesitate to remandfor resentencing, even when the trial judge claimed to be
unaffected by the error. For example in Messer v. State,
330 So. 2d 137, 142 (1976), the State Supreme Court remanded for resentencing when the trial court failed to allow
the jury to consider certain mitigating evidence. The court
rejected the argument that the trial court's subsequent
weighing of the mitigating evidence cured the error: The
Florida scheme, the court concluded, was one of "checks and
balances in which the input of the jury serves as an integral
part." Ibid. Our holding in Proffitt v. Florida, 428 U. S.
242, 255 (1976) ( joint opinion), that Florida's sentencing
scheme is not facially unconstitutional does not suggest otherwise. There, we determined that the State's sentencing
procedure provided adequate safeguards against arbitrary
imposition of the death sentence in part because of the procedures followed by the trial judge in fixing the sentence. Our
focus was on the adequacy of the guidance provided by the
sentencing scheme; accordingly, we had no need to extensively examine or discuss the judge's relationship to the jury
or Florida Supreme Court decisions like Tedder.

Second, simply ignoring the reasoning in Tedder, the Court
suggests that there was "no error for the trial judge to
cure, since under Florida law the trial court, not the jury,
was the sentencer." Ante, at 533 (emphasis deleted). It is,
of course, true that the judge imposes the sentence after
receiving the jury's recommendation. But this has never

meant that constitutional error in the proceedings before thejury is simply irrelevant. Cf. Messer v. State, supra. As

then-Justice Rehnquist noted in 1983, it is well-settledFlorida law that if the jury makes a recommendation of life
imprisonment, "the trial judge may not impose a death sen-tence unless `the facts suggesting a sentence of death [are]
so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable personcould differ.'

Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908, 910 (1975)."Barclay v. Florida, 463 U. S. 939, 955-956 (plurality opinion).6 Similarly, a trial judge should not disturb a jury rec-ommendation of death "unless there appear strong reasons
to believe that reasonable persons could not agree with therecommendation." See

LeDuc v. State, 365 So. 2d 149, 151
(Fla. 1978), cert. denied, 444 U. S. 885 (1979). Given this,it is vacuous to argue that our prior references to the judge

as the sentencer somehow imply that an error before the
jury would not affect the ultimate sentence. It is equallyvacuous to suggest that our conclusion in

Espinosa "that the
jury was at least in part a cosentencer" had its source in acase decided "just three weeks earlier,"

ante, at 533 (citing
Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S. 527 (1992)). In that earlier case,we cited

Tedder after explaining that the jury was a constituent element of the sentencer "because the trial judge doesnot render wholly independent judgment, but must accord

deference to the jury's recommendation." Sochor, 504 U. S.,
at 533.Third, the Court suggests that the trial court's "weighing

of properly narrowed aggravators and mitigators was suffi-ciently independent of the jury to cure any error in the jury's
consideration of a vague aggravator." Ante, at 534 (em6 The Florida Supreme Court has applied Tedder in numerous cases to
reverse a trial judge's override of a jury's life sentence. See, e. g., Wasko
v. State, 505 So. 2d 1314, 1318 (1987); Goodwin v. State, 405 So. 2d 170, 172

phasis deleted). This suggestion is doubly flawed. Giventhat the judge's instruction to the jury failed to narrow the

HAC aggravator, there is no reason to believe that he ap-propriately narrowed the factor in his own deliberations.

7

More importantly, even if he did apply a limiting definition,his sentencing decision was made without the benefit of an

untainted recommendation from the jury, and, under Floridalaw, he could not have simply resentenced the petitioner
without regard to the jury's tainted recommendation. Norcan one simply conclude that this error made no practical
difference in petitioner's sentence. There is nothing in therecord to suggest that had the jury recommended a life sentence, the judge would have found that "the facts suggestinga sentence of death were so clear and convincing that virtually no reasonable person could differ," as Tedder requires.Here, again, the Court finds that our statements in cases
like Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), that a stateappellate court may affirm a death sentence resulting from
an unconstitutionally broad aggravator by applying a limit-ing definition, suggest that Espinosa is a new rule. The majority's analysis confuses an appellate court's application of alimiting definition on appellate review with a trial judge's
deference to a tainted jury recommendation. The judge inthis case did not indicate that he was applying a limiting
definition of the HAC factor, or that he was in some otherway curing or discounting the error in the jury instruction.
At the time of petitioner's sentencing, given Godfrey and
Tedder, this rendered petitioner's death sentence constitu-tionally defective.

As a matter of logic and law there was nothing new about
Espinosa's holding that the jury plays a central role in Flori-da's capital sentencing scheme. Moreover, as statistics that

7 Nothing in the record indicates that the judge recognized that the jury
instruction was erroneous, or that he sought to cure that error in his own
weighing process. In finding that the HAC aggravator was present, the
judge merely stated: "The facts speak for themselves." App. 20.

O'Connor, J., dissenting
I have previously summarized demonstrate, it was equallyclear as a matter of fact that "erroneous instructions to the

jury at the sentencing phase of the trial may make the differ-ence between life or death." Sochor v. Florida, 504 U. S.,
at 552.8I respectfully dissent.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
Although I agree with much of the reasoning set forth inPart II of the Court's opinion, I disagree with its disposition

of the case. I would instead vacate the judgment of theCourt of Appeals and remand the case so that the Court
of Appeals might consider the procedural bar issue in thefirst instance.

The Court holds that, as a general practice, a federal ha-beas court should consider whether the relief a habeas petitioner requests is a "new rule" under Teague v. Lane, 489U. S. 288 (1989), only after resolving the State's argument
that his claim is procedurally barred. Ante, at 525. Usu8 "As a matter of fact, the jury sentence is the sentence that is usually
imposed by the Florida Supreme Court. The State has attached an appendix to its brief, see App. to Brief for Respondent A1-A70, setting forth
data concerning 469 capital cases that were reviewed by the Florida Supreme Court between 1980 and 1991. In 341 of those cases (73%), the
jury recommended the death penalty; in none of those cases did the trial
judge impose a lesser sentence. In 91 cases (19%), the jury recommended
a life sentence; in all but one of those cases, the trial judge overrode the
jury's recommended life sentence and imposed a death sentence. In 69 of
those overrides (77%), however, the Florida Supreme Court vacated the
trial judge's sentence and either imposed a life sentence itself or remanded
for a new sentencing hearing.

"Two conclusions are evident. First, when the jury recommends a
death sentence, the trial judge will almost certainly impose that sentence.
Second, when the jury recommends a life sentence, although overrides
have been sustained occasionally, the Florida Supreme Court will normally uphold the jury rather than the judge. It is therefore clear that in
practice, erroneous instructions to the jury at the sentencing phase of the
trial may make the difference between life or death." Sochor v. Florida,
504 U. S., at 551-552 (footnote omitted).

O'Connor, J., dissenting
ally, then, when a federal habeas court has before it conten-tions that a petitioner's claim is barred both on state procedural grounds and because the petitioner seeks to rely on a"new rule" under

Teague, the court should consider the
Teague question only after the procedural bar issue has been
resolved in the petitioner's favor. As the Court recognizes,addressing the procedural bar issue first avoids unnecessary

consideration of constitutional questions and accords fittingrespect to the State's procedural rules, which are indispensable to the administration of its criminal justice system.
Ante, at 524-525.

With this much of the Court's opinion I agree. Of course,there may be exceptions to the rule that the procedural bar

issue should be resolved first. One case might be where the
procedural bar question is excessively complicated, but the
Teague issue can be easily resolved. The Court of Appeals
here gave no reason for its failure to consider the FloridaSupreme Court's determination that petitioner's claim based

on Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (1992) (per curiam),was procedurally barred. Indeed, the Court of Appeals did
not even discuss the state court's holding, let alone decidethat resolution of the procedural bar issue would be inappropriate in this case. I see no reason to think resolution of
the procedural bar question would be especially troublesome,
nor do I see any other reason for the Court of Appeals' failure to give priority to the State's argument that an independent and adequate state ground barred petitioner's
Espinosa claim.

Accordingly, I would remand the case to the Court of Appeals for it to resolve the procedural bar issue. As the
Court points out, the Court of Appeals is better suited to
evaluating matters of state procedure than are we. Ante,
at 525. In my view, then, it is premature to address the
State's contention that petitioner's Espinosa claim is barred
on Teague grounds. Nevertheless, since the Court reaches
the question, I wish to express my agreement with Justice
Stevens' resolution of the Teague issue.

HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAI et ux.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-1621. Argued January 13, 1997--Decided May 12, 1997
Respondent Papai was injured while painting the housing structure of the

tug Pt. Barrow. Petitioner Harbor Tug & Barge Co., the tug's operator, had hired him to do the work, which was expected to last one day
and would not involve sailing with the vessel. Papai had been employed by Harbor Tug on 12 previous occasions in the 21/2 months before
his injury, receiving those jobs through the Inland Boatman's Union
(IBU) hiring hall. He had been getting short-term jobs with various
vessels through the hiring hall for about 21/4 years. Most of those were
deckhand work, which Papai said involved manning the lines on- and
off-board vessels while they dock or undock. Papai sued Harbor Tug,
claiming, inter alia, negligence under the Jones Act, and his wife joined
as a plaintiff, claiming loss of consortium. The District Court granted
Harbor Tug summary judgment upon finding that Papai did not enjoy
seaman status under the Jones Act, and it later confirmed that adjudication. The Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded for a trial of, among
other things, Papai's seaman status and his corresponding Jones Act
claim. Based on Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347, the court described the relevant inquiry as not whether Papai had a permanent connection with the vessel but whether his relationship with a vessel or an
identifiable group of vessels was substantial in duration and nature, and
found that this required consideration of his employment's total circumstances. The court determined that a reasonable jury could conclude
that Papai satisfied that test, for if the type of work a maritime worker
customarily performs would entitle him to seaman status if performed
for a single employer, he should not be deprived of that status simply
because the industry operates under a daily assignment, rather than a
permanent employment, system.

Held:

1. Because the issue whether the record permits a reasonable jury to
conclude that Papai is a Jones Act seaman is here resolved in the employer's favor, this Court does not reach the question whether an administrative ruling for an employee on his claim of Longshore and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act coverage bars his claim of seaman status in
a Jones Act suit. P. 550.

2. This record would not permit a reasonable jury to conclude that
Papai is a Jones Act seaman. Jones Act coverage is confined to seamen,
those workers who face regular exposure to the perils of the sea. An
important part of the test for determining who is a seaman is whether
the injured worker has a substantial connection to a vessel or to a fleet
of vessels, and the latter concept requires a requisite degree of common
ownership or control. Chandris, 515 U. S., at 366. The requisite link
is not established by the mere use of the same hiring hall which draws
from the same pool of employees. The various vessels on which Papai
worked through the IBU hiring hall in the 21/4 years before his injury
were not linked by any common ownership or control. Considering
prior employments with independent employers in making the seaman
status inquiry would undermine "the interests of employers and maritime workers alike in being able to predict who will be covered by the
Jones Act . . . before a particular work day begins," id., at 363, and there
would be no principled basis for limiting which prior employments are
considered for determining seaman status. That the IBU Deckhands
Agreement classified Papai as a deckhand does not give him claim to
seaman status. Seaman status is based on his actual duties, South Chicago Coal & Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S. 251, 260, and Papai's duties
during the employment in question included no seagoing activity. Nor
is it reasonable to infer from his testimony that his 12 prior employments with Harbor Tug involved work of a seagoing nature that could
qualify him for seaman status. Pp. 553-560.

Opinion of the Court
General Kneedler, J. Davitt McAteer, Allen H. Feldman,
Nathaniel I. Spiller, and Mark S. Flynn.*

Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.
Adjudication to determine whether a maritime employeeis a seaman under the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. App. $ 688(a), or

a maritime employee covered by the Longshore and Harbor
Workers' Compensation Act (LHWCA), 44 Stat. (pt. 2) 1424,as amended, 33 U. S. C. $ 901

et seq., continues to be of concern in our system. The distinction between the two mutu-ally exclusive categories can be difficult to implement, and

many cases turn on their specific facts.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in this
case that there was a jury question as to whether an injuredworker was a Jones Act seaman. Granting the employer's
petition for a writ of certiorari, we brought two questions
before us. The first is whether an administrative ruling infavor of the employee on his claim of coverage under the

LHWCA bars his claim of seaman status in the Jones Actsuit he wishes to pursue in district court. The second is
whether this record would permit a reasonable jury to conclude the employee is a Jones Act seaman. We resolve the
second question in the employer's favor and, as it is dispositive of the case, we do not reach the first.

On the question of seaman status, there is an issue of significance beyond the facts of this case. Our statement in an
earlier case that a worker may establish seaman status based
on the substantiality of his connection to "an identifiable
group of . . . vessels" in navigation, see Chandris, Inc. v.

I
Respondent John Papai was painting the housing structureof the tug Pt. Barrow when a ladder he was on moved, he

alleges, causing him to fall and injure his knee. App. 50.Petitioner Harbor Tug & Barge Co., the tug's operator, had
hired Papai to do the painting work. Id., at 44. A primecoat of paint had been applied and it was Papai's task to
apply the finish coat. Id., at 45. There was no vessel cap-tain on board and Papai reported to the port captain, who
had a dockside office. Id., at 36-37. The employment wasexpected to begin and end the same day,

id., at 35, 48, andPapai was not going to sail with the vessel after he finished

painting, id., at 51. Papai had been employed by HarborTug on 12 previous occasions in the 2

1/2 months before his

injury.Papai received his jobs with Harbor Tug through the Inland Boatman's Union (IBU) hiring hall. He had been get-ting jobs with various vessels through the hiring hall for
about 21/4 years. All the jobs were short term. The longestlasted about 40 days and most were for 3 days or under.

Id.,at 29, 34. In a deposition, Papai described the work as coming under three headings: maintenance, longshoring, anddeckhand. Id., at 30-32. Papai said maintenance work involved chipping rust and painting aboard docked vessels.Id., at 30, 34-35. Longshoring work required helping to discharge vessels. Id., at 31. Deckhand work involved man-ning the lines on- and off-board vessels while they docked or
undocked. Id., at 30. As for the assignments he obtainedthrough the hiring hall over 2

1/4 years, most of them, says

Papai, involved deckhand work. Id., at 34.After his alleged injury aboard the

Pt. Barrow, Papai suedHarbor Tug in the United States District Court for the

Northern District of California, claiming negligence under

Opinion of the Court
the Jones Act and unseaworthiness under general maritimelaw, in addition to other causes of action. His wife joined as

a plaintiff, claiming loss of consortium. Harbor Tug soughtsummary judgment on Papai's Jones Act and unseaworthiness claims, contending he was not a seaman and so could not
prevail on either claim. The District Court granted HarborTug's motion and later denied Papai's motion for reconsideration. After our decisions in McDermott Int'l, Inc. v.
Wilander, 498 U. S. 337 (1991), and Southwest Marine, Inc.
v. Gizoni, 502 U. S. 81 (1991), the District Court granted amotion by Harbor Tug "to confirm" the earlier summary

adjudication of Papai's nonseaman status. The District
Court reasoned, under a test since superseded, see Chandris, supra, that Papai was not a seaman within the meaning of the Jones Act or the general maritime law, because
"he did not have a `more or less permanent connection' with
the vessel on which he was injured nor did he perform substantial work on the vessel sufficient for seaman status."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed and
remanded for a trial of Papai's seaman status and his corresponding Jones Act and unseaworthiness claims. Based on
our decision in Chandris, the court described the relevant
inquiry as "not whether plaintiff had a permanent connection
with the vessel [but] whether plaintiff 's relationship with a
vessel (or a group of vessels) was substantial in terms of
duration and nature, which requires consideration of the
total circumstances of his employment." 67 F. 3d 203, 206
(1995). A majority of the panel believed it would be reasonable for a jury to conclude the employee satisfied that test.
In the majority's view, "[i]f the type of work a maritime
worker customarily performs would entitle him to seaman
status if performed for a single employer, the worker should
not be deprived of that status simply because the industry
operates under a daily assignment rather than a permanent
employment system." Ibid. The majority also said the

Opinion of the Court
"circumstance" that Papai had worked for Harbor Tug on 12
occasions during the 21/2 months before his injury "may in
itself provide a sufficient connection" to Harbor Tug's vessels
to establish seaman status. Ibid.

Judge Poole dissented from the majority's holding that
there was a triable issue as to Papai's seaman status. He
recognized that Chandris held out the possibility of being a
seaman without a substantial connection to a particular vessel in navigation, provided one nevertheless had the required
connection to " `an identifiable group of such vessels.' " 67
F. 3d, at 209 (quoting 515 U. S., at 368). Judge Poole said,
however, it would be a mistake to view Chandris as holding
that, for seaman-status purposes, a "group may be identified
simply as those vessels on which a sailor sails, not just those
of a particular employer or controlling entity. . . . Th[e majority's holding] renders the `identifiable group' or `fleet' requirement a nullity." 67 F. 3d, at 209 (citation omitted).
Judge Poole also noted that the majority's position conflicted
with that of the Fifth Circuit (en banc) and of a Third Circuit
panel. Ibid. (citing Barrett v. Chevron, U. S. A., Inc., 781
F. 2d 1067 (CA5 1986) (en banc); Reeves v. Mobile Dredging & Pumping Co., 26 F. 3d 1247 (CA3 1994)); see also Johnson v. Continental Grain Co., 58 F. 3d 1232 (CA8 1995); but
see Fisher v. Nichols, 81 F. 3d 319, 323 (CA2 1996) (rejecting
common ownership or control requirement).

We granted certiorari, 518 U. S. 1055 (1996), and now
reverse.

The LHWCA, a maritime workers' compensation scheme,
excludes from its coverage "a master or member of a crew
of any vessel," 33 U. S. C. $ 902(3)(G). These masters and
crewmembers are the seamen entitled to sue for damages
under the Jones Act. Chandris, 515 U. S., at 355-358. In
other words, the LHWCA and the Jones Act are "mutually
exclusive." Id., at 355-356.

554 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAI

Opinion of the Court
Our recent cases explain the proper inquiry to determineseaman status. We need not restate that doctrinal development, see id., at 355-368; Wilander, supra, at 341-354, toresolve Papai's claim. It suffices to cite

Chandris, which
held, in pertinent part:

"[T]he essential requirements for seaman status are
twofold. First, . . . an employee's duties must contrib-ut[e] to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission. . . ."Second, and most important for our purposes here, a
seaman must have a connection to a vessel in navigation
(or to an identifiable group of such vessels) that is sub-stantial in terms of both its duration and its nature."

515 U. S., at 368 (citations and internal quotationmarks omitted).

The seaman inquiry is a mixed question of law and fact, andit often will be inappropriate to take the question from the
jury. Nevertheless, "summary judgment or a directed ver-dict is mandated where the facts and the law will reasonably
support only one conclusion." Wilander, supra, at 356; see
also Chandris, 515 U. S., at 368-369.

Harbor Tug does not dispute that it would be reasonable
for a jury to conclude Papai's duties aboard the Pt. Barrow
(or any other vessel he worked on through the IBU hiring
hall) contributed to the function of the vessel or the accomplishment of its mission, satisfying Chandris' first standard.
Nor does Harbor Tug dispute that a reasonable jury could
conclude that the Pt. Barrow or other vessels Papai worked
on were in navigation. The result, as will often be the case,
is that seaman status turns on the part of Chandris' second
standard which requires the employee to show "a connection
to a vessel in navigation (or to an identifiable group of such
vessels) that is substantial in terms of both its duration and

Opinion of the Court
"The fundamental purpose of th[e] substantial connec-tion requirement is to give full effect to the remedial

scheme created by Congress and to separate the sea-based maritime employees who are entitled to Jones Act
protection from those land-based workers who have onlya transitory or sporadic connection with a vessel in navigation, and therefore whose employment does not regu-larly expose them to the perils of the sea."

Ibid.

For the substantial connection requirement to serve its pur-pose, the inquiry into the nature of the employee's connection

to the vessel must concentrate on whether the employee'sduties take him to sea. This will give substance to the inquiry both as to the duration and nature of the employee'sconnection to the vessel and be helpful in distinguishing
land-based from sea-based employees.Papai argues, and the Court of Appeals majority held, that
Papai meets Chandris' second test based on his employmentswith the various vessels he worked on through the IBU hiring hall in the 21/4 years before his injury, vessels owned, itappears, by three different employers not linked by any common ownership or control, App. 38. He also did longshoringwork through the hiring hall,

id., at 31, and it appears thiswas for still other employers,

id., at 38. As noted above,Papai testified at his deposition that the majority of his work

during this period was deckhand work. According to Papai,this satisfies Chandris because the group of vessels Papai
worked on through the IBU hiring hall constitutes "an iden-tifiable group of . . . vessels" to which he has a "substantial
connection." 515 U. S., at 368.The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was the first to
hold that a worker could qualify as a seaman based on hisconnection to a group of vessels rather than a particular one.
In Braniff v. Jackson Ave.-Gretna Ferry, Inc., 280 F. 2d523 (1960), the court held the employer was not entitled to
summary judgment on the seaman-status question where an

Opinion of the Court
employee's job was to perform maintenance work on the em-ployer's fleet of ferry boats, often while the boats were running: "The usual thing, of course, is for a person to have aJones Act seaman status in relation to a particular vessel.
But there is nothing about this . . . concept to limit it mechanically to a single ship." Id., at 528. There is "no insur-mountable difficulty," the court explained, in finding seaman

status based on the employee's relationship to "several spe-cific vessels"--"an identifiable fleet"--as opposed to a single
one. Ibid.We, in turn, adverted to the group of vessels concept in
Chandris. We described it as a rule "allow[ing] seaman status for those workers who had the requisite connection with
an `identifiable fleet' of vessels, a finite group of vessels under
common ownership or control." 515 U. S., at 366. The majority in the Court of Appeals did not discuss our description
of the group of vessels concept as requiring common ownership or control, nor did it discuss other Courts of Appeals
cases applying the concept, see, e. g., Reeves v. Mobile
Dredging & Pumping Co., 26 F. 3d, at 1258. The court
pointed to this statement from Chandris: "[W]e see no reason to limit the seaman status inquiry . . . exclusively to an
examination of the overall course of a worker's service with a
particular employer." 515 U. S., at 371-372. It interpreted
this to mean "it may be necessary to examine the work performed by the employee while employed by different employers during the relevant time period." 67 F. 3d, at 206.
The court did not define what it meant by "the relevant time
period." In any event, the context of our statement in
Chandris makes clear our meaning, which is that the employee's prior work history with a particular employer may not
affect the seaman inquiry if the employee was injured on a
new assignment with the same employer, an assignment
with different "essential duties" from his previous ones. 515
U. S., at 371. In Chandris, the words "particular employer"
give emphasis to the point that the inquiry into the nature

520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

557Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
of the employee's duties for seaman-status purposes mayconcentrate on a narrower, not broader, period than the employee's entire course of employment with his current em-ployer. There was no suggestion of a need to examine the
nature of an employee's duties with prior employers. See
also id., at 367 ("Since Barrett [v. Chevron, U. S. A., Inc., 781F. 2d 1067 (CA5 1986) (en banc)], the Fifth Circuit consistently has analyzed the problem [of determining seaman sta-tus] in terms of the percentage of work performed on vessels
for the employer in question"). The Court of Appeals ma-jority interpreted the words "particular employer" outside
the limited discussion in which we used them and, as a result,
gave the phrase a meaning opposite from what the context
requires.

The Court of Appeals stressed that various of Papai's employers had "join[ed] together to obtain a common labor pool
on which they draw by means of a union hiring hall." 67
F. 3d, at 206; see also id., at 206, n. 3 (suggesting that this
case involves a "group of vessels [that] have collectively
agreed to obtain employees" from a hiring hall). There is
no evidence in the record that the contract Harbor Tug had
with the IBU about employing deckhands (IBU Deckhands
Agreement) was negotiated by a multiemployer bargaining
group, and, even if it had been, that would not affect the
result here. There was no showing that the group of vessels
the court sought to identify were subject to unitary ownership or control in any aspect of their business or operation.
So far as the record shows, each employer was free to hire,
assign, and direct workers for whatever tasks and time
period they each determined, limited, at most, by the IBU
Deckhands Agreement. In deciding whether there is an
identifiable group of vessels of relevance for a Jones Act
seaman-status determination, the question is whether the
vessels are subject to common ownership or control. The
requisite link is not established by the mere use of the same
hiring hall which draws from the same pool of employees.

558 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAI

Opinion of the Court
Considering prior employments with independent employ-ers in making the seaman-status inquiry would undermine

"the interests of employers and maritime workers alike inbeing able to predict who will be covered by the Jones Act
(and, perhaps more importantly for purposes of the employers' workers' compensation obligations, who will be coveredby the LHWCA) before a particular work day begins."

Chandris, supra, at 363. There would be no principled basisfor limiting which prior employments are considered for
determining seaman status. The Court of Appeals spoke ofa "relevant time period" but, as noted above, it did not define
this term. Since the substantial connection standard is
often, as here, the determinative element of the seaman
inquiry, it must be given workable and practical confines.
When the inquiry further turns on whether the employee has
a substantial connection to an identifiable group of vessels,
common ownership or control is essential for this purpose.

Papai contends his various employers through the hiring
hall would have been able to predict his status as a seaman
under the Jones Act based on the seagoing nature of some of
the duties he could have been hired to perform consistent
with his classification as a "qualified deckhand" under the
IBU Deckhands Agreement. By the terms of the agreement, Papai was qualified as a "satisfactory helmsman and
lookout," for example, and he could have been hired to serve
a vessel while it was underway, in which case his duties
would have included "conduct[ing] a check of the engine
room status a minimum of two (2) times each watch . . . for
vessel safety reasons." App. 77. In South Chicago Coal &
Dock Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S. 251 (1940), we rejected a claim
to seaman status grounded on the employee's job title, which
also happened to be "deckhand." "The question," we said,
"concerns his actual duties." Id., at 260. See also Northeast Marine Terminal Co. v. Caputo, 432 U. S. 249, 268, n. 30
(1977) (reasoning that employee's membership in longshoremen's union was, in itself, irrelevant to whether employee

520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

559Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
was covered by the LHWCA, as fact of union membershipwas unrelated to the purposes of the LHWCA's coverage

provisions). The question is what connection the employeehad in actual fact to vessel operations, not what a union
agreement says. Papai was qualified under the IBU Deckhands Agreement to perform nonseagoing work in additionto the seagoing duties described above. His actual duty on

the Pt. Barrow throughout the employment in question didnot include any seagoing activity; he was hired for one day
to paint the vessel at dockside and he was not going to sailwith the vessel after he finished painting it. App. 44, 48, 51.
This is not a case where the employee was hired to perform
seagoing work during the employment in question, however
brief, and we need not consider here the consequences
of such an employment. The IBU Deckhands Agreement
gives no reason to assume that any particular percentage of
Papai's work would be of a seagoing nature, subjecting him
to the perils of the sea. In these circumstances, the union
agreement does not advance the accuracy of the seamanstatus inquiry.

Papai argues he qualifies as a seaman if we consider his 12
prior employments with Harbor Tug over the 21/2 months
before his injury. Papai testified at his deposition that he
worked aboard the Pt. Barrow on three or four occasions
before the day he was injured, the most recent of which was
more than a week earlier. Id., at 35, 44. Each of these engagements involved only maintenance work while the tug
was docked. Id., at 34-35. The nature of Papai's connection to the Pt. Barrow was no more substantial for seamanstatus purposes by virtue of these engagements than the one
during which he was injured. Papai does not identify with
specificity what he did for Harbor Tug the other eight or
nine times he worked for the company in the 21/2 months

before his injury. The closest he comes is his deposition testimony that 70 percent of his work over the 21/4 years before
his injury was deckhand work. Id., at 34. Coupled with

560 HARBOR TUG & BARGE CO. v. PAPAI

Stevens, J., dissenting
the fact that none of Papai's work aboard the Pt. Barrowwas of a seagoing nature, it would not be reasonable to infer

from Papai's testimony that his recent engagements withHarbor Tug involved work of a seagoing nature. In any
event, these discrete engagements were separate from the
one in question, which was the sort of "transitory or spo-radic" connection to a vessel or group of vessels that, as

we explained in Chandris, does not qualify one for seamanstatus. 515 U. S., at 368.

Jones Act coverage is confined to seamen, those workerswho face regular exposure to the perils of the sea. An important part of the test for determining who is a seaman iswhether the injured worker seeking coverage has a substantial connection to a vessel or a fleet of vessels, and the latter
concept requires a requisite degree of common ownership orcontrol. The substantial connection test is important in distinguishing between sea- and land-based employment, forland-based employment is inconsistent with Jones Act coverage. This was the holding in Chandris, and we adhere to ithere. The only connection a reasonable jury could identify
among the vessels Papai worked aboard is that each hiredsome of its employees from the same union hiring hall from
which Papai was hired. That is not sufficient to establish
seaman status under the group of vessels concept. Papai
had the burden at summary judgment to "set forth specific
facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial." Fed.
Rule Civ. Proc. 56(e). He failed to meet it. The Court of
Appeals erred in holding otherwise. Its judgment is
reversed. It is so ordered.

Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

During the 2-year period immediately before his injury,
respondent Papai worked as a maintenance man and a deckhand for various employers who hired out of the Inland Boat520US2 Unit: $U53 [09-10-99 19:24:37] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Stevens, J., dissenting
man's Union hiring hall. He testified that about 70 percent
of his work was as a deckhand, and that "most of that work
[was] done while the boats were moving on the water."
App. 34. If all of that deckhand work had been performed
for petitioner, there would be no doubt about Papai's status
as a seaman.

Petitioner, however, did not maintain a permanent crew
on any of its vessels. 67 F. 3d 203, 204 (CA9 1995). Instead,
like other tugboat operators in the San Francisco Bay area,
it obtained its deckhands on a job-by-job basis through the
union hiring hall. Under these circumstances, I believe the
Court of Appeals correctly concluded that Papai's status as
a seaman should be tested by the character of his work for
the group of vessel owners that used the same union agent
to make selections from the same pool of employees.

In Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U. S. 347 (1995), the Court
rejected a "voyage test" of seaman status, concluding that
an employee who was injured while performing his duties on
a vessel on the high seas was not necessarily a Jones Act
seaman. Id., at 358-364. The Court instead adopted a
status-based inquiry that looked at the nature and duration
of the employee's relationship to a vessel--or an identifiable
group of vessels--in navigation to determine whether that
employee received Jones Act coverage. Id., at 370-371.
Today, the majority apparently concludes that an employee
is not necessarily protected by the Jones Act even if he was
injured aboard a vessel in navigation and his work over the
preceding two years was primarily seaman's work. I believe this conclusion is unsupported by either the reasoning
or the language in the Chandris opinion.

Chandris' status-based test requires a maritime worker to
have a relationship that is substantial in duration and nature
with a vessel, or an identifiable group of vessels, in navigation. See id., at 376. Nothing in the Court's holding there
intimated that the "identifiable group of vessels" need all be

owned by the same person.1 Particularly in a labor marketdesigned to allow employers to rely on temporary workers

for a range of jobs, there is "no reason to limit the seamanstatus inquiry . . . exclusively to an examination of the overall course of a worker's service with a particular employer."
Id., at 371-372. As the Court of Appeals observed in thiscase: "If the type of work a maritime worker customarily

performs would entitle him to seaman status if performedfor a single employer, the worker should not be deprived of
that status simply because the industry operates under adaily assignment rather than a permanent employment
system." 67 F. 3d, at 206.The unfairness created by the Court's rule is evident.
Let us assume that none of the tugboat operators in the bay
area have permanent crews and that all of them obtain theirdeckhands on a more or less random basis through the same

hiring hall. Further, assume that about 70 percent of the
work performed by the employees thus obtained is seaman's
work, while the remainder is shore-based maintenance work.
A typical employee working for a typical employer in that
pool would have the status of a seaman, and both the employees and the employers would be aware of this reality about
their work environment. But under the Court's reasoning,
even if over 70 percent of his randomly selected assignments
during a 2-year period were seaman assignments, an injured
worker would not be a seaman for Jones Act purposes if he
happened to receive only a few assignments with the owner
of the particular boat on which he was injured and those
assignments were not seaman's work.

1 The majority puts great weight on Chandris' description of the Fifth
Circuit's case law developing the fleet doctrine as "modif[ying] the test to
allow seaman status for those workers who had the requisite connection
with an `identifiable fleet' of vessels, a finite group of vessels under common ownership or control." Chandris, 515 U. S., at 366. See ante, at
556. But that description of the lower court's case law did not form part
of the Chandris holding, and it should not control the outcome here.

563Cite as: 520 U. S. 548 (1997)
Stevens, J., dissenting
The majority tries to justify this conclusion with the argu-ment that a rule acknowledging an employee's status as a

seaman based on the work he does for a number of employerswho hire out of the same hiring hall would create uncertainties for employers. Ante, at 558. The Court's concern isthat an employer might not realize that an employee he
had selected to chip paint on a docked boat had spent mostof the past year as a deckhand on a neighboring vessel. This
fear is exaggerated, since an employer who hires its workersout of a union hiring hall should be presumed to be familiar
with the general character of their work. Moreover, surelythe unfairness created by the majority's rule outweighs this
concern.Of course, in order to hold a particular employer liable,
an employment relationship must have existed between theworker and the particular vessel owner at the time of the
injury. Chandris teaches us, however, that the specific ac-tivity being performed at the time of the injury is not sufficient to establish the employee's status under the Jones Act.Rather, we must determine whether an employee has seaman status by looking at his work history. The character ofthat history in the market from which a vessel owner obtains
all of its crews seems to me just as relevant as the assign-ments to the particular operator for whom work was being
performed when the injury occurred.Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of
Appeals.2

2 On the question the Court does not reach, I think the Court of Appeals
correctly interpreted our opinion in Southwest Marine, Inc. v. Gizoni, 502
U. S. 81 (1991). See also G. Gilmore & C. Black, Law of Admiralty 435
(2d ed. 1975).

CAMPS NEWFOUND/OWATONNA, INC. v. TOWNOF HARRISON

et al.

certiorari to the supreme judicial court of maine

No. 94-1988. Argued October 9, 1996--Decided May 19, 1997
Petitioner, a Maine nonprofit corporation, operates a church camp for children, most of whom are not Maine residents. Petitioner is financed
through camper tuition and other revenues. From 1989 to 1991, it paid
over $20,000 per year in real estate and personal property taxes. A
state statute provides a general exemption from those taxes for charitable institutions incorporated in Maine. With respect to institutions
operated principally for the benefit of Maine nonresidents, however,
a charity may only qualify for a more limited tax benefit, and then
only if its weekly charge for services does not exceed $30 per person.
Petitioner was ineligible for any exemption, because its campers were
largely nonresidents and its weekly tuition was roughly $400 per
camper. After respondent town of Harrison (Town) rejected its request for a refund of taxes already paid and a continuing exemption
from future taxes, which was based principally on a claim that the tax
exemption statute violated the Commerce Clause, petitioner filed suit
and was awarded summary judgment by the Superior Court. The
Maine Supreme Judicial Court reversed, holding that petitioner had not
met its burden of persuasion that the statute is unconstitutional.

Held: An otherwise generally applicable state property tax violates the

Commerce Clause if its exemption for property owned by charitable
institutions excludes organizations operated principally for the benefit
of nonresidents. Pp. 571-595.

(a) Because the Government lacked power to regulate interstate commerce during the Nation's first years, the States freely adopted measures fostering local interests without regard to possible prejudice to
nonresidents, resulting in a "conflict of commercial regulations, destructive to the harmony of the States." Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 224
(Johnson, J., concurring in judgment). Arguably, this was the cause of
the Constitutional Convention. Ibid. The Commerce Clause not only
granted Congress express authority to override restrictive and conflicting state commercial regulations, but also effected a curtailment of state
power even absent congressional legislation. Pp. 571-572.

(b) The Court is unpersuaded by the Town's arguments that the dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable here, either because campers are

520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus
not "articles of commerce," or more generally because interstate commerce is not implicated. The camp is unquestionably engaged in commerce, not only as a purchaser, see, e. g., Katzenbach v. McClung, 379
U. S. 294, 300-301, but also as a provider of goods and services akin to
a hotel, see, e. g., Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S.
241, 244, 258. Although the latter case involved Congress' affirmative
powers, its reasoning is applicable in the dormant Commerce Clause
context. See, e. g., Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322, 326, n. 2. The
Town's further argument that the dormant Clause is inapplicable because a real estate tax is at issue is also rejected. Even assuming, as
the Town argues, that Congress could not impose a national real estate
tax, States are not free to levy such taxes in a manner that discriminates
against interstate commerce. Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S.
553, 596. Pp. 572-575.

(c) There is no question that if this statute targeted profit-making
entities, it would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. The statute
discriminates on its face against interstate commerce: It expressly distinguishes between entities that serve a principally interstate clientele
and those that primarily serve an intrastate market, singling out camps
that serve mostly in-staters for beneficial tax treatment, and penalizing
those camps that do a principally interstate business. Such laws are
virtually per se invalid. E. g., Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325,
331. Because the Town did not attempt to defend the statute by demonstrating that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be
adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives, e. g.,
Oregon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality
of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 101, the Court does not address this question. See
Fulton Corp., 516 U. S., at 333-334. Pp. 575-583.

(d) The rule applicable to profit-making enterprises also applies to
a discriminatory tax exemption for charitable and benevolent institutions. The dormant Commerce Clause's applicability to the nonprofit
sector follows from this Court's decisions holding not-for-profit institutions subject to laws regulating commerce, e. g., Associated Press v.
NLRB, 301 U. S. 103, 129, and to the federal antitrust laws, e. g., National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla.,
468 U. S. 85, 100, n. 22. The Court has already held that the dormant
Clause applies to activities not intended to earn a profit, Edwards v.
California, 314 U. S. 160, 172, n. 1, and there is no reason why an enterprise's nonprofit character should exclude it from the coverage of either
the affirmative or the negative aspect of the Clause, see, e. g., Hughes v.
Oklahoma, 441 U. S., at 326, n. 2. Whether operated on a for-profit or

nonprofit basis, camps such as petitioner's purchase goods and services
in competitive markets, offer their facilities to a variety of patrons, and
derive revenues from a variety of local and out-of-state sources. Any
categorical distinction on the basis of profit is therefore wholly illusory.
Pp. 583-588.

(e) The Town's arguments that the exemption statute should be
viewed as either a legitimate discriminatory subsidy of those charities
that focus on local concerns, see, e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v.
Healy, 512 U. S. 186, 199, or alternatively as a governmental "purchase"
of charitable services falling within the narrow exception to the dormant Commerce Clause for States in their role as "market participants,"
see, e. g., Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794; Reeves, Inc.
v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, are unpersuasive. Although tax exemptions and
subsidies serve similar ends, they differ in important and relevant respects that preclude approval of the statute at issue. See, e. g., West
Lynn, 512 U. S., at 269, 278 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). As
for the "market participant" argument, the Court has already rejected
the Town's position in New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269,
277, and in any event respondents' open-ended exemption is not analogous to the industry-specific state actions approved in Alexandria
Scrap and Reeves. Pp. 588-594.

(f) This case's facts, viewed in isolation, do not appear to pose any
threat to the national economy's health. Nevertheless, history, including the history of commercial conflict that preceded the Constitutional
Convention as well as the uniform course of Commerce Clause jurisprudence animated and enlightened by that early history, has shown that
even the smallest discrimination invites significant inroads on national
solidarity. See Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511, 523.

OF HARRISON

Opinion of the Court

The Maine statute at issue, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36,$ 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996), provides a general exemption from

real estate and personal property taxes for "benevolent andcharitable institutions incorporated" in the State. With
respect to institutions that are "in fact conducted or oper-ated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine," however, a charity may only qualify for amore limited tax benefit, and then only if the weekly charge

"The following property of institutions and organizations is exempt
from taxation:

"1. Property of institutions and organizations.
"A. The real estate and personal property owned and occupied or used
solely for their own purposes by benevolent and charitable institutions
incorporated by this State, and none of these may be deprived of the right
of exemption by reason of the source from which its funds are derived or
by reason of limitation in the classes of persons for whose benefit such
funds are applied.

"(1) Any such institution that is in fact conducted or operated principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine is entitled
to an exemption not to exceed $50,000 of current just value only when the
total amount of any stipends or charges that it makes or takes during any
tax year, as defined by section 502, for its services, benefits or advantages
divided by the total number of persons receiving such services, benefits
or advantages during the same tax year does not result in an average rate
in excess of $30 per week when said weekly rate is computed by dividing
the average yearly charge per person by the total number of weeks in a
tax year during which such institution is in fact conducted or operated
principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine. No
such institution that is in fact conducted or operated principally for the
benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine and makes charges that
result in an average weekly rate per person, as computed under this subparagraph, in excess of $30 may be entitled to tax exemption. This subparagraph does not apply to institutions incorporated as nonprofit corporations for the sole purpose of conducting medical research.

3 And, since the weekly tuition was roughly $400, petitioner was ineligible for any charitable tax exemption at all.In 1992 petitioner made a formal request to the Town for

a refund of taxes paid from 1989 through 1991, and a continu-ing exemption from future property taxes, based principally
on a claim that the tax exemption statute violated the Com-merce Clause of the Federal Constitution.

denied, and petitioner filed suit in the Superior Court againstthe Town and its tax assessors and collectors.

3 The statute's language reserving the property tax exemption for those

entities operated "principally for the benefit" of Maine residents is not
without ambiguity. The parties are in agreement, however, that because
petitioner's camp is attended almost entirely by out-of-staters, it would
not qualify for the exemption under any reading of the language. See
Brief for Petitioner 2; Brief for Respondents 2, n. 3; Tr. of Oral Arg. 36.
The courts below appear to have presumed the same, and we of course
accept their interpretation of state law.

4 Petitioner also argued below that the Maine statute violated the Equal

Protection Clauses of the United States and Maine Constitutions, and the
Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, $ 2, of the Federal Constitution.
The Maine Supreme Judicial Court had already found the statute constitutional under an equal protection analysis in a prior decision, and adhered
to its earlier view. See Green Acre Baha'i Institute v. Eliot, 159 Me. 395,
193 A. 2d 564 (1963); 655 A. 2d 876, 879-880 (1995). As for the privileges
and immunities claim, the Supreme Judicial Court found petitioner's argument unavailing. Id., at 880. These claims are not before us.

constitutionality of its statute. App. to Pet. for Cert. 9a. However, the

Opinion of the Court

parties agreed on the relevant facts, they filed cross-motionsfor summary judgment. The Superior Court ruled for petitioner, explaining that under Maine's statute:

"Denial of a tax exemption is explicitly and primarilytriggered by engaging in a certain level of interstate

commerce. This denial makes operation of the institu-tions serving non-residents more expensive. This increased cost results from an impermissible distinc-tion between in-state and out-of-state consumers. See
Commonwealth Edison Co., 453 U. S., at 617-19. . . .Maine's charitable tax exemption is denied, not because
there is a difference between the activities of charitableinstitutions serving residents and non-residents, but because of the residency of the people whom the institu-tions serve." App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a-15a (footnote
omitted).
The Town, but not the State, appealed and the Maine Su-preme Judicial Court reversed. 655 A. 2d 876 (1995). Noting that a Maine statute 6 characterized tax exemptions as"tax expenditures," it viewed the exemption for charitable
institutions as the equivalent of a purchase of their services.
Id., at 878. Because the exemption statute "treats all Mainecharities alike"--given the fact that "all have the opportunity to qualify for an exemption by choosing to dispense themajority of their charity locally"--it "regulates evenhandedly with only incidental effects on interstate commerce."
Id., at 879. In the absence of evidence that petitioner'scamp "competes with other summer camps outside of or

within Maine," or that the statute "impedes interstatetravel" or that it "provides services that are necessary for
interstate travel," the Court concluded that petitioner had

II
During the first years of our history as an independentconfederation, the National Government lacked the power to

regulate commerce among the States. Because each Statewas free to adopt measures fostering its own local interests
without regard to possible prejudice to nonresidents, whatJustice Johnson characterized as a "conflict of commercial
regulations, destructive to the harmony of the States," en-sued. See

Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 224 (1824) (opinionconcurring in judgment). In his view, this "was the immediate cause that led to the forming of a [constitutional] conven-tion."

Ibid. "If there was any one object riding overevery other in the adoption of the constitution, it was to keep

the commercial intercourse among the States free from allinvidious and partial restraints." Id., at 231.

We have subsequently endorsed Justice Johnson's ap-praisal of the central importance of federal control over interstate and foreign commerce and, more narrowly, his con-clusion that the Commerce Clause had not only granted
Congress express authority to override restrictive and con-flicting commercial regulations adopted by the States, but
that it also had immediately effected a curtailment of statepower. "In short, the Commerce Clause even without implementing legislation by Congress is a limitation upon thepower of the States.

v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 534-535 (1949). Although Con-gress unquestionably has the power to repudiate or substantially modify that course of adjudication,8 it has not done so.This case involves an issue that we have not previously
addressed--the disparate real estate tax treatment of a non-profit service provider based on the residence of the consumers that it serves. The Town argues that our dormantCommerce Clause jurisprudence is wholly inapplicable to
this case, because interstate commerce is not implicated hereand Congress has no power to enact a tax on real estate.
We first reject these arguments, and then explain why we
think our prior cases make it clear that if profit-making en-terprises were at issue, Maine could not tax petitioner more

heavily than other camp operators simply because its camp-ers come principally from other States. We next address
the novel question whether a different rule should apply toa discriminatory tax exemption for charitable and benevolent
institutions. Finally, we reject the Town's argument thatthe exemption should either be viewed as a permissible subsidy or as a purchase of services by the State acting as a
"market participant." III

We are unpersuaded by the Town's argument that the
dormant Commerce Clause is inapplicable here, either because campers are not "articles of commerce" or, more gen-erally, because the camp's "product is delivered and `consumed' entirely within Maine." Brief for Respondents

Opinion of the Court
17-18. Even though petitioner's camp does not make a
profit, it is unquestionably engaged in commerce, not only as
a purchaser, see Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 300-
301 (1964); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 558 (1995),
but also as a provider of goods and services. It markets
those services, together with an opportunity to enjoy the
natural beauty of an inland lake in Maine, to campers who
are attracted to its facility from all parts of the Nation. The
record reflects that petitioner "advertises for campers in
[out-of-state] periodicals . . . and sends its Executive Director annually on camper recruiting trips across the country."
App. 49-50. Petitioner's efforts are quite successful; 95 percent of its campers come from out of State. The attendance
of these campers necessarily generates the transportation of
persons across state lines that has long been recognized as a
form of "commerce." Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160,
172 (1941); see also Caminetti v. United States, 242 U. S. 470,
491 (1917); Hoke v. United States, 227 U. S. 308, 320 (1913).

Summer camps are comparable to hotels that offer their
guests goods and services that are consumed locally. In
Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241
(1964), we recognized that interstate commerce is substantially affected by the activities of a hotel that "solicits
patronage from outside the State of Georgia through various
national advertising media, including magazines of national
circulation." Id., at 243. In that case, we held that commerce was substantially affected by private race discrimination that limited access to the hotel and thereby impeded
interstate commerce in the form of travel. Id., at 244, 258;
see Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558-559. Official discrimination that
limits the access of nonresidents to summer camps creates a
similar impediment. Even when business activities are
purely local, if " `it is interstate commerce that feels the
pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze.' " Heart of Atlanta, 379 U. S., at 258

Opinion of the Court

(quoting United States v. Women's Sportswear Mfrs. Assn.,336 U. S. 460, 464 (1949)).

Although Heart of Atlanta involved Congress' affirmativeCommerce Clause powers, its reasoning is applicable here.
As we stated in Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322 (1979):
"The definition of `commerce' is the same when relied on tostrike down or restrict state legislation as when relied on to

support some exertion of federal control or regulation." Id.,at 326, n. 2. That case in turn rested upon our reasoning in
Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978), in whichwe rejected a "two-tiered definition of commerce."

Id., at
622. "Just as Congress ha[d] power to regulate the interstate movement of [the] wastes" at issue in that case, so too
we held were States "not free from constitutional scrutiny
when they restrict that movement." Id., at 622-623. See
also Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941,
953 (1982).

The Town's arguments that the dormant Commerce Clause
is inapplicable to petitioner because the campers are not "articles of commerce," or more generally that interstate commerce is not at issue here, are therefore unpersuasive. The
services that petitioner provides to its principally out-ofstate campers clearly have a substantial effect on commerce,
as do state restrictions on making those services available to
nonresidents. Cf. C & A Carbone, Inc. v. Clarkstown, 511
U. S. 383, 391 (1994).

The Town also argues that the dormant Commerce Clause
is inapplicable because a real estate tax is at issue. We disagree. A tax on real estate, like any other tax, may impermissibly burden interstate commerce. We may assume as
the Town argues (though the question is not before us) that
Congress could not impose a national real estate tax. It
does not follow that the States may impose real estate taxes
in a manner that discriminates against interstate commerce.
A State's "power to lay and collect taxes, comprehensive and
necessary as that power is, cannot be exerted in a way which

Opinion of the Court
involves a discrimination against [interstate] commerce."Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 596 (1923).

To allow a State to avoid the strictures of the dormantCommerce Clause by the simple device of labeling its discriminatory tax a levy on real estate would destroy the bar-rier against protectionism that the Constitution provides.
We noted in West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S.186 (1994), that "[t]he paradigmatic . . . law discriminating
against interstate commerce is the protective [import] tariffor customs duty, which taxes goods imported from other
States, but does not tax similar products produced in State."
Id., at 193. Such tariffs are "so patently unconstitutionalthat our cases reveal not a single attempt by a State to enact

one." Ibid. Yet, were the Town's theory adopted, a Statecould create just such a tariff with ease. The State would
need only to pass a statute imposing a special real estate taxon property used to store, process, or sell imported goods.
By gearing the increased tax to the value of the importedgoods at issue, the State could create the functional equivalent of an import tariff. As this example demonstrates, toaccept the Town's theory would have radical and unacceptable results.We therefore turn to the question whether our prior cases
preclude a State from imposing a higher tax on a camp thatserves principally nonresidents than on one that limits its
services primarily to residents.

IV
There is no question that were this statute targeted atprofit-making entities, it would violate the dormant Commerce Clause. "State laws discriminating against interstatecommerce on their face are `virtually per se invalid.' " Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325, 331 (1996) (quoting Ore-gon Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental
Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99 (1994)). It is not necessaryto look beyond the text of this statute to determine that it

Opinion of the Court

discriminates against interstate commerce. The Maine lawexpressly distinguishes between entities that serve a principally interstate clientele and those that primarily serve anintrastate market, singling out camps that serve mostly instaters for beneficial tax treatment, and penalizing thosecamps that do a principally interstate business. As a practical matter, the statute encourages affected entities to limittheir out-of-state clientele, and penalizes the principally nonresident customers of businesses catering to a primarily in-terstate market.

If such a policy were implemented by a statutory prohibition against providing camp services to nonresidents, the
statute would almost certainly be invalid. We have "con-sistently . . . held that the Commerce Clause . . . precludes a

state from mandating that its residents be given a preferredright of access, over out-of-state consumers, to natural resources located within its borders or to the products derivedtherefrom."

9 In West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), we held invalid
under the Commerce Clause an Oklahoma statute that had the effect of
preventing out-of-state consumers from purchasing Oklahoma natural gas.
We ruled similarly in Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923),
that a West Virginia statute limiting out-of-state users' access to West
Virginia gas to that not "required to meet the local needs for all purposes,"
id., at 594, violated the Commerce Clause. We found those cases directly
analogous in New England Power, ruling invalid a state law that reserved
for state citizens domestically generated hydroelectric power. In Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978), we struck down a New Jersey
statute prohibiting certain categories of out-of-state waste from flowing
into the State's landfills, noting that "a State may not accord its own inhabitants a preferred right of access over consumers in other States to natural
resources located within its borders." Id., at 627. And, in Hughes v.
Oklahoma, 441 U. S., at 338, we ruled that a statute prohibiting the export
of minnows for sale out of State violated the Commerce Clause. We held
similarly in Sporhase v. Nebraska ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941, 958 (1982),
that a provision preventing the export of ground water to States not
allowing reciprocal export rights was an impermissible barrier to com520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
in part the natural beauty of Maine itself and, in addition,the special services that the camp provides. In this way, the

Maine statute is like a law that burdens out-of-state access todomestically generated hydroelectric power, New England
Power, or to local landfills, Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437U. S. 617 (1978). In those cases, as in this case, the burden
fell on out-of-state access both to a natural resource and torelated services provided by state residents.

10

Avoiding this sort of "economic Balkanization," Hughes v.
Oklahoma, 441 U. S., at 325, and the retaliatory acts of otherStates that may follow, is one of the central purposes of our

negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. See ibid.; Westv. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229, 255 (1911) (expressing concern that "embargo may be retaliated by em-bargo, and commerce will be halted at state lines"). And,
as we noted in Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York
State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573, 580 (1986): "Economicprotectionism is not limited to attempts to convey advanmerce. Insofar as Sporhase suggests certain narrow circumstances in
which the reservation of natural resources for state citizens may be permissible, see id., at 956-957, these concerns are not implicated here.

10 We have long noted the applicability of our dormant Commerce Clause

jurisprudence to service industries. See, e. g., C & A Carbone, Inc. v.
Clarkstown, 511 U. S. 383, 391 (1994) ("[T]he article of commerce is not
so much the solid waste itself, but rather the service of processing and
disposing of it"); Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Michigan Dept.
of Natural Resources, 504 U. S. 353, 359 (1992) (noting that "arrangements
between out-of-state generators of waste and the . . . operator of a waste
disposal site" may be "viewed as `sales' of garbage or `purchases' of transportation and disposal services"); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax
Comm'n, 429 U. S. 318, 337 (1977) ("[N]o State may discriminatorily tax
. . . the business operations performed in any other State"); Lewis v. BT
Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27, 42 (1980) (striking down state
statute under dormant Commerce Clause that favored in-state over outof-state entities in the investor services market). Given the substantial
portion of the national economy now devoted to service industries, see
Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 1995, p. 779
(Table 1288) (noting service industries constituted approximately 20 percent of gross domestic product in 1992), this is a natural development in
our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence.

tages on local merchants; it may include attempts to givelocal consumers an advantage over consumers in other

States." 11 By encouraging economic isolationism, prohibi-tions on out-of-state access to in-state resources serve the
very evil that the dormant Commerce Clause was designedto prevent.

Of course, this case does not involve a total prohibition.Rather, the statute provides a strong incentive for affected
entities not to do business with nonresidents if they are ableto so avoid the discriminatory tax. In this way, the statute
is similar to the North Carolina "intangibles tax" that westruck down in

Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S., at 327.That case involved the constitutionality under the Commerce

Clause of a state "regime that taxe[d] stock [held by in-stateshareholders] only to the degree that its issuing corporation
participates in interstate commerce." Id., at 333. We heldthe statute facially discriminatory, in part because it tended
"to discourage domestic corporations from plying theirtrades in interstate commerce."

Ibid. Maine's statute hasa like effect.

To the extent that affected Maine organizations are notdeterred by the statute from doing a principally interstate
business, it is clear that discriminatory burdens on interstatecommerce imposed by regulation or taxation may also violate the Commerce Clause. We have held that special feesassessed on nonresidents directly by the State when they
attempt to use local services impose an impermissible burdenon interstate commerce. See, e. g., Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. Hunt, 504 U. S. 334, 342 (1992) (discrimina-tory tax imposed on disposal of out-of-state hazardous
waste). That the tax discrimination comes in the form of adeprivation of a generally available tax benefit, rather than

11 The Town argues that "the Commerce Clause protects out-of-state
competitors but does not protect out-of state consumers." Brief for Respondents 16. As the discussion above indicates, our cases have rejected
this view.

Opinion of the Court
a specific penalty on the activity itself, is of no moment.Thus, in New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269,

274 (1988), the Court invalidated an Ohio statute that pro-vided a tax credit for sales of ethanol produced in State, but
not ethanol produced in certain other States; the law "de-prive[d] certain products of generally available beneficial tax
treatment because they are made in certain other States,and thus on its face appear[ed] to violate the cardinal requirement of nondiscrimination." 12 Given the fact that theburden of Maine's facially discriminatory tax scheme falls
by design in a predictably disproportionate way on out-of-staters,

13 the pernicious effect on interstate commerce is

12 See Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 268 (1984) (discriminatory excise tax exemption); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 756
(1981) (tax scheme "unquestionably discriminates against interstate commerce . . . as the necessary result of various tax credits and exclusions");
Westinghouse Elec. Corp. v. Tully, 466 U. S. 388, 399-400, and n. 9 (1984)
(per curiam); see also West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S., at
210 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).

13 Because the Maine tax is facially discriminatory, this case is unlike

Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609 (1981). There, we
held permissible under the Commerce Clause a generally applicable Montana severance tax on coal extracted from in-state mines. Appellants
challenged the tax arguing, inter alia, that it discriminated against interstate commerce because 90 percent of the coal happened to be shipped to
out-of-state users, and the tax burden was therefore borne principally by
nonresidents. We rejected this claim, noting that "there is no real discrimination in this case; the tax burden is borne according to the amount
of coal consumed and not according to any distinction between in-state and
out-of-state consumers." Id., at 619. We recognized that an approach to
the dormant Commerce Clause requiring an assessment of the likely demand for a particular good by nonresidents and a State's ability to shift
its tax burden out of State "would require complex factual inquiries about
such issues as elasticity of demand for the product and alternative sources
of supply," id., at 619, n. 8, and declined to adopt such a difficult to police
test. Here, in contrast, the tax scheme functions by design and on its
face to burden out-of-state users disproportionately. Our analysis in
Commonwealth Edison is therefore inapplicable.

CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U. S. 69 (1987), is also
inapposite. In that case, we rejected the argument that a facially nondis520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court

the same as in our cases involving taxes targeting out-of-staters alone.

Unlike in Chemical Waste, we recognize that here the dis-criminatory burden is imposed on the out-of-state customer
indirectly by means of a tax on the entity transacting business with the non-Maine customer. This distinction makesno analytic difference. As we noted in

West Lynn Creamery
discussing the general phenomenon of import tariffs: "Forover 150 years, our cases have rightly concluded that the

imposition of a differential burden on any part of the streamof commerce--from wholesaler to retailer to consumer--is
invalid, because a burden placed at any point will result in adisadvantage to the out-of-state producer." 512 U. S., at 202
(citing cases). So too here, it matters little that it is the
camp that is taxed rather than the campers. The recorddemonstrates that the economic incidence of the tax falls at

least in part on the campers, the Town has not contested
the point, and the courts below based their decision on this
presumption. App. 49; 655 A. 2d, at 879; App. to Pet. for
Cert. 14a, n. 2.14

With respect to those businesses--like petitioner's--that
continue to engage in a primarily interstate trade, the Maine
statute therefore functionally serves as an export tariff that

criminatory state law deterring hostile tender offers violated the dormant
Commerce Clause because most such offers "are launched by offerors outside Indiana." Id., at 88. We explained that "nothing in the . . . Act
imposes a greater burden on out-of-state offerors than it does on similarly
situated Indiana offerors." Ibid. (emphasis added). Here, the discrimination appears on the face of the Maine statute. Exxon Corp. v. Governor
of Maryland, 437 U. S. 117 (1978), is similarly distinguishable. See id., at
126 ("The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself, establish a claim of discrimination
against interstate commerce").

principally serve them. As our cases make clear, this sort
of discrimination is at the very core of activities forbidden
by the dormant Commerce Clause. " `[A] State may not tax
a transaction or incident more heavily when it crosses state
lines than when it occurs entirely within the State.' "
Chemical Waste, 504 U. S., at 342 (quoting Armco Inc. v.
Hardesty, 467 U. S. 638, 642 (1984)); see West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S., at 193 (tariffs forbidden by the
dormant Commerce Clause).

Ninety-five percent of petitioner's campers come from out
of State. Insofar as Maine's discriminatory tax has increased tuition, that burden is felt almost entirely by outof-staters, deterring them from enjoying the benefits of
camping in Maine.15 In sum, the Maine statute facially discriminates against interstate commerce, and is all but per se
invalid. See, e. g., Oregon Waste, 511 U. S., at 100-101.

We recognize that the Town might have attempted to defend the Maine law under the per se rule by demonstrating
that it " `advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be
adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.' " Id., at 101 (quoting New Energy Co., 486 U. S., at
278). In assessing respondents' arguments, we would have
applied our "strictest scrutiny." Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441

15 The Town argues that these effects are entirely speculative, because
the record does not reflect any decision by a potential camper not to attend
petitioner's camp as a result of the burden imposed. Brief for Respondents 16. The Supreme Judicial Court appears to have adopted similar
reasoning. 655 A. 2d, at 879. This misconstrues the proper analysis.
As we made clear most recently in Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S., at
333, n. 3, there is no " `de minimis' defense to a charge of discriminatory
taxation under the Commerce Clause." A particularized showing of the
sort respondent seeks is not required. See Associated Industries of Mo.
v. Lohman, 511 U. S. 641, 650 (1994) ("[A]ctual discrimination, wherever it
is found, is impermissible, and the magnitude and scope of the discrimination have no bearing on the determinative question whether discrimination has occurred"); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 756; see also

Hunt, 504 U. S., at 342 ("Once a state tax is found to discrimi-nate against out-of-state commerce, it is typically struck
down without further inquiry"). Perhaps realizing theweight of its burden, the Town has made no effort to defend
the statute under the per se rule, and so we do not addressthis question. See

Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S., at333-334.

16 Justice Scalia submits that we err by following our precedent in
Fulton and declining to address an argument that the Town itself did not
think worthy of pressing. Post, at 602-603. But even if there were reason to consider the State's compliance with the per se rule, the Town would
not prevail. In the single case Justice Scalia points to in which we
found the per se standard to have been met, Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S.
131 (1986), the State had no " `reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives,' "
Oregon Waste, 511 U. S., at 101 (quoting New Energy Co., 486 U. S., at
278), to the action it had taken. Absent a bar on the import of certain
minnows, there was no way for Maine to protect its natural environment
from the hazard of parasites and nonnative species that might have been
accidentally introduced into the State's waters. Taylor, 477 U. S., at 141.

In contrast, here Maine has ample alternatives short of a facially discriminatory property tax exemption to achieve its apparent goal of subsidizing the attendance of the State's children at summer camp. Maine
could, for example, achieve this end by offering direct financial support to
parents of resident children. Cf. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618
(1969). Though we have not had the occasion to address the issue, it
might also be permissible for the State to subsidize Maine camps directly
to the extent that they serve residents. See West Lynn Creamery, Inc.
v. Healy, 512 U. S., at 199, n. 15; New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486

While the Town does argue its case under the less exacting analysis set
forth in, e. g., Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970), "this

a profit-making entity, the discriminatory tax exemptionwould be impermissible.

V
The unresolved question presented by this case is whether
a different rule should apply to tax exemptions for charitableand benevolent institutions. Though we have never had

cause to address the issue directly, the applicability of thedormant Commerce Clause to the nonprofit sector of the
economy follows from our prior decisions.Our cases have frequently applied laws regulating commerce to not-for-profit institutions. In Associated Press v.
NLRB, 301 U. S. 103 (1937), for example, we held the Na-tional Labor Relations Act as applied to the Associated

Press' (A. P.'s) newsgathering activities to be an enactmententirely within Congress' Commerce Clause power, despite
the fact that the A. P. "does not sell news and does not oper-ate for a profit."

Id., at 129. Noting that the A. P.'s activities "involve[d] the constant use of channels of interstate and
foreign communication," we concluded that its operations"amount[ed] to commercial intercourse, and such intercourse

is commerce within the meaning of the Constitution." Id.,
against interstate trade.' " Chemical Waste, 504 U. S., at 343, n. 5 (quoting Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 (emphasis added)). Because the Maine statute is facially discriminatory, the more deferential
standard is inapplicable. Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, this
case is quite unlike General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278 (1997).
There, the Court premised its holding that the statute at issue was not
facially discriminatory on the view that sellers of "bundled" and "unbundled" natural gas were principally competing in different markets. See

id., at 297-298, 300 ("dormant Commerce Clause protects markets and participants in markets, not taxpayers as such"). While it may be true that
"[d]isparate treatment constitutes discrimination only if the objects of
the disparate treatment are . . . similarly situated," post, at 601, there is no
question that the statute at issue here is facially discriminatory because
it disparately treats identically situated Maine nonprofit camps depending
upon whether they favor in-state, as opposed to out-of-state, campers.

We have similarly held that federal antitrust laws areapplicable to the anticompetitive activities of nonprofit organizations. See National Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board
of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 100, n. 22 (1984)(Sherman Act $ 1 applies to nonprofits);

Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773 (1975). The nonprofit character of an enterprise does not place it beyondthe purview of federal laws regulating commerce. See also

NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U. S. 672, 681, n. 11 (1980) (noting that in context of amendments to National Labor Re-lations Act "Congress appears to have agreed that nonprofit institutions `affect commerce' under modern economicconditions").

We have already held that the dormant Commerce Clauseis applicable to activities undertaken without the intention
of earning a profit. In Edwards v. California, 314 U. S. 160(1941), we addressed the constitutionality of a California
statute prohibiting the transport into that State of indigent
persons. We struck the statute down as a violation of the
dormant Commerce Clause, reasoning that "the transportation of persons is `commerce,' " and that the California
statute was an "unconstitutional barrier to [that] interstate
commerce." Id., at 172-173. In determining whether the
transportation of persons is "commerce," we noted that "[i]t
is immaterial whether or not the transportation is commercial in character." Id., at 172, n. 1.

We see no reason why the nonprofit character of an enterprise should exclude it from the coverage of either the affirmative or the negative aspect of the Commerce Clause.

572-574. There are a number of lines of commerce in whichboth for-profit and nonprofit entities participate. Some educational institutions, some hospitals, some child care facilities,some research organizations, and some museums generate
significant earnings; and some are operated by not-for-profitcorporations. See Hansmann, The Role of Nonprofit Enterprise, 89 Yale L. J. 835, 835, and n. 1, 865 (1980).A nonprofit entity is ordinarily understood to differ from
a for-profit corporation principally because it "is barred fromdistributing its net earnings, if any, to individuals who exercise control over it, such as members, officers, directors, ortrustees."

Id., at 838.17 Nothing intrinsic to the nature ofnonprofit entities prevents them from engaging in interstate

commerce. Summer camps may be operated as for-profit ornonprofit entities; nonprofits may depend--as here--in substantial part on fees charged for their services. Clotfelter,The Distributional Consequences of Nonprofit Activities, in
Who Benefits from the Nonprofit Sector? 1, 6 (C. Clotfeltered. 1992) (nonprofits in some sectors are "heavily dependent
on fees by paying customers, with private payments account-ing for at least half of total revenues"). Whether operated
on a for-profit or nonprofit basis, they purchase goods and

17 Maine's law governing nonprofits embraces this conception, see Me.
Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 13-B, $ 102(9) (1981), as does the tax exemption statute at issue here. The exemption applies to "benevolent and charitable
institutions." Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996). To
qualify, the entity must devote "[a]ll profits derived from [its] operation
. . . and the proceeds from the sale of its property . . . exclusively to the
purposes for which it is organized." $ 652(1)(C)(3). "A director, trustee,
officer or employee of an organization claiming exemption is not entitled
to receive directly or indirectly any pecuniary profit from the operation
of that organization, excepting reasonable compensation for services in
effecting its purposes." $ 652(1)(C)(2). The statute also expressly designates certain categories of entities (nonprofit nursing homes, boarding
homes, community mental health service facilities, and child care centers)
that qualify for tax exempt status under federal law, 26 U. S. C. $ 501(c)(3),
as falling within its ambit. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A)

services in competitive markets, offer their facilities to avariety of patrons, and derive revenues from a variety of

sources, some of which are local and some out of State.For purposes of Commerce Clause analysis, any categorical distinction between the activities of profit-making enterprises and not-for-profit entities is therefore wholly illusory.
Entities in both categories are major participants in interstate markets. And, although the summer camp involved in
this case may have a relatively insignificant impact on the
commerce of the entire Nation, the interstate commercial
activities of nonprofit entities as a class are unquestionably
significant.18 See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 127-
128 (1942); Lopez, 514 U. S., at 556, 559-560.

18 We are informed by amici that "the nonprofit sector spends over $389
billion each year in operating expenses--approximately seven percent of
the gross national product." Brief for American Council on Education
et al. as Amici Curiae 19. In recent years, nonprofits have employed
approximately seven percent of the Nation's paid workers, roughly 9.3
million people in 1990. V. Hodgkinson, M. Weitzman, C. Toppe, & S. Noga,
Nonprofit Almanac 1992-1993: Dimensions of the Independent Sector 29
(1992) (Table 1.5).

Justice Scalia wrongly suggests that Maine's law offers only a "narrow tax exemption," post, at 598, which he implies has no substantial effect
on interstate commerce and serves only "to relieve the State of its burden
of caring for its residents," post, at 596. This characterization is quite
misleading. The statute expressly exempts from tax property used by
such important nonprofit service industries as nursing homes and child
care centers. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(A)(1) (Supp. 1996).
Nonprofit participation in these sectors is substantial. Nationally, nonprofit nursing homes had estimated revenues of $18 billion in 1994. U. S.
Bureau of the Census, Service Annual Survey: 1994 (1996) (Table 7.3).
These entities compete with a sizeable for-profit nursing home sector,
which had revenues of approximately $40 billion in 1994. Id., at Table
7.1. Similarly, the $5 billion nonprofit market in child day care services
competes with an $11 billion for-profit industry. Id., at Tables 8.1, 8.3
(1994 data).

Nonprofit hospitals and health maintenance organizations also receive
an exemption from Maine's property tax. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit.

Opinion of the Court
From the State's standpoint it may well be reasonable touse tax exemptions as a means of encouraging nonprofit institutions to favor local citizens, notwithstanding any possi-ble adverse impact on the larger markets in which those in36, $$ 652(1)(A), (K) (Supp. 1996). While operating as nonprofit entities,
their activities are serious business. In Maine Medical Center v. Lucci,
317 A. 2d 1 (1974), the Supreme Judicial Court presumed that a "large
hospital" employing 2,000 people qualified as a "benevolent and charitable
institution" for purposes of the $ 652(1)(A) exemption, and held that a
newly constructed $3.3 million parking facility--which patients, visitors,
and staff were charged a fee to use--was also exempt from the tax.
Though the garage was being operated at an immediate loss, "projected
estimates of income and expense indicated a possible recovery of the capital investment over a period of twenty years." Id., at 2. Nonprofit hospitals had national revenues of roughly $305 billion in 1994, considerably
more than the $34 billion in revenues collected by hospitals operated on a
for-profit basis. U. S. Bureau of the Census, Service Annual Survey: 1994
(1996) (Tables 7.1, 7.3).

Maine law further permits qualifying nonprofits to rent out their property on a commercial basis at market rates in order to support other activities, so long as that use of the property is only incidental to their own
purposes. See Maine Medical Center, 317 A. 2d, at 2 (citing with approval Curtis v. Androscoggin Lodge, No. 24, Independent Order of Odd
Fellows, 99 Me. 356, 360, 59 A. 518, 520 (1904)); State Young Men's Christian Assn. v. Winthrop, 295 A. 2d 440, 442 (Me. 1972). Although Maine's
tax exemption statute was amended in 1953 to specify that the property
need not be occupied by the charity to qualify for the exemption, but may
also be "used solely" for its own purposes, see ibid., this extension did not
alter the "well defined rul[e] of exemption" permitting "occasional or
purely incidental" renting. Green Acre Baha'i Institute, 150 Me., at 354,
110 A. 2d, at 584; see also Alpha Rho Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha, Inc. v.
Waterville, 477 A. 2d 1131, 1141 (Me. 1984). But cf. Nature Conservancy
of the Pine Tree State, Inc. v. Bristol, 385 A. 2d 39, 43 (Me. 1978) (holding
that requirement that property be used "solely" for institution's own purposes prohibits tax exemption where grantor of property to charity maintains private rights of use). Maine's statute expressly contemplates that
entities receiving the benefit of the tax exemption may well earn profits,
though of course these must be plowed back into the enterprise or otherwise appropriately used. See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 652(1)(C)(3)
(Supp. 1996).

stitutions participate. Indeed, if we view the issue solelyfrom the State's perspective, it is equally reasonable to use

discriminatory tax exemptions as a means of encouraging thegrowth of local trade. But as our cases clearly hold, such
exemptions are impermissible. See, e. g., Bacchus Imports,
Ltd. v. Dias, 468 U. S. 263, 273 (1984). Protectionism,whether targeted at for-profit entities or serving, as here, to

encourage nonprofits to keep their efforts close to home, isforbidden under the dormant Commerce Clause.

19 If there

is need for a special exception for nonprofits, Congress notonly has the power to create it,

20 but also is in a far better

position than we to determine its dimensions.21

VI
Rather than urging us to create a categorical exception fornonprofit entities, the Town argues that Maine's exemption

statute should be viewed as an expenditure of governmentmoney designed to lessen its social service burden and to
foster the societal benefits provided by charitable organiza-tions. So characterized, the Town submits that its tax exemption scheme is either a legitimate discriminatory subsidy

19 Contrary to Justice Scalia's suggestion, nothing in our holding
today "prevent[s] a State from giving a tax break to charities that benefit
the State's inhabitants." Post, at 595. The States are, of course, free
to provide generally applicable nondiscriminatory tax exemptions without
running afoul of the dormant Commerce Clause.

20 See n. 8, supra.

21 We must admit to some puzzlement as to the force of the argument

underlying Justice Scalia's dissent. On the one hand, he suggests that
a categorical exemption of nonprofit activities from dormant Commerce
Clause scrutiny would be proper. Post, at 607-608. Yet at the same
time, he makes a great effort to characterize this statute as being so narrow that, whatever the appropriate generally applicable rule, the dormant
Commerce Clause ought not to apply here. Post, at 598. As we have
explained, the argument in favor of a categorical exemption for nonprofits
is unpersuasive, and we disagree with Justice Scalia's characterization
of this statute's effects. Accordingly, we reject his position on either of
these theories.

Opinion of the Court
of only those charities that choose to focus their activities onlocal concerns, or alternatively a governmental "purchase"

of charitable services falling within the narrow exception tothe dormant Commerce Clause for States in their role as
"market participants," see, e. g., Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap
Corp., 426 U. S. 794 (1976); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S.429 (1980). We find these arguments unpersuasive. Although tax exemptions and subsidies serve similar ends, theydiffer in important and relevant respects, and our cases have
recognized these distinctions. As for the "market partici-pant" argument, we have already rejected the Town's position in a prior case, and in any event respondents' openended exemption for charitable and benevolent institutionsis not analogous to the industry-specific state actions that we

reviewed in Alexandria Scrap and Reeves.The Town argues that its discriminatory tax exemption is,
in economic reality, no different from a discriminatory sub-sidy of those charities that cater principally to local needs.
Noting our statement in West Lynn Creamery that "[a] puresubsidy funded out of general revenue ordinarily imposes no
burden on interstate commerce, but merely assists local business," 512 U. S., at 199, the Town submits that since a dis-criminatory subsidy may be permissible, a discriminatory exemption must be, too. We have "never squarely confrontedthe constitutionality of subsidies,"

id., at 199, n. 15, and we
need not address these questions today. Assuming, arguendo, that the Town is correct that a direct subsidy benefiting only those nonprofits serving principally Maine residentswould be permissible, our cases do not sanction a tax exemption serving similar ends.22

22 As the Supreme Judicial Court made clear, 655 A. 2d, at 878, under
Maine law an exemption is categorized as a "tax expenditure." Me. Rev.
Stat. Ann., Tit. 36, $ 196 (1990). The Town's effort to argue that this state
statutory categorization allows it to elide the federal constitutional distinction between tax exemptions and subsidies is unavailing. We recognized
long ago that a tax exemption can be viewed as a form of government

Opinion of the Court

In Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664(1970), notwithstanding our assumption that a direct subsidy

of religious activity would be invalid,23 we held that NewYork's tax exemption for church property did not violate the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.24 That
holding rested, in part, on the premise that there is a constitutionally significant difference between subsidies and tax
exemptions.25 We have expressly recognized that this distinction is also applicable to claims that certain state action
designed to give residents an advantage in the marketplace
is prohibited by the Commerce Clause.

In New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269 (1988),
we found unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause an
Ohio tax scheme that provided a sales tax credit for ethanol
produced in State, or manufactured in another State to the
extent that State gave similar tax advantages to ethanol
produced in Ohio. We recognized that the party challenging
the Ohio scheme was "eligible to receive a cash subsidy"

spending. See Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U. S.
540, 544 (1983). The distinction we have drawn for dormant Commerce
Clause purposes does not turn on this point.

23 We noted: "Obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationship

pregnant with involvement and, as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards, but that is
not this case." Walz, 397 U. S., at 675.

24 We reasoned that "New York's statute [cannot be read] as attempting

to establish religion; it . . . simply spar[es] the exercise of religion from
the burden of property taxation levied on private profit institutions." Id.,
at 673.

25 "The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains
from demanding that the church support the state. No one has ever suggested that tax exemption has converted libraries, art galleries, or hospitals into arms of the state or put employees `on the public payroll.' " Id.,
at 675. As Justice Brennan noted: "Tax exemptions and general subsidies
. . . are qualitatively different." Id., at 690 (concurring opinion).

Opinion of the Court
from its home State, and was therefore "the potential bene-ficiary of a scheme no less discriminatory than the one that

it attacks, and no less effective in conferring a commer-cial advantage over out-of-state competitors." Id., at 278.
That was of no importance. We noted: "The CommerceClause does not prohibit all state action designed to give its
residents an advantage in the marketplace, but only actionof that description

in connection with the State's regulationof interstate commerce. Direct subsidization of domestic

industry does not ordinarily run afoul of that prohibition;discriminatory taxation . . . does." Ibid. (emphasis in original). See also West Lynn, 512 U. S., at 210 (Scalia, J., con-curring in judgment) (drawing similar distinction between
forbidden generally applicable tax with discriminatory "ex-emption" and permissible "subsidy . . . funded from the
State's general revenues"). This distinction is supported byscholarly commentary as well as precedent, and we see no
reason to depart from it. See Enrich, Saving the Statesfrom Themselves: Commerce Clause Constraints on State
Tax Incentives for Business, 110 Harv. L. Rev. 377, 442-443(1996); Hellerstein & Coenen, Commerce Clause Restraints
on State Business Development Incentives, 81 Cornell L.Rev. 789, 846-848 (1996).

26 The Town's claim that its discriminatory tax scheme should be viewed as a permissiblesubsidy is therefore unpersuasive.

27

26 The distinction provides a sufficient response to the Town's argument
that our ruling today would invalidate a State's subsidization of all or part
of its residents' tuition at state-owned universities.

27 Justice Scalia, post, at 605-606, and n. 4, would distinguish this line

of authority by holding that it should not apply where a State is giving
tax relief to charitable enterprises. As explained in Part V, supra, we
see no categorical reason to treat for-profit and nonprofit entities differently under the dormant Commerce Clause. Justice Scalia's heavy reliance upon Board of Ed. of Ky. Annual Conference of Methodist Episcopal
Church v. Illinois, 203 U. S. 553 (1906), is misplaced. In that case, a bequest to a Kentucky charitable corporation did not qualify for an exemp520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Finally, the Town argues that its discriminatory tax ex-emption scheme falls within the "market-participant" exception. As we explained in New Energy Co.: "That doctrinedifferentiates between a State's acting in its distinctive governmental capacity, and a State's acting in the more general
capacity of a market participant; only the former is subjectto the limitations of the negative Commerce Clause." 486

U. S., at 277. See White v. Massachusetts Council of
Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 208 (1983); Reeves,
Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S., at 436-437; Hughes v. Alexandria
Scrap Corp., 426 U. S., at 810.

In Alexandria Scrap we concluded that the State of Mary-land had, in effect, entered the market for abandoned automobile hulks as a purchaser because it was using state funds
to provide bounties for their removal from Maryland streetsand junkyards.

Id., at 809-810. In Reeves, the State of
South Dakota similarly participated in the market for ce-ment as a seller of the output of the cement plant that it had

owned and operated for many years. 447 U. S., at 431-432.And in

White, the city of Boston had participated in the construction industry by funding certain projects. 460 U. S., at205-206. These three cases stand for the proposition that,

for purposes of analysis under the dormant Commerce
Clause, a State acting in its proprietary capacity as a purtion from the Illinois inheritance tax because the corporate legatee was
not incorporated in Illinois. In this case, the petitioner is a Maine corporation, and the validity of the portion of the Maine statute that denies the
exemption to out-of-state corporations is not at issue. Moreover, unlike
the situation in Board of Ed. of Ky., in which none of the charitable activities of the legatee were performed in Illinois, all of the benefits of attending petitioner's camp in Maine are "bestowed within her borders." Id.,
at 563. While the dictum that Justice Scalia quotes, post, at 606, is
consistent with his analysis, it does not purport to address the applicability
of the dormant Commerce Clause to charities in general, to resident charities, or to nonresident charities that provide benefits for both residents
and nonresidents.

chaser or seller may "favor its own citizens over others."
Alexandria Scrap, 426 U. S., at 810.

Maine's tax exemption statute cannot be characterized asa proprietary activity falling within the market-participant

exception. In New Energy Co., Ohio argued similarly that
a discriminatory tax credit program fell within the exception. We noted that the tax program had "the purpose and
effect of subsidizing a particular industry, as do many dispositions of the tax laws." 486 U. S., at 277. "That," we
explained, "does not transform it into a form of state participation in the free market." Ibid. "The Ohio action ultimately at issue is neither its purchase nor its sale of ethanol,
but its assessment and computation of taxes--a primeval
governmental activity." Ibid. As we indicated in White:
"[I]n this kind of case there is `a single inquiry: whether the
challenged "program constituted direct state participation in
the market." ' " 460 U. S., at 208 (quoting Reeves, 447 U. S.,
at 436, n. 7). A tax exemption is not the sort of direct state
involvement in the market that falls within the marketparticipation doctrine.

Even if we were prepared to expand the exception in the
manner suggested by the Town, the Maine tax statute at
issue here would be a poor candidate. Like the tax exemption upheld in Walz--which applied to libraries, art galleries,
and hospitals as well as churches 28--the exemption that has
been denied to petitioner is available to a broad category
of charitable and benevolent institutions.29 For that reason, nothing short of a dramatic expansion of the "market28 See Walz, 397 U. S., at 666-667, and n. 1.

purposes of this paragraph, `benevolent and charitable institutions' include, but are not limited to, nonprofit nursing homes and nonprofit boarding homes and boarding care facilities . . . , nonprofit community mental
health service facilities . . . [,] and nonprofit child care centers") (emphasis added).

participant" exception would support its application to this
case. Alexandria Scrap involved Maryland's entry into the
market for automobile hulks, a discrete activity focused on a
single industry. Similarly, South Dakota's participation in
the market for cement was--in part because of its narrow
scope--readily conceived as a proprietary action of the State.
In contrast, Maine's tax exemption--which sweeps to cover
broad swathes of the nonprofit sector--must be viewed as
action taken in the State's sovereign capacity rather than a
proprietary decision to make an entry into all of the markets
in which the exempted charities function. See White, 460
U. S., at 211, n. 7 (noting that "there are some limits on
a state or local government's ability to impose restrictions that reach beyond the immediate parties with which
the government transacts business"). The Town's version
of the "market-participant" exception would swallow the
rule against discriminatory tax schemes. Contrary to the
Town's submission, the notion that whenever a State provides a discriminatory tax abatement it is "purchasing" some
service in its proprietary capacity is not readily confined to
the charitable context. A special tax concession for liquors
indigenous to Hawaii, for example, might be conceived as
a "purchase" of the jobs produced by local industry, or an
investment in the unique local cultural value provided by
these beverages. Cf. Bacchus, 468 U. S., at 270-271. Discriminatory schemes favoring local farmers might be seen as
the "purchase" of agricultural services in order to ensure
that the State's citizens will have a steady local supply of the
product. Cf. West Lynn, 512 U. S., at 190 (striking down
statute protecting in-state milk producers designed to "preserve . . . local industry," "thereby ensur[ing] a continuous
and adequate supply of fresh milk for our market" (internal
quotation marks omitted)). Our cases provide no support
for the Town's radical effort to expand the marketparticipant doctrine.

VII
As was true in Bacchus Imports, Ltd. v. Dias, the facts ofthis particular case, viewed in isolation, do not appear to

pose any threat to the health of the national economy. Nev-ertheless, history, including the history of commercial conflict that preceded the Constitutional Convention as well asthe uniform course of Commerce Clause jurisprudence animated and enlightened by that early history, provides thecontext in which each individual controversy must be judged.
The history of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence hasshown that even the smallest scale discrimination can interfere with the project of our Federal Union. As Justice Car-dozo recognized, to countenance discrimination of the sort
that Maine's statute represents would invite significant in-roads on our "national solidarity":

"The Constitution was framed under the dominion ofa political philosophy less parochial in range. It was
framed upon the theory that the peoples of the severalstates must sink or swim together, and that in the long
run prosperity and salvation are in union and not divi-sion."

Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511,523 (1935).

The judgment of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court isreversed.

It is so ordered.
Justice Scalia, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice
Thomas, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

The Court's negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence hasdrifted far from its moorings. Originally designed to create

a national market for commercial activity, it is today invokedto prevent a State from giving a tax break to charities that
benefit the State's inhabitants. In my view, Maine's taxexemption, which excuses from taxation only that property

used to relieve the State of its burden of caring for itsresidents, survives even our most demanding Commerce

Clause scrutiny. I

We have often said that the purpose of our negative Com-merce Clause jurisprudence is to create a national market.
As Justice Jackson once observed, the "vision of the Found-ers" was "that every farmer and every craftsman shall be
encouraged to produce by the certainty that he will havefree access to every market in the Nation, that no home
embargoes will withhold his exports, and no foreign statewill by customs duties or regulations exclude them."

H. P.Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 539 (1949). In

our zeal to advance this policy, however, we must take carenot to overstep our mandate, for the Commerce Clause was
not intended "to cut the States off from legislating on allsubjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their
citizens, though the legislation might indirectly affect thecommerce of the country."

Huron Portland Cement Co.v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440, 443-444 (1960).

Our cases have struggled (to put it nicely) to develop a setof rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the States' police powers, eachexercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce
of the Nation. See Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson
Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 180-183 (1995). The rules that wecurrently use can be simply stated, if not simply applied:

Where a state law facially discriminates against interstatecommerce, we observe what has sometimes been referred to
as a "virtually per se rule of invalidity;" where, on the otherhand, a state law is nondiscriminatory, but nonetheless adversely affects interstate commerce, we employ a deferential"balancing test," under which the law will be sustained unless "the burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearlyexcessive in relation to the putative local benefits,"

Pike v.Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970). See Oregon

Scalia, J., dissenting
Waste Systems, Inc. v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 99 (1994).

While the "virtually per se rule of invalidity" entails appli-cation of the "strictest scrutiny,"

Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441
U. S. 322, 337 (1979), it does not necessarily result in the
invalidation of facially discriminatory state legislation, see,
e. g., Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986) (upholding absolute ban on the importation of baitfish into Maine), for "whatmay appear to be a `discriminatory' provision in the constitutionally prohibited sense--that is, a protectionist enact-ment--may on closer analysis not be so,"

New Energy Co. of
Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278 (1988). Thus, even a statute that erects an absolute barrier to the movement of goods
across state lines will be upheld if "the discrimination is demonstrably justified by a valid factor unrelated to economic
protectionism," id., at 274, or to put a finer point on it, if the
state law "advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot
be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives," id., at 278.

In addition to laws that employ suspect means as a necessary expedient to the advancement of legitimate state ends,
we have also preserved from judicial invalidation laws that
confer advantages upon the State's residents but do so without regulating interstate commerce. We have therefore
excepted the State from scrutiny when it participates in
markets rather than regulates them--by selling cement,
for example, see Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429 (1980),
or purchasing auto hulks, see Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap
Corp., 426 U. S. 794 (1976), or hiring contractors, see White
v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460
U. S. 204 (1983). Likewise, we have said that direct subsidies to domestic industry do not run afoul of the Commerce
Clause. See New Energy Co., supra, at 278. In sum, we
have declared that "[t]he Commerce Clause does not prohibit
all state action designed to give its residents an advantage
in the marketplace, but only action of that description in con520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:34] PAGES PGT: OPIN

nection with the State's regulation of interstate commerce."Ibid. (emphasis in original).

II
In applying the foregoing principles to the case beforeus, it is of course important to understand the precise scope

of the exemption created by Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 36,$ 652(1)(A) (Supp. 1996-1997). The Court's analysis suffers
from the misapprehension that $ 652(1)(A) "sweeps to coverbroad swathes of the nonprofit sector,"

ante, at 594, includingnonprofit corporations engaged in quintessentially commercial activities. That is not so. A review of Maine law dem-onstrates that the provision at issue here is a narrow tax
exemption, designed merely to compensate or subsidizethose organizations that contribute to the public fisc by dispensing public benefits the State might otherwise provide.Although Maine allows nonprofit corporations to be organized "for any lawful purpose," Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit.13-B, $ 201 (1981 and Supp. 1996-1997), the exemption supplied by $ 652(1)(A) does not extend to all nonprofit organi-zations, but only to those "benevolent and charitable institutions," $ 652(1)(A), which are "organized and conductedexclusively for benevolent and charitable purposes,"

$ 652(1)(C)(1) (emphasis added), and only to those parcels ofreal property and items of personal property that are used
"solely," $ 652(1)(A), "to further the organization's charitablepurposes," Poland v. Poland Springs Health Institute, Inc.,
649 A. 2d 1098, 1100 (Me. 1994). The Maine Supreme Judi-cial Court has defined the statutory term "benevolent and
charitable institutions" to include only those nonprofits thatdispense "charity," which is in turn defined to include only
those acts which are

" `for the benefit of an indefinite number of persons,either by bringing their minds or hearts under the influence of education or religion, by relieving their bodiesfrom disease, suffering, or constraint, by assisting them

to establish themselves in life, or by erecting or maintaining public buildings or works or otherwise lessening
the burdens of government.' " Lewiston v. Marcotte
Congregate Housing, Inc., 673 A. 2d 209, 211 (1996) (emphasis added).

Moreover, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court has further
limited the $ 652(1)(A) exemption by insisting that the party
claiming its benefit "bring its claim unmistakably within the
spirit and intent of the act creating the exemption," ibid.
(internal quotation marks omitted), and by proclaiming that
the spirit and intent of $ 652(1)(A) is to compensate charitable organizations for their contribution to the public fisc. As
the court has explained:

" `[A]ny institution which by its charitable activities relieves the government of part of [its] burden is conferring a pecuniary benefit upon the body politic, and in
receiving exemption from taxation it is merely being
given a "quid pro quo" for its services in providing
something which otherwise the government would have
to provide.' " Episcopal Camp Foundation, Inc. v.
Hope, 666 A. 2d 108, 110 (1995) (quoting Young Men's
Christian Assn. of Germantown v. Philadelphia, 323
Pa. 401, 413, 187 A. 204, 210 (1936)).

Thus, $ 652(1)(A) exemptions have been denied to organizations that do not provide substantial public benefits, as defined by reference to the state public policy. In one case,
for example, an organization devoted to maintaining a wildlife sanctuary was denied exemption on the ground that the
preserve's prohibition on deer hunting conflicted with state
policy on game management, so that the preserve could not
be deemed to provide a public benefit. See Holbrook Island
Sanctuary v. Brooksville, 214 A. 2d 660 (Me. 1965). Even
churches have been denied exemptions, see Pentecostal
Assembly of Bangor v. Maidlow, 414 A. 2d 891, 893-894

(Me. 1980) ("religious purposes are not to be equated withbenevolent and charitable purposes").

The Maine Supreme Judicial Court has adhered rigorouslyto the requirement that the exempt property be used
"solely" for charitable purposes. Even when there is no
question that the organization owning the property is de-voted exclusively to charitable purposes, the entire exemption will be forfeited if even a small fraction of the propertyis not used in furtherance of those purposes. See

Lewiston,
supra, at 212-213 (denying exemption to a building 18 per-cent of which was leased at market rates);

Nature Conservancy of Pine Tree State, Inc. v. Bristol, 385 A. 2d 39, 43
(1978) (denying exemption to a nature preserve on which the
grantors had reserved rights-of-way).

That $ 652(1)(A) serves to compensate private charities for
helping to relieve the State of its burden of caring for its
residents should not be obscured by the fact that this particular case involves a summer camp rather than a more traditional form of social service. The statute that the Court
strikes down does not speak of "camps" at all, but rather
lists as examples of "benevolent and charitable institutions"
nonprofit nursing homes, boarding homes, community mental health service facilities, and child care centers, see

$ 652(1)(A). Some summer camps fall within the exemption
under a 1933 decision of the Supreme Judicial Court which
applied it to a tuition-free camp for indigent children, see
Camp Emoh Associates v. Inhabitants of Lyman, 166 A. 59,
60, and under a recent 4-to-3 decision which relied heavily
on the fact that the camp at issue provided "moral instruction" and training in "social living and civic responsibility,"
and was not only "nonprofit" but furnished its camping services below cost, see Episcopal Camp Foundation, supra, at

109, 111. What is at issue in this case is not whether a summer camp can properly be regarded as relieving the State
of social costs, but rather whether, assuming it can, a distinction between charities serving mainly residents and

I turn next to the validity of this focused tax exemption--applicable only to property used solely for charitable purposes by organizations devoted exclusively to charity--underthe negative Commerce Clause principles discussed earlier.
The Court readily concludes that, by limiting the class ofeligible property to that which is used "principally for the
benefit of persons who are Maine residents," the statute"facially discriminates" against interstate commerce. That
seems to me not necessarily true. Disparate treatment con-stitutes discrimination only if the objects of the disparate
treatment are, for the relevant purposes, similarly situated.See General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U. S. 278, 298-299

1 The Court protests that "there is no `de minimis' defense to a charge
of discriminatory taxation under the Commerce Clause," ante, at 581,
n. 15--as though that were the point of our emphasizing in this Part II
the narrowness of the challenged limitation. It is not. Rather, the point
is (1) that Maine's limitation focuses upon a particular state interest that
is deserving of exemption from negative Commerce Clause invalidation,
and (2) that acknowledging the principle of such an exemption (as developed in Part III below) will not place the "national market" in any peril.
What the Court should have gleaned from our discussion, it did not: It
persists in misdescribing the exemption we defend as "a categorical exemption of nonprofit activities from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny."
Ante, at 588, n. 21; see also ante, at 591-592, n. 27.

The Court also makes an attempt to contest on the merits the narrowness of the exemption, suggesting a massive effect upon interstate
commerce by reciting the multi-billion-dollar annual revenues of nonprofit
nursing homes, child care centers, hospitals, and health maintenance
organizations. See ante, at 586-587, n. 18. But of course most of the
services provided by those institutions are provided locally, to local beneficiaries. (In that regard the summer camp that is the subject of the
present suit is most atypical.) The record does not show the number of
nonprofit nursing homes, child care centers, hospitals, and HMO's in
Maine that have been denied the charitable exemption because their
property is not used "principally for the benefit of persons who are Maine
residents"; but it would be a good bet that the number is zero.

(1997). And for purposes of entitlement to a tax subsidyfrom the State, it is certainly reasonable to think that property gratuitously devoted to relieving the State of someof its welfare burden is not similarly situated to property
used "principally for the benefit of persons who are not residents of [the State]," $ 652(1)(A). As we have seen, thetheory underlying the exemption is that it is a

quid pro
quo for uncompensated expenditures that lessen the State'sburden of providing assistance to its residents.

The Court seeks to establish "facial discrimination" byshowing that the effect of treating disparate property disparately is to produce higher costs for those users of theproperty who come from out of State. But that could be
regarded as an indirect effect upon interstate commerce
produced by a tax scheme that is not facially discriminatory,which means that the proper mode of analysis would be the

more lenient "balancing" standard discussed above. We fol-low precisely this mode of analysis in

Tracy, upholding an
Ohio law that provides preferential tax treatment to domes-tic public utilities. Such entities, we conclude, are not "similarly situated" to other fuel distributors; their insulationfrom out-of-state competition does not violate the negative
Commerce Clause because it "serves important interests in
health and safety." 519 U. S., at 306. The Court in Tracy
paints a compelling image of people shivering in their homes
in the dead of winter without the assured service that
competition-sheltered public utilities provide. See id., at
301-302, 306. No less important, however, is the availability
of many of the benefits provided by Maine's private charities
and facilitated not by total insulation from competition but
by favorable tax treatment: care for the sick and dying, for
example, or nursing services for the elderly.

Even if, however, the Maine statute displays "facial discrimination" against interstate commerce, that is not the end
of the analysis. The most remarkable thing about today's
judgment is that it is rendered without inquiry into whether
the purposes of the tax exemption justify its favoritism.

Once having concluded that the statute is facially discrimina-tory, the Court rests. "[T]he Town," it asserts, "has made

no effort to defend the statute under the per se rule." Ante,at 582. This seems to me a pointless technicality. The town
of Harrison (Town) has asserted that the State's interest inencouraging private entities to shoulder part of its socialwelfare burden validates this provision under the negativeCommerce Clause. Whether it does so because the presence
of that interest causes the resident-benefiting charities notto be "similarly situated" to the non-resident-benefiting
charities, and hence negates "facial discrimination," or ratherbecause the presence of that interest

justifies "facial discrim-ination," is a question that is not only of no consequence but

is also probably unanswerable. To strike down this statutebecause the Town's lawyers put the argument in one form
rather than the other is truly senseless.2If the Court were to proceed with that further analysis it
would have to conclude, in my view, that this is one of thosecases in which the "virtually

per se rule of invalidity" doesnot apply. Facially discriminatory or not, the exemption is

no more an artifice of economic protectionism than any statelaw which dispenses public assistance only to the State's residents.3 Our cases have always recognized the legitimacy of

2 I do not understand the Court's contention, ante, at 582, and n. 16,
that Fulton Corp. v. Faulkner, 516 U. S. 325 (1996), provides precedent
for such a course. In Fulton, the arguments left unaddressed had not
been made in another form, but had not been made at all. There (unlike
here) the State conceded facial discrimination, and relied exclusively on
the compensatory tax defense, see id., at 333, which the Court found had
not been made out, see id., at 344. That narrow defense could not possibly have been regarded as an invocation of broader policy justifications
such as those asserted here.

3 In a footnote responding to this dissent, the Court does briefly address

whether the statute fails the "virtually per se rule of invalidity." It concludes that it does fail because "Maine has ample alternatives short of a
facially discriminatory property tax exemption," such as offering direct
cash subsidies to parents of resident children or to camps that serve residents. Ante, at 582, n. 16. These are nonregulatory alternatives (and
hence immune from negative Commerce Clause attack), but they are not

limiting state-provided welfare benefits to bona fide residents. As Justice Stevens once wrote for a unanimous
Court: "Neither the overnight visitor, the unfriendly agent
of a hostile power, the resident diplomat, nor the illegal entrant, can advance even a colorable claim to a share in the
bounty that a conscientious sovereign makes available to its
own citizens." Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 80 (1976).
States have restricted public assistance to their own bona
fide residents since colonial times, see, M. Ierley, With Charity For All, Welfare and Society, Ancient Times to the Present 41 (1984), and such self-interested behavior (or, put more
benignly, application of the principle that charity begins at
home) is inherent in the very structure of our federal system,
cf. Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624, 644 (1982) ("[T]he
State has no legitimate interest in protecting nonresident[s]"). We have therefore upheld against equal protection challenge continuing residency requirements for municipal employment, see McCarthy v. Philadelphia Civil Serv.
Comm'n, 424 U. S. 645 (1976) (per curiam), and bona fide

nondiscriminatory alternatives, which is what the exception to the "virtually per se rule of invalidity" requires. See Oregon Waste Systems, Inc.
v. Department of Environmental Quality of Ore., 511 U. S. 93, 101 (1994)
(quoting New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269, 278 (1988)).
Surely, for example, our decision in Maine v. Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986),
which upheld Maine's regulatory ban on the importation of baitfish, would
not have come out the other way if it had been shown that a state subsidy
of sales of in-state baitfish could have achieved the same goal--by making
the out-of-state fish noncompetitive and thereby excluding them from the
market even more effectively than a difficult-to-police ban on importation.
Where regulatory discrimination against out-of-state interests is appropriate, the negative Commerce Clause is not designed to push a State into
nonregulatory discrimination instead. It permits state regulatory action
disfavoring out-of-staters where disfavoring them is indispensable to the
achievement of an important and nonprotectionist state objective. As
applied to the present case: It is obviously impossible for a State to distribute social welfare benefits only to its residents without discriminating
against nonresidents.

residency requirements for free primary and secondaryschooling, see Martinez v. Bynum, 461 U. S. 321 (1983).

If the negative Commerce Clause requires the invalidationof a law such as $ 652(1)(A), as a logical matter it also requires invalidation of the laws involved in those cases.After all, the Court today relies not on any discrimination
against out-of-state nonprofits, but on the supposed discrimi-nation against nonresident would-be

recipients of charity(the nonprofits' "customers"); surely those individuals are

similarly discriminated against in the direct distribution ofstate benefits. The problem, of course, is not limited to municipal employment and free public schooling, but extendsalso to libraries, orphanages, homeless shelters, and refuges
for battered women. One could hardly explain the constitu-tionality of a State's limiting its provision of these to its own
residents on the theory that the State is a "market partici-pant." These are traditional governmental functions, far removed from commercial activity and utterly unconnected toany genuine private market.

If, however, a State that provides social services directlymay limit its largesse to its own residents, I see no reason
why a State that chooses to provide some of its social serv-ices indirectly--by compensating or subsidizing private charitable providers--cannot be similarly restrictive.4 In fact,we have already approved it. In Board of Ed. of Ky. Annual Conference of Methodist Episcopal Church v. Illinois,203 U. S. 553 (1906), we upheld a state law providing an in4 It is true, of course, that the legitimacy of a State's subsidizing domestic commercial enterprises out of general funds does not establish the legitimacy of a State's giving domestic commercial enterprises preferential
tax treatment. See West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186,
210-212 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). But there is no valid
comparison between, on the one hand, the State's giving tax relief to an
enterprise devoted to the making of profit and, on the other hand, the
State's giving tax relief to an enterprise which, for the purpose at hand,
has the same objective as the State itself (the expenditure of funds for
social welfare).

heritance tax exemption to in-state charities but denying asimilar exemption to out-of-state charities. We recognized

that such exemptions are nothing but compensation to pri-vate organizations for their assistance in alleviating the
State's burden of caring for its less fortunate residents, see
id., at 561. "[I]t cannot be said," we wrote, "that if a Stateexempts property bequeathed for charitable or educational

purposes from taxation it is unreasonable or arbitrary to re-quire the charity to be exercised or the education to be bestowed within her borders and for her people," id., at 563.5It is true that the opinion in Board of Ed. of Ky. addressed

Clemons v. Mississippi, 494 U. S. 738, 747-748, n. 3 (1990).The Commerce Clause objection went undiscussed, I think,

that the statute upheld in that case treated charities differently based on
whether they were incorporated within the State, rather than on whether
they dispensed charity within the State, see ante, at 591-592, n. 27. That
is quite impossible, inasmuch as we have held that out-of-state incorporation is not a constitutional basis for discriminating between charities.
And in the case that announced that holding (invalidating the denial of a
property tax exemption to a nonprofit corporation incorporated in another
State), we distinguished Board of Ed. of Ky. on the ground that the statute at issue there withheld the exemption "by reason of the foreign corporation's failure or inability to benefit the State in the same measure as do
domestic nonprofit corporations." WHYY, Inc. v. Glassboro, 393 U. S. 117,

the correct one.

legislated distinction between charity "bestowed within herborders and for her people" and charity bestowed elsewhere

or for others did not implicate commerce at all, except tothe indirect and permissible extent that innumerable state
laws do.

Finally, even if Maine's property tax exemption for localcharities constituted facial discrimination against out-ofstate commerce, and even if its policy justification (unrelatedto economic protectionism) were insufficient to survive our
"virtually per se rule of invalidity," cf. Maine v. Taylor, 477U. S. 131 (1986), there would remain the question whether
we should not recognize an additional exception to the negative Commerce Clause, as we have in Tracy. As that case
explains, just as a public health justification unrelated to
economic protectionism may justify an overt discrimination
against goods moving in interstate commerce, "so may health
and safety considerations be weighed in the process of deciding the threshold question whether the conditions entailing
application of the dormant Commerce Clause are present."
519 U. S., at 307. Today's opinion goes to great length to
reject the Town's contention that Maine's property tax exemption does not fall squarely within either the "market participant" or "subsidy" exceptions to the negative Commerce
Clause, but never stops to ask whether those exceptions are
the only ones that may apply. As we explicitly acknowledge
in Tracy--which effectively creates what might be called
a "public utilities" exception to the negative Commerce
Clause--the "subsidy" and "market participant" exceptions
do not exhaust the realm of state actions that we should
abstain from scrutinizing under the Commerce Clause. In
my view, the provision by a State of free public schooling,
public assistance, and other forms of social welfare to only (or
principally) its own residents--whether it be accomplished
directly or by providing tax exemptions, cash, or other property to private organizations that perform the work for
the State--implicates none of the concerns underlying our

negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence. That is, I think,self-evidently true, despite the Court's effort to label the

recipients of the State's philanthropy as "customers," or "cli-entele," see, e. g., ante, at 576. Because $ 652(1)(A) clearly
serves these purposes and has nothing to do with economicprotectionism, I believe that it is beyond scrutiny under the
negative Commerce Clause.

* * *
As I have discussed, there are various routes by which theCourt could validate the statute at issue here: on the ground

that it does not constitute "facial discrimination" against in-terstate commerce and readily survives the Pike v. Bruce
Church balancing test; on the ground that it does constitute"facial discrimination" but is supported by such traditional
and important state interests that it survives scrutiny underthe "virtually

per se rule of invalidity"; or on the ground thatthere is a "domestic charity" exception ( just as there is a

"public utility" exception) to the negative Commerce Clause.Whichever route is selected, it seems to me that the quid
pro quo exemption at issue here is such a reasonable exerciseof the State's taxing power that it is not prohibited by the
Commerce Clause in the absence of congressional action.We held as much in

Board of Ed. of Ky. and should not over-rule that decision.

The State of Maine may have special need for acharitable-exemption limitation of the sort at issue here: Its
lands and lakes are attractive to various charities of moredensely populated Eastern States, which would (if the limitation did not exist) compel the taxpayers of Maine to sub-sidize their generosity. But the principle involved in our
disapproval of Maine's exemption limitation has broad appli-cation elsewhere. A State will be unable, for example, to
exempt private schools that serve its citizens from state andlocal real estate taxes unless it exempts as well private
schools attended predominantly or entirely by students from

out of State. A State that provides a tax exemption for realproperty used exclusively for the purpose of feeding the poor

must provide an exemption for the facilities of an organiza-tion devoted exclusively to feeding the poor in another country. These results may well be in accord with the parableof the Good Samaritan, but they have nothing to do with the
Commerce Clause.I respectfully dissent.

Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Scalia joins,and with whom

The Chief Justice joins as to Part I,dissenting.

The tax at issue here is a tax on real estate, the quintes-sential asset that does not move in interstate commerce.
Maine exempts from its otherwise generally applicable prop-erty tax, and thereby subsidizes, certain charitable organizations that provide the bulk of their charity to Maine's ownresidents. By invalidating Maine's tax assessment on the
real property of charitable organizations primarily servingnon-Maine residents, because of the tax's alleged indirect
effect on interstate commerce, the majority has essentiallycreated a "dormant" Necessary and Proper Clause to supplement the "dormant" Commerce Clause. This moveworks a significant, unwarranted, and, in my view, improvident expansion in our "dormant," or "negative," CommerceClause jurisprudence.

1 For that reason, I join Justice

Scalia's dissenting opinion.

1 Although the terms "dormant" and "negative" have often been used
interchangeably to describe our jurisprudence in this area, I believe "negative" is the more appropriate term. See Oklahoma Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175, 200 (1995) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas,
J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he `negative Commerce Clause' . . . is
`negative' not only because it negates state regulation of commerce, but
also because it does not appear in the Constitution"). There is, quite
frankly, nothing "dormant" about our jurisprudence in this area. See
Eule, Laying the Dormant Commerce Clause to Rest, 91 Yale L. J. 425,
425, n. 1 (1982).

I write separately, however, because I believe that the improper expansion undertaken today is possible only because
our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, developed
primarily to invalidate discriminatory state taxation of
interstate commerce, was already both overbroad and unnecessary. It was overbroad because, unmoored from any
constitutional text, it brought within the supervisory authority of the federal courts state action far afield from the discriminatory taxes it was primarily designed to check. It
was unnecessary because the Constitution would seem to
provide an express check on the States' power to levy certain
discriminatory taxes on the commerce of other States--not
in the judicially created negative Commerce Clause, but in
the Art. I, $ 10, Import-Export Clause, our decision in Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123 (1869), notwithstanding. That
the expansion effected by today's decision finds some support
in the morass of our negative Commerce Clause case law
only serves to highlight the need to abandon that failed jurisprudence and to consider restoring the original ImportExport Clause check on discriminatory state taxation to
what appears to be its proper role. As I explain in Part III,
the tax (and tax exemption) at issue in this case seems easily
to survive Import-Export Clause scrutiny; I would therefore,
in all likelihood, sustain Maine's tax under that Clause as
well, were we to apply it instead of the judicially created
negative Commerce Clause.

S. 37, 44 (1971), I think itworth revisiting the underlying justifications for our involvement in the negative aspects of the Commerce Clause, andthe compelling arguments demonstrating why those justifications are illusory.To cover its exercise of judicial power in an area for which
there is no textual basis, the Court has historically offeredtwo different theories in support of its negative Commerce
Clause jurisprudence. The first theory posited was that theCommerce Clause itself constituted an

exclusive grant ofpower to Congress. See,
e. g., Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283,393-400 (1849).

wrong from the outset, however. See, e. g., The FederalistNo. 32, p. 154 (M. Beloff ed. 1987) (A. Hamilton) ("[N]otwithstanding the affirmative grants of general authorities, therehas been the most pointed care in those cases where it was

Thomas, J., dissenting

Indeed, the Court's early view that the Commerce Clause,on its own, prohibited state impediments to interstate commerce such that "Congress cannot re-grant, or in any mannerreconvey to the states that power," Cooley v. Board of Wardens of Port of Philadelphia ex rel. Soc. for Relief of Distressed Pilots, 12 How. 299, 318 (1852), quickly proved un-tenable. Compare Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont

Bridge Co., 13 How. 518 (1852) (holding that construction ofthe Wheeling Bridge impeded commerce in violation of the
Commerce Clause), with Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Bel-mont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 426 (1856) (upholding Federal
Act that declared the Wheeling Bridge to be "[a] lawfulstructur[e]"); see also

Transportation Co. v. Parkersburg,107 U. S. 691, 701 (1883) ("It is Congress, and not the Judicial

Department, to which the Constitution has given the powerto regulate commerce").

8 And, as this Court's definition of

the scope of congressional authority under the positive Com-merce Clause has expanded, the exclusivity rationale has

moved from untenable to absurd.The second theory offered to justify creation of a negative
Commerce Clause is that Congress, by its silence, pre-emptsstate legislation. See Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing
Dist., 120 U. S. 489, 493 (1887) (asserting that congressional
1829). The majority's interpretation of the letter is anachronistic. There
is nothing in the letter to suggest that Madison had in mind the "negative"
Commerce Clause we have created which supposedly operates of its own
force to allow courts to invalidate state laws that affect commerce.
Rather, Madison's reference to the Clause as granting a "power" strongly
suggests that he was merely asserting that the Convention designed the
Clause more to enable "the General Government," namely, Congress, to
negate state laws impeding commerce "rather than as a power to be used
for the positive purposes of the General Government." Ibid.

silence evidences congressional intent that there be no stateregulation of commerce). In other words, we presumed that

congressional "inaction" was "equivalent to a declarationthat inter-State commerce shall be free and untrammelled."
Welton v. Missouri, 91 U. S. 275, 282 (1876). To the extentthat the "pre-emption-by-silence" rationale ever made sense,
it, too, has long since been rejected by this Court in virtuallyevery analogous area of the law.

For example, ever since the watershed case of Erie R. Co.v.

Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), this Court has rejected thenotion that it can create a federal common law to fill in great

silences left by Congress, and thereby pre-empt state law.We have recognized that "a federal court could not generally
apply a federal rule of decision, despite the existence of juris-diction, in the absence of an applicable Act of Congress."
Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U. S. 304, 313 (1981).9The limited areas in which we have created federal common law typically involve either uniquely federal issues or
the rights and responsibilities of the United States or itsagents. See

Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff Materials,
Inc., 451 U. S. 630, 641 (1981). But where a federal rule isnot essential, or where state law already operates within a

particular field, we have applied state law rather than optingto create federal common law. See

pleas for uniformity" as a basis for creating federal commonlaw); see also

Atherton v. FDIC, 519 U. S. 213, 225-226
(1997) (same).Similarly, even where Congress

has legislated in an area
subject to its authority, our pre-emption jurisprudence explicitly rejects the notion that mere congressional silence ona particular issue may be read as pre-empting state law:

"As is always the case in our pre-emption jurisprudence, where `federal law is said to bar state action infields of traditional state regulation, . . . we have worked

on the "assumption that the historic police powers of the
States were not to be superseded by the Federal Actunless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress." ' " California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr. N. A., Inc., 519 U. S.

316, 325 (1997) (citations omitted).

See also Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519 (1977)
(same); Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218(1947) (same).

To be sure, we have overcome our reluctance to pre-emptstate law in two types of situations: (1) where a state law
directly conflicts with a federal law; and (2) where Congress,through extensive legislation, can be said to have pre-empted
the field. See Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management
Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 98 (1992). But those two forms of pre-emption provide little aid to defenders of the negative Commerce Clause. Conflict pre-emption only applies when thereis a direct clash between an Act of Congress and a state
statute, but the very premise of the negative Commerce
Clause is the absence of congressional action.

Field pre-emption likewise is of little use in areas where
Congress has failed to enter the field, and certainly does not
support the general proposition of "pre-emption-by-silence"
that is used to provide a veneer of legitimacy to our negative
Commerce Clause forays. Furthermore, field pre-emption

is itself suspect, at least as applied in the absence of a con-gressional command that a particular field be pre-empted.

Perhaps recognizing this problem, our recent cases have fre-quently rejected field pre-emption in the absence of statutory language expressly requiring it. See, e. g., O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 512 U. S. 79, 85 (1994) ("Nor wouldwe adopt a court-made rule to supplement federal statutory

regulation that is comprehensive and detailed; matters leftunaddressed in such a scheme are presumably left subject to
the disposition provided by state law"). Even when an ex-press pre-emption provision has been enacted by Congress,
we have narrowly defined the area to be pre-empted. See,
e. g., Dillingham, supra, at 324-325; Cipollone v. Liggett
Group, Inc., 505 U. S. 504, 517 (1992).

In the analogous context of statutory construction, we
have similarly refused to rely on congressional inaction to
alter the proper construction of a pre-existing statute. See
Central Bank of Denver, N. A. v. First Interstate Bank of
Denver, N. A., 511 U. S. 164, 180-185 (1994). And, even
more troubling, the "pre-emption-by-silence" rationale virtually amounts to legislation by default, in apparent violation
of the constitutional requirements of bicameralism and presentment. Cf. INS v. Chadha, 462 U. S. 919, 951-959 (1983).
Thus, even were we wrongly to assume that congressional
silence evidenced a desire to pre-empt some undefined category of state laws, and an intent to delegate such policyladen categorization to the courts, treating unenacted congressional intent as if it were law would be constitutionally
dubious.

In sum, neither of the Court's proffered theoretical justifications--exclusivity or pre-emption-by-silence--currently
supports our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, if
either ever did. Despite the collapse of its theoretical foundation, I suspect we have nonetheless adhered to the negative Commerce Clause because we believed it necessary to
check state measures contrary to the perceived spirit, if not

the actual letter, of the Constitution. Thus, in one of our
early uses of the negative Commerce Clause, we invalidated
a state tax on the privilege of selling goods "which are not
the growth, produce, or manufacture of the State." Welton
v. Missouri, 91 U. S., at 278. And in Cook v. Pennsylvania,
97 U. S. 566 (1878), we struck down a state tax on out-ofstate goods sold at auction. See also, e. g., I. M. Darnell &
Son Co. v. Memphis, 208 U. S. 113 (1908); Voight v. Wright,
141 U. S. 62 (1891); Walling v. Michigan, 116 U. S. 446 (1886);
Webber v. Virginia, 103 U. S. 344 (1881). To this day, we
find discriminatory state taxes on out-of-state goods to be
"virtually per se invalid" under our negative Commerce
Clause. See, e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512
U. S. 186 (1994); Associated Industries of Mo. v. Lohman,
511 U. S. 641 (1994); New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486
U. S. 269 (1988); Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725 (1981).
Though each of these cases reached what intuitively seemed
to be a desirable result--and in some cases arguably was
the constitutionally correct result, as I describe below--the
negative Commerce Clause rationale upon which they rested
remains unsettling because of that rationale's lack of a textual basis.

Moreover, our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence
has taken us well beyond the invalidation of obviously discriminatory taxes on interstate commerce. We have used
the Clause to make policy-laden judgments that we are ill
equipped and arguably unauthorized to make. See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 278-280 (1978) (recognizing that establishing a formula for apportioning taxes on
multistate corporations would require "extensive judicial
lawmaking" for which the courts are ill suited). In so doing,
we have developed multifactor tests in order to assess the
perceived "effect" any particular state tax or regulation has
on interstate commerce. See Complete Auto Transit, Inc.
v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977); see also Quill Corp. v. North

Thomas, J., dissenting
Dakota, 504 U. S. 298 (1992). And in an unabashedly legisla-tive manner, we have balanced that "effect" against the perceived interests of the taxing or regulating State, as the verydescription of our "general rule" indicates:

"Where the statute regulates even-handedly to effectu-ate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on
interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be up-held unless the burden imposed on such commerce is
clearly excessive in relation to the putative local bene-fits.

Huron [Portland] Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S.
440, 443 [(1960)]. If a legitimate local purpose is found,
then the question becomes one of degree. And the ex-tent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course

depend on the nature of the local interest involved, andon whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser
impact on interstate activities." Pike v. Bruce Church,
Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970).

Any test that requires us to assess (1) whether a particu-lar statute serves a "legitimate" local public interest; (2)

whether the effects of the statute on interstate commerce
are merely "incidental" or "clearly excessive in relation to
the putative benefits"; (3) the "nature" of the local interest;
and (4) whether there are alternative means of furthering
the local interest that have a "lesser impact" on interstate
commerce, and even then makes the question "one of degree," surely invites us, if not compels us, to function more
as legislators than as judges. See Bendix Autolite Corp. v.
Midwesco Enterprises, Inc., 486 U. S., at 897-898 (Scalia,
J., concurring in judgment) (urging abandonment of the Pike
balancing test so as to "leave essentially legislative judgments to the Congress").

Moreover, our open-ended balancing tests in this area have
allowed us to reach different results based merely "on differing assessments of the force of competing analogies." Okla520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

homa Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U. S. 175,196, n. 7 (1995). The examples are almost too numerous to

count, but there is perhaps none that more clearly makes thepoint than a comparison of our decisions in

Philadelphia v.
New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978), and its progeny, on the one
hand, and Bowman v. Chicago & Northwestern R. Co., 125U. S. 465 (1888), and its progeny, on the other. In

Bowman,
we recognized that States can prohibit the importation of"cattle or meat or other provisions that are diseased or decayed, or otherwise, from their condition and quality, unfitfor human use or consumption,"

id., at 489, a view to which
we have adhered for more than a century, see, e. g., Maine v.
Taylor, 477 U. S. 131 (1986); Asbell v. Kansas, 209 U. S. 251
(1908). In Philadelphia, however, we held that New Jersey
could not prohibit the importation of "solid or liquid waste
which originated or was collected outside the territorial limits of the State." 437 U. S., at 618 (internal quotation marks
omitted). The cases were arguably distinguishable, but only
on policy grounds and not on any distinction derived from
the text of the Constitution itself.

Similarly, we have in some cases rejected attempts by a
State to limit use of the State's own natural resources to that
State's residents. See, e. g., Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S.
322, 338 (1979). But in other cases, we have upheld just
such preferential access. See, e. g., Sporhase v. Nebraska
ex rel. Douglas, 458 U. S. 941, 955-957 (1982); cf. Baldwin
v. Fish and Game Comm'n of Mont., 436 U. S. 371 (1978).
Again, the distinctions turned on often subtle policy judgments, not the text of the Constitution.

In my view, none of this policy-laden decisionmaking is
proper. Rather, the Court should confine itself to interpreting the text of the Constitution, which itself seems to prohibit in plain terms certain of the more egregious state taxes
on interstate commerce described above, see supra, at 618,
and leaves to Congress the policy choices necessary for any
further regulation of interstate commerce.

II
Article I, $ 10, cl. 2, of the Constitution provides that "[n]oState shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any

Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports . . . ." To the20th-century reader, the Clause appears only to prohibit
States from levying certain kinds of taxes on goods importedfrom or exported to

foreign nations. But a strong argumentcan be made that for the Constitution's Framers and ratifiers--representatives of States which still viewed themselvesas semi-independent sovereigns--the terms "imports" and
"exports" encompassed not just trade with foreign nations,but trade with

other States as well.The late Professor William Crosskey, in a persuasive treatment of this subject nearly a half century ago, unearthednumerous founding-era examples in which the word "import"
referred to goods produced in other States. See The TrueMeaning of the Imports and Exports Clause: Herein of "Interstate Trade Barriers," in 1787, 1 Politics and the Constitu-tion in the History of the United States 295-323 (1953).
Crosskey recounts, for example, that merchants frequentlypublished advertisements in the local newspapers announcing recent shipments of such "imported" goods as "Philadel-phia Flour," "Carolina Rice," and "Connecticut Beef."

goods shipped both to other States and abroad. One writer,for example, urged his fellow Connecticut citizens to manufacture stockings in sufficient quantity not only for the sup-ply of Connecticut "but for exportation to other States" as
well. Letter from "A. C.," Massachusetts Centinel, Sept. 5,1787, p. 1, col. 1, reprinted from New Haven Gazette (emphasis added). Another argued that Connecticut could enrichitself "[b]y making and refining

Cyder for exportation withwhich we might supply the Southern States, as well as the

large provinces of Quebec and Nova-Scotia." ConnecticutFarmer, New-Haven Gazette, Oct. 6, 1785, p. 2, col. 3 (second
and third emphases added).More significantly, the early statute books are replete with
examples of these commonplace 18th-century understandingsof the terms "import" and "export." The Virginia cheeseduty Act of October 1786, for example, provided for a dutyof "three pence a pound on all cheese . . .

imported into thiscommonwealth." 12 Hening, Virginia Statutes at Large, ch.

29, $ 2, p. 289 (emphasis added). As complaints published inNew England newspapers indicate, that duty was imposed
on cheese produced by the New England States. See Salem[Mass.] Mercury, Mar. 3, 1787, p. 2, col. 2. Moreover, the
duty was but one of many imposed by Virginia, which hadfor some time, it seems, "imposed like duties upon the importation of New-England rum, Lynn [Mass.] Shoes, Cheese,Cordage, and a variety of other articles manufactured in the
Eastern States." Independent Chronicle [Boston], Apr. 19,1787, p. 3, col. 2; see 11 Hening, Virginia Statutes at Large,
ch. 8, $ 8, pp. 121-122 (Oct. 1782) (imposing a tonnage duty"on all vessels . . . from or to foreign parts, or from or to any
of the United States," and an impost duty on goods "im-ported or brought into this commonwealth . . . from any port
or place whatsoever").

Maryland, for its part, taxed certain "articles exported outof " the State, including flour shipped to New England. 1784

Md. Laws, ch. 84, $ 1; see also Letter from "A Citizen," Nor-wich [Conn.] Packet, Jan. 17, 1788, p. 1, col. 1 ("The NewEngland States have imported, for four years past, from theState of Maryland, upwards of twenty five thousand barrels
of flour annually--on which they have been obliged to pay aduty for the liberty of exportation"). And, when it provided
for the inspection of salted foods "exported and importedfrom and to the town of Baltimore," Maryland expressly included salted foods "brought or imported into the said town,from any part of this state, or any one of the United States,
or from any foreign port whatever." 1786 Md. Laws, ch.17, $ 5.

In similar fashion, Connecticut adopted an excise tax thatdistinguished between "imported Chocolate," taxed at three
pence per pound, and "Chocolate made within this State,"taxed at one penny per pound. 1783 Conn. Acts and Laws
619. And in May 1784, Connecticut adopted an import dutythat expressly applied to certain enumerated articles "imported or brought into this State, by Land or Water, fromany of the United States of America." 1784 Conn. Acts and
Laws 271.11

11 Some commentators have argued that the phrase "imported or
brought" suggests that Connecticut lawmakers intended to distinguish between foreign goods "imported" and other States' goods "brought" into
the State. This supposed distinction between "imported" and "brought"
is not consistent with the remainder of the statute, however. For example, the second paragraph of the Act uses the phrase "brought or imported
into this State" when referring exclusively to items "that are not the
Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of the United States." 1784 Conn. Acts
and Laws 271. And conversely, "imported" is used alone in contexts
where it plainly covers goods produced in other States. See, e. g., id., at
309 (setting duty for sugar, "whether the Produce or Manufacture of the
United States, or not, imported into this State"); cf. 1786 Md. Laws, ch.
17, $ 6 (setting standards for "all beef and pork barrels brought to, or
imported into, Baltimore-town, from any part of this state"). The more
plausible view, therefore, is that the words "brought" and "imported" are

In fact, when state legislators of the founding generation
intended to limit the term "imports" only to goods of foreign
origin, they were quite adept at so indicating. See id., at
269 (provision regarding merchants "who shall import annually into [New London or New Haven] from Europe, Asia or
Africa, Goods, Wares and Merchandise, the Growth, Produce
or Manufacture of said Countries"); id., at 270 (setting duties
for "Goods imported into this State from any Foreign Port,
Island or Plantation not within any of The United States");
2 New York Laws, ch. 7, p. 12 (1886) (Act of Nov. 18, 1784,
setting duties for certain "articles imported from Europe").
Thus, based on this common 18th-century usage of the words
"import" and "export," and the lack of any textual indication
that the Clause was intended to apply exclusively to foreign
goods, it seems likely that those who drafted the Constitution sought, through the Import-Export Clause, to prohibit
States from levying duties and imposts on goods imported
from, or exported to, other States as well as foreign nations,
and that those who ratified the Constitution would have so
understood the Clause.

Our Civil War era decision in Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall.
123 (1869), of course, held that the Import-Export Clause
applied only to foreign trade. None of the parties to these
proceedings have challenged that holding, but given that the
common 18th-century understanding of the words used in the
Clause extended to interstate as well as foreign trade, it is

largely redundant and, to the extent they refer to different activities, the
distinction in the phrase is not between foreign goods "imported" into
Connecticut, on the one hand, and other States' goods "brought" into Connecticut, on the other, but between goods of both kinds--domestic and
foreign--commercially "imported" in quantity and those "brought" in limited quantities by individuals in their own baggage. Compare 1784 Conn.
Acts and Laws, at 272 (using the phrase "imported or brought" when referring both to a ship's cargo and to the "Baggage of Passengers"), with
id., at 273 (using only the word "imported" when referring solely to the
ship's cargo).

worth assessing the Woodruff Court's reasoning with an eyetoward reconsidering that decision in an appropriate case.

The Woodruff Court began with a textual argument, con-tending that the power to levy "imposts" given to Congress
in Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1, applied only to foreign imports. Such a
limited reading of the word "imposts" in that Clause wasnecessary, the Court claimed, because any other reading

would be nonsensical: Goods "imported" by one State fromanother State, explained the Court, would be an "export" of
the State where the goods were produced or grown, and thesupposed power given to Congress in Art. I, $ 8, to levy an
"impost" on such "imports" would be prohibited by the Art.I, $ 9, provision that "[n]o Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State." This apparent tension between $ 8 and $ 9 led the Court to believe that the word "im-posts" in $ 8 must be read as applying only to foreign imports

in order to avoid a partial negation of the Art. I, $ 8, power.
The Court then extrapolated from this reading that the word
"impost" in Art. I, $ 10, similarly had the same limited application to foreign imports. As we have already seen, however, see supra, at 621-623, the word "import" derived its
meaning from the jurisdiction into which goods were imported; consequently, it does not necessarily follow that the
imports on which Congress was given the power to lay "imposts" in Art. I, $ 8, were identical to the imports and exports
on which the several States were prohibited from levying
"Imposts or Duties" by Art. I, $ 10.12

The Woodruff Court bolstered its textual argument with
two further arguments, neither of which appear still to be

12 Even assuming that the word "impost" in the two Clauses applied to
the same class of "imports," there is nothing nonsensical in reading "impost" in Art. I, $ 8, as applicable to interstate as well as foreign trade. It
is frequently the case that a broad grant of power in one Clause is restricted by another Clause. Moreover, a State could also import goods
from a federal territory, and the congressional power to lay an impost on
such (nonforeign) trade would not run afoul of the Art. I, $ 9, prohibition.

valid, if ever they were: First, that in the history of the Constitution's formation and adoption, "the words imports and
imposts were used with exclusive reference to articles imported from foreign countries," id., at 133 (emphasis added),
and second, the policy concern that goods imported from
other States would be forever exempt from tax if the Clause
were read to apply to interstate imports.

As to the first nontextual argument, the Woodruff Court
was selective in its use of history, to say the least. It first
asserted that, in Articles VI and IX of the Articles of Confederation, the words "imports, exports, and imposts are
used with exclusive reference to foreign trade, because
[those articles] have regard only to the treaty-making power
of the federation." Id., at 134. Even if the Woodruff
Court's assertion was accurate as to Articles VI and IX,
which is doubtful,13 Article IV cannot be so read. That Article expressly permitted "duties" and "impositions" to be levied on property removed from one State to another, as long

13 Article VI, $ 3, merely provided that "[n]o State shall lay any imposts
or duties, which may interfere with any stipulations in treaties, entered
into by the United States in Congress assembled." 1 Stat. 5. And Article IX provided: "The United States, in Congress assembled, shall have
the sole and exclusive right and power of . . . entering into treaties and
alliances, provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made, whereby the
legislative power of the respective States shall be restrained from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as their own people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species
of goods or commodities whatsoever. . . ." 1 Stat. 6. As should be evident, neither Article requires a reading of "impost" as applicable exclusively to foreign imports. The better reading is that when the States
levied imposts in their individual capacities, they could not interfere with
treaties enacted by the States in their collective capacity. In fact, the two
provisions, read together, suggest the existence of much broader classes of
"imposts," "imports," and "exports," and that only the subclass of imposts
interfering with foreign trade might be prohibited. The absence of this
very qualifier in the later enacted Import-Export Clause creates a negative inference that the unqualified constitutional language covered more
than did the limited prohibition in the Articles of Confederation.

as the property was not owned by "the United States, oreither of them."

14

The Woodruff Court next turned to the use of the words"duty" and "import" in the Continental Congress. The

Court noted that the Continental Congress recommendedthat the States give it permission to levy a duty of five percent on all "foreign merchandise imported into the country,"
and that, though "imperfectly . . . preserved," the debates inthe Congress "are full of the subject of the injustice done by

the States who had good seaports, by duties levied in thoseports on foreign goods designed for States who had no such
ports." Id., at 134.There is, of course, no question that the ability of seaport
States to tax the foreign imports of their neighbors was a
source of discord between the States, and continued to be sothrough the Constitutional Convention itself. In order to

support its contention, however, the Woodruff Court was obligated to show not merely that the words "duty," "impost,"
and "imports" were used in reference to foreign goods, but

14 Indeed, some New Englanders apparently believed that the Virginia
duty on New England cheese, see supra, at 622, was contrary to Article
IV's provision that "no imposition, duties or restriction, shall be laid by
any State, on the property of the United States, or either of them." 1
Stat. 4. See Salem [Mass.] Mercury, Mar. 3, 1787. The general view of
the Clause, however, and certainly the view of the several States that
imposed duties on interstate trade, see supra, at 622-623, was that it applied only to goods actually owned by the States, not to goods grown or
manufactured within them. See Salem [Mass.] Mercury, Mar. 3, 1787
("[T]he proper construction of that part of the Articles of Confederation
is, that no state in the union shall lay a tax on publick property imported
therein--for, be it remembered, Congress were, at the time the Confederation was formed, exporters of almost every necessary for carrying on the
war, & the clause alluded to was intended to prevent any individual state
from laying a duty on those necessary supplies"); see also 12 Hening, Virginia Statutes at Large, ch. 40, $ 3, pp. 304-305 (Oct. 1786) (distinguishing
between articles "which are the property of the United States, or either
of them," and articles "which shall be proved to be of the growth, produce
or manufacture of the State from which they shall be imported").

that foreign goods were the exclusive reference. Contraryto the

Woodruff Court's claim, the historical record does not
appear to support such an exclusive use of the words.The records of the Continental Congress contain numerous

examples of the words "duty," "impost," and "import" being
used with reference to interstate trade. In 1785, for exam-ple, in response to the increasing animosities between the

States engendered by conflicting interstate trade regula-tions, an amendment to the Articles of Confederation was
proposed that would have vested in the Continental Con-gress the power to lay "such imposts and duties upon imports
and exports, as may be necessary for the purpose" of "regulating the trade of the States, as well with foreign Nations,
as with each other." 28 Journals of the Continental Congress, Mar. 28, 1785, p. 201 (1933) (emphasis added). Two
provisos within the proposed amendment further suggest
that interstate imports and exports were very much within
the purview of the amendment: First, "that the Citizens of
the States shall in no instance be subjected to pay higher
imposts and duties, than those imposed on the subjects of
foreign powers"; and second, "that the Legislative power of
the several States shall not be restrained from prohibiting
the importation or exportation of any species of goods or
commodities whatsoever." Ibid.

As early as 1779, the problems posed by interstate trade
barriers had become acute enough to warrant a request by
the Continental Congress urging the States "to repeal all
laws or other restrictions laid on the inland trade between
the said states." Resolution of Aug. 25, 1779, 14 Journals of
the Continental Congress 986; id., at 996 (adopting resolution). While this particular resolution does not use the
words "duties" or "imports," it seems evident from a survey
of the statutory "duties" being levied by some States on
goods "imported" from other States, see supra, at 622-623,
that the resolution was directed at just such duties on imports from other States.

Many of the States ignored the request, of course, andtheir "rival, conflicting and angry regulations" continued to

be a source of conflict until the new Constitution went intoeffect. See Madison, Preface to Debates in the Convention
of 1787 (Draft), circa 1836, in 3 Farrand 547; see also, e. g.,
William Ellery to Samuel Dick, Aug. 2, 1784, in 7 Letters ofMembers of the Continental Congress 579 (E. Burnett ed.

1934) (hereinafter Burnett's Letters) (predicting that RhodeIsland would not agree to the national impost requested by
the Congress in 1781 "until the States shall have agreed notto lay any

duties upon goods imported into them from any
one of their Sister States; perhaps not then" (emphasis
added)); William Samuel Johnson to Jonathan Sturges (draft),
Jan. 26, 1785, in 8 Burnett's Letters 13 (noting that the Continental Congress was considering asking the States "to invest
Congress with the Power of regulating their Trade as well
with foreign Nations as with each other," a move which
"might probably overturn the System [of "duties" on "imported" goods, see supra, at 623,] Conn[ecticu]t has adopt'd
as relat[iv]e to N. Y. which it is said she will counteract by
regulat[ion]s of her Assembly now convening" (emphasis in
original)).

In fact, the animosity engendered by the various duties
levied on imports from other States was one of the motivating factors leading to the Annapolis Convention of 1786.
See T. Powell, Vagaries and Varieties in Constitutional Interpretation 182 (1956) ("When the Framers spoke in 1787, the
states were substantially sovereign, and their exercises of
sovereign powers in adversely affecting trade from sister
states was one of the factors leading to the Annapolis conference"). As noted by Tench Coxe, one of the Pennsylvania
Commissioners appointed to attend the Convention: "Goods
of the growth product and manufacture of the Other States
in Union were [in several of the States] charged with high

the same Kinds." Coxe, Letter to the Virginia Commission-ers at Annapolis, Sept. 13, 1786, reprinted in 9 The Papers

of James Madison 125 (Rutland ed. 1975). Coxe thought thevery purpose of the Annapolis Convention had been "[t]o procure an alteration" of this and other practices, which were,
he added, "evidently opposed to the great principles andSpirit of the Union."

Ibid.
Similarly, one of the first criticisms leveled against the Ar-ticles of Confederation during the ensuing Federal Convention was the general Government's inability to prevent "quar-rels between states," including those arising from the various
"duties" the States imposed upon each other, both on foreign
goods moving through the seaport States and on each other's
goods. See 1 Farrand 19, 25 (Edmund Randolph, May 29);
see also Madison, Preface to Debates in the Convention of
1787 (draft), circa 1836, in 3 Farrand 547-548 ("Some of the
States, as Connecticut, taxed imports as from Massts higher
than imports even from G. B. of w[hi]ch Massts. complained
to Virga. and doubtless to other States").

While the focus of the Convention quickly moved beyond
the mere abolition of trade barriers, of course, there are passages in the available Convention debates which indicate
that interstate trade barriers remained a concern, and that
the words of the Import-Export Clause applied to interstate,
as well as to foreign, trade. George Mason, for example,
proposed to exempt from the Import-Export Clause prohibition duties necessary for the States' execution of their inspection laws. Otherwise, he argued, the "restriction on the
States would prevent the incidental duties necessary for the
inspection & safe-keeping of their produce, and be ruinous
to the [Southern] Staple States." 2 Farrand 588 (Sept. 12).
James Madison seconded the motion, and his comment that
any feared abuse of the power to levy duties on exports for
inspection purposes was perhaps best guarded against by
"the right in the Genl. Government to regulate trade between State & State," id., at 588-589 (emphasis added),

strongly suggests that exports to other States were withinthe Clause's reach.

These references to duties on interstate imports andexports are bolstered by several more in the ratification

debates. See, e. g., 2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Con-stitution 57-58 (2d ed. 1891) (hereinafter Elliot) (Dawes,
Massachusetts ratifying convention) ("As to commerce, it iswell known that the different states now pursue different
systems of duties in regard to each other. By this, and forwant of general laws of prohibition through the Union, we
have not secured even our own domestic traffic that passesfrom state to state" (original emphasis deleted)). Indeed,
one of the principal Anti-Federalist complaints against thenew Constitution was that States were prohibited from laying any duties or imposts on imports or exports, a prohibi-tion that, in their view, left only direct taxation as a means
for the States to support their own governments. See, e. g.,Brutus 1, Oct. 18, 1787, in 13 Documentary History of the
Ratification of the Constitution 415 (J. Kaminsky & G. Sala-dino eds. 1981) (hereinafter Doc. Hist.) ("No state can . . . lay
any duties, or imposts, on imports, or exports . . . . [T]heonly mean therefore left, for any state to support its government and discharge its debts, is by direct taxation").16 This

15 Furthermore, in response to concerns that the inspection exemption might be used merely as a pretext for taxing neighboring States,
see 2 Farrand 589, Mason's proposal was further amended to make
any such State inspection laws "subject to the revision and controul
of Congress," id., at 607, 624. The need for, and existence of, this further limitation on the States' authority to tax imports and exports suggests that the Commerce Clause power itself, referred to by Madison,
would not operate to limit the States of its own accord. See supra, at
613-614, n. 7.

complaint overstates the case somewhat--States could still
levy excises, and duties other than those on imports and exports. See, e. g., The Federalist No. 32, p. 151 (M. Beloff ed.
1987) (A. Hamilton) ("([W]ith the sole exception of duties on
imports and exports)[, States] would, under the plan of the
convention, retain [the] authority [to raise their own revenues] in the most absolute and unqualified sense"). But it
does suggest that the Anti-Federalists, at least, viewed the
Import-Export Clause as prohibiting all other state taxes,
including the duties then in place on goods imported from
neighboring States. And moves in various States shortly
after the Constitution's ratification to repeal the offending
duties on interstate trade support the Anti-Federalist view.
Compare An Act repealing the Laws made for levying and
collecting a Duty on Articles imported into this State, 1789
Conn. Acts and Laws 377 (Jan. 1789), with, e. g., An Act for
levying and collecting Duties on the Importation of certain
Articles, and for appropriating the same, 1784 Conn. Acts
and Laws 309 (Oct. 1784) (providing for, inter alia, a duty of
three pence "on each Pound of Sugar . . . whether the
Produce or Manufacture of the United States, or not, imported into this State").

Justice Nelson, of course, pointed out in his Woodruff dissent that a lack of "security or protection" against "obstructions and interruptions of commerce among the States" was
"one of the principal grievances that led to the Convention
of 1787, and to the adoption of the Federal Constitution." 8

nal many of the historical materials cited above, which indi-cate that the words used in the Import-Export Clause encompassed, at the time the Constitution was written, bothinterstate and foreign trade.

17 Indeed, the Woodruff majority itself felt compelled to note that its "research [had]extended" only so far as permitted by "the discussions on

this subject, as they have come down to us from that time."
Id., at 136; see also id., at 134 (referring to the "imperfectly. . . preserved" discussions of the Continental Congress).

Whatever the cause, the Woodruff Court's analysis of thehistorical usage of the words overlooked many contrary
examples and is thus not especially compelling.The second contention that the

Woodruff Court used tobolster its textual argument was a policy concern based on

an unnecessarily broad view of the Import-Export Clause'sprohibition. The Woodruff Court believed that the prohibition on "Duties or Imposts on Exports or Imports" exemptedimported articles, and the merchants who traded in them,
from state taxation of any kind, at least so long as they re-mained in their original packages.

Id., at 137. This viewof the Clause's prohibition would result in "the grossest injustice," said the Court, were the Clause to be read as apply-ing to "articles brought from one State into another," for
"[n]either the State nor the city which protects [the importmerchant's] life and property [could] make him contribute a
dollar to support its government." Ibid.

17 Farrand did not publish his volumes until 1911 (although the Woodruff
Court did have available to it Madison's notes, as well as the more perfunctory convention journal); Burnett's Letters were published between 1921
and 1936; the Journals of the Continental Congress were published between 1904 and 1937; volume 9 of The Papers of James Madison, in which
Tench Coxe's letter was first reprinted, was not published until 1975; and
a useful, readily accessible collection of the various Anti-Federalist writings was not available until 1981. This is not to say that the original
documents reprinted in these volumes would not have been available to
the Woodruff Court. But our ready access to, as well as our appreciation
of, such documents has increased over time.

Thomas, J., dissenting

Woodruff 's broad reading of the Clause's prohibition was
explicitly adopted three years later in Low v. Austin, 13
Wall. 29 (1872), a case involving foreign imports. But we
expressly overruled Low 20 years ago, in Michelin Tire
Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276, 279 (1976), holding that the
Import-Export Clause "cannot be read to accord imported
goods preferential treatment that permits escape from uniform taxes imposed without regard to foreign origin for
services which the State supplies," id., at 287; cf. United
States v. International Business Machines Corp., 517 U. S.
843, 857-859 (1996) (distinguishing the Art. I, $ 9, cl. 5, Export Clause, which bars the United States from imposing any
tax on exports, from the Import-Export Clause, which prohibits States from levying only duties and imposts). While
Michelin and Low dealt with foreign imports, the expansive
interpretation of the Import-Export Clause's prohibition rejected by Michelin was the same interpretation that gave
the Woodruff Court pause and that seems to have been an
impetus to its refusal to read the Clause as applying to imports from other States. Thus, after Michelin, the second
argument the Woodruff Court used to bolster its weak textual analysis--that it would be a gross injustice to prohibit
States from levying any taxes on goods which were produced
in other States--no longer has any force.

There is nothing else of consequence to support the Woodruff Court's holding. The only remaining argument made
by the Woodruff majority was that it was "improbable" that
the Convention would have permitted States to tax "imports" from other States merely with the assent of Congress,
because the revenues that would accrue to Congress by
granting such assent would prove too great a temptation for
Congress to serve as a neutral arbiter regarding such taxes.
Woodruff, supra, at 133. The Woodruff Court's speculation
was without historical support, however, and pales in comparison to the substantial evidence described above regard520US2 Unit: $U54 [09-10-99 19:36:35] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ing the meaning of the words in the Clause, see supra, at621-624.

In short, there is little in the Woodruff opinion to sustainits holding, and its weakness is even more evident given the

contrary precedent rejected by the Woodruff Court. In
Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 449 (1827), Chief Justice
Marshall, writing for the Court, suggested: "[W]e suppose
the principles laid down in this case [namely, that a statelicense tax on importers of foreign articles was invalid both

under the Import-Export Clause and the Act of Congresswhich authorizes importation] to apply equally to importations from a sister State." And just eight years before
Woodruff, Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous
Court, struck down a stamp tax on bills of lading for gold
being shipped from California to New York, holding that"the State tax in question is a duty upon the

export of gold
and silver, and consequently repugnant to the [ImportExport] clause in the Constitution." Almy v. California, 24
How. 169, 175 (1861) (emphasis added).

Chief Justice Marshall's statement in Brown was merely
dicta, of course, but the Woodruff majority's rejection of the
precedential force of Almy, based solely on its assertion that
"[i]t seems to have escaped the attention of counsel on both
sides, and of the Chief Justice who delivered the opinion,

18 Indeed, were I similarly to speculate, I would not find it "improbable"
that the Convention would have trusted Congress to serve as a referee
between individual States. Since many States would necessarily be
harmed by a single State's impost, the institutional checks would in all
likelihood be sufficient to counter any revenue "temptation" Congress
might have faced, especially given the extensive revenue authority
granted directly to Congress in Art. I, $ 8, cl. 1. My "speculation" is at
least consistent with the recorded Convention debates. Roger Sherman
proposed the requirement that any revenues raised by congressionally approved state imposts go into the federal treasury not as a separate means
of raising national revenues, but to ensure that the States not use a protectionist impost as a pretext for raising revenues from other States. See 2
Farrand 441-442 (Aug. 28).

that the case was one of inter-state commerce," 8 Wall., at137, is harder to sustain. The

Almy Court expressly noted
that Mr. Almy was charged with failing to pay the stamp taxon a bill of lading for "a quantity of gold-dust for transportation to New York" from San Francisco, 24 How., at 172, and
the explicit "question presented by the case" was whether aState had a right "to tax such instruments when used in

commerce among the States," Brief for Plaintiff in Error in
Almy v. California, D. T. 1860, No. 23, pp. 1-2 (emphasis
added); see also id., at 3 (referring to fact that the tax wason bills of lading "for exports to other States").

Woodruff 's
rejection of Brown and Almy--precedent which better
reflected the historical record and common usage of the
Clause's words--was thus highly questionable.

In sum, it would seem that Woodruff was, in all likelihood,
wrongly decided. Of course, much of what the ImportExport Clause appears to have been designed to protect
against has since been addressed under the negative Commerce Clause. As the majority recognizes, discriminatory
state taxation of interstate commerce is one of the core
pieces of our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence.
Ante, at 581. Were it simply a matter of invalidating state
laws under one Clause of the Constitution rather than another, I might be inclined to leave well enough alone. Indeed, our rule that state taxes that discriminate against
interstate commerce are virtually per se invalid under the
negative Commerce Clause may well approximate the apparent prohibition of the Import-Export Clause itself. But, as
already described, without the proper textual roots, our negative Commerce Clause has gone far afield of its core--and
we have yet to articulate either a coherent rationale for permitting the courts effectively to legislate in this field, or a
workable test for assessing which state laws pass negative
Commerce Clause muster. Precedent as unworkable as our
negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence has become is simply not entitled to the weight of stare decisis. See Holder

v. Hall, 512 U. S. 874, 936-937 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurringin judgment). And it is quite possible that, were we to revisit Woodruff, we might find that the Constitution alreadyaffords us a textual mechanism with which to address the
more egregious of state actions discriminating against inter-state commerce.

III
Were we thus to shed ourselves of our nontextual negativeCommerce Clause and all the accompanying multifactor balancing tests we have employed, and instead merely applywhat appears to me to be the relevant provision of the Constitution, this would seem to be a fairly straightforward case(although I reserve final judgment of the matter for a case
when the Import-Export Clause is specifically addressed bythe parties). Unlike the Export Clause of Art. I, $ 9, which
prohibits the Congress from levying any tax on exports, theImport-Export Clause only prohibits States from levying
"duties" and "imposts." See International Business Machines, 517 U. S., at 857-858.The Maine property tax at issue here is almost certainly

not an impost, for, as 18th-century usage of the word indi-cates, an impost was a tax levied on

goods at the time ofimportation. See, e. g., The Observer-No. XII, Connecticut

Courant and Weekly Intelligencer, Jan. 7, 1790, p. 1, col. 2("[I]mpost is a tax on merchandize, payable at the port of
entry"); 19 N. Bailey, An Universal Etymological English Dic-tionary (26 ed. 1789) (defining "impost" as "a tax or tribute,
but more especially such as is received by a prince or state,for goods brought into any haven from other nations");

Michelin, 423 U. S., at 287 ("[I]mposts and duties . . . areessentially taxes on the commercial privilege of bringing

goods into a country"). Because the tax at issue here islevied on real property--property that cannot possibly have
been "imported"--the tax would not seem to fit within anyof the commonly accepted definitions of "impost."

"Duty," however, though frequently used like "impost"to denote "money paid for custom of goods," An Universal
Etymological English Dictionary, supra, does not appear tohave been limited to taxes assessed at portside. See,

e. g.,S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (7th ed.

1785) ("Duty . . . Tax; impost; custom; toll. All the winesmake their way through several

duties and taxes, beforethey reach the port" (second emphasis added)); 2 Elliot 331

(John Williams, New York ratifying convention) (noting thatCongress' Art. I, $ 8, power "extend[s] to duties on all kinds
of goods, to tonnage and poundage of vessels, to duties onwritten instruments, newspapers, almanacs, &c"). In fact,
"imposts" seems to have been viewed as a particular subclassof duties; the fact that the two words are used disjunctively
in the Import-Export Clause suggests, therefore, that some-thing broader than portside customs was within the constitutional prohibition.Because of the somewhat ambiguous usage of the words

Committee on Detail, replied as follows: "[D]uties are applicable to many objects to which the word imposts does not
relate. The latter are appropriated to commerce; the former
extend to a variety of objects, as stamp duties &c." 2 Farrand 305 (emphasis in original); see also 2 Storing 54 (Luther
Martin, in Maryland Convention, describing same colloquy);
The Fallacies of the Freeman Detected by a Farmer, Freeman's Journal, April 1788, in 3 Storing 186-187 ("Under the
term duties [in Art. I, $ 8], every species of indirect taxes is
included, but it especially means the power of levying money
upon printed books, and written instruments"). What
seems likely from these descriptions is that a duty, though
broader than an impost, was still a tax on particular goods
or written instruments.

It is important to note, moreover, that the Martin-Wilson
colloquy is in reference to the Art. I, $ 8, power given to
Congress to levy duties. That power is broader than the
prohibition on States found in Art. I, $ 10, which reaches not
all duties, but only those on "imports or exports." 21 But
even without this additional limitation, one kind of tax that
duties almost certainly did not encompass were "direct"
taxes, such as property taxes and poll taxes. See, e. g., The
Federalist No. 12 (A. Hamilton) (distinguishing direct taxes,

such as property taxes, from indirect taxes, such as imposts,duties, and excises); Freeman's Journal, in 3 Storing 186-187

("Under the term duties [in Art. I, $ 8], every species of indi-rect taxes is included"); see also Michelin, supra, at 286,
290-291.The tax at issue here is nothing more than a tax on real
property. Such taxes were classified as "direct" taxes at thetime of the framing, and were not within the class of "indirect" taxes encompassed by the common understanding ofthe word "duties." The amount of the Maine tax is tied to
the value of the real property on which it is imposed, not toany particular goods, and not even to the number of campers
served. It does not appear, therefore, to be a "duty" on "im-ports" in any sense of the words.

22 Even when coupled with

the tax exemption for certain Maine charities (which is, intruth, no different than a subsidy paid out of the State's general revenues), Maine's property tax would not seem to be a"Duty or Impost on Imports or Exports" within the meaning
of the Import-Export Clause. Thus, were we to overruleWoodruff and apply the Import-Export Clause to this case,
I would in all likelihood sustain this tax under that Clauseas well.

22 Even were I to agree with the majority that a particular property tax
may be a property tax in name only, see ante, at 574-575, and even were I
to assume that travel across state lines to consume services in another
State renders those traveling consumers "imports," it is difficult to characterize the tax at issue here as a duty on imports. It is, rather, as the majority recognizes, a "generally applicable state property tax." Ante, at
567. Maine's grant of an exemption from the tax to some charitable organizations that dispense their charity primarily to Maine residents makes
the tax something less than universal, but it does not make the tax, even
in practical effect, one that is levied exclusively, or even primarily, on imports. See, e. g., New Energy Co. of Ind. v. Limbach, 486 U. S. 269 (1988);
Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 756 (1981); License Cases, 5 How.

"the fact that a State may elect to grant a preference, or an exemption, to
a small percentage of its residents does not make the tax discriminatory").

Syllabus

EDWARDS et al. v. BALISOK
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-1352. Argued November 13, 1996--Decided May 19, 1997
Respondent, an inmate of a Washington state prison, was found guilty of

prison rule infractions and sentenced to, inter alia, the loss of 30 days'
good-time credit he had previously earned toward his release. Alleging
that the procedures used in his disciplinary proceeding violated his
Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, he filed this suit under 42
U. S. C. $ 1983 for a declaration that those procedures were unconstitutional, compensatory and punitive damages for their use, and an injunction to prevent future violations. Although he expressly reserved the
right to seek restoration of the lost good-time credits in an appropriate
forum, he refrained from requesting that relief in light of Preiser v.
Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 500, under which the sole remedy in federal
court for a prisoner seeking such restoration is habeas corpus. The
District Court applied Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 487, which held
that a state prisoner's claim for damages is not cognizable under $ 1983
if a judgment for him would "necessarily imply" the invalidity of his
conviction or sentence, unless he can demonstrate that the conviction
or sentence has previously been invalidated. Although holding that a
judgment for respondent would necessarily imply the invalidity of his
disciplinary hearing and the resulting sanctions, the court did not dismiss the suit, but stayed it pending filing and resolution of a state-court
action for restoration of the good-time credits. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that a claim challenging only the procedures used in a
disciplinary hearing is always cognizable under $ 1983.

Held:

1. Respondent's claim for declaratory relief and money damages is not
cognizable under $ 1983. The principle relied on by the Ninth Circuit--
that a claim seeking damages only for using the wrong procedures, not
for reaching the wrong result, is always cognizable under $ 1983--is incorrect, since it disregards the possibility, clearly envisioned by Heck,
supra, at 482-483, 486-487, and n. 6, that the nature of the challenge to
the procedures could be such as necessarily to imply the invalidity of the
judgment. If established, respondent's allegations of deceit and bias by
the hearing officer at his disciplinary proceeding would necessarily
imply the invalidity of the deprivation of his good-time credits. Cf.,
e. g., Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 535. His contrary contention, which

is based on Washington's "some or any evidence" standard, is rejected.
Pp. 644-648.

2. Although a prayer for prospective injunctive relief ordinarily will
not "necessarily imply" the invalidity of a previous loss of good-time
credits, and so may properly be brought under $ 1983, respondent's
claim for such relief must be remanded because it was not considered
by either lower court, and its validity was neither briefed nor argued
here. Pp. 648-649.

3. The District Court erred in staying this $ 1983 action. That court
was mistaken in its view that once respondent had exhausted his state
remedies, the action could proceed. Section 1983 contains no judicially
imposed exhaustion requirement, Heck, supra, at 481, 483; absent some
other bar to the suit, a claim either is cognizable under $ 1983 and should
immediately go forward, or is not cognizable and should be dismissed.
P. 649.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
In Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U. S. 477, 487 (1994), this Courtheld that a state prisoner's claim for damages is not cognizable under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 if "a judgment in favor of theplaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence," unless the prisoner can demonstrate thatthe conviction or sentence has previously been invalidated.
This case presents the question whether a claim for damagesand declaratory relief brought by a state prisoner challenging the validity of the procedures used to deprive him ofgood-time credits is cognizable under $ 1983.

Respondent Jerry Balisok is an inmate at the WashingtonState Penitentiary in Walla Walla. On August 16, 1993, he
was charged with, and at a hearing on September 2 wasfound guilty of, four prison infractions. He was sentenced
to 10 days in isolation, 20 days in segregation, and depriva-tion of 30 days' good-time credit he had previously earned
toward his release. His appeal within the prison's appealsystem was rejected for failure to comply with the applicable
procedural requirements.On January 26, 1994, respondent filed the present $ 1983
action alleging that the procedures used in his disciplinaryproceeding violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process
rights. His amended complaint requested a declaration thatthe procedures employed by state officials violated due process, compensatory and punitive damages for use of the un-constitutional procedures, an injunction to prevent future
violations, and any other relief the court deems just andequitable. Taking account of our opinion in

Preiser v.Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 475, 500 (1973), which held that the sole

644 EDWARDS v. BALISOK

Opinion of the Court
of good-time credits is a writ of habeas corpus, Balisok's
amended complaint did not request restoration of the lost
credits. (As the District Court noted, however, he expressly reserved the right to seek that relief in an appropriate forum. App. to Pet. for Cert. F-4.)

The District Court, applying our opinion in Heck, held that
a judgment in Balisok's favor "would necessarily imply the
invalidity of the disciplinary hearing and the resulting sanctions." App. to Pet. for Cert. F-14. Rather than grant
petitioners' motion to dismiss, however, the District Court
stayed this action pending filing and resolution of a statecourt action for restoration of the good-time credits. It authorized an immediate appeal of its ruling pursuant to 28
U. S. C. $ 1292(b), and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit reversed, holding that a claim challenging only the
procedures employed in a disciplinary hearing is always cognizable under $ 1983. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2, judgt.
order reported at 70 F. 3d 1277 (1995). We granted certiorari. 517 U. S. 1166 (1996).

The violations of due process alleged by respondent are
similar to those alleged by the plaintiff in Heck. There, the
allegations were that the state officials had conducted an arbitrary investigation, had knowingly destroyed exculpatory
evidence, and had caused an illegal voice identification procedure to be used at the plaintiff 's criminal trial. 512 U. S.,
at 479. Here, respondent principally alleged that petitioner
Edwards, who was the hearing officer at his disciplinary proceeding, concealed exculpatory witness statements and refused to ask specified questions of requested witnesses, App.
to Pet. for Cert. I-3 to I-7, which prevented respondent from
introducing extant exculpatory material and "intentionally
denied" him the right to present evidence in his defense,
Brief for Respondent 3. (Respondent also alleged that Edwards failed to provide a statement of the facts supporting
the guilty finding against him, App. to Pet. for Cert. I-6

Opinion of the Court
to I-7, and that petitioner Wood erroneously rejected hisappeal as exceeding the page limitation, id., at I-7 to I-8.)

There is, however, this critical difference from Heck: Re-spondent, in his amended complaint, limited his request to
damages for depriving him of good-time credits without due
process, not for depriving him of good-time credits undeservedly as a substantive matter.* That is to say, his claim
posited that the procedures were wrong, but not necessarilythat the result was. The distinction between these two

sorts of claims is clearly established in our case law, as is theplaintiff 's entitlement to recover at least nominal damages
under $ 1983 if he proves the former one without also provingthe latter one. See

Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 266-267
(1978). The Court of Appeals was of the view that this difference from Heck was dispositive, following Circuit prece-dent to the effect that a claim challenging only the procedures employed in a disciplinary hearing is always cognizableunder $ 1983. See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2, citing

Gotcher
v. Wood, 66 F. 3d 1097, 1099 (CA9 1995), cert. pending, No.95-1385.

That principle is incorrect, since it disregards the possibil-ity, clearly envisioned by

Heck, that the nature of the challenge to the procedures could be such as necessarily to imply
the invalidity of the judgment. This possibility is alluded toin the very passage from

Heck relied upon by the Court of
Appeals, a passage that distinguished the earlier case of
Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539 (1974), as follows:

"In light of the earlier language characterizing the claimas one of `damages for the deprivation of civil rights,'

rather than damages for the deprivation of good-timecredits, we think this passage recognized a $ 1983 claim
for using the wrong procedures, not for reaching the
*The amended complaint could be considered ambiguous on the point,
but this was the Court of Appeals' interpretation, which has been accepted
by petitioners. Brief for Petitioners 5.

Opinion of the Court
wrong result (i. e., denying good-time credits). Nor isthere any indication in the opinion, or any reason to

believe, that using the wrong procedures necessarily vi-tiated the denial of good-time credits. Thus, the claim
at issue in Wolff did not call into question the lawfulnessof the plaintiff 's continuing confinement."

Heck, 512U. S., at 482-483 (emphasis added and deleted).

The same point was apparent in Heck's summary of itsholding:

"We hold that, in order to recover damages for al-legedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment,

or
for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulnesswould render a conviction or sentence invalid,

6 a $ 1983

plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence hasbeen [overturned]."

Id., at 486-487 (emphasis added).

The footnote appended to the above-italicized clause gave aconcrete example of "a $ 1983 action that does not seek damages directly attributable to conviction or confinement butwhose successful prosecution would necessarily imply that
the plaintiff 's criminal conviction was wrongful." Id., at486, n. 6. The Court of Appeals was thus incorrect in
asserting that a claim seeking damages only "for usingthe wrong procedure, not for reaching the wrong result,"
Gotcher, supra, at 1099, would never be subject to the limi-tation announced in Heck.

The principal procedural defect complained of by respond-ent would, if established, necessarily imply the invalidity of
the deprivation of his good-time credits. His claim is, firstof all, that he was completely denied the opportunity to put
on a defense through specifically identified witnesses whopossessed exculpatory evidence. It appears that all witness
testimony in his defense was excluded. See App. to Pet. forCert. F-2 (District Court opinion) ("At the infraction hearing
. . . , [respondent] asked that the witness statements be readinto the record. According to [respondent], Edwards replied

Opinion of the Court
that no witness statements had been submitted on his be-half "). This is an obvious procedural defect, and state and

federal courts have reinstated good-time credits (absent anew hearing) when it is established. See,

e. g., Kingsley v.
Bureau of Prisons, 937 F. 2d 26, 27, 31 (CA2 1991); Dumas
v. State, 654 So. 2d 48, 49 (Ala. Crim. App. 1994); Mahers v.
State, 437 N. W. 2d 565, 568-569 (Iowa 1989); In re Contras,
199 App. Div. 2d 601, 602, 604 N. Y. S. 2d 651, 652 (1993).Cf.

In re Reismiller, 101 Wash. 2d 291, 293-297, 678 P. 2d
323, 325, 326 (1984); In re Burton, 80 Wash. App. 573, 585,910 P. 2d 1295, 1304 (1996). Respondent's claim, however,

goes even further, asserting that the cause of the exclusion
of the exculpatory evidence was the deceit and bias of the
hearing officer himself. He contends that the hearing officer
lied about the nonexistence of witness statements, see App.
to Pet. for Cert. I-4, I-6, I-7; Brief for Respondent 2-3; App.
4, and thus "intentionally denied" him the right to present
the extant exculpatory evidence, Brief for Respondent 3. A
criminal defendant tried by a partial judge is entitled to have
his conviction set aside, no matter how strong the evidence
against him. Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 535 (1927); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 308 (1991). The due
process requirements for a prison disciplinary hearing are in
many respects less demanding than those for criminal prosecution, but they are not so lax as to let stand the decision of
a biased hearing officer who dishonestly suppresses evidence
of innocence. Cf. Wolff, supra, at 570-571.

Respondent contends that a judgment in his favor would
not imply the invalidity of the loss of his good-time credits
because Washington courts follow a "some or any evidence"
standard, under which, "if there is any evidence in the record
to support the prison hearing determination, then the court
will not undertake an entire review of the record and will
uphold prison hearing results." Brief for Respondent 7, citing Superintendent, Mass. Correctional Institution at Walpole v. Hill, 472 U. S. 445 (1985); Brief for Respondent 21

520US2 Unit: $U55 [09-10-99 19:40:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN
648 EDWARDS v. BALISOK

Opinion of the Court
(citing Washington state cases). Here, respondent pointsout, the record contains ample evidence to support the judgment under this standard. That may be true, but when thebasis for attacking the judgment is not insufficiency of the
evidence, it is irrelevant. As the Washington Supreme
Court has explained: "The evidentiary requirements of dueprocess are satisfied if there is `some evidence' in the record

to support a prison disciplinary decision revoking good timecredits."

In re Johnston, 109 Wash. 2d 493, 497, 745 P. 2d
864, 867 (1987) (emphasis added). Similarly, our discussionin

Hill in no way abrogated the due process requirements
enunciated in Wolff, but simply held that in addition to those
requirements, revocation of good-time credits does not comport with " `the minimum requirements of procedural due
process,' " unless the findings are "supported by some evidence in the record." 472 U. S., at 454 (quoting Wolff,
supra, at 558).

We conclude, therefore, that respondent's claim for declaratory relief and money damages, based on allegations of deceit and bias on the part of the decisionmaker that necessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed, is not
cognizable under $ 1983. Respondent also requests, however, prospective injunctive relief. His amended complaint
alleges that prison officials routinely fail to date-stamp witness statements that are made in cases involving "jail house
attorney[s]" like himself, in order to weaken any due process
challenge for failure to call witnesses. App. to Pet. for Cert.
I-4. He requests an injunction requiring prison officials to
date-stamp witness statements at the time they are received.
Id., at I-10. Ordinarily, a prayer for such prospective relief
will not "necessarily imply" the invalidity of a previous loss
of good-time credits, and so may properly be brought under

$ 1983. To prevail, of course, respondent must establish
standing, see Lewis v. Casey, 518 U. S. 343, 351-354 (1996),
and meet the usual requirements for injunctive relief, see,
e. g., O'Shea v. Littleton, 414 U. S. 488, 499, 502 (1974). Nei520US2 Unit: $U55 [09-10-99 19:40:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ther the Ninth Circuit nor the District Court considered thisinjunctive claim, and its validity was neither briefed nor

argued here. We leave this issue for consideration by thelower courts on remand.

Since we are remanding, we must add a word concerning
the District Court's decision to stay this $ 1983 action whilerespondent sought restoration of his good-time credits,

rather than dismiss it. The District Court was of the viewthat once respondent had exhausted his state remedies, the

$ 1983 action could proceed. App. to Pet. for Cert. F-14.This was error. We reemphasize that $ 1983 contains no judicially imposed exhaustion requirement, Heck, 512 U. S., at481, 483; absent some other bar to the suit, a claim either is
cognizable under $ 1983 and should immediately go forward,
or is not cognizable and should be dismissed.The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the

case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion.

It is so ordered.
Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Souter and
Justice Breyer join, concurring.

I agree that Balisok's claim is not cognizable under 42U. S. C. $ 1983 to the extent that it is "based on allegations

of deceit and bias on the part of the decisionmaker," ante, at
648; those allegations, as the Court explains, "necessarily
imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed," ibid.; see
ante, at 646-648. Balisok alleged other procedural defects,
however, including the failure of prison official Edwards
"to specify what facts and evidence supported the finding
of guilt." App. to Pet. for Cert. F-3 (District Court order);
see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U. S. 539, 564-565 (1974) (inmate subjected to discipline is entitled to a written statement of reasons and evidence relied on). A defect of this
order, unlike the principal "deceit and bias" procedural defect Balisok alleged, see ante, at 646-647, would not neces520US2 Unit: $U55 [09-10-99 19:40:45] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Syllabus

EDMOND v. UNITED STATES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe armed forces

No. 96-262. Argued February 24, 1997--Decided May 19, 1997*
The Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals (formerly the Coast Guard

Court of Military Review) hears appeals from the decisions of courtsmartial, and its decisions are subject to review by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. Under Article 66(a) of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), its judges may be commissioned officers or civilians. During the times here relevant, the court
had two civilian members, both of whom were originally assigned to the
court by the General Counsel of the Department of Transportation. In
anticipation of the possible invalidation of these assignments under the
Appointments Clause, Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2, the Secretary of Transportation
issued a memorandum "adopting" the General Counsel's earlier judicial
assignments as appointments of his own. In Ryder v. United States,
515 U. S. 177, this Court overturned a conviction that had been affirmed,
before the secretarial appointments, by a Coast Guard Court of Military
Review panel that included both civilian members, as it was conceded
that the judges had not been validly appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause. The present case concerns the validity of six convictions
that were affirmed by the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals (or
its predecessor), with one or both civilian judges participating, after the
secretarial appointments. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
affirmed the convictions, relying on its holding on remand in Ryder that
the Secretary's appointments were valid and cured the defect that had
previously existed.

Held: The judicial appointments at issue are valid. Pp. 655-666.

(a) Congress has authorized the Secretary to appoint civilian members of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals. Petitioners' argument that those appointments are invalid because the Secretary lacks
the power under 49 U. S. C. $ 323(a) to appoint Coast Guard judges is
rejected. Although $ 323(a) does not specifically mention such judges,
its plain language authorizes the Secretary to "appoint and fix the pay
of officers and employees of the Department." This Court rejects peti*Together with Lazenby v. United States; Leaver v. United States;
Leonard v. United States; Nichols v. United States; and Venable v. United
States, also on certiorari to the same court (see this Court's Rule 12.4).

Syllabus
tioners' assertion that $ 323(a) is a default statute superseded by express
language in Article 66(a) of the UCMJ giving the Judge Advocate General of each military branch exclusive authority to appoint Court of
Criminal Appeals judges. Conspicuously absent from Article 66(a) is
any mention of "appointment." Instead, the statute refers only to
judges "who are assigned to a Court of Criminal Appeals" (emphasis
added). The fact that this Court found the distinction to be significant
in Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S. 163, 171-172, suggests that Article
66(a) concerns not the appointment of judges, but only their assignment.
A contrary interpretation of Article 66(a) would render it unconstitutional, for under the Appointments Clause Congress could not give
Judge Advocates General power to "appoint" even inferior officers of
the United States. Pp. 655-658.

(b) The Secretary's authorization to appoint civilian Court of Criminal Appeals judges is constitutional. The Appointments Clause gives
the President the exclusive power to select principal officers by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, but authorizes Congress to
"vest the Appointment of . . . inferior Officers . . . in the Heads of Departments." Despite the importance of the responsibilities the judges
in question bear, they are "inferior Officers" under the Clause. Generally speaking, "inferior officers" are officers whose work is directed and
supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential
nomination with the Senate's advice and consent. See, e. g., ch. 4, $$ 1,
2, 1 Stat. 28. Supervision of the work of Coast Guard Court of Criminal
Appeals judges is divided between the General Counsel of the Department of Transportation (who is subordinate to the Secretary) and the
Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. See Arts. 66(f), 67(a), UCMJ.
Significantly, these judges have no power to render a final decision on
behalf of the United States unless permitted to do so by other Executive
officers, and hence they are inferior within the meaning of Article II.

We must determine in this case whether Congress has au-thorized the Secretary of Transportation to appoint civilian

members of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals, andif so, whether this authorization is constitutional under the
Appointments Clause of Article II.

I
The Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals (formerlyknown as the Coast Guard Court of Military Review) is an

intermediate court within the military justice system. It isone of four military Courts of Criminal Appeals; others exist
for the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy-Marine Corps.The Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals hears appeals
from the decisions of courts-martial, and its decisions aresubject to review by the United States Court of Appeals for
the Armed Forces (formerly known as the United StatesCourt of Military Appeals).

1

Appellate military judges who are assigned to a Court ofCriminal Appeals must be members of the bar, but may be

commissioned officers or civilians. Art. 66(a), Uniform Codeof Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. $ 866(a). During the
times relevant to this case, the Coast Guard Court of Crimi-nal Appeals has had two civilian members, Chief Judge Joseph H. Baum and Associate Judge Alfred F. Bridgman, Jr.These judges were originally assigned to serve on the court
by the General Counsel of the Department of Transportation,

Opinion of the Court
who is, ex officio, the Judge Advocate General of the CoastGuard, Art. 1(1), UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 801(1). Subsequent

events, however, called into question the validity of theseassignments.

In Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S. 163 (1994), we considered whether the assignment of commissioned militaryofficers to serve as military judges without reappointment

under the Appointments Clause was constitutional. Weheld that military trial and appellate judges are officers of
the United States and must be appointed pursuant to theAppointments Clause.

Id., at 170. We upheld the judicial
assignments at issue in Weiss because each of the military
judges had been previously appointed by the President as a
commissioned military officer, and was serving on active
duty under that commission at the time he was assigned to
a military court. We noted, however, that "allowing civilians to be assigned to Courts of Military Review, without
being appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause, obviously presents a quite different question." Id., at 170, n. 4.

In anticipation of our decision in Weiss, Chief Judge Baum
sent a memorandum to the Chief Counsel of the Coast Guard
requesting that the Secretary, in his capacity as a department head, reappoint the judges so the court would be constitutionally valid beyond any doubt. See United States v.
Senior, 36 M. J. 1016, 1018 (C. G. C. M. R. 1993). On January
15, 1993, the Secretary of Transportation issued a memorandum "adopting" the General Counsel's assignments to the
Coast Guard Court of Military Review "as judicial appointments of my own." The memorandum then listed the names
of "[t]hose judges presently assigned and appointed by me,"
including Chief Judge Baum and Judge Bridgman. Addendum to Brief for Petitioners A6.

Two Terms ago, in Ryder v. United States, 515 U. S. 177
(1995), we considered the validity of a conviction that had
been affirmed by a panel of the Coast Guard Court of Military Review, including its two civilian members, before the

Opinion of the Court
secretarial appointments of January 15, 1993. The Government conceded that the civilian judges of the Court of Military Review had not been appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause, see Brief for United States in Ryder v.
United States, O. T. 1994, No. 94-431, p. 9, n. 9, but argued
that Ryder's conviction should be affirmed notwithstanding
this defect. We disagreed, holding that Ryder was "entitled
to a hearing before a properly appointed panel of " the Coast
Guard Court of Military Review. 515 U. S., at 188. We did
not consider the validity of convictions affirmed by the court
after the secretarial appointments.

Each of the petitioners in the present case was convicted
by court-martial. In each case the conviction and sentence
were affirmed, in whole or in part, by the Coast Guard Court
of Criminal Appeals (or its predecessor the Court of Military
Review) after the January 15, 1993, secretarial appointments. Chief Judge Baum participated in each decision, and
Judge Bridgman participated in the appeals involving two of
the petitioners. The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
affirmed the convictions, relying on its holding on remand in
United States v. Ryder, 44 M. J. 9 (1996), that the Secretary
of Transportation's appointments were valid and cured the
defect that had previously existed. 45 M. J. 19 (1996); 44
M. J. 273 (1996); 44 M. J. 272 (1996). Petitioners sought review in a consolidated petition pursuant to this Court's Rule
12.4, and we granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 977 (1996).

II
Petitioners argue that the Secretary's civilian appointments to the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals are
invalid for two reasons: First, the Secretary lacks authority
under 49 U. S. C. $ 323(a) to appoint members of the court;
second, judges of military Courts of Criminal Appeals are
principal, not inferior, officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause, and must therefore be appointed by the

The Commandant of theCoast Guard is required to "carry out duties and powers prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation," and he "reportsdirectly to the Secretary." 49 U. S. C. $ 108(b). Most relevant to the present case, $ 323(a) provides: "The Secretaryof Transportation may appoint and fix the pay of officers and
employees of the Department of Transportation and mayprescribe their duties and powers." Petitioners do not
dispute that judges of the Coast Guard Court of CriminalAppeals are officers of the Department of Transportation.
Thus, although the statute does not specifically mentionCoast Guard judges, the plain language of $ 323(a) appears
to give the Secretary power to appoint them.Petitioners argue, however, that $ 323(a) is a default statute, applicable only where Congress has not otherwise pro-vided for the appointment of specific officers. Petitioners
contend that Article 66(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 866(a),gives the Judge Advocate General of each military branch
exclusive authority to appoint judges of his respective Courtof Criminal Appeals. That provision reads as follows:

"Each Judge Advocate General shall establish a Courtof Criminal Appeals which shall be composed of one or
more panels, and each such panel shall be composed ofnot less than three appellate military judges. . . . Appellate military judges who are assigned to a Court of

Opinion of the Court
Criminal Appeals may be commissioned officers or civil-ians, each of whom must be a member of a bar of a Federal court or of the highest court of a State. The JudgeAdvocate General shall designate as chief judge one of
the appellate military judges of the Court of CriminalAppeals established by him. The chief judge shall determine on which panels of the court the appellatejudges assigned to the court will serve and which military judge assigned to the court will act as senior judgeon each panel."

Were we to accept petitioners' interpretation of Article66(a) as providing for the "appointment" of Court of Criminal
Appeals judges, their argument that Congress intended it tobe the exclusive means of appointment might prove persuasive. Ordinarily, where a specific provision conflicts with ageneral one, the specific governs.

Busic v. United States,446 U. S. 398, 406 (1980). Conspicuously absent from Article

66(a), however, is any mention of the "appointment" of mili-tary judges. Instead, the statute refers to judges "who are
assigned to a Court of Criminal Appeals" (emphasis added).The difference between the power to "assign" officers to a
particular task and the power to "appoint" those officers isnot merely stylistic. In

Weiss, we upheld the assignment ofmilitary officers to serve on military courts because they had

previously been "appointed" as officers of the United Statespursuant to the Appointments Clause, and because Congress
had not designated the position of a military judge as onerequiring reappointment. 510 U. S., at 176. We noted in
Weiss that Congress has consistently used the word "ap-point" with respect to military positions requiring a separate
appointment, rather than using terms not found within theAppointments Clause, such as "assign": "Congress repeatedly and consistently distinguished between an office thatwould require a separate appointment and a position or duty
to which one could be `assigned' or `detailed' by a superior

Opinion of the Court
officer." Id., at 172. We found it significant that the sec-tions of the UCMJ relating to military judges "speak explicitly and exclusively in terms of `detail' or `assign'; nowherein these sections is mention made of a separate appointment." Ibid. This analysis suggests that Article 66(a) con-cerns not the appointment of Court of Criminal Appeals
judges, but only their assignment.Moreover, we see no other way to interpret Article 66(a)
that would make it consistent with the Constitution. Underthe Appointments Clause, Congress could not give the Judge
Advocates General power to "appoint" even inferior officersof the United States; that power can be conferred only upon
the President, department heads, and courts of law. Thus,petitioners are asking us to interpret Article 66(a) in a manner that would render it clearly unconstitutional--which wemust of course avoid doing if there is another reasonable interpretation available. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chi-cago, 440 U. S. 490, 500 (1979); Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S.
142 (1927). Petitioners respond that reading $ 323(a) topermit the Secretary to appoint Court of Criminal Appeals
judges causes us unnecessarily to reach the constitutionalquestion whether those judges are inferior officers under the
Appointments Clause, since Congress may vest only theappointment of inferior officers in a department head. But
a constitutional question confronted in order to preserve,if possible, a congressional enactment is not a constitutional
question confronted unnecessarily.We conclude that Article 66(a) does not give Judge Advocates General authority to appoint Court of CriminalAppeals judges; that $ 323(a) does give the Secretary of
Transportation authority to do so; and we turn to the con-stitutional question whether this is consistent with the Appointments Clause. III

The Appointments Clause of Article II of the Constitutionreads as follows:

659Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
"[The President] shall nominate, and by and with theAdvice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of thesupreme Court, and all other Officers of the United
States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwiseprovided for, and which shall be established by Law: but
the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of suchinferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President
alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Depart-ments." U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2.

As we recognized in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 125(1976)

(per curiam), the Appointments Clause of Article IIis more than a matter of "etiquette or protocol"; it is among

the significant structural safeguards of the constitutionalscheme. By vesting the President with the exclusive power
to select the principal (noninferior) officers of the UnitedStates, the Appointments Clause prevents congressional encroachment upon the Executive and Judicial Branches. See
id., at 128-131; Weiss, supra, at 183-185 (Souter, J., concur-ring); Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U. S. 868, 904, and n. 4

(1991) (Scalia, J., concurring). This disposition was also de-signed to assure a higher quality of appointments: The Framers anticipated that the President would be less vulnerableto interest-group pressure and personal favoritism than
would a collective body. "The sole and undivided responsi-bility of one man will naturally beget a livelier sense of duty,
and a more exact regard to reputation." The FederalistNo. 76, p. 387 (M. Beloff ed. 1987) (A. Hamilton); accord, 3
J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the UnitedStates 374-375 (1833). The President's power to select principal officers of the United States was not left unguarded,however, as Article II further requires the "Advice and Consent of the Senate." This serves both to curb Executiveabuses of the appointment power, see 3 Story, supra, at 376-
377, and "to promote a judicious choice of [persons] for fillingthe offices of the union," The Federalist No. 76, at 386-387.

660 EDMOND v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
By requiring the joint participation of the President and the
Senate, the Appointments Clause was designed to ensure
public accountability for both the making of a bad appointment and the rejection of a good one. Hamilton observed:

"The blame of a bad nomination would fall upon the
president singly and absolutely. The censure of rejecting a good one would lie entirely at the door of the senate; aggravated by the consideration of their having
counteracted the good intentions of the executive. If
an ill appointment should be made, the executive for
nominating, and the senate for approving, would participate, though in different degrees, in the opprobrium and
disgrace." Id., No. 77, at 392.

See also 3 Story, supra, at 375 ("If [the President] should . . .
surrender the public patronage into the hands of profligate
men, or low adventurers, it will be impossible for him long
to retain public favour").

The prescribed manner of appointment for principal officers is also the default manner of appointment for inferior
officers. "[B]ut," the Appointments Clause continues, "the
Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior
Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the
Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments." This provision, sometimes referred to as the "Excepting Clause," was
added to the proposed Constitution on the last day of the
Grand Convention, with little discussion. See 2 M. Farrand,
Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 627-628 (1911
ed.). As one of our early opinions suggests, its obvious purpose is administrative convenience, see United States v. Germaine, 99 U. S. 508, 510 (1879)--but that convenience was
deemed to outweigh the benefits of the more cumbersome
procedure only with respect to the appointment of "inferior
Officers." Section 323(a), which confers appointment power
upon the Secretary of Transportation, can constitutionally be

Opinion of the Court
applied to the appointment of Court of Criminal Appealsjudges only if those judges are "inferior Officers."

Our cases have not set forth an exclusive criterion for dis-tinguishing between principal and inferior officers for Appointments Clause purposes. Among the offices that we
have found to be inferior are that of a district court clerk,
Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 225, 258 (1839), an election supervisor, Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371, 397-398 (1880), a viceconsul charged temporarily with the duties of the consul,

United States v. Eaton, 169 U. S. 331, 343 (1898), and a"United States commissioner" in district court proceedings,
Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, 352-
354 (1931). Most recently, in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S.
654 (1988), we held that the independent counsel created by
provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 28
U. S. C. $$ 591-599, was an inferior officer. In reaching that
conclusion, we relied on several factors: that the independent
counsel was subject to removal by a higher officer (the Attorney General), that she performed only limited duties, that
her jurisdiction was narrow, and that her tenure was limited.
487 U. S., at 671-672.

Petitioners are quite correct that the last two of these conclusions do not hold with regard to the office of military
judge at issue here. It is not "limited in tenure," as that
phrase was used in Morrison to describe "appoint[ment] essentially to accomplish a single task [at the end of which] the
office is terminated." Id., at 672. Nor are military judges
"limited in jurisdiction," as used in Morrison to refer to the
fact that an independent counsel may investigate and prosecute only those individuals, and for only those crimes, that
are within the scope of jurisdiction granted by the special
three-judge appointing panel. See Weiss, 510 U. S., at 192
(Souter, J., concurring). However, Morrison did not purport to set forth a definitive test for whether an office is
"inferior" under the Appointments Clause. To the contrary,
it explicitly stated: "We need not attempt here to decide ex520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
662 EDMOND v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
actly where the line falls between the two types of officers,because in our view [the independent counsel] clearly falls

on the `inferior officer' side of that line." 487 U. S., at 671.To support principal-officer status, petitioners emphasize
the importance of the responsibilities that Court of Criminal
Appeals judges bear. They review those court-martial pro-ceedings that result in the most serious sentences, including

those "in which the sentence, as approved, extends to death,dismissal . . . , dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or
confinement for one year or more." Art. 66(b)(1), UCMJ,10 U. S. C. $ 866(b)(1). They must ensure that the courtmartial's finding of guilt and its sentence are "correct in law
and fact," id., Art. 66(c), $ 866(c), which includes resolution of
constitutional challenges. And finally, unlike most appellate
judges, Court of Criminal Appeals judges are not required
to defer to the trial court's factual findings, but may independently "weigh the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses."
Ibid. We do not dispute that military appellate judges are
charged with exercising significant authority on behalf of the
United States. This, however, is also true of offices that we
have held were "inferior" within the meaning of the Appointments Clause. See, e. g., Freytag v. Commissioner, 501
U. S., at 881-882 (special trial judges having "significan[t] . . .
duties and discretion" are inferior officers). The exercise of
"significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United
States" marks, not the line between principal and inferior
officer for Appointments Clause purposes, but rather, as we
said in Buckley, the line between officer and nonofficer. 424
U. S., at 126.

Generally speaking, the term "inferior officer" connotes a
relationship with some higher ranking officer or officers
below the President: Whether one is an "inferior" officer depends on whether he has a superior. It is not enough that
other officers may be identified who formally maintain a

520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
higher rank, or possess responsibilities of a greater magnitude. If that were the intention, the Constitution might
have used the phrase "lesser officer." Rather, in the context
of a Clause designed to preserve political accountability relative to important Government assignments, we think it
evident that "inferior officers" are officers whose work is
directed and supervised at some level by others who were
appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and
consent of the Senate.

This understanding of the Appointments Clause conforms
with the views of the first Congress. On July 27, 1789, Congress established the first Executive department, the Department of Foreign Affairs. In so doing, it expressly designated the Secretary of the Department as a "principal
officer," and his subordinate, the Chief Clerk of the Department, as an "inferior officer:

"Section 1. Be it enacted . . . That there shall be an
Executive department, to be denominated the Department of Foreign Affairs, and that there shall be a principal officer therein, to be called the Secretary for the
Department of Foreign Affairs, who shall perform and
execute such duties as shall from time to time be enjoined on or intrusted to him by the President of the
United States, agreeable to the Constitution, relative to
[matters respecting foreign affairs]; and furthermore,
that the said principal officer shall conduct the business
of the said department in such manner as the President
of the United States shall from time to time order or
instruct.

"Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That there shall
be in the said department, an inferior officer, to be appointed by the said principal officer, and to be employed
therein as he shall deem proper, and to be called the
chief Clerk in the Department of Foreign Affairs. . . ."
Ch. 4, 1 Stat. 28.

664 EDMOND v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of the Court
Congress used similar language in establishing the Depart-ment of War, repeatedly referring to the Secretary of that

department as a "principal officer," and the Chief Clerk, whowould be "employed" within the Department as the Secretary "shall deem proper," as an "inferior officer." Ch. 7,1 Stat. 49.

Supervision of the work of Court of Criminal Appealsjudges is divided between the Judge Advocate General (who
in the Coast Guard is subordinate to the Secretary of Trans-portation) and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.
The Judge Advocate General exercises administrative oversight over the Court of Criminal Appeals. He is charged
with the responsibility to "prescribe uniform rules of proce-dure" for the court, and must "meet periodically [with other

Judge Advocates General] to formulate policies and proce-dure in regard to review of court-martial cases." Art. 66(f),
UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 866(f). It is conceded by the partiesthat the Judge Advocate General may also remove a Court of
Criminal Appeals judge from his judicial assignment withoutcause. The power to remove officers, we have recognized,
is a powerful tool for control. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U. S.
714, 727 (1986); Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926).The Judge Advocate General's control over Court of Criminal Appeals judges is, to be sure, not complete. He may notattempt to influence (by threat of removal or otherwise) the
outcome of individual proceedings, Art. 37, UCMJ, 10U. S. C. $ 837, and has no power to reverse decisions of the
court. This latter power does reside, however, in anotherExecutive Branch entity, the Court of Appeals for the
Armed Forces.2 That court reviews every decision of the

2 Article 141 of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. $ 941, states that the Court of
Appeals for the Armed Forces "is established under article I of the Constitution," and "is located for administrative purposes only in the Department of Defense." Although the statute does not specify the court's "location" for nonadministrative purposes, other provisions of the UCMJ make
clear that it is within the Executive Branch. The court reviews the judg520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
Courts of Criminal Appeals in which: (a) the sentence ex-tends to death; (b) the Judge Advocate General orders such

review; or (c) the court itself grants review upon petition ofthe accused. Id., Art. 67(a), $ 867(a). The scope of review
is narrower than that exercised by the Court of CriminalAppeals: so long as there is some competent evidence in the
record to establish each element of the offense beyond a rea-sonable doubt, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
will not reevaluate the facts. Id., Art. 67(c), $ 867(c); United
States v. Wilson, 6 M. J. 214 (C. M. A. 1979). This limitationupon review does not in our opinion render the judges of

the Court of Criminal Appeals principal officers. What is
significant is that the judges of the Court of Criminal Ap-peals have no power to render a final decision on behalf of

the United States unless permitted to do so by other Execu-tive officers.

Finally, petitioners argue that Freytag v. Commissioner,501 U. S. 868 (1991), which held that special trial judges
charged with assisting Tax Court judges were inferior offi-cers and could be appointed by the Chief Judge of the Tax
Court, suggests that Court of Criminal Appeals judges
are principal officers. Petitioners contend that Court ofCriminal Appeals judges more closely resemble Tax Court

judges--who we implied (according to petitioners) wereprincipal officers--than they do special trial judges. We
note initially that Freytag does not hold that Tax Courtjudges are principal officers; only the appointment of special
trial judges was at issue in that case. Moreover, there aretwo significant distinctions between Tax Court judges and
Court of Criminal Appeals judges. First, there is no Execuments of only military tribunals, id., Art. 67, $ 867; its judges must meet
annually in committee with the Judge Advocates General and two members appointed by the Secretary of Defense to survey the operation of the
military justice system, id., Art. 146, $ 946; and the President may remove
its judges for neglect of duty, misconduct, or mental or physical disability,
id., Art. 142(c), $ 942(c).

its decisions are appealable only to courts of the ThirdBranch. 26 U. S. C. $ 7482. And second, there is no officer
comparable to a Judge Advocate General who supervises thework of the Tax Court, with power to determine its procedural rules, to remove any judge without cause, and to orderany decision submitted for review.

Freytag does not controlour decision here.

* * *
We conclude that 49 U. S. C. $ 323(a) authorizes the Secre-tary of Transportation to appoint judges of the Coast Guard

Court of Criminal Appeals; and that such appointment is inconformity with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, since those judges are "inferior Officers" within themeaning of that provision, by reason of the supervision over
their work exercised by the General Counsel of the Depart-ment of Transportation in his capacity as Judge Advocate
General and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces.The judicial appointments at issue in this case are therefore
valid.

Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Ap-peals for the Armed Forces with respect to each petitioner.

It is so ordered.
Justice Souter, concurring in part and concurring in
the judgment.

I join in Parts I and II of the Court's opinion and agree
with the reasoning in Part III insofar as it describes an
important, and even necessary, reason for holding judges ofthe Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals to be inferior

officers within the meaning of the Appointments Clause,U. S. Const., Art. II, $ 2, cl. 2. The Court states that "[g]enerally speaking, the term `inferior officer' connotes a rela-tionship [of supervision and direction] with some higher

667Cite as: 520 U. S. 651 (1997)
Opinion of Souter, J.
ranking officer or officers below the President: Whether oneis an `inferior' officer depends on whether he has a superior."

Ante, at 662. The Court goes on to show that administra-tive supervision of these judges by the Judge Advocate General of the Coast Guard, combined with his power to control
them by removal from a case, establishes that the interme-diate appellate judges here have the necessary superior.

With this conclusion I agree, but unlike the Court I am notprepared to decide on that basis alone that these judges are
inferior officers.Because the term "inferior officer" implies an official superior, one who has no superior is not an inferior officer. This
unexceptionable maxim will in some instances be dispositive
of status; it might, for example, lead to the conclusion that
United States district judges cannot be inferior officers,
since the power of appellate review does not extend to them
personally, but is limited to their judgments. See In re
Sealed Case, 838 F. 2d 476, 483 (CADC), rev'd sub nom. Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654 (1988) (suggesting that "lower
federal judges . . . are principal officers" because they are
"not subject to personal supervision," 838 F. 2d, at 483); cf.
ante, at 665.

It does not follow, however, that if one is subject to some
supervision and control, one is an inferior officer. Having a
superior officer is necessary for inferior officer status, but
not sufficient to establish it. See, e. g., Morrison v. Olson,
487 U. S., at 654, 722 ("To be sure, it is not a sufficient condition for `inferior' officer status that one be subordinate to a
principal officer. Even an officer who is subordinate to a
department head can be a principal officer") (Scalia, J., dissenting). Accordingly, in Morrison, the Court's determination that the independent counsel was "to some degree `inferior' " to the Attorney General, see id., at 671, did not end
the enquiry. The Court went on to weigh the duties, jurisdiction, and tenure associated with the office, id., at 671-672,
before concluding that the independent counsel was an infe520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN
668 EDMOND v. UNITED STATES

Opinion of Souter, J.
rior officer. Thus, under Morrison, the Solicitor General ofthe United States, for example, may well be a principal officer, despite his statutory "inferiority" to the Attorney Gen-eral. See,

e. g., 28 U. S. C. $ 505 (directing Presidential appointment, with the advice and consent of the Senate, of a
Solicitor General to "assist the Attorney General in the per-formance of his duties"). The mere existence of a "superior"

officer is not dispositive.In this case, as the Court persuasively shows, the Judge
Advocate General has substantial supervisory authority overthe judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals.
As the Court notes, the Judge Advocate General prescribes
rules of procedure for the Court of Criminal Appeals, formulates policies for review of court-martial cases, and is authorized to remove judges from their judicial assignments without cause. See ante, at 664. While these facts establish
that the condition of supervision and control necessary for
inferior officer status has been met, I am wary of treating
them as sufficient to demonstrate that the judges of the
Court of Criminal Appeals are actually inferior officers
under the Constitution.

In having to go beyond the Court's opinion to decide that
the criminal appeals judges are inferior officers, I do not
claim the convenience of a single sufficient condition, and,
indeed, at this stage of the Court's thinking on the matter, I
would not try to derive a single rule of sufficiency. What is
needed, instead, is a detailed look at the powers and duties
of these judges to see whether reasons favoring their inferior
officer status within the constitutional scheme weigh more
heavily than those to the contrary. Having tried to do this
in a concurring opinion in Weiss v. United States, 510 U. S.

163, 182 (1994), I will not repeat the essay. See id., at 192-
194 (reviewing the Morrison factors, including tenure, jurisdiction, duties, and removal; concluding that because it is
"hard to say with any certainty" whether Courts of Military
Review judges should be considered principal or inferior of520US2 Unit: $U56 [09-10-99 19:44:01] PAGES PGT: OPIN

ficers, deference to the political branches' judgment is appro-priate). Here it is enough to add that after the passage of

three Terms since writing in Weiss, I am unrepentant. Itherefore join not only in the Court's conclusion that the necessary supervisory condition for inferior officer status is sat-isfied here, but in the Court's ultimate holding that the
judges of the Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals areinferior officers within the meaning of the Appointments
Clause.

Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. HYDE
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-667. Argued April 15, 1997--Decided May 27, 1997
Respondent pleaded guilty to several federal fraud counts, pursuant to a

plea agreement in which the Government agreed to move for dismissal
of other charges. The District Court accepted the plea but deferred
decision on whether to accept the plea agreement, pending completion
of the presentence report. Before sentencing and the court's decision
on the plea agreement, respondent sought to withdraw his plea. Finding that he had not provided a "fair and just reason" for withdrawing
the plea before sentencing, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 32(e), the court denied respondent's request. The court then
accepted the plea agreement, entered judgment, and sentenced respondent. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that if a court defers acceptance of a plea or of a plea agreement, a defendant may withdraw
his plea for any or no reason, until the court accepts both the plea and
the agreement.

Held: In the circumstances presented here, a defendant may not withdraw

his plea unless he shows a "fair and just reason" under Rule 32(e).
Nothing in the text of Rule 11, which sets out the prerequisites to accepting a guilty plea and plea agreement, supports the Court of Appeals'
holding. That text shows that guilty pleas can be accepted while plea
agreements are deferred and the acceptance of the two can be separated
in time. The Court of Appeals' requirement that a district court shall
not accept a guilty plea without accepting the plea agreement is absent
from the list of prerequisites to accepting a plea set out in Rules 11(c)
and (d). If a court decides to reject a plea agreement such as the one
here, the defendant is given "the opportunity to then withdraw the
plea," Rule 11(e)(4), and he does not have to comply with Rule 32(e)'s
"fair and just reason" requirement. This provision implements the
commonsense notion that a defendant can no longer be bound by an
agreement that the court has refused to sanction, and its necessary implication is that if the court has neither rejected nor accepted the agreement, the defendant is not granted the "opportunity" to automatically
withdraw his plea. The Court of Appeals' holding contradicts this implication and thus strips Rule 11(e)(4) of any meaning. It also debases
the judicial proceeding at which a defendant pleads and the court accepts his plea by allowing him to withdraw his plea simply on a lark.

Opinion of the Court
In addition, the holding would allow little, if any, time for the "fair and
just reason" standard to apply, for a court's decision to accept a plea
agreement is often made at the sentencing hearing. Respondent's arguments--that the "fair and just reason" standard was not meant to
apply to guilty pleas conditioned on acceptance of the plea agreement,
and that the Advisory Committee's Notes to Rule 32(b)(3) support the
Court of Appeals' holding--are rejected. Pp. 673-680.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.
Rule 32(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedurestates that a district court may allow a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea before he is sentenced "if the defendantshows any fair and just reason." After the defendant in this
case pleaded guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement, the Dis-trict Court accepted his plea but deferred decision on
whether to accept the plea agreement. The defendant thensought to withdraw his plea. We hold that in such circumstances a defendant may not withdraw his plea unless heshows a "fair and just reason" under Rule 32(e).

A federal grand jury indicted respondent Robert Hyde oneight counts of mail fraud, wire fraud, and other fraudrelated crimes. On the morning of his trial, respondentindicated his desire to enter plea negotiations with the Government. Those negotiations produced a plea agreement

Opinion of the Court
in which respondent agreed to plead guilty to four of thecounts. In exchange, the Government agreed to move to

dismiss the remaining four counts and not to bring furthercharges against respondent for other allegedly fraudulent
conduct.

That afternoon, the parties appeared again before the Dis-trict Court and submitted the plea agreement to the court,

along with respondent's "application for permission to enter[a] plea of guilty." After placing respondent under oath, the
court questioned him extensively to ensure that his plea wasknowing and voluntary, and that he understood the consequences of pleading guilty, including the possibility of a maximum sentence of 30 years. The court asked respondent
what he had done, and respondent admitted committing the
crimes set out in the four counts. The court then asked
the Government to set out what it was prepared to prove,
and the Government did so. The court asked respondent
whether he was pleading guilty because he was in fact guilty
of the crimes set out in the four counts. Respondent said
that he was. Finally, the court asked respondent how he
pleaded to each count, and respondent stated "guilty."

The District Court concluded that respondent was pleading guilty knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently, and that
there was a factual basis for the plea. The court therefore
stated that it was accepting respondent's guilty plea. It also
stated that it was deferring decision on whether to accept
the plea agreement, pending completion of the presentence
report.

One month later, before sentencing and the District
Court's decision about whether to accept the plea agreement,
respondent filed a motion to withdraw his guilty plea. His
motion alleged that he had pleaded guilty under duress from
the Government and that his admissions to the District
Court had in fact been false. After holding an evidentiary
hearing, the court concluded that there was no evidence to
support respondent's claim of duress, and that respondent

Opinion of the Court
had not provided a "fair and just reason" for withdrawing hisguilty plea, as required by Rule 32(e). The court therefore

refused to let respondent withdraw his guilty plea. Thecourt then accepted the plea agreement, entered judgment
against respondent on the first four counts, dismissed the
indictment's remaining four counts on the Government's mo-tion, and sentenced respondent to a prison term of 2

1/2 years.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, hold-ing that respondent had an absolute right to withdraw his

guilty plea before the District Court accepted the plea agree-ment. 92 F. 3d 779, 781 (1996). The court reasoned as follows: First, before a district court has accepted a defendant's
guilty plea, the defendant has an absolute right to withdraw
that plea. Id., at 780 (citing United States v. Washman, 66
F. 3d 210, 212-213 (CA9 1995)). Second, the guilty plea and
the plea agreement are " `inextricably bound up together,' "
such that the court's deferral of the decision whether to accept the plea agreement also constitutes an automatic deferral of its decision whether to accept the guilty plea, even if
the court explicitly states that it is accepting the guilty plea.
92 F. 3d, at 780 (quoting United States v. Cordova-Perez, 65
F. 3d 1552, 1556 (CA9 1995)). Combining these two propositions, the Court of Appeals held that "[i]f the court defers
acceptance of the plea or of the plea agreement, the defendant may withdraw his plea for any reason or for no reason,
until the time that the court does accept both the plea and
the agreement." 92 F. 3d, at 781.

The Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and Seventh Circuits
have reached the opposite conclusion on this issue. United
States v. Ewing, 957 F. 2d 115, 118-119 (CA4 1992); United
States v. Ellison, 798 F. 2d 1102, 1106 (CA7 1986). We
granted certiorari to resolve the conflict, 519 U. S. 1086
(1997), and now reverse.

To understand why we hold that Rule 32(e) governs here,
we must go back to Rule 11, the principal provision in the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure dealing with the sub520US3 Unit: $U57 [09-11-99 17:02:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN
674 UNITED STATES v. HYDE

Opinion of the Court
ject of guilty pleas and plea agreements. The Court of Ap-peals equated acceptance of the guilty plea with acceptance

of the plea agreement, and deferral of the plea agreementwith deferral of the guilty plea. Nothing in the text of Rule
11 supports these conclusions. In fact, the text shows thatthe opposite is true: Guilty pleas can be accepted while plea
agreements are deferred, and the acceptance of the two canbe separated in time.

The prerequisites to accepting a guilty plea are set outin subdivisions (c) and (d) of Rule 11. Subdivision (c) says:
"Before accepting a plea of guilty . . . , the court must ad-dress the defendant personally in open court and inform the
defendant of, and determine that the defendant under-stands," numerous consequences of pleading guilty. For
example, the court must ensure the defendant understandsthe maximum possible penalty that he may face by pleading
guilty, Rule 11(c)(1), and the important constitutional rightshe is waiving, including the right to a trial, Rules 11(c)(3),
(4). Subdivision (d) says: "The court shall not accept a pleaof guilty . . . without first, by addressing the defendant personally in open court, determining that the plea is volun-tary."

1 The opening words of these two subdivisions are

important: Together, they speak of steps a district courtmust take "[b]efore accepting a plea of guilty," and without

which it "shall not accept a plea of guilty." Based on thislanguage, we conclude that once the court has taken these
steps, it may, in its discretion, accept a defendant's guiltyplea. The Court of Appeals would read an additional prerequisite into this list: A district court shall not accept a pleaof guilty without first accepting the plea agreement. But
that "prerequisite" is absent from the list set out in subdivi-sions (c) and (d), strongly suggesting that no such addition
is warranted.

1 See also Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(f) (court should not enter judgment
on an accepted guilty plea without confirming that the plea has a factual
basis).

Opinion of the Court
Subdivision (e), which covers plea agreements, also contradicts the Court of Appeals' holding. That subdivision divides plea agreements into three types, based on what the
Government agrees to do: In type A agreements, the Government agrees to move for dismissal of other charges; in
type B, it agrees to recommend (or not oppose the defendant's request for) a particular sentence; and in type C, it
agrees that the defendant should receive a specific sentence.
As to type A and type C agreements, the Rule states that
"the court may accept or reject the agreement, or may defer
its decision as to the acceptance or rejection until there has
been an opportunity to consider the presentence report." 2
Rule 11(e)(2). The plea agreement in this case is a type A
agreement: The Government agreed to move to dismiss four
counts, did not agree to recommend a particular sentence,
and did not agree that a specific sentence was the appropriate disposition. The District Court deferred its decision
about whether to accept or reject the agreement.

If the court had decided to reject the plea agreement, it
would have turned to subdivision (e)(4) of Rule 11. That
subdivision, a critical one for our purposes, provides:

"If the court rejects the plea agreement, the court shall
. . . advise the defendant personally . . . that the court is
not bound by the plea agreement, afford the defendant
the opportunity to then withdraw the plea, and advise
the defendant that if the defendant persists in a guilty
plea . . . the disposition of the case may be less favorable
to the defendant than that contemplated by the plea
agreement." Rule 11(e)(4) (emphasis added).

2 Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a district court is required to defer
its decision about whether to accept a type A or type C agreement until
after it has reviewed the presentence report, unless the court believes
that a presentence report is not required. United States Sentencing
Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 6B1.1(c) (Nov. 1995) (USSG).

676 UNITED STATES v. HYDE

Opinion of the Court
Thus, if the court rejects the agreement, the defendant can"then" withdraw his plea for any reason and does not have to

comply with Rule 32(e)'s "fair and just reason" requirement.This provision implements the commonsense notion that a
defendant can no longer be bound by an agreement that thecourt has refused to sanction.

Under the Court of Appeals' holding, however, the defend-ant can withdraw his plea "for any reason or for no reason"
even if the district court does not reject the plea agreement,but merely defers decision on it. Thus, for the Court of Appeals, the rejection of the plea agreement has no significance:Before rejection, the defendant is free to withdraw his plea;
after rejection, the same is true. But the text of Rule11(e)(4) gives the rejection of the agreement a great deal
of significance. Only "then" is the defendant granted "theopportunity" to withdraw his plea. The necessary implication of this provision is that if the court has neither rejectednor accepted the agreement, the defendant is not granted
"the opportunity to then withdraw" his plea. The Court ofAppeals' holding contradicts this implication, and thus strips
subdivision (e)(4) of any meaning.Not only is the Court of Appeals' holding contradicted by
the very language of the Rules, it also debases the judicialproceeding at which a defendant pleads and the court accepts
his plea. After the defendant has sworn in open court thathe actually committed the crimes, after he has stated that
he is pleading guilty because he is guilty, after the court hasfound a factual basis for the plea, and after the court has
explicitly announced that it accepts the plea, the Court ofAppeals would allow the defendant to withdraw his guilty
plea simply on a lark. The Advisory Committee, in addingthe "fair and just reason" standard to Rule 32(e) in 1983,
explained why this cannot be so:

"Given the great care with which pleas are taken under[the] revised Rule 11, there is no reason to view pleas so

taken as merely `tentative,' subject to withdrawal be520US3 Unit: $U57 [09-11-99 17:02:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
fore sentence whenever the government cannot estab-lish prejudice. `Were withdrawal automatic in every

case where the defendant decided to alter his tactics andpresent his theory of the case to the jury, the guilty plea
would become a mere gesture, a temporary and mean-ingless formality reversible at the defendant's whim.
In fact, however, a guilty plea is no such trifle, but a"grave and solemn act," which is "accepted only with
care and discernment." ' " Advisory Committee's Noteson Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 794
(quoting United States v. Barker, 514 F. 2d 208, 221(CADC 1975), in turn quoting

Brady v. United States,397 U. S. 742, 748 (1970)).

We think the Court of Appeals' holding would degrade theotherwise serious act of pleading guilty into something akin
to a move in a game of chess.The basis for the Court of Appeals' decision was its prior
statement in Cordova-Perez that "[t]he plea agreement andthe [guilty] plea are inextricably bound up together." 65
F. 3d, at 1556 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thisstatement, on its own, is not necessarily incorrect. The
guilty plea and the plea agreement are "bound up together"in the sense that a rejection of the agreement simultaneously
frees the defendant from his commitment to plead guilty.See Rule 11(e)(4). And since the guilty plea is but one side
of the plea agreement, the plea is obviously not wholly inde-pendent of the agreement.

But the Rules nowhere state that the guilty plea and theplea agreement must be treated identically. Instead, they
explicitly envision a situation in which the defendant per-forms his side of the bargain (the guilty plea) before the Government is required to perform its side (here, the motion todismiss four counts). If the court accepts the agreement
and thus the Government's promised performance, then thecontemplated agreement is complete and the defendant gets
the benefit of his bargain. But if the court rejects the Gov520US3 Unit: $U57 [09-11-99 17:02:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ernment's promised performance, then the agreement is ter-minated and the defendant has the right to back out of his

promised performance (the guilty plea), just as a bindingcontractual duty may be extinguished by the nonoccurrence
of a condition subsequent. See J. Calamari & J. Perillo, Law
of Contracts $ 11-7, p. 441 (3d ed. 1987); 3A A. Corbin, Corbinon Contracts $ 628, p. 17 (1960).

If the Court of Appeals' holding were correct, it wouldalso be difficult to see what purpose Rule 32(e) would serve.

Since 1983, that Rule has provided: "If a motion to withdrawa plea of guilty . . . is made before sentence is imposed, the
court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendantshows any fair and just reason." Under the Court of Appeals' holding, the "fair and just reason" standard would onlybe applicable between the time that the plea agreement is
accepted and the sentence is imposed. Since the decision
whether to accept the plea agreement will often be deferred
until the sentencing hearing, see Rule 11(e)(2); USSG

$ 6B1.1(c), at which time the presentence report will have
been submitted to the parties, objected to, revised, and filed
with the court, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(b)(6), the decision whether to accept the plea agreement will often be
made at the same time that the defendant is sentenced.
This leaves little, if any, time in which the "fair and just

3 Respondent argues that it is unfair to bind the defendant to the terms
of the plea agreement before the Government is so bound. He therefore
argues that, as a policy matter, an interpretation of the Rules that results
in such a differential treatment should be rejected. Even if respondent were correct in arguing that the defendant is bound before the Government is bound (a point we do not decide), the fact remains that our

task here is not to act as policymaker, deciding how to make the Rules as
fair as possible, but rather to determine what the Rules actually provide.
Cf. Carlisle v. United States, 517 U. S. 416, 444-445 (1996) (district court
may not use "inherent supervisory power" to correct perceived unfairness
in application of Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29(a)'s 7-day time limit for filing
motions for judgment of acquittal, if use of the power would "circumvent
or conflict with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure").

Opinion of the Court
reason" standard would actually apply. We see no indica-tion in the Rules to suggest that Rule 32(e) can be eviscerated in this manner, and the Court of Appeals did not pointto one.

Respondent defends this cramped understanding of Rule
32(e) by arguing that the "fair and just reason" standard wasmeant to apply only to "fully accepted" guilty pleas, as opposed to "conditionally accepted" pleas--i. e., pleas that areaccepted but later withdrawn under Rule 11(e)(4) if the plea
agreement is rejected. He points out that the "fair and justreason" standard was derived from dictum in our pre-Rules
opinion in Kercheval v. United States, 274 U. S. 220, 224
(1927), see Advisory Committee's Notes on Rule 32, 18
U. S. C. App., p. 794, and that Kercheval spoke of a guilty
plea as a final, not a conditional, act, see 274 U. S., at 223
("A plea of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere
admission or an extra-judicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is
not required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment
and sentence"). He then argues that since the Rule 32(e)
standard was derived from Kercheval, the Rule must also
have incorporated the Kercheval view that a guilty plea is
a final, unconditional act. Thus, since his guilty plea was
conditioned on the District Court accepting the plea agreement, the Rule simply does not apply.

We reject this somewhat tortuous argument. When the
"fair and just reason" standard was added in 1983, the Rules
already provided that the district court could defer decision
on whether to accept the plea agreement, that it could then
reject the agreement, and that the defendant would then be
able to withdraw his guilty plea. Guilty pleas made pursuant to plea agreements were thus already subject to this sort
of condition subsequent. Yet neither the new Rule 32(e) nor
the Advisory Committee's Notes accompanying it attempted
to draw a distinction between "fully accepted" and "conditionally accepted" guilty pleas. Instead, the Rule simply

520US3 Unit: $U57 [09-11-99 17:02:26] PAGES PGT: OPIN
680 UNITED STATES v. HYDE

Opinion of the Court
says that the standard applies to motions to withdraw aguilty plea "made before sentence is imposed." Respondent's speculation that the Advisory Committee, this Court,and Congress had the Kercheval view of a guilty plea in mind
when Rule 32(e) was amended in 1983 is thus contradictedby the Rules themselves.

Respondent's only other substantial argument in defenseof the Court of Appeals' holding relies on an interpretation
of the Advisory Committee's Notes to Rule 32(b)(3). ThatRule, concerning presentence reports, provides: "The report
must not be submitted to the court or its contents disclosedto anyone unless the defendant has consented in writing, has
pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found guilty."This Rule obviously does not deal at all with motions to
withdraw guilty pleas, and any comments in the AdvisoryCommittee's Notes to this Rule dealing with plea withdrawal
could not alter the meaning of Rules 11 and 32(e) as we haveconstrued them.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore

Reversed.

CLINTON v. JONES
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 95-1853. Argued January 13, 1997--Decided May 27, 1997
Respondent sued under 42 U. S. C. $$ 1983 and 1985 and Arkansas law to

recover damages from petitioner, the current President of the United
States, alleging, inter alia, that while he was Governor of Arkansas,
petitioner made "abhorrent" sexual advances to her, and that her rejection of those advances led to punishment by her supervisors in the state
job she held at the time. Petitioner promptly advised the Federal
District Court that he would file a motion to dismiss on Presidential
immunity grounds, and requested that all other pleadings and motions
be deferred until the immunity issue was resolved. After the court
granted that request, petitioner filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice and to toll any applicable statutes of limitation during his Presidency. The District Judge denied dismissal on immunity grounds and
ruled that discovery could go forward, but ordered any trial stayed until
petitioner's Presidency ended. The Eighth Circuit affirmed the dismissal denial, but reversed the trial postponement as the "functional
equivalent" of a grant of temporary immunity to which petitioner was
not constitutionally entitled. The court explained that the President,
like other officials, is subject to the same laws that apply to all citizens,
that no case had been found in which an official was granted immunity
from suit for his unofficial acts, and that the rationale for official immunity is inapposite where only personal, private conduct by a President
is at issue. The court also rejected the argument that, unless immunity
is available, the threat of judicial interference with the Executive
Branch would violate separation of powers.

Held:

1. This Court need not address two important constitutional issues
not encompassed within the questions presented by the certiorari
petition: (1) whether a claim comparable to petitioner's assertion of
immunity might succeed in a state tribunal, and (2) whether a court
may compel the President's attendance at any specific time or place.
Pp. 689-692.

2. Deferral of this litigation until petitioner's Presidency ends is not
constitutionally required. Pp. 692-710.

(a) Petitioner's principal submission--that in all but the most exceptional cases, the Constitution affords the President temporary immu520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
682 CLINTON v. JONES

Syllabus
nity from civil damages litigation arising out of events that occurred
before he took office--cannot be sustained on the basis of precedent.
The principal rationale for affording Presidents immunity from damages
actions based on their official acts--i. e., to enable them to perform their
designated functions effectively without fear that a particular decision
may give rise to personal liability, see, e. g., Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457
U. S. 731, 749, 752, and n. 32--provides no support for an immunity
for unofficial conduct. Moreover, immunities for acts clearly within
official capacity are grounded in the nature of the function performed,
not the identity of the actor who performed it. Forrester v. White, 484
U. S. 219, 229. The Court is also unpersuaded by petitioner's historical
evidence, which sheds little light on the question at issue, and is largely
canceled by conflicting evidence that is itself consistent with both the
doctrine of Presidential immunity as set forth in Fitzgerald, and rejection of the immunity claim in this case. Pp. 692-697.

(b) The separation-of-powers doctrine does not require federal
courts to stay all private actions against the President until he leaves
office. Even accepting the unique importance of the Presidency in the
constitutional scheme, it does not follow that that doctrine would be
violated by allowing this action to proceed. The doctrine provides a
self-executing safeguard against the encroachment or aggrandizement
of one of the three coequal branches of Government at the expense of
another. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 122. But in this case there is
no suggestion that the Federal Judiciary is being asked to perform any
function that might in some way be described as "executive." Respondent is merely asking the courts to exercise their core Article III jurisdiction to decide cases and controversies, and, whatever the outcome, there
is no possibility that the decision here will curtail the scope of the Executive Branch's official powers. The Court rejects petitioner's contention that this case--as well as the potential additional litigation that an
affirmance of the Eighth Circuit's judgment might spawn--may place
unacceptable burdens on the President that will hamper the performance of his official duties. That assertion finds little support either in
history, as evidenced by the paucity of suits against sitting Presidents
for their private actions, or in the relatively narrow compass of the
issues raised in this particular case. Of greater significance, it is settled
that the Judiciary may severely burden the Executive Branch by reviewing the legality of the President's official conduct, see, e. g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, and may direct appropriate process to the President himself, see, e. g., United States v.
Nixon, 418 U. S. 683. It must follow that the federal courts have power
to determine the legality of the President's unofficial conduct. The rea520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

sons for rejecting a categorical rule requiring federal courts to stay
private actions during the President's term apply as well to a rule that
would, in petitioner's words, require a stay "in all but the most exceptional cases." Pp. 697-706.

(c) Contrary to the Eighth Circuit's ruling, the District Court's stay
order was not the "functional equivalent" of an unconstitutional grant
of temporary immunity. Rather, the District Court has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to control its own
docket. See, e. g., Landis v. North American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254.
Moreover, the potential burdens on the President posed by this litigation are appropriate matters for that court to evaluate in its management of the case, and the high respect owed the Presidency is a matter
that should inform the conduct of the entire proceeding. Nevertheless,
the District Court's stay decision was an abuse of discretion because it
took no account of the importance of respondent's interest in bringing
the case to trial, and because it was premature in that there was nothing
in the record to enable a judge to assess whether postponement of trial
after the completion of discovery would be warranted. Pp. 706-708.

(d) The Court is not persuaded of the seriousness of the alleged
risks that this decision will generate a large volume of politically
motivated harassing and frivolous litigation and that national security
concerns might prevent the President from explaining a legitimate need
for a continuance, and has confidence in the ability of federal judges to
deal with both concerns. If Congress deems it appropriate to afford
the President stronger protection, it may respond with legislation.

Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case raises a constitutional and a prudential question
concerning the Office of the President of the United States.
Respondent, a private citizen, seeks to recover damages from
the current occupant of that office based on actions allegedly
taken before his term began. The President submits that in
all but the most exceptional cases the Constitution requires
federal courts to defer such litigation until his term ends and
that, in any event, respect for the office warrants such a stay.
Despite the force of the arguments supporting the President's submissions, we conclude that they must be rejected.

Presidency in 1992, and reelected in 1996. His term of office

complaint alleges two federal claims, and two state-law
claims over which the federal court has jurisdiction because
of the diverse citizenship of the parties.1 As the case comes
to us, we are required to assume the truth of the detailed--
but as yet untested--factual allegations in the complaint.

Those allegations principally describe events that are said
to have occurred on the afternoon of May 8, 1991, during an
official conference held at the Excelsior Hotel in Little Rock,
Arkansas. The Governor delivered a speech at the conference; respondent--working as a state employee--staffed the
registration desk. She alleges that Ferguson persuaded her
to leave her desk and to visit the Governor in a business
suite at the hotel, where he made "abhorrent" 2 sexual advances that she vehemently rejected. She further claims
that her superiors at work subsequently dealt with her in a
hostile and rude manner, and changed her duties to punish
her for rejecting those advances. Finally, she alleges that
after petitioner was elected President, Ferguson defamed
her by making a statement to a reporter that implied she
had accepted petitioner's alleged overtures, and that various
persons authorized to speak for the President publicly
branded her a liar by denying that the incident had occurred.

Respondent seeks actual damages of $75,000 and punitive
damages of $100,000. Her complaint contains four counts.
The first charges that petitioner, acting under color of state
law, deprived her of rights protected by the Constitution, in
violation of Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. The second
charges that petitioner and Ferguson engaged in a conspiracy to violate her federal rights, also actionable under federal law. See Rev. Stat. $ 1980, 42 U. S. C. $ 1985. The
third is a state common-law claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress, grounded primarily on the incident at the

hotel. The fourth count, also based on state law, is for defa-mation, embracing both the comments allegedly made to the

press by Ferguson and the statements of petitioner's agents.Inasmuch as the legal sufficiency of the claims has not yet
been challenged, we assume, without deciding, that each ofthe four counts states a cause of action as a matter of law.
With the exception of the last charge, which arguably mayinvolve conduct within the outer perimeter of the President's
official responsibilities, it is perfectly clear that the allegedmisconduct of petitioner was unrelated to any of his official
duties as President of the United States and, indeed, oc-curred before he was elected to that office.

In response to the complaint, petitioner promptly advisedthe District Court that he intended to file a motion to dismiss

on grounds of Presidential immunity, and requested the courtto defer all other pleadings and motions until after the immunity issue was resolved.4 Relying on our cases holding thatimmunity questions should be decided at the earliest possible
stage of the litigation, 858 F. Supp. 902, 905 (ED Ark. 1994),our recognition of the " `singular importance of the President's duties,' " id., at 904 (quoting Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457U. S. 731, 751 (1982)), and the fact that the question did not
require any analysis of the allegations of the complaint, 858F. Supp., at 905, the court granted the request. Petitioner
thereupon filed a motion "to dismiss . . . without prejudiceand to toll any statutes of limitation [that may be applicable]
until he is no longer President, at which time the plaintiff

1359, n. 7 (CA8 1996), we do not address the question whether the President's immunity from damages liability for acts taken within the "outer
perimeter" of his official responsibilities provides a defense to the fourth
count of the complaint. See Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731, 756 (1982).

parties and the Department of Justice.5The District Judge denied the motion to dismiss on immunity grounds and ruled that discovery in the case could goforward, but ordered any trial stayed until the end of petitioner's Presidency. 869 F. Supp. 690 (ED Ark. 1994). Al-though she recognized that a "thin majority" in

Nixon v.Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731 (1982), had held that "the President

has absolute immunity from civil damage actions arising outof the execution of official duties of office," she was not convinced that "a President has absolute immunity from civilcauses of action arising prior to assuming the office."

6 She

was, however, persuaded by some of the reasoning in ouropinion in Fitzgerald that deferring the trial if one were

required would be appropriate.7 869 F. Supp., at 699-700.Relying in part on the fact that respondent had failed to
bring her complaint until two days before the 3-year periodof limitations expired, she concluded that the public interest
in avoiding litigation that might hamper the President inconducting the duties of his office outweighed any demonstrated need for an immediate trial. Id., at 698-699.Both parties appealed. A divided panel of the Court of
Appeals affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss, butbecause it regarded the order postponing the trial until the

government, which asserts as did the English in the Magna Carta and
the Petition of Right, that even the sovereign is subject to God and the
law." Ibid.

discovery to go forward, the court later stayed discovery pending the outcome of the appeals on the immunity issue. 879 F. Supp. 86 (ED Ark.

Opinion of the Court
President leaves office as the "functional equivalent" of a
grant of temporary immunity, it reversed that order. 72 F.
3d 1354, 1361, n. 9, 1363 (CA8 1996). Writing for the majority, Judge Bowman explained that "the President, like all
other government officials, is subject to the same laws that
apply to all other members of our society," id., at 1358, that
he could find no "case in which any public official ever has
been granted any immunity from suit for his unofficial acts,"
ibid., and that the rationale for official immunity "is inapposite where only personal, private conduct by a President is
at issue," id., at 1360. The majority specifically rejected the
argument that, unless immunity is available, the threat of
judicial interference with the Executive Branch through
scheduling orders, potential contempt citations, and sanctions would violate separation-of-powers principles. Judge
Bowman suggested that "judicial case management sensitive
to the burdens of the presidency and the demands of the
President's schedule" would avoid the perceived danger.
Id., at 1361.

In dissent, Judge Ross submitted that even though the
holding in Fitzgerald involved official acts, the logic of the
opinion, which "placed primary reliance on the prospect that
the President's discharge of his constitutional powers and
duties would be impaired if he were subject to suits for
damages," applies with equal force to this case. 72 F. 3d,
at 1367. In his view, "unless exigent circumstances can be
shown," all private actions for damages against a sitting
President must be stayed until the completion of his term.
Ibid. In this case, Judge Ross saw no reason why the stay
would prevent respondent from ultimately obtaining an adjudication of her claims.

In response to the dissent, Judge Beam wrote a separate
concurrence. He suggested that a prolonged delay may well
create a significant risk of irreparable harm to respondent
because of an unforeseeable loss of evidence or the possible

death of a party. Id., at 1363-1364. Moreover, he arguedthat in civil rights cases brought under $ 1983 there is a "public interest in an ordinary citizen's timely vindication of . . .
her most fundamental right against alleged abuse of power
by government officials." Id., at 1365. In his view, the dissent's concern about judicial interference with the functioning of the Presidency was "greatly overstated." Ibid. Neither the involvement of prior Presidents in litigation, either
as parties or as witnesses, nor the character of this "relatively uncomplicated civil litigation," indicated that the
threat was serious. Id., at 1365-1366. Finally, he saw "no
basis for staying discovery or trial of the claims against
Trooper Ferguson." Id., at 1366.8

The President, represented by private counsel, filed a petition for certiorari. The Acting Solicitor General, representing the United States, supported the petition, arguing that
the decision of the Court of Appeals was "fundamentally mistaken" and created "serious risks for the institution of the
Presidency." 9 In her brief in opposition to certiorari, respondent argued that this "one-of-a-kind case is singularly
inappropriate" for the exercise of our certiorari jurisdiction
because it did not create any conflict among the Courts of
Appeals, it "does not pose any conceivable threat to the functioning of the Executive Branch," and there is no precedent
supporting the President's position.10

While our decision to grant the petition, 518 U. S. 1016
(1996), expressed no judgment concerning the merits of the
case, it does reflect our appraisal of its importance. The

Opinion of the Court
representations made on behalf of the Executive Branch
as to the potential impact of the precedent established by
the Court of Appeals merit our respectful and deliberate
consideration.

It is true that we have often stressed the importance of
avoiding the premature adjudication of constitutional questions.11 That doctrine of avoidance, however, is applicable
to the entire Federal Judiciary, not just to this Court, cf. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, ante, p. 43, and comes
into play after the court has acquired jurisdiction of a case.
It does not dictate a discretionary denial of every certiorari
petition raising a novel constitutional question. It does,
however, make it appropriate to identify two important constitutional issues not encompassed within the questions presented by the petition for certiorari that we need not address
today.12

11 As we have explained: " `If there is one doctrine more deeply rooted
than any other in the process of constitutional adjudication, it is that
we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality . . . unless such
adjudication is unavoidable.' Spector Motor Service v. McLaughlin, 323
U. S. 101, 105 [(1944)]. It has long been the Court's `considered practice
not to decide abstract, hypothetical or contingent questions . . . or to decide any constitutional question in advance of the necessity for its decision . . . or to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied . . . or to decide any
constitutional question except with reference to the particular facts to
which it is to be applied . . . .' Alabama State Federation of Labor v.
McAdory, 325 U. S. 450, 461 [(1945)]. `It is not the habit of the court to
decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary
to a decision of the case.' Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 295
[(1905)]." Rescue Army v. Municipal Court of Los Angeles, 331 U. S.
549, 570, n. 34 (1947).

12 The two questions presented in the certiorari petition are:

"1. Whether the litigation of a private civil damages action against an
incumbent President must in all but the most exceptional cases be deferred until the President leaves office"; and "2. Whether a district court,

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

691Cite as: 520 U. S. 681 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
First, because the claim of immunity is asserted in a fed-eral court and relies heavily on the doctrine of separation

of powers that restrains each of the three branches of theFederal Government from encroaching on the domain of
the other two, see, e. g., Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 122
(1976) (per curiam), it is not necessary to consider or decide
whether a comparable claim might succeed in a state tribunal. If this case were being heard in a state forum, instead
of advancing a separation-of-powers argument, petitioner
would presumably rely on federalism and comity concerns,13
as well as the interest in protecting federal officials from
possible local prejudice that underlies the authority to remove certain cases brought against federal officers from a
state to a federal court, see 28 U. S. C. $ 1442(a); Mesa v.
California, 489 U. S. 121, 125-126 (1989). Whether those
concerns would present a more compelling case for immunity
is a question that is not before us.

Second, our decision rejecting the immunity claim and
allowing the case to proceed does not require us to confront
the question whether a court may compel the attendance of
the President at any specific time or place. We assume that
the testimony of the President, both for discovery and for
use at trial, may be taken at the White House at a time that

as a proper exercise of judicial discretion, may stay such litigation until
the President leaves office." Our review is confined to these issues. See
this Court's Rule 14.1(a).

13 Because the Supremacy Clause makes federal law "the supreme Law

of the Land," Art. VI, cl. 2, any direct control by a state court over the
President, who has principal responsibility to ensure that those laws are
"faithfully executed," Art. II, $ 3, may implicate concerns that are quite
different from the interbranch separation-of-powers questions addressed
here. Cf., e. g., Hancock v. Train, 426 U. S. 167, 178-179 (1976); Mayo v.
United States, 319 U. S. 441, 445 (1943). See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 513 (2d ed. 1988) ("[A]bsent explicit congressional consent no
state may command federal officials . . . to take action in derogation of
their . . . federal responsibilities").

Opinion of the Court
will accommodate his busy schedule, and that, if a trial isheld, there would be no necessity for the President to attend

in person, though he could elect to do so.14

IV
Petitioner's principal submission--that "in all but the most
exceptional cases," Brief for Petitioner i, the Constitutionaffords the President temporary immunity from civil damages litigation arising out of events that occurred before hetook office--cannot be sustained on the basis of precedent.

Only three sitting Presidents have been defendants in civil
litigation involving their actions prior to taking office.Complaints against Theodore Roosevelt and Harry Truman

had been dismissed before they took office; the dismissalswere affirmed after their respective inaugurations.

15 Two

companion cases arising out of an automobile accident werefiled against John F. Kennedy in 1960 during the Presidential

campaign.16 After taking office, he unsuccessfully arguedthat his status as Commander in Chief gave him a right to a
stay under the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940,50 U. S. C. App. $$ 501-525. The motion for a stay was denied by the District Court, and the matter was settled out
of court.17 Thus, none of those cases sheds any light on theconstitutional issue before us.

The principal rationale for affording certain public servants immunity from suits for money damages arising out of

14 Although Presidents have responded to written interrogatories, given
depositions, and provided videotaped trial testimony, see infra, at 704-
705, no sitting President has ever testified, or been ordered to testify, in
open court.

Opinion of the Court
their official acts is inapplicable to unofficial conduct. In
cases involving prosecutors, legislators, and judges we have
repeatedly explained that the immunity serves the public interest in enabling such officials to perform their designated
functions effectively without fear that a particular decision
may give rise to personal liability.18 We explained in Ferri
v. Ackerman, 444 U. S. 193 (1979):

"As public servants, the prosecutor and the judge represent the interest of society as a whole. The conduct of
their official duties may adversely affect a wide variety
of different individuals, each of whom may be a potential
source of future controversy. The societal interest in
providing such public officials with the maximum ability
to deal fearlessly and impartially with the public at large
has long been recognized as an acceptable justification
for official immunity. The point of immunity for such
officials is to forestall an atmosphere of intimidation
that would conflict with their resolve to perform their
designated functions in a principled fashion." Id., at
202-204.

That rationale provided the principal basis for our holding
that a former President of the United States was "entitled
to absolute immunity from damages liability predicated on
his official acts," Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 749. See id., at
752 (citing Ferri v. Ackerman). Our central concern was to

18 Some of these cases defined the immunities of state and local officials
in actions filed under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983. See, e. g., Imbler v. Pachtman,
424 U. S. 409, 422-423 (1976) (prosecutorial immunity); Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 376-377 (1951) (legislative immunity); Pierson v. Ray,
386 U. S. 547, 554-555 (1967) (judicial immunity). The rationale underlying our official immunity jurisprudence in cases alleging constitutional
violations brought against federal officials is similar. See, e. g., Butz v.
Economou, 438 U. S. 478, 500-501 (1978).

Opinion of the Court
avoid rendering the President "unduly cautious in the dis-charge of his official duties." 457 U. S., at 752, n. 32.

19

This reasoning provides no support for an immunity forunofficial conduct. As we explained in Fitzgerald, "the

sphere of protected action must be related closely to the im-munity's justifying purposes."

Id., at 755. Because of thePresident's broad responsibilities, we recognized in that case

an immunity from damages claims arising out of official actsextending to the "outer perimeter of his authority." Id., at
757. But we have never suggested that the President, orany other official, has an immunity that extends beyond the
scope of any action taken in an official capacity. See id., at759 (Burger, C. J., concurring) (noting that "a President, like
Members of Congress, judges, prosecutors, or congressionalaides--all having absolute immunity--are not immune for
acts outside official duties"); see also id., at 761, n. 4.Moreover, when defining the scope of an immunity for acts
clearly taken within an official capacity, we have applied afunctional approach. "Frequently our decisions have held
that an official's absolute immunity should extend only toacts in performance of particular functions of his office."
Id., at 755. Hence, for example, a judge's absolute immunitydoes not extend to actions performed in a purely administra19 Petitioner draws our attention to dicta in Fitzgerald, which he suggests are helpful to his cause. We noted there that "[b]ecause of the singular importance of the President's duties, diversion of his energies by
concern with private lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective
functioning of government," 457 U. S., at 751, and suggested further that
"[c]ognizance of . . . personal vulnerability frequently could distract a President from his public duties," id., at 753. Petitioner argues that in this
aspect the Court's concern was parallel to the issue he suggests is of great
importance in this case, the possibility that a sitting President might be
distracted by the need to participate in litigation during the pendency of
his office. In context, however, it is clear that our dominant concern was
with the diversion of the President's attention during the decisionmaking
process caused by needless worry as to the possibility of damages actions
stemming from any particular official decision. Moreover, Fitzgerald did
not present the issue raised in this case because that decision involved
claims against a former President.

tive capacity. See Forrester v. White, 484 U. S. 219, 229-230(1988). As our opinions have made clear, immunities are

grounded in "the nature of the function performed, not theidentity of the actor who performed it." Id., at 229.

Petitioner's effort to construct an immunity from suit forunofficial acts grounded purely in the identity of his office is
unsupported by precedent. V

We are also unpersuaded by the evidence from the histori-cal record to which petitioner has called our attention. He
points to a comment by Thomas Jefferson protesting the sub-poena

duces tecum Chief Justice Marshall directed to him inthe Burr trial,

20 a statement in the diaries kept by Senator

William Maclay of the first Senate debates, in which then-Vice President John Adams and Senator Oliver Ellsworth

are recorded as having said that "the President personally[is] not . . . subject to any process whatever," lest it be "put
. . . in the power of a common Justice to exercise any Author-ity over him and Stop the Whole Machine of Government,"

21

and to a quotation from Justice Story's Commentaries on theConstitution.

22 None of these sources sheds much light on

the question at hand.23

20 In Jefferson's view, the subpoena jeopardized the separation of powers
by subjecting the Executive Branch to judicial command. See 10 Works
of Thomas Jefferson 404, n. (P. Ford ed. 1905); Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751,

$ 1563, pp. 418-419 (1833).

23 Jefferson's argument provides little support for petitioner's position.

As we explain later, the prerogative Jefferson claimed was denied him by
the Chief Justice in the very decision Jefferson was protesting, and this
Court has subsequently reaffirmed that holding. See United States v.
Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974). The statements supporting a similar proposition recorded in Senator Maclay's diary are inconclusive of the issue before
us here for the same reason. In addition, this material is hardly proof
of the unequivocal common understanding at the time of the founding.
Immediately after mentioning the positions of Adams and Ellsworth,

Opinion of the Court
Respondent, in turn, has called our attention to conflictinghistorical evidence. Speaking in favor of the Constitution's

adoption at the Pennsylvania Convention, James Wilson--who had participated in the Philadelphia Convention at
which the document was drafted--explained that, althoughthe President "is placed [on] high," "not a single privilege is
annexed to his character; far from being above the laws, heis amenable to them in his private character as a citizen, and
in his public character by impeachment." 2 J. Elliot, De-bates on the Federal Constitution 480 (2d ed. 1863) (emphasis
deleted). This description is consistent with both the doc-trine of Presidential immunity as set forth in

Fitzgerald andrejection of the immunity claim in this case. With respect

to acts taken in his "public character"--that is, official acts--the President may be disciplined principally by impeachment, not by private lawsuits for damages. But he is other-wise subject to the laws for his purely private acts.

In the end, as applied to the particular question before us,we reach the same conclusion about these historical materials that Justice Jackson described when confronted with anissue concerning the dimensions of the President's power.

Maclay went on to point out in his diary that he virulently disagreed with
them, concluding that his opponents' view "[s]hows clearly how amazingly
fond of the old leven many People are." Diary of Maclay 168.

Finally, Justice Story's comments in his constitutional law treatise provide no substantial support for petitioner's position. Story wrote that
because the President's "incidental powers" must include "the power to
perform [his duties], without any obstruction," he "cannot, therefore, be
liable to arrest, imprisonment, or detention, while he is in the discharge
of the duties of his office; and for this purpose his person must be deemed,
in civil cases at least, to possess an official inviolability." 3 Story $ 1563,
at 418-419 (emphasis added). Story said only that "an official inviolability," ibid. (emphasis added), was necessary to preserve the President's
ability to perform the functions of the office; he did not specify the dimensions of the necessary immunity. While we have held that an immunity
from suits grounded on official acts is necessary to serve this purpose, see
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 749, it does not follow that the broad immunity
from all civil damages suits that petitioner seeks is also necessary.

VI
Petitioner's strongest argument supporting his immunityclaim is based on the text and structure of the Constitution.

He does not contend that the occupant of the Office of thePresident is "above the law," in the sense that his conduct
is entirely immune from judicial scrutiny.24 The Presidentargues merely for a postponement of the judicial proceedings
that will determine whether he violated any law. His argu-ment is grounded in the character of the office that was
created by Article II of the Constitution, and relies onseparation-of-powers principles that have structured our
constitutional arrangement since the founding.As a starting premise, petitioner contends that he occupies
a unique office with powers and responsibilities so vast andimportant that the public interest demands that he devote
his undivided time and attention to his public duties. Hesubmits that--given the nature of the office--the doctrine of
separation of powers places limits on the authority of the

24 For that reason, the argument does not place any reliance on the English ancestry that informs our common-law jurisprudence; he does not
claim the prerogatives of the monarchs who asserted that "[t]he King can
do no wrong." See 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *246. Although we
have adopted the related doctrine of sovereign immunity, the common-law
fiction that "[t]he king . . . is not only incapable of doing wrong, but even
of thinking wrong," ibid., was rejected at the birth of the Republic. See,
e. g., Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415, and nn. 7-8 (1979); Langford v.
United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880).

Opinion of the Court
Federal Judiciary to interfere with the Executive Branch
that would be transgressed by allowing this action to
proceed.

We have no dispute with the initial premise of the argument. Former Presidents, from George Washington to
George Bush, have consistently endorsed petitioner's characterization of the office.25 After serving his term, Lyndon
Johnson observed: "Of all the 1,886 nights I was President,
there were not many when I got to sleep before 1 or 2 a.m.,
and there were few mornings when I didn't wake up by 6 or
6:30." 26 In 1967, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the Constitution was adopted to ensure continuity in the performance of the powers and duties of the office; 27 one of the
sponsors of that Amendment stressed the importance of providing that "at all times" there be a President "who has complete control and will be able to perform" those duties.28 As

executive authority "in a single head in whose choice the

Opinion of the Court
457 U. S., at 749.29 Thus, while we suspect that even in our
modern era there remains some truth to Chief Justice Marshall's suggestion that the duties of the Presidency are not
entirely "unremitting," United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30,
34 (No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807), we accept the initial premise
of the Executive's argument.

It does not follow, however, that separation-of-powers
principles would be violated by allowing this action to proceed. The doctrine of separation of powers is concerned
with the allocation of official power among the three coequal
branches of our Government. The Framers "built into the
tripartite Federal Government . . . a self-executing safeguard
against the encroachment or aggrandizement of one branch
at the expense of the other." Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at
122.30 Thus, for example, the Congress may not exercise the
judicial power to revise final judgments, Plaut v. Spendthrift

29 We noted in Fitzgerald: "Article II, $ 1, of the Constitution provides
that `[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United
States . . . .' This grant of authority establishes the President as the chief
constitutional officer of the Executive Branch, entrusted with supervisory
and policy responsibilities of utmost discretion and sensitivity. These include the enforcement of federal law--it is the President who is charged
constitutionally to `take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed'; the
conduct of foreign affairs--a realm in which the Court has recognized that
`[i]t would be intolerable that courts, without the relevant information,
should review and perhaps nullify actions of the Executive taken on information properly held secret'; and management of the Executive Branch--
a task for which `imperative reasons requir[e] an unrestricted power [in
the President] to remove the most important of his subordinates in their
most important duties.' " 457 U. S., at 749-750 (footnotes omitted).

Opinion of the Court
Of course the lines between the powers of the threebranches are not always neatly defined. See Mistretta v.

United States, 488 U. S. 361, 380-381 (1989).35 But in thiscase there is no suggestion that the Federal Judiciary is
being asked to perform any function that might in some waybe described as "executive." Respondent is merely asking
the courts to exercise their core Article III jurisdiction todecide cases and controversies. Whatever the outcome of
this case, there is no possibility that the decision will curtailthe scope of the official powers of the Executive Branch.
The litigation of questions that relate entirely to the unoffi-cial conduct of the individual who happens to be the President poses no perceptible risk of misallocation of either judi-cial power or executive power.

Rather than arguing that the decision of the case willproduce either an aggrandizement of judicial power or a
narrowing of executive power, petitioner contends that--asa byproduct of an otherwise traditional exercise of judicial
power--burdens will be placed on the President that willhamper the performance of his official duties. We have recognized that "[e]ven when a branch does not arrogate powerto itself . . . the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that
a branch not impair another in the performance of its consti-tutional duties."

Opinion of the Court
additional litigation that an affirmance of the Court of Ap-peals judgment might spawn--may impose an unacceptable

burden on the President's time and energy, and thereby im-pair the effective performance of his office.

Petitioner's predictive judgment finds little support ineither history or the relatively narrow compass of the issues
raised in this particular case. As we have already noted, inthe more than 200-year history of the Republic, only three
sitting Presidents have been subjected to suits for their pri-vate actions.

36 See supra, at 692. If the past is any indicator, it seems unlikely that a deluge of such litigation willever engulf the Presidency. As for the case at hand, if properly managed by the District Court, it appears to us highlyunlikely to occupy any substantial amount of petitioner's
time.

Of greater significance, petitioner errs by presuming that
interactions between the Judicial Branch and the Executive,even quite burdensome interactions, necessarily rise to the

level of constitutionally forbidden impairment of the Execu-tive's ability to perform its constitutionally mandated functions. "[O]ur . . . system imposes upon the Branches a de-gree of overlapping responsibility, a duty of interdependence
as well as independence the absence of which `would preclude the establishment of a Nation capable of governing it-self effectively.' "

Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 381 (quoting Buck36 In Fitzgerald, we were able to discount the lack of historical support
for the proposition that official-capacity actions against the President
posed a serious threat to the office on the ground that a right to sue
federal officials for damages as a result of constitutional violations had
only recently been recognized. See 457 U. S., at 753, n. 33; Bivens v. Six
Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971). The situation with
respect to suits against the President for actions taken in his private capacity is quite different because such suits may be grounded on legal theories that have always been applicable to any potential defendant. Moreover, because the President has contact with far fewer people in his
private life than in his official capacity, the class of potential plaintiffs is
considerably smaller and the risk of litigation less intense.

Opinion of the Court
ley, 424 U. S., at 121). As Madison explained, separation ofpowers does not mean that the branches "ought to have no

partial agency in, or no controul over the acts of eachother."

37 The fact that a federal court's exercise of its traditional Article III jurisdiction may significantly burden thetime and attention of the Chief Executive is not sufficient to

establish a violation of the Constitution. Two long-settledpropositions, first announced by Chief Justice Marshall, support that conclusion.First, we have long held that when the President takes
official action, the Court has the authority to determinewhether he has acted within the law. Perhaps the most dramatic example of such a case is our holding that PresidentTruman exceeded his constitutional authority when he issued an order directing the Secretary of Commerce to takepossession of and operate most of the Nation's steel mills in
order to avert a national catastrophe. Youngstown Sheet &Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952). Despite the serious impact of that decision on the ability of the ExecutiveBranch to accomplish its assigned mission, and the substantial time that the President must necessarily have devotedto the matter as a result of judicial involvement, we exercised our Article III jurisdiction to decide whether his officialconduct conformed to the law. Our holding was an application of the principle established in Marbury v. Madison, 1Cranch 137 (1803), that "[i]t is emphatically the province and
duty of the judicial department to say what the law is." Id.,at 177.

Second, it is also settled that the President is subject tojudicial process in appropriate circumstances. Although
Thomas Jefferson apparently thought otherwise, Chief Jus-tice Marshall, when presiding in the treason trial of Aaron
Burr, ruled that a subpoena duces tecum could be directed

to the President. United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 30(No. 14,692d) (CC Va. 1807).

38 We unequivocally and emphatically endorsed Marshall's position when we held thatPresident Nixon was obligated to comply with a subpoena

commanding him to produce certain tape recordings of his
conversations with his aides. United States v. Nixon, 418U. S. 683 (1974). As we explained, "neither the doctrine of

separation of powers, nor the need for confidentiality ofhigh-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity fromjudicial process under all circumstances."

Id., at 706.39
Sitting Presidents have responded to court orders to pro-vide testimony and other information with sufficient frequency that such interactions between the Judicial and Exec-utive Branches can scarcely be thought a novelty. President
Monroe responded to written interrogatories, see Rotunda,Presidents and Ex-Presidents as Witnesses: A Brief Historical Footnote, 1975 U. Ill. L. Forum 1, 5-6, President Nixon--
as noted above--produced tapes in response to a subpoena

38 After the decision was rendered, Jefferson expressed his distress in a
letter to a prosecutor at the trial, noting that "[t]he Constitution enjoins
[the President's] constant agency in the concerns of 6. millions of people."
10 Works of Thomas Jefferson 404, n. (P. Ford ed. 1905). He asked: "Is
the law paramount to this, which calls on him on behalf of a single one?"
Ibid.; see also Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at 751-752, n. 31 (quoting Jefferson's
comments at length). For Chief Justice Marshall, the answer--quite
plainly--was yes.

39 Of course, it does not follow that a court may " `proceed against the

president as against an ordinary individual,' " United States v. Nixon, 418
U. S., at 715 (quoting United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (No. 14,694)

respect to which "[t]he interest in preserving confidentiality is weighty
indeed and entitled to great respect." 418 U. S., at 712. We have made
clear that in a criminal case the powerful interest in the "fair administration of criminal justice" requires that the evidence be given under appropriate circumstances lest the "very integrity of the judicial system" be
eroded. Id., at 709, 711-712.

trial, United States v. Fromme, 405 F. Supp. 578 (ED Cal.1975), and President Clinton has twice given videotaped
testimony in criminal proceedings, see United States v. McDougal, 934 F. Supp. 296 (ED Ark. 1996); United States v.Branscum, No. LRP-CR-96-49 (ED Ark., June 7, 1996).

Moreover, sitting Presidents have also voluntarily compliedwith judicial requests for testimony. President Grant gave
a lengthy deposition in a criminal case under such circum-stances, 1 R. Rotunda & J. Nowak, Treatise on Constitutional
Law $ 7.1 (2d ed. 1992), and President Carter similarly gavevideotaped testimony for use at a criminal trial,

id., $ 7.1(b)(Supp. 1997).

In sum, "[i]t is settled law that the separation-of-powersdoctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction over the
President of the United States." Fitzgerald, 457 U. S., at753-754. If the Judiciary may severely burden the Executive Branch by reviewing the legality of the President's offi-cial conduct, and if it may direct appropriate process to the
President himself, it must follow that the federal courts havepower to determine the legality of his unofficial conduct.
The burden on the President's time and energy that is a merebyproduct of such review surely cannot be considered as
onerous as the direct burden imposed by judicial review andthe occasional invalidation of his official actions.

40 We therefore hold that the doctrine of separation of powers does not

lawsuit should be "dread[ed] . . . beyond almost anything else short of
sickness and death." 3 Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
Lectures on Legal Topics 105 (1926). We recognize that a President, like
any other official or private citizen, may become distracted or preoccupied
by pending litigation. Presidents and other officials face a variety of
demands on their time, however, some private, some political, and some
as a result of official duty. While such distractions may be vexing to
those subjected to them, they do not ordinarily implicate constitutional
separation-of-powers concerns.

706 CLINTON v. JONES

Opinion of the Court
require federal courts to stay all private actions against thePresident until he leaves office.

The reasons for rejecting such a categorical rule apply aswell to a rule that would require a stay "in all but the most
exceptional cases." Brief for Petitioner i. Indeed, if theFramers of the Constitution had thought it necessary to protect the President from the burdens of private litigation, wethink it far more likely that they would have adopted a categorical rule than a rule that required the President to liti-gate the question whether a specific case belonged in the
"exceptional case" subcategory. In all events, the questionwhether a specific case should receive exceptional treatment
is more appropriately the subject of the exercise of judicialdiscretion than an interpretation of the Constitution. Accordingly, we turn to the question whether the DistrictCourt's decision to stay the trial until after petitioner leaves
office was an abuse of discretion.

VII
The Court of Appeals described the District Court's dis-cretionary decision to stay the trial as the "functional equivalent" of a grant of temporary immunity. 72 F. 3d, at 1361,n. 9. Concluding that petitioner was not constitutionally
entitled to such an immunity, the court held that it was errorto grant the stay. Ibid. Although we ultimately conclude
that the stay should not have been granted, we think theissue is more difficult than the opinion of the Court of Appeals suggests.Strictly speaking the stay was not the functional equivalent of the constitutional immunity that petitioner claimed,because the District Court ordered discovery to proceed.
Moreover, a stay of either the trial or discovery might bejustified by considerations that do not require the recognition of any constitutional immunity. The District Court hasbroad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its
power to control its own docket. See, e. g., Landis v. North

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
American Co., 299 U. S. 248, 254 (1936). As we have ex-plained, "[e]specially in cases of extraordinary public moment, [a plaintiff] may be required to submit to delay notimmoderate in extent and not oppressive in its consequences
if the public welfare or convenience will thereby be pro-moted."

Id., at 256. Although we have rejected the argu-ment that the potential burdens on the President violate

separation-of-powers principles, those burdens are appro-priate matters for the District Court to evaluate in its management of the case. The high respect that is owed to theoffice of the Chief Executive, though not justifying a rule of
categorical immunity, is a matter that should inform the con-duct of the entire proceeding, including the timing and scope
of discovery.41Nevertheless, we are persuaded that it was an abuse of
discretion for the District Court to defer the trial until afterthe President leaves office. Such a lengthy and categorical
stay takes no account whatever of the respondent's interestin bringing the case to trial. The complaint was filed within
the statutory limitations period--albeit near the end of thatperiod--and delaying trial would increase the danger of

41 Although these claims are in fact analytically distinct, the District
Court does not appear to have drawn that distinction. Rather than basing its decision on particular factual findings that might have buttressed
an exercise of discretion, the District Court instead suggested that a discretionary stay was supported by the legal conclusion that such a stay
was required by Fitzgerald. See 869 F. Supp., at 699. We therefore reject petitioner's argument that we lack jurisdiction over respondent's
cross-appeal from the District Court's alternative holding that its decision
was "also permitted," inter alia, "under the equity powers of the Court."
Ibid. The Court of Appeals correctly found that pendent appellate jurisdiction over this issue was proper. See 72 F. 3d, at 1357, n. 4. The District Court's legal ruling that the President was protected by a temporary
immunity from trial--but not discovery--was "inextricably intertwined,"
Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U. S. 35, 51 (1995), with its suggestion that a discretionary stay having the same effect might be proper;
indeed, "review of the [latter] decision [is] necessary to ensure meaningful
review of the [former]," ibid.

Opinion of the Court
prejudice resulting from the loss of evidence, including theinability of witnesses to recall specific facts, or the possible

death of a party.The decision to postpone the trial was, furthermore, premature. The proponent of a stay bears the burden of estab-lishing its need.

Id., at 255. In this case, at the stage atwhich the District Court made its ruling, there was no way

to assess whether a stay of trial after the completion of dis-covery would be warranted. Other than the fact that a trial
may consume some of the President's time and attention,there is nothing in the record to enable a judge to assess
the potential harm that may ensue from scheduling the trialpromptly after discovery is concluded. We think the District Court may have given undue weight to the concern thata trial might generate unrelated civil actions that could conceivably hamper the President in conducting the duties ofhis office. If and when that should occur, the court's discretion would permit it to manage those actions in such fashion(including deferral of trial) that interference with the President's duties would not occur. But no such impingementupon the President's conduct of his office was shown here.

VIII
We add a final comment on two matters that are discussedat length in the briefs: the risk that our decision will generate a large volume of politically motivated harassing andfrivolous litigation, and the danger that national security
concerns might prevent the President from explaining a le-gitimate need for a continuance.

We are not persuaded that either of these risks is serious.Most frivolous and vexatious litigation is terminated at the
pleading stage or on summary judgment, with little if anypersonal involvement by the defendant. See Fed. Rules Civ.
Proc. 12, 56. Moreover, the availability of sanctions pro-vides a significant deterrent to litigation directed at the
President in his unofficial capacity for purposes of political

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
gain or harassment.42 History indicates that the likelihoodthat a significant number of such cases will be filed is remote.

Although scheduling problems may arise, there is no reasonto assume that the district courts will be either unable to
accommodate the President's needs or unfaithful to the tra-dition--especially in matters involving national security--
of giving "the utmost deference to Presidential responsi-bilities."

43 Several Presidents, including petitioner, have

given testimony without jeopardizing the Nation's security.See

supra, at 704-705. In short, we have confidence in theability of our federal judges to deal with both of these

concerns.If Congress deems it appropriate to afford the President
stronger protection, it may respond with appropriate legisla-tion. As petitioner notes in his brief, Congress has enacted
more than one statute providing for the deferral of civillitigation to accommodate important public interests. Brief
for Petitioner 34-36. See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $ 362 (litigationagainst debtor stayed upon filing of bankruptcy petition);
Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940, 50 U. S. C. App.$$ 501-525 (provisions governing,

inter alia, tolling or stayof civil claims by or against military personnel during course

NASCO, Inc., 501 U. S. 32, 50 (1991) (noting that "if in the informed discretion of the court, neither the statute nor the Rules are up to the task,
the court may safely rely on its inherent power" in imposing appropriate
sanctions). Those sanctions may be set at a level "sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated."
Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11(c)(2). As Rule 11 indicates, sanctions may be appropriate where a claim is "presented for any improper purpose, such as
to harass," including any claim based on "allegations and other factual
contentions [lacking] evidentiary support" or unlikely to prove wellgrounded after reasonable investigation. Rules 11(b)(1), (3).

the President advocates, Congress, of course, could not re-peal it. But our holding today raises no barrier to a statutory response to these concerns.The Federal District Court has jurisdiction to decide this
case. Like every other citizen who properly invokes thatjurisdiction, respondent has a right to an orderly disposition
of her claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is affirmed.

It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment.
I agree with the majority that the Constitution does notautomatically grant the President an immunity from civil

lawsuits based upon his private conduct. Nor does the "doc-trine of separation of powers . . . require federal courts to
stay" virtually "all private actions against the Presidentuntil he leaves office."

Ante, at 705-706. Rather, as theCourt of Appeals stated, the President cannot simply rest

upon the claim that a private civil lawsuit for damages will"interfere with the constitutionally assigned duties of the
Executive Branch . . . without detailing any specific responsi-bilities or explaining how or the degree to which they are
affected by the suit." 72 F. 3d 1354, 1361 (CA8 1996). To
obtain a postponement the President must "bea[r] the burdenof establishing its need."

Ante, at 708.
In my view, however, once the President sets forth andexplains a conflict between judicial proceeding and public duties, the matter changes. At that point, the Constitutionpermits a judge to schedule a trial in an ordinary civil damages action (where postponement normally is possible with-out overwhelming damage to a plaintiff) only within the constraints of a constitutional principle--a principle that forbids
a federal judge in such a case to interfere with the Presi-dent's discharge of his public duties. I have no doubt that

the Constitution contains such a principle applicable to civilsuits, based upon Article II's vesting of the entire "executive
Power" in a single individual, implemented through the Con520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stitution's structural separation of powers, and revealed bothby history and case precedent.

I recognize that this case does not require us now to applythe principle specifically, thereby delineating its contours;
nor need we now decide whether lower courts are to applyit directly or categorically through the use of presumptions
or rules of administration. Yet I fear that to disregard itnow may appear to deny it. I also fear that the majority's
description of the relevant precedents de-emphasizes the ex-tent to which they support a principle of the President's independent authority to control his own time and energy, see,
e. g., ante, at 693, 694 (describing the "central concern" of
Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731 (1982), as "to avoid render-ing the President `unduly cautious' "); ante, at 695, 696, and

n. 23 (describing statements by Story, Jefferson, Adams, andEllsworth as providing "little" or "no substantial support"
for the President's position). Further, if the majority iswrong in predicting the future infrequency of private civil
litigation against sitting Presidents, ante, at 702, acknowl-edgment and future delineation of the constitutional principle will prove a practically necessary institutional safeguard.For these reasons, I think it important to explain how the
Constitution's text, history, and precedent support this prin-ciple of judicial noninterference with Presidential functions
in ordinary civil damages actions.

The Constitution states that the "executive Power shallbe vested in a President." Art. II, $ 1. This constitutional

delegation means that a sitting President is unusually busy,that his activities have an unusually important impact upon
the lives of others, and that his conduct embodies an author-ity bestowed by the entire American electorate. He (along
with his constitutionally subordinate Vice President) is theonly official for whom the entire Nation votes, and is the only
elected officer to represent the entire Nation both domesti-cally and abroad.

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
This constitutional delegation means still more. Arti-cle II makes a single President responsible for the actions

of the Executive Branch in much the same way that the en-tire Congress is responsible for the actions of the Legislative Branch, or the entire Judiciary for those of the Judicial Branch. It thereby creates a constitutional equivalencebetween a single President, on the one hand, and many legislators, or judges, on the other.The Founders created this equivalence by consciously deciding to vest Executive authority in one person rather thanseveral. They did so in order to focus, rather than to
spread, Executive responsibility thereby facilitating accountability. They also sought to encourage energetic, vigorous,
decisive, and speedy execution of the laws by placing in the
hands of a single, constitutionally indispensable, individual
the ultimate authority that, in respect to the other branches,
the Constitution divides among many. Compare U. S.
Const., Art. II, $ 1 (vesting power in "a President"), with
U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 1 (vesting power in "a Congress" that
"consist[s] of a Senate and House of Representatives"), and
U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 1 (vesting power in a "supreme
Court" and "inferior Courts").

The authority explaining the nature and importance of this
decision is legion. See, e. g., J. Locke, Second Treatise of
Civil Government $ 144 (J. Gough ed. 1947) (desirability of a
perpetual Executive); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *242-
*243 (need for single Executive); The Federalist No. 70,
p. 423 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (Executive "[e]nergy" needed for security, "steady administration of the
laws," "protection of property," "justice," and protection of
"liberty"); Ellsworth, The Landholder, VI, in Essays on the
Constitution 161, 163 (P. Ford ed. 1892) ("supreme executive
should be one person, and unfettered otherwise than by the
laws he is to execute"); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U. S. 654,
698-699 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (describing history);

policy arguments). See also The Federalist No. 71, at 431(A. Hamilton); P. Kurland, Watergate and the Constitution

135 (1978) (President is "sole indispensable man in govern-ment" and "should not be called" from his duties "at the instance of any other . . . branch of government"); Calabresi,Some Normative Arguments for the Unitary Executive, 48
Ark. L. Rev. 23, 37-47 (1995). Cf. T. Roosevelt, An Auto-biography 372 (1913).

For present purposes, this constitutional structure meansthat the President is not like Congress, for Congress can
function as if it were whole, even when up to half of its mem-bers are absent, see U. S. Const., Art. I, $ 5, cl. 1. It means
that the President is not like the Judiciary, for judges oftencan designate other judges, e. g., from other judicial circuits,
to sit even should an entire court be detained by personallitigation. It means that, unlike Congress, which is regularly out of session, U. S. Const., Art. I, $$ 4, 5, 7, the Presi-dent never adjourns.

More importantly, these constitutional objectives explainwhy a President, though able to delegate duties to others,
cannot delegate ultimate responsibility or the active obliga-tion to supervise that goes with it. And the related constitutional equivalence between President, Congress, and theJudiciary means that judicial scheduling orders in a private
civil case must not only take reasonable account of, say, aparticularly busy schedule, or a job on which others critically
depend, or an underlying electoral mandate. They mustalso reflect the fact that interference with a President's ability to carry out his public responsibilities is constitutionallyequivalent to interference with the ability of the entirety
of Congress, or the Judicial Branch, to carry out its publicobligations.

II
The leading case regarding Presidential immunity fromsuit is

Nixon v. Fitzgerald. Before discussing Fitzgerald, itis helpful to understand the historical precedent on which it

714 CLINTON v. JONES

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
relies. While later events have called into question some ofthe more extreme views on Presidential immunity, the essence of the constitutional principle remains true today.The historical sources, while not in themselves fully determinative, in conjunction with this Court's precedent inform myjudgment that the Constitution protects the President from
judicial orders in private civil cases to the extent that thoseorders could significantly interfere with his efforts to carry
out his ongoing public responsibilities.

A
Three of the historical sources this Court cited in Fitzger-ald, 457 U. S., at 749, 750-752, n. 31--a commentary by

Joseph Story, an argument attributed to John Adams andOliver Ellsworth, and a letter written by Thomas Jefferson--
each make clear that this is so.First, Joseph Story wrote in his Commentaries:

"There are . . . incidental powers, belonging to the exec-utive department, which are necessarily implied from
the nature of the functions, which are confided to it.Among those, must necessarily be included the power to
perform them, without any obstruction or impedimentwhatsoever. The president cannot, therefore, be liable
to arrest, imprisonment, or detention, while he is inthe discharge of the duties of his office;

and for this purpose his person must be deemed, in civil cases at least,to possess an official inviolability." 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States$ 1563, pp. 418-419 (1833) (emphasis added), quoted in
Fitzgerald, supra, at 749.
As interpreted by this Court in Nixon v. Fitzgerald, thewords "for this purpose" would seem to refer to the President's need for "official inviolability" in order to "perform"the duties of his office without "obstruction or impediment."
As so read, Story's commentary does not explicitly define the

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

715Cite as: 520 U. S. 681 (1997)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
contours of "official inviolability." But it does suggest thatthe "inviolability" is timebound ("while . . . in the discharge

of the duties of his office"); that it applies in private lawsuits(for it attaches to the President's "person" in "civil cases");
and that it is functional ("necessarily implied from the nature
of the [President's] functions").Since

Fitzgerald did not involve a physical constraint, the
Court's reliance upon Justice Story's commentary makesclear, in the Court's view, that the commentary does not limit

the scope of "inviolability" to an immunity from a physicalimprisonment, physical detention, or physical "arrest"--a
now abandoned procedure that permitted the arrest of certain civil case defendants (e. g., those threatened by bankruptcy) during a civil proceeding.

I would therefore read Story's commentary to mean what
it says, namely, that Article II implicitly grants an "official
inviolability" to the President "while he is in the discharge
of the duties of his office," and that this inviolability must be
broad enough to permit him "to perform" his official duties
without "obstruction or impediment." As this Court has
previously held, the Constitution may grant this kind of protection implicitly; it need not do so explicitly. See Fitzgerald, supra, at 750, n. 31; United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S.
683, 705-706, n. 16 (1974); cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4
Wheat. 316, 406 (1819).

Second, during the first Congress, then-Vice President
John Adams and then-Senator Oliver Ellsworth expressed a
view of an applicable immunity far broader than any currently asserted. Speaking of a sitting President, they said
that the " `President, personally, was not the subject to any
process whatever . . . . For [that] would . . . put it in the
power of a common justice to exercise any authority over
him and stop the whole machine of Government.' " 457
U. S., at 751, n. 31 (quoting Journal of William Maclay 167
(E. Maclay ed. 1890) (Sept. 26 journal entry reporting exchange between Sen. Maclay, Adams, and Ellsworth)). They

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
included in their claim a kind of immunity from criminal,as well as civil, process. They responded to a counterargument--that the President "was not above the laws," andwould have to be arrested if guilty of crimes--by stating
that the President would first have to be impeached, andcould then be prosecuted. 9 Documentary History of First
Federal Congress of United States 168 (K. Bowling & H. Veiteds. 1988) (Diary of William Maclay). This Court's rejection
of Adams' and Ellsworth's views in the context of criminalproceedings, see

ante, at 703-704, does not deprive thoseviews of authority here. See Fitzgerald, supra, at 751-752,

n. 31. Nor does the fact that Senator William Maclay, whoreported the views of Adams and Ellsworth, "went on to
point out in his diary that he virulently disagreed withthem."

Ante, at 696, n. 23. Maclay, unlike Adams and Ells-worth, was not an important political figure at the time of

the constitutional debates. See Diary of William Maclayxi-xiii.

Third, in 1807, a sitting President, Thomas Jefferson, dur-ing a dispute about whether the federal courts could subpoena his presence in a criminal case, wrote the following toUnited States Attorney George Hay:

"The leading principle of our Constitution is the inde-pendence of the Legislature, executive and judiciary of
each other, and none are more jealous of this than thejudiciary. But would the executive be independent of
the judiciary, if he were subject to the commands of the
latter, & to imprisonment for disobedience; if the severalcourts could bandy him from pillar to post, keep him

constantly trudging from north to south & east to west,
and withdraw him entirely from his constitutional du-ties?" 10 Works of Thomas Jefferson 404, n. (P. Ford

ed. 1905) (letter of June 20, 1807, from President ThomasJefferson to United States Attorney George Hay),
quoted in Fitzgerald, supra, at 751, n. 31.

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

717Cite as: 520 U. S. 681 (1997)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
Three days earlier Jefferson had written to the samecorrespondent:

"To comply with such calls would leave the nation with-out an executive branch, whose agency, nevertheless, is
understood to be so constantly necessary, that it is thesole branch which the constitution requires to be always
in function. It could not then mean that it should bewithdrawn from its station by any co-ordinate authority." 10 Works of Thomas Jefferson, at 401 (letter ofJune 17, 1807, from Thomas Jefferson to George Hay).

Jefferson, like Adams and Ellsworth, argued strongly for animmunity from both criminal and civil judicial process--an
immunity greater in scope than any immunity, or any specialscheduling factor, now at issue in the civil case before us.
The significance of his views for present purposes lies in his
conviction that the Constitution protected a sitting Presidentfrom litigation that would "withdraw" a President from his

current "constitutional duties." That concern may not haveapplied to Mr. Fitzgerald's 1982 case against a

former President, but it is at issue in the current litigation.

Precedent that suggests to the contrary--that the Constitution does not offer a sitting President significant protections from potentially distracting civil litigation--consists of
the following: (1) In several instances sitting Presidents have
given depositions or testified at criminal trials, and (2) this
Court has twice authorized the enforcement of subpoenas
seeking documents from a sitting President for use in a criminal case.

I agree with the majority that these precedents reject any
absolute Presidential immunity from all court process. But
they do not cast doubt upon Justice Story's basic conclusion
that "in civil cases," a sitting President "possess[es] an official inviolability" as necessary to permit him to "perform"
the duties of his office without "obstruction or impediment."

718 CLINTON v. JONES

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
The first set of precedents tells us little about what theConstitution commands, for they amount to voluntary actions on the part of a sitting President. The second set ofprecedents amounts to a search for documents, rather than
a direct call upon Presidential time. More important, both
sets of precedents involve criminal proceedings in which thePresident participated as a witness. Criminal proceedings,

unlike private civil proceedings, are public acts initiated andcontrolled by the Executive Branch; see

United States v.
Nixon, 418 U. S., at 693-696; they are not normally subjectto postponement, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 6; and ordinarily

they put at risk, not a private citizen's hope for monetary
compensation, but a private citizen's freedom from enforced
confinement, 418 U. S., at 711-712, and n. 19; Fitzgerald, 457
U. S., at 754, n. 37. See also id., at 758, n. 41. Nor is it
normally possible in a criminal case, unlike many civil cases,
to provide the plaintiff with interest to compensate for
scheduling delay. See, e. g., Winter v. Cerro Gordo County
Conservation Bd., 925 F. 2d 1069, 1073 (CA8 1991); Foley v.
Lowell, 948 F. 2d 10, 17-18 (CA1 1991); Wooten v. McClendon, 272 Ark. 61, 62-63, 612 S. W. 2d 105, 106 (1981).

The remaining precedent to which the majority refers does
not seem relevant in this case. That precedent, Youngstown
Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585 (1952), concerns official action. And any Presidential time spent dealing with, or action taken in response to, that kind of case is
part of a President's official duties. Hence court review in
such circumstances could not interfere with, or distract from,
official duties. Insofar as a court orders a President, in any
such a proceeding, to act or to refrain from action, it defines,
or determines, or clarifies the legal scope of an official duty.
By definition (if the order itself is lawful), it cannot impede,
or obstruct, or interfere with the President's basic task--
the lawful exercise of his Executive authority. Indeed, if
constitutional principles counsel caution when judges consider an order that directly requires the President properly

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

719Cite as: 520 U. S. 681 (1997)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
to carry out his official duties, see Franklin v. Massachu-setts, 505 U. S. 788, 827 (1992) (

Scalia, J., concurring in partand concurring in judgment) (describing the "apparently unbroken historical tradition . . . implicit in the separation ofpowers" that a President may not be ordered by the Judiciary to perform particular Executive acts); id., at 802-803(plurality opinion of

O'Connor, J.), so much the more mustthose principles counsel caution when such an order threatens to interfere with the President's properly carrying outthose duties.

B
Case law, particularly, Nixon v. Fitzgerald, strongly sup-ports the principle that judges hearing a private civil damages action against a sitting President may not issue ordersthat could significantly distract a President from his official
duties. In Fitzgerald, the Court held that former PresidentNixon was absolutely immune from civil damages lawsuits
based upon any conduct within the "outer perimeter" ofhis official responsibilities. 457 U. S., at 756. The holding
rested upon six determinations that are relevant here.First, the Court found that the Constitution assigns the
President singularly important duties (thus warrantingan "absolute," rather than a "qualified," immunity).

Id.,at 750-751. Second, the Court held that "recognition of

immunity" does not require a "specific textual basis" in theConstitution.

Id., at 750, n. 31. Third, although physicalconstraint of the President was not at issue, the Court nevertheless considered Justice Story's constitutional analysis, dis-cussed supra, at 714-715, "persuasive." 457 U. S., at 749.
Fourth, the Court distinguished contrary precedent on theground that it involved criminal, not civil, proceedings.

Id.,at 754, and n. 37. Fifth, the Court's concerns encompassed

the fact that "the sheer prominence of the President's office"could make him "an easily identifiable target for suits for
civil damages." Id., at 752-753. Sixth, and most impor-tant, the Court rested its conclusion in important part upon

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
720 CLINTON v. JONES

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
the fact that civil lawsuits "could distract a President fromhis public duties, to the detriment of not only the President

and his office but also the Nation that the Presidency wasdesigned to serve."

Id., at 753.
The majority argues that this critical, last-mentioned, feature of the case is dicta. Ante, at 694, n. 19. In the majori-ty's view, since the defendant was a

former President, the
lawsuit could not have distracted him from his official duties;hence the case must rest entirely upon an alternative concern, namely, that a President's fear of civil lawsuits basedupon his official duties could

distort his official decisionmaking. The majority, however, overlooks the fact that
Fitzgerald set forth a single immunity (an absolute immunity) applicable both to sitting and former Presidents. Its
reasoning focused upon both. Its key paragraph, explainingwhy the President enjoys an absolute immunity rather than

a qualified immunity, contains seven sentences, four of whichfocus primarily upon time and energy

distraction and three
of which focus primarily upon official decision distortion.Indeed, that key paragraph begins by stating:

"Because of the singular importance of the President'sduties, diversion of his energies by concern with private
lawsuits would raise unique risks to the effective func-tioning of government." 457 U. S., at 751.

Moreover, the Court, in numerous other cases, has foundthe problem of time and energy distraction a critically important consideration militating in favor of a grant of immunity.See,

e. g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 817-818 (1982)
(qualified immunity for Presidential assistants based in part
on "costs of trial" and "burdens of broad-reaching discovery"
that are "peculiarly disruptive of effective government");
Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U. S. 409, 423 (1976) (absolute immunity of prosecutors based in part upon concern about "deflection of the prosecutor's energies from his public duties");
Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U. S. 367, 377 (1951) (absolute im520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

721Cite as: 520 U. S. 681 (1997)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
munity for legislators avoids danger they will "be subjectedto the cost and inconvenience and distractions of a trial").

Indeed, cases that provide public officials, not with immunity,but with special protective procedures such as interlocutory
appeals, rest entirely upon a "time and energy distraction"
rationale. See Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299, 306, 308(1996) ("[G]overnment official['s] right . . . to avoid standing

trial [and] to avoid the burdens of such pretrial matters asdiscovery" are sufficient to support an immediate appeal
from "denial of a claim of qualified immunity" (citations andinternal quotation marks omitted));

Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472
U. S. 511, 526 (1985) ("[E]ntitlement not to stand trial or
face the other burdens of litigation . . . is effectively lost if a
case is erroneously permitted to go to trial" (citing Harlow,
supra, at 818)).

It is not surprising that the Court's immunity-related case
law should rely on both distraction and distortion, for the
ultimate rationale underlying those cases embodies both concerns. See Pierson v. Ray, 386 U. S. 547, 554 (1967) (absolute judicial immunity is needed because of "burden" of litigation, which leads to "intimidation"); Bradley v. Fisher, 13
Wall. 335, 349 (1872) (without absolute immunity a judge's
"office [would] be degraded and his usefulness destroyed,"
and he would be forced to shoulder "burden" of keeping full
records for use in defending against suits). The cases ultimately turn on an assessment of the threat that a civil damages lawsuit poses to a public official's ability to perform his
job properly. And, whether they provide an absolute immunity, a qualified immunity, or merely a special procedure,
they ultimately balance consequent potential public harm
against private need. Distraction and distortion are equally
important ingredients of that potential public harm. Indeed, a lawsuit that significantly distracts an official from his
public duties can distort the content of a public decision just
as can a threat of potential future liability. If the latter concern can justify an "absolute" immunity in the case of a Pres520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN
722 CLINTON v. JONES

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
ident no longer in office, where distraction is no longer aconsideration, so can the former justify, not immunity, but a

postponement, in the case of a sitting President.

III
The majority points to the fact that private plaintiffs havebrought civil damages lawsuits against a sitting President

only three times in our Nation's history; and it relies uponthe threat of sanctions to discourage, and "the court's discretion" to manage, such actions so that "interference with thePresident's duties would not occur." Ante, at 708. I am
less sanguine. Since 1960, when the last such suit was filed,the number of civil lawsuits filed annually in Federal District
Courts has increased from under 60,000 to about 240,000, seeAdministrative Office of the United States Courts, Statistical
Tables for the Federal Judiciary 27 (1995); Annual Report ofthe Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts--1960, p. 224 (1961); the number of federal dis-trict judges has increased from 233 to about 650, see Administrative Office of United States Courts, Judicial Business ofUnited States Courts 7 (1994); Annual Report of the Director
of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts--1960,

supra, at 205; the time and expense associated withboth discovery and trial have increased, see,

e. g., Bell,Varner, & Gottschalk, Automatic Disclosure in Discovery--

The Rush To Reform, 27 Ga. L. Rev. 1, 9-11 (1992); see alsoS. Rep. No. 101-416, p. 1 (1990); Judicial Improvements Act
of 1990, Pub. L. 101-650, 104 Stat. 5089; an increasingly com-plex economy has led to increasingly complex sets of statutes, rules, and regulations that often create potential lia-bility, with or without fault. And this Court has now made
clear that such lawsuits may proceed against a sitting Presi-dent. The consequence, as the Court warned in

Fitzgerald,is that a sitting President, given "the visibility of his office,"

could well become "an easily identifiable target for suits forcivil damages," 457 U. S., at 753. The threat of sanctions

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

723Cite as: 520 U. S. 681 (1997)
Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
could well discourage much unneeded litigation, ante, at 708-709, but some lawsuits (including highly intricate and complicated ones) could resist ready evaluation and disposition; andindividual district court procedural rulings could pose a significant threat to the President's official functions.

I concede the possibility that district courts, supervised bythe Courts of Appeals and perhaps this Court, might prove

able to manage private civil damages actions against sittingPresidents without significantly interfering with the discharge of Presidential duties--at least if they manage thoseactions with the constitutional problem in mind. Nonetheless, predicting the future is difficult, and I am skeptical.
Should the majority's optimism turn out to be misplaced,
then, in my view, courts will have to develop administrative
rules applicable to such cases (including postponement rules
of the sort at issue in this case) in order to implement the
basic constitutional directive. A Constitution that separates
powers in order to prevent one branch of Government from
significantly threatening the workings of another could not
grant a single judge more than a very limited power to
second-guess a President's reasonable determination (announced in open court) of his scheduling needs, nor could it
permit the issuance of a trial scheduling order that would significantly interfere with the President's discharge of his duties--in a private civil damages action the trial of which might
be postponed without the plaintiff suffering enormous harm.
As Madison pointed out in The Federalist No. 51: "The great
security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department consists in giving to those who
administer each department the necessary constitutional
means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the
others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all
other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack."
Id., at 321-322 (emphasis added). I agree with the majority's determination that a constitutional defense must await
a more specific showing of need; I do not agree with what I

520US3 Unit: $U58 [09-11-99 17:25:00] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., concurring in judgment
believe to be an understatement of the "danger." And I be-lieve that ordinary case-management principles are unlikely

to prove sufficient to deal with private civil lawsuits for dam-ages unless supplemented with a constitutionally based requirement that district courts schedule proceedings so as toavoid significant interference with the President's ongoing
discharge of his official responsibilities.

IV
This case is a private action for civil damages in which, asthe District Court here found, it is possible to preserve evidence and in which later payment of interest can compensatefor delay. The District Court in this case determined that
the Constitution required the postponement of trial duringthe sitting President's term. It may well be that the trial
of this case cannot take place without significantly interfer-ing with the President's ability to carry out his official duties.
Yet, I agree with the majority that there is no automatictemporary immunity and that the President should have to
provide the District Court with a reasoned explanation ofwhy the immunity is needed; and I also agree that, in the
absence of that explanation, the court's postponement of thetrial date was premature. For those reasons, I concur in
the result.

725OCTOBER TERM, 1996
Syllabus

SUITUM v. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 96-243. Argued February 26, 1997--Decided May 27, 1997
Petitioner Suitum owns an undeveloped lot near Lake Tahoe. Respondent Tahoe Regional Planning Agency determined that the lot is ineligible for development under agency regulations, but that Suitum is entitled to receive certain allegedly valuable "Transferable Development
Rights" (TDR's) that she can sell to other landowners with the agency's
approval. Suitum did not seek those rights, but instead brought this
action for compensation under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming that the
agency's determinations amounted to a regulatory taking of her property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth
Amendments. The District Court held that her claim is not ripe for
adjudication because she has not attempted to sell her TDR's, so that
their specific values are unknown and the court could not realistically
assess whether the agency's regulations have frustrated her reasonable
expectations. The Ninth Circuit agreed and affirmed, reasoning, inter
alia, that action on a TDR transfer application would be the requisite
"final decision" by the agency regarding its regulations' application to
Suitum's lot.

Held: Suitum's regulatory takings claim is ripe for adjudication.

Pp. 733-744.

(a) Suitum must satisfy the prudential ripeness principle requiring
that she receive a "final decision" from the agency regarding the application of its regulations to her property. Williamson County Regional
Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172,
186. Pp. 733-734.

(b) The Ninth Circuit's rationale for holding Suitum's claim unripe--
that she had failed to obtain a final and authoritative agency decision--
is unsupported by this Court's precedents. See, e. g., Williamson
County, supra, at 191, 193; MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo
County, 477 U. S. 340, 349. These precedents make two points clear
about the finality requirement: it applies to decisions about how a takings plaintiff's particular parcel may be used, see, e. g., Williamson
County, supra, at 191, and it responds to the high degree of discretion
characteristically possessed by land-use boards in softening the strictures of the general regulations they administer, see, e. g., MacDonald,
supra, at 350. Suitum's claim satisfies the demand for finality. It is

726 SUITUM v. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Syllabus
undisputed that the agency has finally determined that her land lies
entirely within a zone in which development is not permitted. Because
the agency has no discretion to exercise over her right to use her land,
no occasion exists for applying Williamson County's requirement that
a landowner take steps to obtain a final decision about the use that will
be permitted on the particular parcel. Although the parties contest the
relevance of the TDR's to the question whether a taking has occurred,
resolution of that legal issue will require no further agency action of the
sort demanded by Williamson County. Pp. 735-739.

(c) Contrary to the lower courts' holdings, action on a possible application by Suitum to transfer her TDR's is not the type of "final decision"
required by the Court's Williamson County precedents. Although
those precedents dealt with land, not TDR's, such a decision might be
required, given the agency's position that TDR's should be considered
when determining whether a taking has occurred, if there were any
question here whether Suitum would obtain a discretionary award of
salable TDR's. No such question is presented, however, since the parties agree on the particular TDR's to which Suitum is entitled, and no
discretionary decision must be made by any agency official for her to
obtain them or to offer them for sale. Pp. 739-740.

(d) The agency's argument that Suitum's case is not ripe because no
values attributable to her TDR's are known is just a variation on the
preceding position, and fares no better. First, as to her rights to receive TDR's that she may later sell, little or no uncertainty remains.
Second, as to her right to transfer her TDR's, the only contingency apart
from private market demand turns on the right of the agency or a local
regulatory body to deny approval for a specific transfer based on the
buyer's intended improper use of the TDR's. However, because the
agency does not deny that there are many potential lawful buyers whose
receipt of the TDR's would unquestionably be approved, the TDRs' valuation is simply an issue of fact about possible market prices, on which
the District Court had considerable evidence. Similar determinations
are routinely made by courts without the benefit of a market transaction
in the subject property. Pp. 740-742.

(e) The agency's argument that Suitum's claim is unripe under the
"fitness for review" requirement of Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387
U. S. 136, 148-149, is rejected. Abbott Laboratories is not on point because the petitioners there were challenging the validity of a regulation
as beyond the scope of its issuing agency's authority, whereas Suitum
seeks not to invalidate the regulations here at issue, but to be paid for
their consequences. Indeed, to the extent that Abbott Laboratories is
in any sense instructive in the disposition of this case, it cuts directly
against the agency: Suitum is just as definitively barred from taking any

Opinion of the Court
Justice Souter delivered the opinion of the Court.
Petitioner Bernadine Suitum owns land near the Nevadashore of Lake Tahoe. Respondent Tahoe Regional Planning

Agency, which regulates land use in the region, determinedthat Suitum's property is ineligible for development but entitled to receive certain allegedly valuable "Transferable De-velopment Rights" (TDR's). Suitum has brought an action
for compensation under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983,claiming that the agency's determinations amounted to a regulatory taking of her property. While the pleadings raiseissues about the significance of the TDR's both to the claim
that a taking has occurred and to the constitutional require-ment of just compensation, we have no occasion to decide,
and we do not decide, whether or not these TDR's may beconsidered in deciding the issue whether there has been a
taking in this case, as opposed to the issue whether just com-pensation has been afforded for such a taking. The sole
question here is whether the claim is ripe for adjudication,

even though Suitum has not attempted to sell the develop-ment rights she has or is eligible to receive. We hold that

it is. I

In 1969, Congress approved the Tahoe Regional PlanningCompact between the States of California and Nevada, creating respondent as an interstate agency to regulate develop-ment in the Lake Tahoe basin. See

Lake Country Estates,Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 440 U. S. 391, 394

(1979). After the 1969 compact had proven inadequate forprotection of the lake and its environment, the States proposed and Congress approved an amendment in 1980, requir-ing the agency to adopt a plan barring any development
exceeding such specific "environmental threshold carryingcapacities" as the agency might find appropriate. Pub. L.
96-551, Arts. I(b), V(b), V(g), 94 Stat. 3234, 3239-3241.1In 1987, the agency adopted a new Regional Plan providing for an "Individual Parcel Evaluation System" (IPES) torate the suitability of vacant residential parcels for building
and other modification. Tahoe Regional Planning AgencyCode of Ordinances, ch. 37 (TRPA Code). Whereas any
property must attain a minimum IPES score to qualify forconstruction,

id., $ 37.8.E; App. 145, an undeveloped parcelin certain areas carrying runoff into the watershed (known

as "Stream Environment Zones" (SEZ's)) receives an IPESscore of zero, TRPA Code $ 37.4.A(3). With limited exceptions not relevant here, the agency permits no "additionalland coverage or other permanent land disturbance" on such
a parcel. Id., $ 20.4.

1 The 1980 compact defines "[e]nvironmental threshold carrying capacity" as "an environmental standard necessary to maintain a significant
scenic, recreational, educational, scientific or natural value of the region
or to maintain public health and safety within the region. Such standards
shall include but not be limited to standards for air quality, water quality,
soil conservation, vegetation preservation and noise." Art. II(i), 94

730 SUITUM v. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court
Although the agency's 1987 plan does not provide for thevariances and exceptions of conventional land-use schemes,

it addresses the potential sharpness of its restrictions bygranting property owners TDR's that may be sold to owners
of parcels eligible for construction, id., $$ 20.3.C, 34.0 to 34.3.There are three kinds of residential TDR's. An owner
needs both a "Residential Development Right" and a "Resi-dential Allocation" to place a residential unit on a buildable
parcel, id., $$ 21.6.C, 33.2.A; the latter permits constructionto begin in a specific calendar year, but expires at year's end,
id., $ 33.2.B(3)(b). An owner must also have "Land Cover-age Rights" for each square foot of impermeable cover placed
upon land. App. 145; see also TRPA Code, ch. 20. All own-ers of vacant residential parcels that existed at the effective
date of the 1987 plan (July 1, 1987), including SEZ parcels,automatically receive one Residential Development Right,
id., $ 21.6.A; owners of SEZ property may obtain and trans-fer bonus points equivalent to three additional Residential
Development Rights, id., $$ 35.2.C, 35.2.D. SEZ propertyowners also receive Land Coverage Rights authorizing coverage of an area equal to 1% of the surface area of theirland.

Id., $$ 20.3.A, 37.11. Finally, SEZ owners, like otherproperty owners, may apply for a Residential Allocation,

awarded by local jurisdictions in random drawings eachyear.

2 Id., $ 33.2.B; App. 98-99. All three kinds of TDR's

may be transferred for the benefit of any eligible propertyin the Lake Tahoe region, subject to approval by the agency

based on the eligibility of the receiving parcel for develop-ment. TRPA Code $$ 20.3.C, 34.1 to 34.3.

In 1972, Suitum and her late husband bought an undevel-oped lot in Washoe County, Nevada, within the agency's
jurisdiction, and 17 years later, after adoption of the 1987

2 Counsel for the agency at oral argument represented that "at this
point" there are "fewer applicants than there are allocations" in Washoe
County, where petitioner's land is located, and there is thus a "100 percent
chance of winning the [drawing]." Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-40.

Opinion of the Court
Regional Plan, Suitum obtained a Residential Allocationthrough Washoe County's annual drawing. When she then

applied to the agency for permission to construct a house onher lot, the agency determined that her property was located
within a SEZ, assigned it an IPES score of zero, and deniedpermission to build. Suitum appealed the denial to the
agency's governing board, which itself denied relief.After the agency turned down the request for a building
permit, Suitum made no effort to transfer any of the TDR'sthat were hers under the 1987 plan, and there is no dispute
that she still has the one Residential Development Right thatowners of undeveloped lots automatically received, plus the
Land Coverage Rights for 183 square feet that she got asthe owner of 18,300 square feet of SEZ land. It is also common ground that Suitum has the right to receive three"bonus" Residential Development Rights. Although Suitum
has questioned the certainty that she would obtain a newResidential Allocation if she sought one, the agency has
represented to this Court that she undoubtably would, seen. 2,

supra.Instead, Suitum brought this 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 action alleging that in denying her the right to construct a house onher lot, the agency's restrictions deprived her of "all reasonable and economically viable use" of her property, and soamounted to a taking of her property without just compensation in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.3App. 15, 16. The agency responded by objecting, among
other things, that Suitum's takings claim was not ripe due toher "failure to obtain a final decision by TRPA as to the
amount of development . . . that may be allowed by" theagency. Id., at 10. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ordered supplemental briefing on

3 Suitum's complaint may have also raised substantive due process and
equal protection claims, see App. 16, 153, but her petition for a writ of
certiorari did not address those issues and they are not considered here.

Opinion of the Court
the nature of Suitum's TDR's, including "what [TDR's] canbe transferred in [Suitum's] case and the procedures, prerequisites and value of such transfer as applicable in this case."
Id., at 89. The agency introduced an affidavit from a real
estate appraiser, whose opinion was that the Residential
Development Right that Suitum already has, and the threemore to which she is entitled, have a market value between

$1,500 and $2,500 each; that her Land Coverage Rights canbe sold for $6 to $12 per square foot ($1,098-$2,196 total);
and that her lot devoid of all TDR's would sell for $7,125to $16,750.

Id., at 131-132. The appraiser also said that if
Suitum were to obtain a Residential Allocation and sell itwith a Development Right, together they would bring between $30,000 and $35,000. Ibid. As if in spite of the figures supplied by its own affidavit, however, the agency main-tained that the "

actual benefits of the [TDR] program for
[Suitum] . . . can only be known if she pursues an appropriate
[transfer] application," with the result that Suitum's claim
was not ripe for adjudication. Id., at 91. For her part,
Suitum insisted that trying to transfer her TDR's would be
an " `idle and futile act' " because the TDR program is a
"sham," 4 and she supplied the affidavit of one of the agency's

former employees whose view was that "there is little to no
value to [Suitum's TDR's] at the present time as . . . either
[there is] no market for them or the procedure for transferring one particular right would restrict the opportunity to
transfer a remaining right." Id., at 135.5

The District Court decided that Suitum's claim was not
ripe for consideration because "[a]s things now stand, there

4 See Suitum's Response to Defendant's Memorandum Concerning its
Transfer of Development Program 1-2.

Mar. 30, 1994), App. to Pet. for Cert. C-3. Although thecourt found that "there is significant value in the transfer of
[Suitum's TDR's], . . . until [specific] values attributable tothe transfer program are known, the court cannot realistically assess whether and to what extent [the agency's] regu-lations have frustrated [Suitum's] reasonable expectations."
Id., at C-3 to C-4.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed this
ripeness ruling for the like reason that "[w]ithout an applica-tion for the transfer of development rights" there would be
no way to "know the regulations' full economic impact orthe degree of their interference with [Suitum's] reasonable
investment-backed expectations," and without action on atransfer application there would be no " `final decision from
[the agency] regarding the application of the regulation[s] tothe property at issue.' "

6 80 F. 3d 359, 362-363 (1996). We

granted certiorari to consider the ripeness of Suitum's tak-ings claim, 519 U. S. 926 (1996), and now reverse.

II
The only issue presented is whether Suitum's claim of aregulatory taking of her land in violation of the Fifth and

Fourteenth Amendments is ready for judicial review underprudential ripeness principles.

7 There are two independent

6 The court held that "[t]hese ripeness requirements," while developed
in the regulatory taking context, "are equally applicable to the due process
and equal protection claims." 80 F. 3d, at 362, n. 1. We address only the
ripeness requirements for Suitum's takings claim, however, and express
no opinion on the ripeness of her other claims.

7 "We have noted that ripeness doctrine is drawn both from Article III

limitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to
exercise jurisdiction." Reno v. Catholic Social Services, Inc., 509 U. S.
43, 57, n. 18 (1993). The agency does not question that Suitum properly
presents a genuine "case or controversy" sufficient to satisfy Article III,
but maintains only that Suitum's action fails to satisfy our prudential ripeness requirements.

Opinion of the Court
prudential hurdles to a regulatory takings claim broughtagainst a state entity in federal court. Williamson County

Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of JohnsonCity, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), explained that a plaintiff must
demonstrate that she has both received a "final decision re-garding the application of the [challenged] regulations to the
property at issue" from "the government entity chargedwith implementing the regulations,"

id., at 186, and sought"compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so," id., at 194. The first requirement fol-lows from the principle that only a regulation that "goes too
far," Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415
(1922), results in a taking under the Fifth Amendment, see,
e. g., MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477
U. S. 340, 348 (1986) ("A court cannot determine whether aregulation has gone `too far' unless it knows how far the

regulation goes"); see also Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal
Council, 505 U. S. 1003, 1014-1019 (1992) (regulation " `goes
too far' " and results in a taking "at leas[t] in the extraordi-nary circumstance when

no productive or economically beneficial use of land is permitted"). The second hurdle stems
from the Fifth Amendment's proviso that only takings with-out "just compensation" infringe that Amendment; "if a

State provides an adequate procedure for seeking just com-pensation, the property owner cannot claim a violation of the
Just Compensation Clause until it has used the procedureand been denied just compensation,"

Williamson County,
supra, at 195. Because only the "final decision" prong of
Williamson was addressed below and briefed before this
Court, we confine our discussion here to that issue.8

8 We therefore do not decide whether Williamson County's "state procedures" requirement has been satisfied in this case. Ordinarily, a plaintiff
must seek compensation through state inverse condemnation proceedings
before initiating a takings suit in federal court, unless the State does not
provide adequate remedies for obtaining compensation. See Williamson
County, 473 U. S., at 194-196. Suitum's counsel stated at oral argument

735Cite as: 520 U. S. 725 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

A
In holding Suitum's claim to be unripe, the Ninth Circuitagreed with the agency's argument that Suitum had failed

to obtain a final and authoritative decision from the agencysufficient to satisfy the first prong of

Williamson County,supra. Although it is unclear whether the agency still urges

precisely that position before this Court, see, e. g., Brief forRespondent 21 (conceding that "[w]e know the full extent of
the regulation's impact in restricting petitioner's develop-ment of her own land"), we think it important to emphasize
that the rationale adopted in the decision under review isunsupported by our precedents.

Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U. S. 255 (1980), is the firstcase in which this Court employed a notion of ripeness in
declining to reach the merits of an as-applied regulatory tak-ings claim.

9 In Agins, the landowners who challenged zonthat "the position of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is that they do
not . . . have provisions for paying just compensation," Tr. of Oral Arg. 4,
thus suggesting that the agency is not subject to inverse condemnation
proceedings, and the agency's counsel did not disagree. Suitum's position
therefore appears to be that the sole remedy against the agency for a
taking without just compensation is a $ 1983 suit for damages, such as she
has brought here. Cf. Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe
Regional Planning Agency, 911 F. 2d 1331, 1341-1342 (CA9 1990). We
leave this matter to the Court of Appeals on remand.

9 Two years earlier, in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438

U. S. 104 (1978), we reached the merits of Penn Central's claim that the
New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission's denial of permission to construct an office building on top of Grand Central Terminal was
a taking, despite our observation that

"it simply cannot be maintained, on this record, that appellants have been
prohibited from occupying any portion of the airspace above the Terminal.
While the [City's] actions in denying applications to construct an office
building in excess of 50 stories above the Terminal may indicate that it
will refuse to issue a certificate of appropriateness for any comparably
sized structure, . . . [t]he [City has] emphasized that whether any construction would be allowed depended upon whether the proposed addition
`would harmonize in scale, material, and character with [the Termi520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
736 SUITUM v. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court
ing ordinances restricting the number of houses they could
build on their property sued without seeking approval for
any particular development on their land. We held that the
only issue justiciable at that point was whether mere enactment of the statute amounted to a taking.10 Id., at 260.
Without employing the term "ripeness," the Court explained
that because the owners "ha[d] not submitted a plan for development of their property as the [challenged] ordinances
permit[ted], there [was] as yet no concrete controversy regarding the application of the specific zoning provisions."
Ibid.

The following Term, Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining &
Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264 (1981), toughened our
nascent ripeness requirement. There, coal producers and
landowners challenged the enactment of the Surface Mining
Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U. S. C. $ 1201 et
seq., as a taking of their property. As in Agins, we concluded that an as-applied challenge was unripe, reasoning
that "[t]here is no indication in the record that appellees
ha[d] availed themselves of the opportunities provided by the
Act to obtain administrative relief by requesting . . . a variance from the [applicable provisions of the Act]," 452 U. S.,
at 297.11 Hodel thus held that where the regulatory regime

nal].' Since appellants have not sought approval for the construction of
a smaller structure, we do not know that appellants will be denied any
use of any portion of the airspace above the Terminal." Id., at 136-137
(citation omitted).

10 Such "facial" challenges to regulation are generally ripe the moment

the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed, but face an "uphill battle," Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U. S. 470, 495
(1987), since it is difficult to demonstrate that " `mere enactment' " of a
piece of legislation "deprived [the owner] of economically viable use of [his]
property." Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc.,
452 U. S. 264, 297 (1981). Suitum does not purport to challenge the
agency's regulations on their face.

11 As in Agins, we found the Hodel plaintiffs' "facial" takings challenge

to be ripe, but ruled it out on the merits. 452 U. S., at 295-297.

520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
offers the possibility of a variance from its facial require-ments, a landowner must go beyond submitting a plan for

development and actually seek such a variance to ripen hisclaim.

Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), confirmed
Hodel's holding. In Williamson County, a developer's plan
to build a residential complex was rejected by the local plan-ning commission as inconsistent with zoning ordinances and

subdivision regulations in eight different respects. ThisCourt acknowledged that "[r]espondent ha[d] submitted a
plan for developing its property, and thus ha[d] passed beyond the Agins threshold," 473 U. S., at 187, but nonetheless
held the takings challenge unripe, reasoning that "among the
factors of particular significance in the [takings] inquiry are
the economic impact of the challenged action and the extent
to which it interferes with reasonable investment-backed expectations," id., at 191, "factors [that] simply cannot be evaluated until the administrative agency has arrived at a final,
definitive position regarding how it will apply the regulations at issue to the particular land in question," ibid. Thus,
a developer must at least "resort to the procedure for obtaining variances . . . [and obtain] a conclusive determination by
the Commission whether it would allow" the proposed development, id., at 193, in order to ripen its takings claim.

MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U. S.
340 (1986), reaffirmed Williamson County's requirement of
a final agency position. In MacDonald, a developer purchased property and presented a tentative subdivision plan
to the local planning commission. After the commission
treated the proposal as inconsistent with the zoning regulations in several respects, the developer immediately filed
suit. Without even relying on the character of the dry run
in the submission of a merely tentative plan, we emphasized
that in the course of litigation two state courts had given
opinions that development of the property was possible

Opinion of the Court
under the regulations in question, flatly contrary to the developer's conclusory allegation that the regulations required
him to provide a greenbelt as a public gratuity. See 477
U. S., at 345-347. Hence, we held the claim unripe under
the rationale of Williamson County: " `the effect [of] the
Commission's application of the zoning ordinance . . . on the
value of respondent's property . . . cannot be measured until
a final decision is made as to how the regulations will be
applied to [the developer's] property.' " MacDonald, supra,
at 349 (quoting Williamson County, supra, at 199-200).

Leaving aside the question of how definitive a local zoning
decision must be to satisfy Williamson County's demand for
finality,12 two points about the requirement are clear: it applies to decisions about how a takings plaintiff 's own land
may be used, and it responds to the high degree of discretion
characteristically possessed by land-use boards in softening
the strictures of the general regulations they administer.
As the Court said in MacDonald, "local agencies charged
with administering regulations governing property development are singularly flexible institutions; what they take with
the one hand they may give back with the other." 477 U. S.,
at 350. When such flexibility or discretion may be brought
to bear on the permissible use of property as singular as a

12 MacDonald suggested that the Williamson County "final decision"
requirement might sometimes require multiple proposals or variance applications before a landowner's case will be considered ripe. We wrote,
for example, that "[r]ejection of exceedingly grandiose development plans
does not logically imply that less ambitious plans will receive similarly
unfavorable reviews." 477 U. S., at 353, n. 9; compare Williamson
County, 473 U. S., at 191 (applicant must obtain final definitive position on
how regulations will be applied to the land in question), with id., at 193
(applicant must obtain conclusive determination whether specific proposed
development will be permitted). Amici the Mayhews et al. urge us to
establish a rule that a takings plaintiff need only make a single proposal
and a single request for a variance to ensure the ripeness of his claim.
Brief for Mayhews et al. as Amici Curiae 22. That issue is not presented
in this case.

Opinion of the Court
parcel of land, a sound judgment about what use will be al-lowed simply cannot be made by asking whether a parcel's

characteristics or a proposal's details facially conform to theterms of the general use regulations.

The demand for finality is satisfied by Suitum's claim, how-ever, there being no question here about how the "regulations at issue [apply] to the particular land in question."
Williamson County, supra, at 191. It is undisputed thatthe agency "has finally determined that petitioner's land lies

entirely within an SEZ," Brief for Respondent 21, and that itmay therefore permit "[n]o additional land coverage or other
permanent land disturbance" on the parcel, TRPA Code$ 20.4. Because the agency has no discretion to exercise
over Suitum's right to use her land, no occasion exists forapplying

Williamson County's requirement that a land-owner take steps to obtain a final decision about the use that

will be permitted on a particular parcel. The parties, ofcourse, contest the relevance of the TDR's to the issue of
whether a taking has occurred, but resolution of that legalissue will require no further agency action of the sort demanded by Williamson County.

B
The agency nonetheless argued below, and the lowercourts agreed, see supra, at 732-733, that there remains a

"final decision" for the agency to make: action on a possibleapplication by Suitum to transfer the TDR's to which she is
indisputably entitled. This is not, however, the type of"final decision" required by our Williamson County precedents. Those precedents addressed the virtual impossibilityof determining what development will be permitted on a particular lot of land when its use is subject to the decision of aregulatory body invested with great discretion, which it has
not yet even been asked to exercise. No such question ispresented here. The parties agree on the particular TDR's
to which Suitum is entitled, and no discretionary decision

740 SUITUM v. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of the Court
must be made by any agency official for her to obtain them orto offer them for sale. The only decision left to the agency is

approval of a particular transfer of TDR's to make certainthat a given potential buyer may lawfully use them. But
whether a particular sale of TDR's may be completed is quitedifferent from whether TDR's are salable; so long as the particular buyer is not the only person who can lawfully buy,the rights would not be rendered unsalable even if the
agency were to make a discretionary decision to kill a partic-ular sale. And the class of buyers is not even arguably so
limited here, where there is no question so far as the law isconcerned that TDR's may be bought and used for the benefit
of all sorts of land parcels and lots.

C
The agency's argument that Suitum's case is not ripe be-cause no " `values attributable to [Suitum's TDR's] are

known,' " Brief for Respondent 23 (quoting No. CV-N-91-040-ECR (D. Nev., Mar. 30, 1994), App. to Pet. for Cert. C-4,
is just a variation on the preceding position, and fares nobetter. First, as to Suitum's rights to receive TDR's that
she may later sell, we have already noted that little or nouncertainty remains. Although the value of a Residential
Development Right may well be greater if it is offered to-gether with a Residential Allocation, and although Suitum
must still enter the lottery for the latter, there is no discre-tionary decision to be made in determining whether she will
get one; in fact, the probability of her getting one is "100percent" according to the agency, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 40,
since there are fewer applications than available allocations,see

id., at 39-40. But even if that were not the case, as itprobably will not always be, it would be unreasonable to require Suitum to enter the drawing in order to ripen her suit.The agency does not, and surely could not, maintain that
if the odds of success in the allocation lottery were low,

520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

741Cite as: 520 U. S. 725 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Suitum's takings claim could be kept at bay from year toyear until she actually won the drawing; such a rule would

allow any local authority to stultify the Fifth Amendment'sguarantee. Rather, in such circumstances, the value attributable to the allocation Suitum might or might not receive inthe drawing would simply be discounted to reflect the mathematical likelihood of her obtaining one.Second, as to Suitum's right to transfer her TDR's, the
only contingency apart from private market demand turnson the right of the agency to deny approval for a specific
transfer on grounds that the buyer's use of the TDR's wouldviolate the terms of the scheme or other local land-use regulation, and the right of a local regulatory body to denytransfer approval for the latter reason. See TRPA Code

$$ 20.3.C, 34.2, 34.3. But even if these potential bars basedon a buyer's intended use of TDR's should turn out to involve
the same degree of discretion assumed in the WilliamsonCounty ripeness requirement, that discretion still would not
render the value of the TDR's nearly as unknowable as thechances of particular development being permitted on a particular parcel in the absence of a zoning board decision thatcould quite lawfully be either yes or no. While a particular
sale is subject to approval, salability is not, and the agency'sown position assumes that there are many potential, lawful
buyers for Suitum's TDR's, whose receipt of those rightswould unquestionably be approved.

The valuation of Suitum's TDR's is therefore simply anissue of fact about possible market prices, and one on which
the District Court had considerable evidence before it, seesupra, at 731-732.

13 Of course, as the agency appears to be

saying, see, e. g., Brief for Respondent 22-23, the very bestevidence of the value of Suitum's TDR's might be their actual

13 Moreover, the court may, of course, request additional briefing on this
subject if necessary, and a trial could be held if the issue cannot be decided
on summary judgment.

Opinion of the Court
selling price (assuming, of course, that the sale were madein good faith and at arm's length). But similar determinations of market value are routinely made in judicial proceed-ings without the benefit of a market transaction in the subject property. See, e. g., United States v. 819.98 Acres of
Land, More or Less, Located in Wasatch and Summit Coun-ties, 78 F. 3d 1468, 1469-1470 (CA10 1996) (upholding valuation of condemned land based on expert testimony relatingto comparable sales and discounted cash flow); United States
v. L. E. Cooke Co., 991 F. 2d 336, 338-339 (CA6 1993) (samewith respect to valuation of mineral rights leases); see also
5 J. Sackman, Nichols' Law of Eminent Domain $ 23-01,p. 23-6 (rev. 3d ed. 1997) ("[I]t is well established that the
value of . . . land taken or injured by the exercise of thepower of eminent domain may be shown by opinion evidence"); see generally 4 id., $ 12.02 (discussing establishmentof market value of condemned land). While it is true that
market value may be hard to calculate without a regulartrade in TDR's, if Suitum is ready to proceed in spite of this
difficulty, ripeness doctrine does not block her. In fact, thereason for the agency's objection is probably a concern that
without much market experience in sales of TDR's, theirmarket values will get low estimates. But this is simply one
of the risks of regulatory pioneering, and the pioneer here isthe agency, not Suitum.

III
Finally, the agency argues (for the first time, before thisCourt) that Suitum's claim is unripe under the "fitness for

review" requirement of Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, 387U. S. 136 (1967).

Abbott Laboratories arose on a petitionunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U. S. C.

$$ 701-704 (1964 ed., Supp. II), by a group of drug manufac-turers seeking review of a labeling regulation promulgated
by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (FDA) but not yetthe subject of any enforcement action against the manufacturers. The petitioners claimed that the FDA lacked statu520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

743Cite as: 520 U. S. 725 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
tory authority to impose the new labeling requirement; theFDA countered that the claim was not ripe for judicial review for want of any proceedings to enforce the regulation.The Court dealt with ripeness under a two-pronged test:

"Without undertaking to survey the intricacies of theripeness doctrine it is fair to say that its basic rationale
is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of prematureadjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract
disagreements over administrative policies, and also toprotect the agencies from judicial interference until
an administrative decision has been formalized and
its effects felt in a concrete way by the challengingparties. The problem is best seen in a twofold aspect,

requiring us to evaluate both the fitness of the issuesfor judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of
withholding court consideration." 387 U. S., at 148-149(footnote omitted).

Under the "fitness for review" prong, we first noted that theFDA's adoption of the labeling regulation was "final agency
action" within the meaning of $ 10 of the APA, 5 U. S. C.$ 704, and then rejected the Government's argument that review must await enforcement. 387 U. S., at 149-152. Wereasoned that "the impact of the regulations upon the petitioners is sufficiently direct and immediate as to render the
issue appropriate for judicial review at this stage" becausepromulgation of the regulations "puts petitioners in a dilemma": "Either they must comply with the [labeling] re-quirement and incur the costs of changing over their promotional material and labeling or they must follow their present
course and risk prosecution." Id., at 152 (internal quotation
marks omitted). Similarly, the immediate impact of the regulation on the manufacturers satisfied the "hardship" prong:
"Where the legal issue presented is fit for judicial resolution,
and where a regulation requires an immediate and significant
change in the plaintiffs' conduct of their affairs with serious

Opinion of the Court
penalties attached to noncompliance," hardship has beendemonstrated and "access to the courts . . . must be permitted." Id., at 153.Abbott Laboratories is not on point. The drug companies
in that case were challenging the validity of a regulationas beyond the scope of the FDA's authority. Whatever the
arguable merit of the FDA's position on ripeness may havebeen, it rested on the fact that the manufacturers could have
precipitated their challenge (if they had wanted) by violatingthe regulation and defending any subsequent prosecution by
placing the regulation's validity in question. Suitum is ina different position from the manufacturers. She does not
challenge the validity of the agency's regulations; her litigat-ing position assumes that the agency may validly bar her
land development just as all agree it has actually done, andher only challenge to the TDR's raises a question about their
value, not about the lawfulness of issuing them. Suitumseeks not to be free of the regulations but to be paid for
their consequences, and even if for some odd reason she haddecided to bring things to a head by building without a permit, a $ 1983 action for money would not be a defense toan equity proceeding to enjoin development. Indeed, to the
extent that Abbott Laboratories is in any sense instructivein the disposition of the case before us, it cuts directly
against the agency: Suitum is just as definitively barred fromtaking any affirmative step to develop her land as the drug
companies were bound to take affirmative steps to changetheir labels. The only discretionary step left to an agency in
either situation is enforcement, not determining applicability.

* * *
Because we find that Suitum has received a "final decision"consistent with

Williamson County's ripeness requirement,we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand

for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

Opinion of Scalia, J.
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice O'Connor and
Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurringin the judgment.

I concur in the judgment of the Court, and join its opinionexcept for Parts II-B and II-C. Those sections consider
whether the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) musthave reached a final decision regarding Suitum's ability to
sell her Transferable Development Rights (TDRs), andwhether the value of Suitum's TDRs must be known. That
discussion presumes that the answers to those questions maybe relevant to the issue presented at this preliminary stage
of the present case: whether Suitum's takings claim is ripefor judicial review under the "final decision" requirement.
In my view they are not relevant to that issue, and theCourt's discussion is beside the point.

To describe the nature of the "final decision" inquiry, theCourt's opinion quotes only the vague language of

William-son County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank

of Johnson City, 473 U. S. 172 (1985), that there must be a"final decision regarding the application of the [challenged]
regulations to the property at issue," id., at 186, quoted ante,
at 734, and of MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County,477 U. S. 340 (1986), that "[a] court cannot determine

whether a regulation has gone `too far' unless it knows howfar the regulation goes,"

id., at 348, quoted ante, at 734.
Unmentioned in the opinion are other, more specific, state-ments in those very cases (and elsewhere) which display

quite clearly that the quoted generalizations (and the "finaldecision" inquiry) have nothing to do with TDRs. Later in
Williamson County, for example, we explained that the purpose of the "final decision" requirement was to ensure thatthe Court can ascertain "how [the takings plaintiff] will be

allowed to develop its property," Williamson County, supra,at 190. And on the very same page from which the Court
extracted the vague statement, MacDonald says quite pre-cisely that the essential function of the "final decision" re520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN
746 SUITUM v. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING AGENCY

Opinion of Scalia, J.
quirement is to ensure that there has been a "determinationof the type and intensity of development legally permitted

on the subject property," MacDonald, supra, at 348; andsays later that "[o]ur cases uniformly reflect an insistence
on knowing the nature and extent of permitted development
before adjudicating the constitutionality of the regulationsthat purport to limit it," 477 U. S., at 351. The Court fails

even to mention, in its otherwise encyclopedic description ofthe development of the "final decision" requirement, the most
recent of our opinions addressing the subject, Lucas v. South
Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U. S. 1003 (1992), in which we
relied exclusively on these more precise formulations and did
not mention the vague language quoted by the Court today,
see id., at 1011.

The focus of the "final decision" inquiry is on ascertaining
the extent of the governmental restriction on land use, not
what the government has given the landowner in exchange
for that restriction. When our cases say, as the Court explains ante, at 734, that without a "final decision" it is impossible to know whether the regulation "goes too far," Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922), they
mean "goes too far in restricting the profitable use of the
land," not "goes not far enough in providing compensation
for restricting the profitable use of the land." The latter
pertains not to whether there has been a taking, but to the
subsequent question of whether, if so, there has been just
compensation.

In all of the cases discussed in Part II-A of the Court's
opinion bearing on the question whether a "final decision"
requisite to a takings claim had been made, the point at issue
was whether the government had finally determined the permissible use of the land. In Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447
U. S. 255 (1980), discussed ante, at 735-736, the government
had not yet determined how many houses the challenged
zoning ordinance would permit on the plaintiff 's property.
In Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn.,

520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

747Cite as: 520 U. S. 725 (1997)
Opinion of Scalia, J.
Inc., 452 U. S. 264 (1981), discussed ante, at 736-737, the gov-ernment had not yet determined whether a variance from

the land-use restrictions of the Surface Mining Control andReclamation Act of 1977 would be allowed. In

Williamson
County, supra, discussed ante, at 737, the government had
not yet determined whether it would approve the developer'splan to build a residential complex. And in

MacDonald,
supra, discussed ante, at 737-738, the government had againnot yet determined whether the developer's subdivision plan

would be approved.TDRs, of course, have nothing to do with the use or development of the land to which they are (by regulatory decree)
"attached." The right to use and develop one's own land is
quite distinct from the right to confer upon someone else an
increased power to use and develop his land. The latter is
valuable, to be sure, but it is a new right conferred upon the
landowner in exchange for the taking, rather than a reduction of the taking. In essence, the TDR permits the landowner whose right to use and develop his property has been
restricted or extinguished to extract money from others.
Just as a cash payment from the government would not relate to whether the regulation "goes too far" (i. e., restricts
use of the land so severely as to constitute a taking), but
rather to whether there has been adequate compensation for
the taking; and just as a chit or coupon from the government,
redeemable by and hence marketable to third parties, would
relate not to the question of taking but to the question of
compensation; so also the marketable TDR, a peculiar type
of chit which enables a third party not to get cash from the
government but to use his land in ways the government
would otherwise not permit, relates not to taking but to compensation. It has no bearing upon whether there has been
a "final decision" concerning the extent to which the plaintiff 's land use has been constrained.

Putting TDRs on the taking rather than the justcompensation side of the equation (as the Ninth Circuit did

Opinion of Scalia, J.
below) is a clever, albeit transparent, device that seeks totake advantage of a peculiarity of our Takings-Clause jurisprudence: Whereas once there is a taking, the Constitutionrequires just (

i. e., full) compensation, see, e. g., United States
v. 564.54 Acres of Monroe and Pike County Land, 441 U. S.
506, 510 (1979) (owner must be put " `in as good a positionpecuniarily as if his property had not been taken' ");

Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U. S. 312, 326 (1893)("[T]he compensation must be a full and perfect equivalent

for the property taken"), a regulatory taking generally doesnot

occur so long as the land retains substantial (albeit not its
full) value, see, e. g., Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York
City, 438 U. S. 104 (1978). If money that the governmentregulator gives to the landowner can be counted on the question of whether there is a taking (causing the courts to say
that the land retains substantial value, and has thus not been
taken), rather than on the question of whether the compensation for the taking is adequate, the government can get away
with paying much less. That is all that is going on here. It
would be too obvious, of course, for the government simply
to say "although your land is regulated, our land-use scheme
entitles you to a government payment of $1,000." That is
patently compensation and not retention of land value. It
would be a little better to say "under our land-use scheme,
TDRs are attached to every parcel, and if the parcel is regulated its TDR can be cashed in with the government for
$1,000." But that still looks too much like compensation.
The cleverness of the scheme before us here is that it causes
the payment to come, not from the government but from
third parties--whom the government reimburses for their
outlay by granting them (as the TDRs promise) a variance
from otherwise applicable land-use restrictions.

Respondent maintains that Penn Central supports the
conclusion that TDRs are relevant to the question whether
there has been a taking. In Penn Central we remarked that
because the rights to develop the airspace above Grand Cen520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of Scalia, J.
tral Terminal had been made transferable to other parcelsin the vicinity (some of which the owners of the terminal

themselves owned), it was "not literally accurate to say that[the owners] have been denied

all use of [their] pre-existing
air rights"; and that even if the TDRs were inadequate to
constitute "just compensation" if a taking had occurred, theycould nonetheless "be taken into account in considering the

impact of regulation." Id., at 137 (emphasis in original).This analysis can be distinguished from the case before us
on the ground that it was applied to landowners who ownedat least eight nearby parcels, some immediately adjacent to
the terminal, that could be benefited by the TDRs. See id.,
at 115. The relevant land, it could be said, was the aggregation of the owners' parcels subject to the regulation (or at
least the contiguous parcels); and the use of that land, as a
whole, had not been diminished. It is for that reason that
the TDRs affected "the impact of the regulation." This
analysis is supported by the concluding clause of the opinion,
which says that the restrictions "not only permit reasonable
beneficial use of the landmark site but also afford appellants
opportunities further to enhance not only the Terminal site
proper but also other properties." Id., at 138. If Penn
Central's one-paragraph expedition into the realm of TDRs
were not distinguishable in this fashion, it would deserve to
be overruled. Considering in the takings calculus the market value of TDRs is contrary to the import of a whole series
of cases, before and since, which make clear that the relevant
issue is the extent to which use or development of the land
has been restricted. Indeed, it is contrary to the whole
principle that land-use regulation, if severe enough, can constitute a taking which must be fully compensated.

I do not mean to suggest that there is anything undesirable or devious about TDRs themselves. To the contrary,
TDRs can serve a commendable purpose in mitigating the
economic loss suffered by an individual whose property use
is restricted, and property value diminished, but not so sub520US3 Unit: $U59 [09-11-99 19:13:40] PAGES PGT: OPIN

stantially as to produce a compensable taking. They mayalso form a proper part, or indeed the entirety, of the full

compensation accorded a landowner when his property istaken. Accord, Penn Central, supra, at 152 (

Rehnquist,
J., dissenting) (noting that Penn Central had been "offeredsubstantial amounts" for its TDRs and suggesting the appropriateness of a remand for a determination of whether theTDRs are valuable enough to constitute full compensation).
I suggest only that the relevance of TDRs is limited to thecompensation side of the takings analysis, and that taking
them into account in determining whether a taking has oc-curred will render much of our regulatory takings jurisprudence a nullity, see Comment, Environmental InterestGroups and Land Regulation: Avoiding the Clutches of
Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 48 U. Miami L.Rev. 1179, 1212 (1994).

In sum, I would resolve the question of whether there hasbeen a "final decision" in this case by looking only to the
fixing of petitioner's rights to use and develop her land.There has never been any dispute over whether that has occurred. Before bringing the present suit, petitioner appliedfor permission to build a house on her lot, and was denied
permission to do so on the basis of TRPA's determinationthat her property is located within a "Stream Environment
Zone"--a designation that carries the consequence that "[n]oadditional land coverage or other permanent land disturbance shall be permitted," TRPA Code $ 20.4. Respondent infact concedes that "[w]e know the full extent of the regulation's impact in restricting petitioner's development of herown land," Brief for Respondent 21. That is all we need to
know to conclude that the "final decision" requirement hasbeen met.

751OCTOBER TERM, 1996
Syllabus

UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe first circuit

No. 95-1726. Argued January 7, 1997--Decided May 27, 1997
Title 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h) directs the United States Sentencing Commission

to "assure" that its Sentencing Guidelines specify a prison sentence "at
or near the maximum term authorized for categories of" adult offenders
who commit their third felony drug offense or violent crime. The Commission sought to implement this directive in its "Career Offender
Guideline," Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.1. That Guideline initially failed
to designate which "maximum term" a sentencing court should use when
federal law establishes a basic statutory maximum for persons convicted
of a particular offense, but also provides an enhanced penalty for career
offenders convicted of that same offense. The District Court used such
an enhancement in sentencing respondents, each of whom was convicted
of federal drug felonies and qualified as a career offender under $ 4B1.1.
After the First Circuit affirmed the convictions and sentences, the Commission adopted Amendment 506, which, inter alia, altered $ 4B1.1's
commentary to preclude consideration of statutory sentence enhancements. One District Court Judge found that Amendment 506 was contrary to $ 994(h) and refused to reduce the sentences of respondents
Dyer and Hunnewell, but another such judge upheld the amendment
and reduced respondent LaBonte's prison term. The First Circuit consolidated the ensuing appeals and held that $ 4B1.1, as construed under
Amendment 506, was a reasonable implementation of $ 994(h)'s directive.

Held: Amendment 506 is inconsistent with $ 994(h)'s plain and unambiguous language and therefore must give way. Stinson v. United States,
508 U. S. 36, 38. Assuming that Congress said what it meant in drafting $ 994(h), and giving the words used their "ordinary meaning,"
Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108, the phrase "maximum term
authorized" must be read to include all applicable statutory sentencing
enhancements. Respondents' contrary argument that the phrase refers
only to the highest penalty authorized by the offense of conviction,
excluding any enhancements, has little merit. Their assertion that

$ 994(h) is ambiguous is based, at least in part, on a strained and flawed

Amendment 506 satisfies Congress' mandate to sentence repeat offenders "at or near" the maximum sentence authorized is also rejected. Although the phrase "at or near" unquestionably permits a certain degree

statutory sentencing enhancements, as the United States ar-gues, or (2) the maximum term available without such enhancements, as the Commission has determined. We con-clude that the Commission's interpretation is inconsistent
with $ 994(h)'s plain language, and therefore hold that "maxi-mum term authorized" must be read to include all applicable
statutory sentencing enhancements.

I
A

In 1984, Congress created the Commission and charged itwith "establish[ing] sentencing policies and practices for the

Federal criminal justice system." 28 U. S. C. $ 991; see Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361, 367-370 (1989). TheCommission, however, was not granted unbounded discretion. Instead, Congress articulated general goals for fed-eral sentencing and imposed upon the Commission a variety
of specific requirements. See $$ 994(b)-(n). Among thoserequirements, Congress directed that the Commission

"shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence toa term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term
authorized for categories of defendants in which the de-fendant is eighteen years old or older and--

"(1) has been convicted of a felony that is--"(A) a crime of violence; or
"(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Con-trolled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 841) . . . ; and
"(2) has previously been convicted of two or moreprior [such] felonies . . . ." 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h).

The Commission sought to implement this directive by prom-ulgating the "Career Offender Guideline," which created a
table of enhanced total offense levels to be used in calculat-ing sentences for "career offenders." United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual $ 4B1.1 (Nov. 1987)

520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
754 UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE

Opinion of the Court
(USSG). Pursuant to that Guideline, each defendant whoqualifies for career offender status is automatically placed in

criminal history "Category VI," the highest available underthe Guidelines. The table then assigns the appropriate
offense level based on the so-called "offense statutorymaximum."

When the Commission coined the phrase "offense statu-tory maximum," it defined it, unhelpfully, as "the maximum
term of imprisonment authorized for the offense of convic-tion." USSG App. C, amdt. 267 (Nov. 1989) (adding $ 4B1.1,
comment., n. 2). Neither the Career Offender Guideline it-self, however, nor the accompanying commentary designated
which "maximum term" was to be used when federal lawestablished a basic statutory maximum for persons convicted
of a particular offense, but also provided an enhanced maxi-mum penalty for career offenders convicted of that same offense.1 The Courts of Appeals, required to choose betweensentencing "at or near the maximum" of the base sentence,
or of the base sentence plus the relevant statutory enhance-ments, uniformly concluded that the "offense statutory maximum" for a defendant with prior convictions was the en-hanced maximum term.

2

The Commission subsequently amended the Career Of-fender Guideline's commentary to preclude consideration

of statutory enhancements in calculating the "offense statu-tory maximum." Rejecting the approach prevailing in the

1 We note that imposition of an enhanced penalty is not automatic. Such
a penalty may not be imposed unless the Government files an information
notifying the defendant in advance of trial (or prior to the acceptance of a
plea) that it will rely on that defendant's prior convictions to seek a penalty enhancement. 21 U. S. C. $ 851(a)(1). If the Government does not
file such notice, however, the lower sentencing range will be applied even
though the defendant may otherwise be eligible for the increased penalty.

Opinion of the Court
Courts of Appeals, the Commission defined the phrase "of-fense statutory maximum" as:

"the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for theoffense of conviction that is a crime of violence or controlled substance offense, not including any increase inthat maximum term under a sentencing enhancement
provision that applies because of the defendant's priorcriminal record . . . ." USSG App. C, amdt. 506 (Nov.
1994) (amending USSG $ 4B1.1, comment., n. 2).
Pursuant to its authority under 28 U. S. C. $ 994(u), the Com-mission opted to give Amendment 506 retroactive effect,

providing sentencing courts with discretion to reduce sen-tences imposed before the amendment's November 1, 1994,
effective date. See USSG $ 1B1.10(c) (Nov. 1996).

B
Prior to the adoption of Amendment 506, respondentsGeorge LaBonte, Alfred Lawrence Hunnewell, and Stephen

Dyer were convicted of various federal controlled substanceoffenses in the United States District Court for the District
of Maine. Each respondent qualified as a career offenderunder USSG $ 4B1.1 (Nov. 1987), had received the required
notice that an enhanced penalty would be sought, and wassentenced under the Career Offender Guideline using the enhancement. The First Circuit affirmed each respondent'sconviction and sentence. Following the adoption of Amendment 506, however, each respondent sought a reduction inhis sentence. In the cases of respondents Dyer and Hunnewell, the District Court found that the amendment wascontrary to 21 U. S. C. $ 841(b)(1)(C) and 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h),
and refused to reduce the sentences. In respondent La-Bonte's case, however, a different judge of the same District
Court upheld the amendment and reduced LaBonte's sen-tence. The First Circuit consolidated the ensuing appeals
and a divided panel, applying the approach set forth in Chev-ron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,

467 U. S. 837 (1984), upheld Amendment 506 as an appro-priate exercise of the Commission's discretion. 70 F. 3d

1396, 1403-1409 (1995). The First Circuit looked to the stat-utory language and "f[ou]nd no clear congressional directive
regarding the meaning of the term `maximum' as that term
is used in section 994(h)." Id., at 1406. In the court's view,the meaning of the word "maximum" was influenced by its

presence in the phrase " `maximum term authorized for [cer-tain] categories of defendants.' "

Id., at 1404 (bracketed
term in original). While acknowledging that the phrasecould apply exclusively to that category of repeat offenders

for whom the Government filed a notice to seek sentence
enhancement, the court also observed that the word "categories" could plausibly be defined "to include all offenders (or
all repeat offenders) charged with transgressing the same
criminal statute, regardless of whether the prosecution
chooses to invoke the sentence-enhancing mechanism against
a particular defendant." Id., at 1404-1405 (emphasis added).
Under the latter view, the court reasoned, the word "maximum" would necessarily refer to the unenhanced statutory
maximum "since this represents the highest possible sentence applicable to all defendants in the category." Id., at
1405.

Based on that perceived ambiguity, the court explained
that the "Career Offender Guideline, read through the prism
of Amendment 506, adopts an entirely plausible version of
the categorical approach that the statute suggests." Id., at
1407. The court thus held that the Career Offender Guideline, as construed under Amendment 506, was a reasonable
implementation of $ 994(h)'s command to designate sentences
at or near the authorized maximum term. Id., at 1409.

In validating Amendment 506, the First Circuit here
reached the same conclusion as the Ninth Circuit later did in
United States v. Dunn, 80 F. 3d 402, 404 (1996). Five other
Courts of Appeals, however, have reached the opposite conclusion, finding Amendment 506 at odds with the plain lan520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Congress has delegated to the Commission "significant dis-cretion in formulating guidelines" for sentencing convicted

federal offenders. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 377. Broad asthat discretion may be, however, it must bow to the specific
directives of Congress. In determining whether Amend-ment 506 accurately reflects Congress' intent, we turn, as we
must, to the statutory language. If the Commission's re-vised commentary is at odds with $ 994(h)'s plain language,
it must give way. Cf. Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S.36, 38 (1993) (explaining that the Guidelines commentary "is
authoritative unless it violates the Constitution or a federalstatute").

In $ 994(h), Congress directed the Commission to "assure"that for adult offenders who commit their third felony drug
offense or crime of violence, the Guidelines prescribe a sen-tence of imprisonment "at or near the maximum term authorized." 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h). We do not start from thepremise that this language is imprecise. Instead, we assume that in drafting this legislation, Congress said whatit meant. Giving the words used their "ordinary meaning,"
Moskal v. United States, 498 U. S. 103, 108 (1990), we findthat the word "maximum" most naturally connotes the
"greatest quantity or value attainable in a given case."Webster's New International Dictionary 1396 (2d ed. 1958);
Black's Law Dictionary 979 (6th ed. 1990) ("The highest orgreatest amount, quality, value, or degree"). We similarly

Opinion of the Court
conclude, and the parties do not dispute, that the phrase"term authorized" refers not to the period of incarceration

specified by the Guidelines, but to that permitted by theapplicable sentencing statutes.

4 Accordingly, the phrase

"maximum term authorized" should be construed as requir-ing the "highest" or "greatest" sentence allowed by statute.

Respondents, however, argue that "maximum term au-thorized" refers only to the highest penalty authorized by
the offense of conviction, excluding any statutory sentencingenhancements. We find little merit in that contention. In
calculating the "highest" term prescribed for a specific of-fense, it is not sufficient merely to identify the basic penalty
associated with that offense. Congress has expressly pro-vided enhanced maximum penalties for certain categories of
repeat offenders in an effort to treat them more harshly thanother offenders. Section 994(h) explicitly refers, for example, to 21 U. S. C. $ 841, which establishes a base "term ofimprisonment of not more than 20 years" for certain drug
traffickers, but then adds that "[i]f any person commits sucha violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense
has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term

4 Indeed, the Commission has explicitly recognized that "the phrase
`maximum term authorized' should be construed as the maximum term
authorized by statute." USSG $ 4B1.1, comment., backg'd (Nov. 1987)
(emphasis added). And, in our view, the phrase refers to all applicable
statutes that would affect the district court's calculation of the prison
term. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, however, 18 U. S. C. $ 3584
does not affect the maximum term authorized. Section 3584 merely instructs a sentencing court whether to run "multiple terms of imprisonment" consecutively or concurrently; it says nothing about how the individual term is to be calculated. $ 3584 (emphasis added). Of course,

$ 3584(c), which the dissent highlights, post, at 770, directs that "[m]ultiple
terms of imprisonment . . . shall be treated for administrative purposes as
a single, aggregate term of imprisonment." 18 U. S. C. $ 3584(c) (emphasis
added). Each of the sections cited by the dissent falls within this "administrative purposes" carve-out, which in no way undercuts, and in fact
plainly bolsters, our point.

Opinion of the Court
of imprisonment of not more than 30 years." $ 841(b)(1)(C).
Where Congress has enacted a base penalty for first-time
offenders or nonqualifying repeat offenders, and an enhanced
penalty for qualifying repeat offenders, the "maximum term
authorized" for the qualifying repeat offenders is the enhanced, not the base, term. As a consequence, the "maximum term authorized" for repeat offenders convicted under

$ 841(b)(1)(C) is 30 years--the enhanced statutory maximum--not the unenhanced maximum of 20 years.

Respondents' assertion that $ 994(h) is ambiguous is based,
at least in part, on a strained construction of the phrase "categories of defendants." They claim that the word "categories" can be defined broadly to encompass all repeat offenders charged with violating the same criminal statute--
including those for whom the Government did not file a notice under $ 851(a)(1) and who are therefore ineligible for the
penalty enhancement. See n. 1, supra. If "categories of
defendants" is defined in this way, respondents argue, a sentence "at or near the maximum term authorized" for this
broader "category" of repeat offenders would necessarily
permit only the unenhanced maximum because this is the
highest possible sentence that could apply to all of the defendants within that category.

We see at least two serious flaws in this reasoning. First,
respondents' construction of the word "categories" is overinclusive because it subsumes within a single category both
defendants who have received notice under $ 851(a)(1) and
those who have not. The statutory scheme, however, obviously contemplates two distinct categories of repeat offenders for each possible crime. The Commission is no more free
to ignore this distinction than it is to ignore the distinction
made between those defendants who distributed certain controlled substances and those whose distribution also directly
resulted in the death of a user. See, e. g., 21 U. S. C.

$ 841(b)(1)(C). Thus, for defendants who have received the

520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
760 UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE

Opinion of the Court
notice under $ 851(a)(1), as respondents did here, the "maximum term authorized" is the enhanced term. For defendants who did not receive the notice, the unenhanced maximum applies.

Second, to read the phrase "categories of defendants" as
respondents suggest would largely eviscerate the penalty enhancements Congress enacted in statutes such as $ 841. We
are unwilling to read $ 994(h) as essentially rendering meaningless entire provisions of other statutes to which it expressly refers. Under respondents' novel construction, a repeat drug or violent felon could only receive a sentence at or
near the maximum allowed for defendants who had no such
prior qualifying convictions or who had never received the
notice under $ 851(a)(1). Indeed, if this interpretation of the
term "categories" were adopted, a sentencing court could be
forbidden to impose the enhanced maximum penalty. Congress surely did not establish enhanced penalties for
repeat offenders only to have the Commission render them
a virtual nullity.

Respondents further seek to circumvent $ 994(h)'s plain
meaning by claiming that Amendment 506 satisfies Congress'
mandate to sentence repeat offenders "at or near" the maximum sentence authorized. The flexibility afforded by the
phrase "at or near," respondents contend, justifies the Commission's decision to rely on the unenhanced maximum.
This statutory phrase unquestionably permits a certain degree of flexibility for upward and downward departures and
adjustments. The pertinent issue, however, "is not how
close the sentence must be to the statutory maximum, but to
which statutory maximum it must be close." United States
v. Fountain, 83 F. 3d 946, 952 (CA8 1996), cert. pending,
No. 96-6001. Whatever latitude $ 994(h) affords the Commission in deciding how close a sentence must come to the
maximum to be "near" it, the statute does not license the
Commission to select as the relevant "maximum term" a sen520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

761Cite as: 520 U. S. 751 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
tence that is different from the congressionally authorizedmaximum term.

5

Finally, respondents rely heavily on the Commission'sstated justifications for choosing the unenhanced maximum.

We are unmoved. First, the Commission asserted that, byprecluding the use of the statutory enhancements, Amendment 506 "avoids unwarranted double counting" of the de-fendant's prior offenses. 59 Fed. Reg. 23608, 23609 (1994).
That argument is entirely beside the point. Congress hasinstructed the Commission to assure that the sentences of
repeat offenders closely track the statutory maximum. Thenumber of steps the Commission employs to achieve that requirement is unimportant, provided the Commission's mech-anism results in sentences "at or near" the "maximum term
authorized."Second, respondents invoke the Commission's assertion
that its amended commentary eliminates "unwarranted dis-parity associated with variations in the exercise of prosecutional discretion in seeking enhanced penalties based onprior convictions."

Ibid. As we understand it, this argu-ment posits that if the Government provides notice under

$ 851(a)(1) to one defendant, but not to another, the resulting

5 Respondents' reliance on United States v. R. L. C., 503 U. S. 291 (1992),
is inapposite. There, we construed 18 U. S. C. $ 5037(c), which provides
that the sentence ordered by a court for a juvenile delinquent may not
extend beyond "the maximum term of imprisonment that would be authorized if the juvenile had been tried and convicted as an adult." We held
that the applicable "maximum" term authorized was the upper limit of the
Guidelines range that would apply to a similarly situated adult offender.
503 U. S., at 306-307. R. L. C. involved a directive to a sentencing court,
however, whereas 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h) is a directive to the Commission.
Because $ 994(h) is designed to cabin the Commission's discretion in the
promulgation of guidelines for career offenders, it would be entirely circular to suggest that the Commission had complied with $ 994(h) merely by
specifying sentences "at or near" the top of the Guidelines range. The
Commission itself recognizes that the "maximum term authorized" within
the meaning of $ 994(h) is the statutory maximum, not the otherwise applicable Guidelines maximum. See n. 4, supra.

762 UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE

Breyer, J., dissenting
difference in the maximum possible term is an "unwarranteddisparity." Insofar as prosecutors, as a practical matter,

may be able to determine whether a particular defendantwill be subject to the enhanced statutory maximum, any such
discretion would be similar to the discretion a prosecutorexercises when he decides what, if any, charges to bring
against a criminal suspect. Such discretion is an integralfeature of the criminal justice system, and is appropriate, so
long as it is not based upon improper factors. See United
States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 464-465 (1996); Wayte v.United States, 470 U. S. 598, 607 (1985). Any disparity in

the maximum statutory penalties between defendants whodo and those who do not receive the notice is a foreseeable--
but hardly improper--consequence of the statutory noticerequirement.

6

III
In sum, we hold that the phrase "at or near the maximumterm authorized" is unambiguous and requires a court to sentence a career offender "at or near" the "maximum" prisonterm available once all relevant statutory sentencing enhancements are taken into account. Accordingly, we re-verse the judgment below and remand the case for further
proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens and
Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.

Breyer, J., dissenting

$ 994(h); United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines
Manual $ 4B1.1, comment., n. 2 (Nov. 1995) (USSG). The
majority finds this interpretation unlawful. It believes that
the three statutory words are unambiguous; that they are
not susceptible to the Commission's interpretation; and that
the only possible interpretation is one that does not except
recidivist enhancement provisions.

In my view, however, the words "maximum term authorized" are ambiguous. They demand an answer to the
question "authorized by what?" The statute itself does not
tell us "what." Nor does the statute otherwise "directly
[speak] to the precise [Guideline] question at issue." Chevron U. S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
467 U. S. 837, 842 (1984); see Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S. 735 (1996). In light of the statutory
ambiguity, we should defer to the Commission's views about
what Guideline the statute permits it to write; and we should
uphold the Guideline the Commission has written because
it "is based on a permissible construction of the statute."
Chevron, supra, at 843.

A

To understand the legal issue before us, one must keep in
mind both what the Guidelines are and how they work. The
Guidelines themselves are a set of legal rules written by the
United States Sentencing Commission acting under authority delegated to it by a congressional statute, the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 (Sentencing Act), Pub. L. 98-473, $ 217,
98 Stat. 2017- 2026, as amended, 28 U. S. C. $$ 991-998. See
generally Mistretta v. United States, 488 U. S. 361 (1989).
Congress established the United States Sentencing Commission both to create a more honest sentencing system (through the elimination of parole, see Pub. L. 98-473,

$ 218(a)(5), 98 Stat. 2027) and to create a fairer system by
reducing the "unjustifiably wide range of sentences [pre520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

viously imposed upon] offenders with similar histories, con-victed of similar crimes, committed under similar circumstances," under the pre-existing indeterminate system ofsentencing. S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 38 (1983). See also

Mistretta, supra, at 366.

At the same time, Congress said that the Commission,when reducing disparity, should not "sacrific[e] proportionality"--the principle that criminal conduct of greater severityshould be punished more harshly than less serious conduct.
United States Sentencing Commission, Supplementary Re-port on the Initial Sentencing Guidelines and Policy Statements 13 (June 1987) (Supplementary Report). See also 18
U. S. C. $ 3553(a)(2)(A) (sentences should "reflect the seriousness of the offense" and "provide just punishment"); 28
U. S. C. $$ 994(a)(2) and (g). This effort to achieve proportionality required the Commission to identify those factors
that make criminal conduct more or less serious and provide
a way for those factors to be taken into account in the Guidelines. Yet because the list of relevant sentencing factors is
long, and their interaction impossibly complex, the Commission had to strike a compromise between the need for proportionality on the one hand and the need for Guidelines that
were simple enough to be administered. USSG ch. 1, pt. A3,
p. s. The upshot is a Guidelines system that balances various, sometimes conflicting, general goals, including reduction
of disparity, proportionality, and administrability.

The Guidelines divide sentencing factors into two basic
categories: "offense" characteristics and "offender" characteristics. See generally USSG $ 1B1.1. The Guidelines
first look to the characteristics of the "offense." The Guidelines tell a sentencing judge to consider the behavior in
which an offender engaged when he committed the crime of
which he was convicted. They assign a number--called a
"Base Offense Level"--to the behavior that constituted the
crime itself. (For example, they assign the Base Offense
Level 20 to robbery. Id., $ 2B3.1(a).) They next tell the

Breyer, J., dissenting
judge to look to the way in which the offender committedthe crime; and they provide specific upward adjustments in

light of certain aggravating features of the criminal behav-ior--adjustments they call "Specific Offense Characteristics." (For example, if the robber used a gun, the judge
adds six levels. Id., $ 2B3.1(b)(2)(B).)The Guidelines then tell the judge to turn to the relevant

characteristics of the defendant, see 28 U. S. C. $ 994(d)--fea-tures not of the crime, but of the criminal. In particular,
they tell the judge to assign a number of "points" determinedby what the Commission has determined to be the single
most important offender characteristic, namely, the offender's prior criminal behavior. These points in turn correspond to one of six Criminal History Categories. (For
example, if the robber had one serious prior criminal
conviction, that is, one that led to a sentence of imprisonment
of more than 13 months, the judge will assign three points,
which places the offender in Criminal History Category II.
USSG $ 4A1.1(a), and id., ch. 5, pt. A (table).)

After determining the "offense level" and Criminal History Category applicable to the offender, the sentencing
judge (after making various other possible adjustments) will
consult a table, the rows of which consist of "levels" and the
columns of which consist of "Categories." The intersection
of the appropriate row and column will normally indicate a
narrow range of months of imprisonment. (For example, at
the intersection of level 26 and Category II lies a sentencing
range of 70-87 months' imprisonment. Id., ch. 5, pt. A
(table).) In an ordinary case, the judge will sentence within
that indicated range.

I say "in an ordinary case" because almost all Guideline
rules are meant to govern typical cases. See 18 U. S. C.

$ 3553(b); 28 U. S. C. $$ 991(b)(1)(B), 994(b)(2) (requiring
strict limits upon judge's sentencing discretion in ordinary
cases). At the same time, the sentencing judge is free to
depart from the Guidelines sentence in an atypical case--one

outside the "heartland" of cases embodying the conduct thatindividual Guidelines describe. 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b); USSG

ch. 1, pt. A4(b); Koon v. United States, 518 U. S. 81, 92-96(1996). This "departure authority" is important because no
set of Guidelines can anticipate every situation. Where"there exists an aggravating or mitigating circumstance of a
kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into considerationby the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines," a judge has the authority to impose an appropriatesentence, so long as that sentence is within the range authorized by the statute under which the defendant was convicted.See 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(b); see also 28 U. S. C. $ 991(b)(1)(B).

As the Commission has pointed out, this system reflectsthe Sentencing Act's "detailed instructions . . . the most important of which directs the Commission to create categoriesof offense behavior and offender characteristics." USSG
ch. 1, pt. A2 (emphasis added). See also 28 U. S. C. $$ 994(c)and (d). Twenty-five statutory subsections, $$ 994(a)-(y),
contain these and other "detailed instructions"--instructionsthat both "delegat[e] broad authority to the Commission to
. . . rationalize the federal sentencing process," USSG ch. 1,pt. A2, and also describe, at least in rough outline, how the
Commission should go about exercising that authority. Thecase before us concerns 1 of those 25 subsections, 28 U. S. C.

$ 994(h), which I shall call the "career offender" subsection.

B
The "career offender" subsection provides more specificdirections than most other subsections. It says that the

Commission

"shall assure that the guidelines specify a sentence to aterm of imprisonment at or near the maximum term

authorized for categories of defendants in which thedefendant is eighteen years old or older and--

"(1) has been convicted of a felony that is--"(A) a crime of violence; or

Breyer, J., dissenting
"(B) an offense described in section 401 of the Con-trolled Substances Act (21 U. S. C. 841) . . . ; and

"(2) has previously been convicted of two or more[similar] prior felonies . . . ." $ 994(h) (emphasis added).

This provision, for present purposes, is not quite as compli-cated as it appears, for the words that follow the italicized
words "maximum term authorized" do not modify or ex-plain those italicized words. Rather, they describe the kind
of person whom the Commission must make certain is sen-tenced to a term "at or near the maximum term authorized."
It is as if the statute said to the Commission: Focus upon"categories" of individuals who have previously committed
two serious crimes (involving drugs or violence) and makecertain that the Guidelines specify, for those "categories" of
individuals, "a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or nearthe maximum term authorized."

The Commission has recently rewritten the Guideline sothat it now imposes sentences based upon

"the maximum term of imprisonment authorized for theoffense of conviction . . . not including any increase in
that maximum term under a sentencing enhancementprovision that applies because of the defendant's prior
criminal record." USSG $ 4B1.1, comment., n. 2.
To understand how the new Guideline works, consider anexample: The basic drug distribution statute, 21 U. S. C.

$ 841, has two relevant subsections, (a) and (b). Subsection(a) makes it a crime to "possess" a "controlled substance,"
such as cocaine, with "intent to distribute" it. Subsection(b) sets forth penalties--both minimum and maximum penalties--for violating subsection (a). Those penalties dependprimarily upon the amount of drugs at issue, but also upon
recidivism. One part of subsection (b), namely, subsection(b)(1)(B), for example, specifies a minimum penalty of 5 years
and a maximum penalty of 40 years where the amount ofcocaine ranges from 500 grams to 5 kilograms. A later por520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN
768 UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE

Breyer, J., dissenting
tion of that part increases the minimum penalty to 10 yearsand the maximum penalty to life if the offender has a previous drug felony conviction. The Commission's CareerOffender Guideline treats the statutory term "authorized"
as if it referred to the "maximums" that $ 841 provides,
except for this last-mentioned part.

II
We must decide whether the career offender statute per-mits the Commission to write this Career Offender Guideline--a Guideline that looks to the maximum sentences thatindividual criminal statutes authorize for the

behavior thatconstitutes the offense. That Guideline does not look to the

maximum sentence that an individual criminal statute au-thorizes for recidivism--perhaps the most important offender characteristic. In a sense, it says that the careeroffender statute, which tells the Commission to transform
statutory maximums into approximate Guideline minimums,
is Congress' basic recidivism provision. That is to say, theCommission's Guideline essentially reads the career offender

statute as permitting an implementing Guideline that sub-stitutes for, rather than supplements, other statutory
recidivism-based maximum-sentence enhancements.The question that divides this Court is not about the wisdom of this implementing interpretation. It is whether the"career offender" statute's words "maximum term authorized" are open to the Commission's interpretation or whetherthey

unambiguously forbid it. In my view, the words,whether read by themselves, read within the context of sentencing law, or read against the historic background of sen-tencing reform, do not unambiguously forbid the Guideline.
Rather, their ambiguity indicates that Congress simply hasnot "addressed the precise question."

Chevron, 467 U. S.,at 843.

First, the language itself--the words "maximum termauthorized"--is ambiguous. As I previously pointed out,

520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

769Cite as: 520 U. S. 751 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
supra, at 767, the immediately subsequent words (about cat-egories of offenders) do not explain the words "maximum

term authorized," for they do not modify those words.Hence the question remains, "authorized by what?" All parties agree that the relevant maximum is the maximum set
by sentencing statutes and not, for example, the top of theotherwise applicable Guideline range. But still, to

which
sentencing statutes does the phrase refer? The answer tothis question is not written upon the statute's face.

The phrase could not possibly refer to every sentencingstatute, nor to every statute that controls the length of
the maximum legally possible sentence for a particular offender or kind of offender. It seems most unlikely that the
phrase was intended to include, for example, 18 U. S. C.

$ 3565(a)(2)--a statute that authorizes a sentence for a probation violator up to the maximum initially available for the
underlying crime. I have never heard anyone claim that an
offender who commits his third drug crime while on probation for, say, a minor part in a counterfeiting offense, see

$ 471; USSG $ 2B5.1, should receive a sentence that approximates the statutory maximum for the drug offense plus the
15-year counterfeiting statutory maximum added in addition.
But see ante, at 757-758.

Nor, to take another example, could the phrase mean to
include the federal statute that governs "[m]ultiple sentences
of imprisonment," 18 U. S. C. $ 3584--a statute that grants
sentencing judges broad authority to "run" multiple sentences either "concurrently or consecutively." That statute
would permit a judge to impose, say, a 20-year maximum
sentence for each count of a six-count indictment and run
those sentences consecutively, producing a total sentence of
120 years. Yet judges would not impose a sentence of 120
years upon an offender who engaged in a single related set
of six 10-gram cocaine sales, even if each sale were the subject of a separate count in a prosecutor's indictment. (The
Guidelines would not permit this 120-year imaginary sen520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
tence. See USSG $$ 3D1.2(d), 3D1.3(b).) No one thinksthat Congress intended the Commission to write its "career

offender" Guideline with an eye toward the maximum sen-tences that this kind of statute (the "multiple sentences"
statute) theoretically would authorize.

The majority, in providing a set of arguments for the cor-rect conclusion that the phrase "maximum term authorized"

does not include the statute just mentioned, effectively con-cedes this point. The majority cannot say that the terms of
imprisonment authorized by this statute do not even potentially fall within the scope of the phrase "maximum term
authorized," for the majority's interpretation of this statute--intended to avoid its application--is itself neither obvious nor even necessarily correct. (Compare the majority's
use of the words "term of imprisonment," for example, see
ante, at 758, n. 4, with the numerous instances in which sentencing law, including a portion of the "multiple sentence"
statute itself, 18 U. S. C. $ 3584(c), uses those words to refer
to the actual time to be served as the result of a sentence
imposed on a defendant. E. g., $$ 3582, 3585, 3621, 3624.)
And once one understands the need to engage in rather complex exercises in statutory interpretation to separate out,
from the set of all potentially applicable sentencing statutes,
those to which the word "authorized" refers, one understands that the referent of that word "authorized" is not obvious--and that is the main point here at issue.

Nor can one resolve the linguistic ambiguity by claiming
(as the drafters of the relevant statutory language seem to
have claimed, see infra, at 775) that Congress simply meant
to refer to the maximum statutory penalties for the "offenses" of which offenders are convicted. That is because
the word "offense" is a technical term in the criminal law,
referring to a crime made up of statutorily defined "elements." See Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 604
(1994); Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985).
Although some criminal statutes consider recidivism an ele520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:24] PAGES PGT: OPIN

771Cite as: 520 U. S. 751 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
ment of the offense, e. g., 18 U. S. C. $ 922(g) (felon in posses-sion of a firearm), many other important criminal statutes

do not. Under the drug possession statute, for example,recidivism is

not an element of the offense, but, rather,
a sentencing-related circumstance that the prosecution need
not charge or prove at trial. Compare 21 U. S. C. $ 841(a)(defining the offense) with $ 841(b) (setting penalties). Thus,

one might read the statute as referring to the maximum sen-tences imposed for "offenses" technically defined (a reading
that would leave out most statutory recidivism enhance-ments) or one might not. The language of the statute, even
if read as referring to offenses, does not say.

Second, background sentencing law does not provide an
unambiguous answer to the "authorized by what" question.
That background law includes a fundamental distinction
between "offense characteristics" and "offender characteristics." This distinction underlies the Guidelines' basic
structure, see supra, at 764-766; it is embodied in the
Commission's authorizing statute, 28 U. S. C. $$ 994(c) and
(d); and it grows out of pre-Guideline sentencing law, see,
e. g., Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U. S. 280, 304 (1976)
(plurality opinion); Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe,
302 U. S. 51, 55 (1937). Thus, it is not surprising that the
Commission should write a Career Offender Guideline that
itself reflects that distinction; nor can one consider the distinction arbitrary, as if, for example, the Commission were
to have picked and chosen among different offense characteristics. Cf. ante, at 759. To the contrary, this aspect of
background sentencing law makes plausible a reading that
sees this directive to create a generally applicable Career
Offender Guideline as, in a sense, a substitute for other, more
specific recidivism-based sentence enhancements already
scattered throughout the Federal Criminal Code. Of course,
one could also read the statute as a supplement to those provisions. But the statute itself does not tell us which reading
is correct.

772 UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE

Breyer, J., dissenting
One further background circumstance helps to explain whythe Commission's reading of the statute is not arbitrary,

i. e.,
why it is not unreasonable for the Guideline to treat recidi-vist enhancements differently from enhancements based on

conduct. The career offender subsection was enacted in the
context of a sweeping overhaul of the federal system of crim-inal sentencing brought about by the Sentencing Act. One

objective of the Act was honesty in sentencing, the idea thatan offender actually should serve approximately the time
stated in the sentence that the judge imposed. S. Rep. No.98-225, at 56. Congress achieved this objective by abolishing parole. It thereby transformed the sentence the judge
pronounced from an enormous overstatement (given the fact
that the offender would have spent perhaps one-third to
one-half or even more of that time on parole), into real-time
years almost all of which the offender would actually spend
in prison. In other words, given parole, a 30-year sentence
might mean 10 to 20 years; a 15-year sentence might mean 5.
See generally id., at 46-49; Supplementary Report, App. C.

When it abolished parole, however, Congress did not expect the Commission to write Guidelines that automatically
transformed into "real time" the parole-inflated 20- or 30-
year terms that judges had previously imposed upon, say,
bank robbers or drug offenders. Rather Congress expected
the Commission to adjust the length of the sentence the
judge pronounced downward to reflect the fact that henceforth there would be no parole and the offender would really
serve close to the entire term. See 28 U. S. C. $ 994(m).
That is what the Commission did. Supplementary Report
21.

This contextual circumstance helps to explain why Congress might indeed have expected that the Commission
would read the career offender subsection to refer to statutory offenses plus conduct-based enhancements alone (without recidivism-based sentence enhancements). Congress realized that the pre-Guideline sentencing system would have

520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

773Cite as: 520 U. S. 751 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
translated the words "20 years maximum" in, say, a drugstatute into maximum sentences that approximated, say, 12

real-time years. Congress similarly realized that the pre-Guideline sentencing system would have translated the
words "30 years maximum" in, say, a drug statute's recidivism provision, into maximum sentences that approximated,say, 20 real-time years. That is to say, Congress realized

that, pre-Guidelines (because of parole), even the most seri-ous class of recidivist offenders (in the absence of other aggravating conduct) would have likely been imprisoned for nomore than 20 real-time years. Under these circumstances,
a legislator could reasonably have taken the career offender
statute's basic objective as one of assuring that all three-time
recidivists serve the, say, 20 real-time years that only the
worst of them would previously have served. That is to say,
by mandating sentences at or near the (newly enacted) 20
year nonrecidivist maximum (for large quantities of cocaine),
the career offender subsection would ensure that all career
offenders serve terms at or near the real-time maximum that
only the most serious offenders would have served under a
pre-Guidelines (parole-based) system. And in this way as
well, the career-offender provision would significantly increase the likely real-time sentences served by most threetime offenders.

To understand the impact of real-time sentencing thus
helps explain why recidivist maximums are different from
maximums associated with offense characteristics; it shows
how the Commission's reading is consistent with Congress'
obvious intent to increase recidivist sentences significantly;
it shows how a general recidivist Guideline has an effect of
a different kind than the statutory recidivist enhancements
contained in prior law and hence might have been thought of
as operating without reference to those enhancements; and it
explains how legislators might reasonably have sought the
goals implicit in the Commission's reading of the statute. Of
course, it may also be the case that no legislator actually

774 UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE

Breyer, J., dissenting
considered the problem before us. Or Congress instead
might have had quite different goals in mind. As the majority says, Congress might have intended the Commission to
insist that all three-time career offenders serve a real-time
sentence significantly longer that the worst of them would
likely have served before the Guidelines. The important
point for present purposes is that the statute itself does not
tell us which of these alternative goals Congress sought to
achieve. The basic objectives of the career offender subsection--ensuring increased penalties for recidivist offenders
who have committed crimes involving drugs or violence--
and of sentencing reform are consistent with either basic
purpose and thus do not resolve the ambiguity.

Third, the statute's legislative history, insofar as it is relevant, helps to explain why any search for a clear expression
of congressional intent is pointless. When first enacted into
law, the career offender subsection did not leave the word
"authorized" hanging in midair. Rather, it said "maximum
term authorized by section 3581(b) of title 18, United States
Code." Pub. L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2021 (emphasis added).
The subsection to which the word "authorized" referred--a
subsection that classified crimes by letter--read as follows:

"Authorized Terms.--The authorized terms of imprisonment are--

"(1) for a Class A felony, the duration of the defendant's life or any period of time;

"(2) for a Class B felony, not more than twenty-five
years;

"(3) for a Class C felony, not more than twelve years;
"(4) for a Class D felony, not more than six years;
"(5) for a Class E felony, not more than three years;
"(6) for a Class A misdemeanor, not more than one
year;

"(7) for a Class B misdemeanor, not more than six
months;

Breyer, J., dissenting
"(8) for a Class C misdemeanor, not more than thirtydays; and

"(9) for an infraction, not more than five days." 18U. S. C. $ 3581(b).

A cross-reference to this classifying subsection does not help,however, for that subsection serves almost no significant
purpose in the Federal Criminal Code. In fact, Congresslater enacted a technical amendment that eliminated the
cross-reference (leaving the word "authorized" without anexplicit reference), Pub. L. 99-646, 100 Stat. 3592, because
the cross-reference was "misleading" and "incorrect" in that"[t]o date, no Federal offense" uses the classification system
in the section to which it referred. H. R. Rep. No. 99-797,p. 18 (1986). The drafters of the technical amendment
thought that the "maximum term of an offense is that termprescribed by the provision of law defining the offense."
Ibid. But, as we have seen, this view of the matter is notconclusive. See supra, at 770-771.

One can find a possible historical explanation for what oc-curred. The classifying subsection, like the sentencing law
itself, originated in a congressional effort to rewrite the en-tire Federal Criminal Code. See, e. g., S. 1, 94th Cong., 1st
Sess. (1975); S. 1437, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. (1978); S. 1630, 97thCong., 2d Sess. (1981). That rewrite attached a classifying
letter to each substantive crime. The classifying subsectionattached a maximum penalty to each letter; and the penalty
was a real-time penalty, for the rewrite contained the laterenacted new sentencing law, which abolished parole and created real-time sentences. For example, the rewrite charac-terized its only drug recidivism provision--an enhanced penalty for a recidivist opiate crime--as a Class B felony; towhich the classifying subsection attached a 25-year maximum sentence. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 95-605, pt. 1, pp. 798,801 (1977). The rewrite did not become law. Congress, instead, enacted into law its sentencing provisions, which in-cluded a career offender statute that initially contained a

520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN
776 UNITED STATES v. LaBONTE

Breyer, J., dissenting
cross-reference to the classifying subsection that no longerserved any significant purpose.

This history may help to explain why Congress did notdirectly provide a clear cross-reference in the career offender
subsection. But it does not itself provide such a reference.
A reader still might see in that subsection a predominatingcongressional focus upon increasing

all career offenders'
real-time terms to a typical real-time maximum term (inwhich case it is natural to read the subsection as omitting

statutory recidivism provisions) or one might see in it apredominating congressional insistence upon further major

increases in the real-time maximum terms themselves (in
which case it is natural to read the subsection's crossreference as picking up statutory recidivism provisions).
The subsection's language, whether read by itself, read in
a broader context of sentencing law, or read against the provision's history, is consistent with either interpretation.

Finally, the majority is wrong when it argues that the Career Offender Guideline "eviscerate[s] the penalty enhancements Congress enacted in statutes such as $ 841." Ante, at
760. Section 841 increases maximum penalties for recidivists, for example, for crimes involving less than 500 grams
of cocaine, from 20 years to 30 years. The Commission's
career offender penalties for these offenses yield sentences
"at or near" the "non-recidivist" maximum. This increased
statutory maximum increases what would otherwise be a
statutory cap on any sentence imposed, thereby permitting
the sentencing judge to sentence a recidivist to more than
the statute's first offender maximum (20 years for 30 grams).
Consequently, the statutory increase authorizes a higher sentence when the relevant Guideline range reaches beyond that
first offender maximum (as it does in the case of some of the
ranges prescribed by the Career Offender Guideline). See,
e. g., USSG $ 4B1.1 (table); id., ch. 5, pt. A (table). It authorizes a higher sentence when the sentencing judge faces
an atypical case warranting a departure upward. See 18

520US3 Unit: $U60 [09-11-99 17:40:25] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Breyer, J., dissenting
U. S. C. $ 3553(b). And, most important, it authorizes ahigher sentence should the Commission decide to write other

Guidelines with specific offense characteristics that tell ajudge to sentence certain especially dangerous recidivists
(say, violent drug offenders) to more than the first offendermaximums. See,

e. g., USSG $ 2D1.1(a)(1).The upshot is that the majority cannot find here, or anywhere else in sentencing law, a clear indication of what Con-gress must have meant by its open-ended term "authorized."
The term is ambiguous. III

Although the Court does not "decide whether the Commis-sion is owed deference under Chevron," ante, at 762, n. 6, I
believe that it is. Chevron directs courts to defer to "anagency's construction of the statute which it administers,"
467 U. S., at 842, when Congress, because it has not clearlyaddressed an issue in the statute itself, likely intends that
the consequent

"ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by theagency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts)

to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguityallows. See Chevron, supra, at 843-844." Smiley v.
Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U. S., at 741.
This kind of inference makes sense in this case. Althoughthe Commission is in the "judicial branch" of Government,

28 U. S. C. $ 991(a); Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 384-397, Congressintended it to carry out a task similar to rulemaking tasks
that Congress has often delegated to administrative agen-cies. The Commission's overall congressional mandate is
sweeping. See 28 U. S. C. $ 994(f) ("providing certainty andfairness in sentencing and reducing unwarranted sentence
disparities"); $ 991(b). Without broad delegated authority, itwould not be possible to reconcile Congress' general objectives--of uniformity, proportionality, and administrability--nor to reconcile those general objectives with a host of more

Breyer, J., dissenting
specific statutory instructions. $ 994. Thus the very na-ture of the task, along with the structure of the Sentencing

Act, indicates a congressional intent to delegate primarily tothe Commission the job of interpreting, and harmonizing, the
authorizing Act's specific statutory instructions--subject, of
course, to the kind of judicial supervision and review thatcourts would undertake were the Commission a typical administrative agency. This Court has previously implied thatthis is so. See

Stinson v. United States, 508 U. S. 36, 44-45
(1993); cf. Mistretta, supra, at 393-394.Were the Commission a typical administrative agency, we

would ask whether its "policy" choice is "reasonable," hence
"permissible," given the statute. Chevron, supra, at 843-
844, 866. And we would give the Commission considerable
interpretive leeway in light of the fact that the choice here
at issue lies at the very heart of the Commission's policyrelated "expertise." Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 651-652 (1990) ("[P]ractical

agency expertise is one of the principal justifications behind
Chevron deference"); Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n
v. Schor, 478 U. S. 833, 845 (1986). The Commission's exercise of that expertise here--its Career Offender Guideline--
meets this legal requirement.

As a matter of policy, the Commission could take account
of the fact that the Guideline that the majority believes the
statute requires would significantly interfere with one of the
Sentencing Act's basic objectives--greater uniformity in sentencing. 28 U. S. C. $$ 991(b)(1)(B), 994(f ). That is because
at least one important set of statutory recidivist enhancements--the drug crime enhancements contained in 21
U. S. C. $ 841(b)--may be imposed only when the prosecutor
files a specific document requesting it. $ 851(a). Consequently, the majority's interpretation of 28 U. S. C. $ 994(h)
places significant power in the hands of the prosecutor to
determine the length of the offender's sentence; and different
prosecutors at different times may exercise that power in

different ways. The Commission concluded that its inter-pretation avoids "unwarranted disparity associated with

variations in the exercise of prosecut[orial] discretion," 59Fed. Reg. 23608, 23609 (1994), in furtherance of the overriding congressional objective. 28 U. S. C. $ 991(b)(1)(B).

The majority counters that "any such discretion would besimilar to the discretion a prosecutor exercises when he decides what, if any, charges to bring against a criminal sus-pect."

Ante, at 762. But this reply overlooks the fact that
the Guidelines themselves, by basing punishments primarilyupon the actual behavior that underlies an offense, are written to diminish the impact of such prosecutorial discretion.
See USSG $ 1B1.3. The Commission recognized that the
problem is one of diminishing, rather than aggravating, sentencing disparity among similarly situated defendants. And
the Commission's interpretation finds support in that basic
objective.

As a matter of policy, the Commission was free to consider
the practical impact of the competing interpretations--in
terms both of their comparative effectiveness in furthering
the basic goals of punishment (deterrence, incapacitation,
just deserts, rehabilitation), 18 U. S. C. $ 3553(a); 28 U. S. C.

$ 994(a)(2); USSG ch. 1, pt. A3, and their comparative costs
in terms of real resources, 28 U. S. C. $ 994(g). And it might
have thought that its present interpretation better balanced
these objectives.

Consider an example: The ordinary (non-Career Offender)
Guideline sentence, applicable to a three-time offender, for
possession with intent to distribute a single dose of cocaine
is 18 months; for possession with intent to distribute 400
grams it is 6 years. The statutory first-offender maximum
is 20 years. The recidivist maximum is 30 years. As a matter of policy, the Commission might have thought that an
increase from 18 months (or 6 years) to 20 real-time years
adequately served basic punishment objectives (as well as
Congress' specific instruction to assure "substantial prison

Breyer, J., dissenting
terms" for repeat drug offenders, S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 175).And, at the same time, it might have thought an increase to

30 real-time years would have added significantly to costs,without significantly advancing any other punitive purpose.
See generally Supplementary Report 71, 73 (predicting
an 8%-10% increase in federal prison populations from 1987to 2002 due solely to the effects of the career offender

subsection).Finally, as a matter of policy, the Commission might have
believed the Guidelines would create a more coherent sen-tencing system if its Career Offender Guideline basically recreated recidivist real-time maximums, rather than increasing those maximums by folding in the additional time that
previously had represented parole. Supra, at 772-774.

This discussion of policy may help to make clear one reason
why I find the majority's decision regrettable. The decision
interferes with a legitimate exercise of the Commission's authority to write Guidelines that reconcile the various, sometimes competing, goals that Congress set forth. The United
States Criminal Code contains a highly complicated group of
statutes. Congress wrote many of them long before it
thought of creating sentencing Guidelines. Congress continues to write other statutes that the Commission, when
revising its Guidelines, may, or may not, find easy to reconcile with what has gone before. Congress understood that
the Commission's task is complex. Congress understood the
importance of the statute's general goals--a fairer and more
rational sentencing system. I believe that courts, when interpreting the authorizing Act, should recall Congress' overriding objectives and Congress' understood need to grant to
this arm of the "judicial branch of the United States," 28
U. S. C. $ 991(a), the discretionary authority necessary to
achieve them. I would allow the Commission to interpret
the ambiguous words of the statute before us with these
general congressional objectives in mind.

I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY, ALABAMA
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eleventh circuit

No. 96-542. Argued March 18, 1997--Decided June 2, 1997
After spending six years on Alabama's death row, petitioner's capital

murder conviction was reversed on the ground that the State had
suppressed exculpatory evidence. He then sued respondent Monroe
County and others under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for the allegedly unconstitutional actions of, inter alios, County Sheriff Tom Tate in suppressing
the evidence. A county is liable under $ 1983 for those actions of its
sheriff that constitute county "policy." Monell v. New York City Dept.
of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694. The District Court dismissed the
claims, holding that Tate's unlawful acts did not represent Monroe
County's policy, because an Alabama county has no authority to make
law enforcement policy. The Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that
a sheriff acting in his law enforcement capacity is not a policymaker for
the county.

Held: Alabama sheriffs, when executing their law enforcement duties,

represent the State of Alabama, not their counties. Pp. 784-796.

(a) In determining a local government's $ 1983 liability, a court's task
is to identify those who speak with final policymaking authority for the
local governmental actor concerning the action alleged to have caused
the violation at issue. Jett v. Dallas Independent School Dist., 491
U. S. 701, 737. The parties agree that Sheriff Tate has final policymaking authority in the area of law enforcement, but they disagree about
whether Alabama sheriffs are policymakers for the State or the county
when acting in their law enforcement capacity. In deciding this dispute, the question is not whether Alabama sheriffs act as county or state
officials in all of their official actions, but whom they represent in a
particular area or on a particular issue. Ibid. This inquiry is dependent on the definition of the official's functions under relevant state law.
Cf. Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425, 429, n. 5. Pp. 784-786.

(b) The Court defers considerably to the Court of Appeals' expertise
in interpreting Alabama law, see Jett, supra, at 738, and concludes that
the State's constitutional provisions concerning sheriffs, the historical
development of those provisions, and the interpretation given them by
the State Supreme Court strongly support Monroe County's contention
that sheriffs represent the State when acting in their law enforcement
capacity. The relevant portions of the Alabama Code, although less

520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:20] PAGES PGT: OPIN
782 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY

Syllabus
compelling, also support this conclusion. Code provisions cutting in
favor of the conclusion that sheriffs are county officials are insufficient
to tip the balance in petitioner's favor. Pp. 786-793.

(c) The Court rejects petitioner's arguments that the result here
will create a lack of uniformity in Alabama--by allowing 67 county sheriffs to have different state law enforcement policies in their counties--
and throughout the country--by permitting sheriffs to be classified as
state officials in some States and county officials in others. The common law itself envisioned the possibility that state law enforcement
"policies" might vary locally, as particular sheriffs adopted varying practices for arresting criminals or securing evidence. And the Nation's
federal nature allows the States wide authority to set up their state and
local governments as they wish. Petitioner's and his amici's concern
that state and local governments will manipulate local officials' titles
in a blatant effort to shield local governments from liability is foreclosed by St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112, 127 (plurality opinion).
Pp. 793-796.

Opinion of the Court
Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of theCourt.

Petitioner sued Monroe County, Alabama, under Rev. Stat.$ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, for allegedly unconstitutional actions taken by Monroe County Sheriff Tom Tate. If thesheriff 's actions constitute county "policy," then the county
is liable for them. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social
Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978). The parties agree that thesheriff is a "policymaker" for $ 1983 purposes, but they disagree about whether he is a policymaker for Monroe Countyor for the State of Alabama. We hold that, as to the actions
at issue here, Sheriff Tate represents the State of Alabamaand is therefore not a county policymaker. We thus affirm
the Court of Appeals' dismissal of petitioner's $ 1983 claimsagainst Monroe County.

I
In November 1986, Ronda Morrison was murdered in Mon-roe County, a sparsely populated county located in southwest

Alabama. Petitioner and one Ralph Myers were indicted forthis crime. Myers then pleaded guilty to a lesser offense
and testified against petitioner at his trial. A jury convictedpetitioner of capital murder, and the trial court sentenced
him to death. After two remands, the Alabama Court ofCriminal Appeals reversed petitioner's conviction, holding
that the State had violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83(1963), by suppressing statements from Myers that contradicted his trial testimony and other exculpatory evidence.
McMillian v. State, 616 So. 2d 933, 942-948 (1993). Thus,after spending six years in prison, petitioner was released.

He then brought this $ 1983 lawsuit in the District Courtfor the Middle District of Alabama against respondent Monroe County and numerous officials, including the three menin charge of investigating the Morrison murder--Tom Tate,
the Sheriff of Monroe County; Larry Ikner, an investigatorwith the District Attorney's office in Monroe County; and
Simon Benson, an investigator with the Alabama Bureau of

Opinion of the Court
Investigation. Only two of the officials were sued in theirofficial capacities--Sheriff Tate and investigator Ikner--and

it is only these official-capacity suits that concern us here.1Petitioner principally alleged that Tate and Ikner, in their
capacities as officials of Monroe County, not as officers of theState of Alabama, intimidated Myers into making false statements and suppressed exculpatory evidence. App. to Pet.for Cert. 26a-33a;

McMillian v. Johnson, 878 F. Supp. 1473,1486-1488 (MD Ala. 1995).

The District Court dismissed the claims against MonroeCounty and the claims against Tate and Ikner in their official
capacities. The court held that "any unlawful acts of De-fendants Tate and Ikner cannot be said to represent [Monroe] County's policy," because "an Alabama county has [no]authority to make policy in the area of law enforcement."
App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a. Petitioner appealed the District
Court's decision as to Sheriff Tate. The Court of Appealsfor the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, agreeing with the District

Court that "Sheriff Tate is not a final policymaker for Mon-roe County in the area of law enforcement, because Monroe
County has no law enforcement authority." McMillian v.

"identify those officials or governmental bodies who speakwith final policymaking authority for the local governmental

actor concerning the action alleged to have caused the partic-ular constitutional or statutory violation at issue."

Jett v.
Dallas Independent School Dist., 491 U. S. 701, 737 (1989).
Here, the parties agree that Sheriff Tate has "final policy-making authority" in the area of law enforcement. They

sharply disagree, however, about whether Alabama sheriffsare policymakers for the State or for the county when they
act in a law enforcement capacity.2In deciding this dispute, our inquiry is guided by two principles. First, the question is not whether Sheriff Tate actsfor Alabama or Monroe County in some categorical, "all or
nothing" manner. Our cases on the liability of local govern-ments under $ 1983 instruct us to ask whether governmental
officials are final policymakers for the local government in aparticular area, or on a particular issue. See

ibid. (court
must identify "those officials who have the power to make
official policy on a particular issue" (emphasis added)); id.,
at 738 (question is whether school district superintendent

485 U. S. 112, 123 (1988) (plurality opinion) ("[T]he challenged action must have been taken pursuant to a policy
adopted by the official or officials responsible under state law
for making policy in that area of the city's business"). Thus,
we are not seeking to make a characterization of Alabama
sheriffs that will hold true for every type of official action
they engage in. We simply ask whether Sheriff Tate repre2 We have explained that a suit against a governmental officer "in his
official capacity" is the same as a suit " `against [the] entity of which [the]
officer is an agent,' " Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U. S. 159, 165 (1985) (quoting Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs., 436 U. S. 658, 690,
n. 55 (1978)), and that victory in such an "official-capacity" suit "imposes
liability on the entity that [the officer] represents," Brandon v. Holt, 469
U. S. 464, 471 (1985).

Opinion of the Court
sents the State or the county when he acts in a law enforcement capacity.

Second, our inquiry is dependent on an analysis of state
law. Cf. Jett, supra, at 737 (" `[W]hether a particular official
has "final policymaking authority" is a question of state law' "
(quoting, with original emphasis, Praprotnik, supra, at 123
(plurality opinion))); Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U. S. 469,
483 (1986) (plurality opinion) (same). This is not to say that
state law can answer the question for us by, for example,
simply labeling as a state official an official who clearly
makes county policy. But our understanding of the actual
function of a governmental official, in a particular area, will
necessarily be dependent on the definition of the official's
functions under relevant state law. Cf. Regents of Univ. of
Cal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425, 429, n. 5 (1997) ("[The] federal
question can be answered only after considering the provisions of state law that define the agency's character").

B
The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit determined
that under Alabama law, a sheriff acting in his law enforcement capacity is not a policymaker for the county. Since the
jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals includes Alabama, we
defer considerably to that court's expertise in interpreting
Alabama law.3 See Jett, supra, at 738 ("We think the Court
of Appeals [for the Fifth Circuit], whose expertise in interpreting Texas law is greater than our own, is in a better
position to determine whether [the school district superintendent] possessed final policymaking authority in the area
of employee transfers"); Pembaur, supra, at 484, n. 13 ("We

3 We note that two of the three judges on the Eleventh Circuit's panel
are based in Alabama. In addition, this is the second Eleventh Circuit
panel to have reached this conclusion. See Swint v. Wadley, 5 F. 3d 1435,
1450-1451 (1993), vacated for lack of appellate jurisdiction, 514 U. S. 35
(1995).

Opinion of the Court
generally accord great deference to the interpretation andapplication of state law by the courts of appeals").

We begin with the Alabama Constitution, "the supremelaw of the state." Alexander v. State ex rel. Carver, 150
So. 2d 204, 208 (Ala. 1963). We agree with the Court of Ap-peals that the constitutional provisions concerning sheriffs,
the historical development of those provisions, and the inter-pretation given them by the Alabama Supreme Court
strongly support Monroe County's contention that sheriffsrepresent the State, at least for some purposes. Alabama's
Constitution, adopted in 1901, states that "[t]he executive department shall consist of a governor, lieutenant governor,
attorney-general, state auditor, secretary of state, statetreasurer, superintendent of education, commissioner of agriculture and industries, and a sheriff for each county." Ala.Const. of 1901, Art. V, $ 112. This designation is especially
important for our purposes, because although every AlabamaConstitution has included sheriffs as constitutional officers
and has provided for their election by county voters, see Ala.Const. of 1819, Art. IV, $ 24; Ala. Const. of 1861, Art. IV, $ 24;
Ala. Const. of 1865, Art. VII, $ 3; Ala. Const. of 1867, Art. V,

$ 21; Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. V, $ 26; Ala. Const. of 1901,Art. V, $ 138, sheriffs have not always been explicitly listed

as members of the state "executive department." Thus, the1867 Constitution listed only the "governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, and attorneygeneral" as constituting "the executive department." Ala.
Const. of 1867, Art. V, $ 1. This changed with the 1875 Con-stitution, when sheriffs and the superintendent of education
were added to the list. Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. V, $ 1.4

4 Executive department officers have to take the constitutional oath of
office, Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. XVII, $ 279; Ala. Const. of 1875, Art. XV,

$ 1, and are required to submit written reports to the Governor on demand. Submitting a false report was originally a crime, Ala. Const. of
1875, Art. V, $ 9, and is now an impeachable offense, Ala. Const. of 1901,
Art. V, $ 121.

788 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
The framers of the 1901 Constitution took two significantsteps in an attempt to solidify the place of sheriffs in the

executive department, and to clarify that sheriffs were act-ing for the State when exercising their law enforcement
functions. First, faced with reports that sheriffs were
allowing mobs to abduct prisoners and lynch them, the fram-ers made such "neglect" by sheriffs an impeachable offense.

See Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. V, $ 138 ("Whenever any pris-oner is taken from jail, or from the custody of any sheriff or
his deputy, and put to death, or suffers grievous bodily harm,owing to the neglect, connivance, cowardice, or other grave
fault of the sheriff, such sheriff may be impeached"); State
ex rel. Garber v. Cazalas, 162 Ala. 210, 50 So. 296 (1909)
(sheriff 's failure to close jail doors, resulting in lynching of
prisoner, constitutes impeachable offense); M. McMillan,Constitutional Development in Alabama, 1789-1901, p. 338,

n. 186 (1955) (impeachment provision resulted in "much prog-ress made against lynching").

Second, authority to impeach sheriffs was moved from thecounty courts to the State Supreme Court, because of "[t]he
failure of county courts to punish sheriffs for neglect ofduty."

Parker v. Amerson, 519 So. 2d 442, 443 (Ala. 1987).
One of the primary purposes of this change, proposed by
ex-Governor Thomas Goode Jones at the 1901 Convention,
was "to augment the power of the Governor." Id., at 444.
After this change, the Governor could order the State Supreme Court, rather than the county court, to begin impeachment proceedings against a wayward sheriff, and
would not have to worry that local support for the sheriff
would annul his effort at centralized control. See ibid.;
Strengthening the Power of the Executive, Address of
Emmet O'Neal, Governor of Alabama, pp. 9-10 (Sept. 12,
1911) (new impeachment provision increases Governor's control of sheriffs and "gives the Executive real power which
is respected and feared"). Thus, sheriffs now share the
same impeachment procedures as state legal officers and
lower state court judges, Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. VII, $ 174,

Opinion of the Court
rather than county and municipal officers, Ala. Const. of 1875,Art. VII, $ 3.

Critically for our case, the Alabama Supreme Court hasinterpreted these provisions and their historical background
as evidence of "the framers' intent to ensure that sheriffsbe considered executive officers of the state."

Parker, 519So. 2d, at 444. Based primarily on this understanding of

the State Constitution, the court has held unequivocally thatsheriffs are state officers, and that tort claims brought
against sheriffs based on their official acts therefore consti-tute suits against the State, not suits against the sheriff 's
county. Id., at 443-445.5 Thus, Alabama counties are notliable under a theory of respondeat superior for a sheriff 's
official acts that are tortious. Id., at 442. The issues inParker are strikingly similar to the ones in the present case,
and that decision is therefore strong evidence in favor of theCourt of Appeals' conclusion that sheriffs act on behalf of
the State, rather than the county, when acting in their lawenforcement capacity.

Turning from the Alabama Constitution to the AlabamaCode, the relevant provisions are less compelling, but still
support the conclusion of the Court of Appeals to some ex-tent. Section 36-22-3 of the code sets out a sheriff 's duties.
First, a sheriff must "attend upon" the state courts in hiscounty, must "obey the lawful orders and directions" of those
courts, and must "execute and return the process and or-ders" of any state court, even those outside his county. Ala.
Code $$ 36-22-3(1), (2) (1991). Thus, judges (who are stateofficers, see Ala. Const. of 1901, Amdt. 328, $ 6.01) may order

5 As a result of this holding and the State Constitution's sovereign immunity provision, see Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. I, $ 14 ("[T]he State of
Alabama shall never be made a defendant in any court of law or equity"),
the Alabama Supreme Court has held that a sheriff is absolutely immune
from all suits for damages based on his official acts. Parker v. Amerson,
519 So. 2d 442, 446 (Ala. 1987). See also King v. Colbert County, 620
So. 2d 623, 626 (Ala. 1993); Boshell v. Walker County Sheriff, 598 So. 2d
843, 844 (Ala. 1992); Hereford v. Jefferson County, 586 So. 2d 209, 210

790 McMILLIAN v. MONROE COUNTY

Opinion of the Court
the sheriff to take certain actions, even if the judge sits in adistant county. And under Ala. Code $ 12-17-24 (1995), the

presiding circuit judge "exercise[s] a general supervision"over the county sheriffs in his circuit,

6 just as if the sheriffs

are normal "court [i. e., state] employees," see $ 12-17-1.Second, the sheriff must give to the county treasurer a

sworn written statement detailing the funds he has receivedfor the county since his last statement, and must pay these
funds to the treasurer. $ 36-22-3(3). In contrast to thestate judges, however, the county treasurer does not appear
to have any statutory authority to direct the sheriff to takespecific actions.

Third and most importantly, "[i]t shall be the duty of sher-iffs in their respective counties, by themselves or deputies,
to ferret out crime, to apprehend and arrest criminals and,insofar as within their power, to secure evidence of crimes
in their counties and to present a report of the evidence sosecured to the district attorney or assistant district attorney
for the county." $ 36-22-3(4). By this mandate, sheriffsare given complete authority to enforce the state criminal
law in their counties. In contrast, the "powers and duties"of the counties themselves--creatures of the State who have
only the powers granted to them by the State, Alexander,150 So. 2d, at 206--do not include any provision in the area
of law enforcement. Ala. Code $ 11-3-11 (1989). Thus, the"governing body" of the counties--which in every Alabama
county is the county commission, see Calvert v. CullmanCounty Comm'n, 669 So. 2d 119 (Ala. 1995) (citing $ 11-
1-5)--cannot instruct the sheriff how to ferret out crime,how to arrest a criminal, or how to secure evidence of a
crime. And when the sheriff does secure such evidence, hehas an obligation to share this information not with the
county commission, but with the district attorney (a stateofficial, see Hooks v. Hitt, 539 So. 2d 157, 159 (Ala. 1988)).

6 Seventeen of the forty judicial circuits in Alabama contain more than
one county, including the circuit in which Monroe County sits. Ala. Code

$ 12-11-2 (1995).

791Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
While the county commission thus has no direct control
over how the sheriff fulfills his law enforcement duty, the
Governor and the attorney general do have this kind of control. Pursuant to $ 36-22-5, they can direct the sheriff to
investigate "any alleged violation of law in their counties."
And after "proceed[ing] promptly" to complete this investigation, the sheriff must "promptly" write a report to the
state official in charge of the investigation, stating his findings, listing the witnesses he has secured, and summarizing
what the witnesses can prove. Ibid. In addition, the salaries of all sheriffs are set by the state legislature, not by the
county commissions. $ 36-22-16.

To all of this, petitioner counters with four important provisions that cut in favor of the conclusion that sheriffs are
county officials. First, the sheriff 's salary is paid "out of the
county treasury." Ibid. Second, the county provides the
sheriff with equipment (including cruisers), supplies, lodging, and reimbursement for expenses, to the extent "reasonably needed for the proper and efficient conduct of the affairs
of the sheriff 's office." $ 36-22-18. Third, the sheriff 's jurisdiction is limited to the borders of his county. See, e. g.,

$ 36-22-3(4) ("It shall be the duty of sheriffs in their respective counties . . . to ferret out crime" (emphasis added)).
Fourth, the sheriff is elected locally by the voters in his
county (as he has been since Alabama's 1819 Constitution).
See Ala. Const. of 1901, Art. V, $ 138; Ala. Const. of 1819,
Art. IV, $ 24.

We do not find these provisions sufficient to tip the balance
in favor of petitioner. The county's payment of the sheriff 's
salary does not translate into control over him, since the
county neither has the authority to change his salary nor the
discretion to refuse payment completely. The county commissions do appear to have the discretion to deny funds to

necessary." See Etowah County Comm'n v. Hayes, 569

Opinion of the Court
discretion would allow the commission to exert an attenu-ated and indirect influence over the sheriff 's operations.

Petitioner's contention that sheriffs are county officials be-cause "state policymakers" typically make policy for the entire State (without limits on their jurisdiction) and are typically elected on a statewide (not local) basis, surely has someforce. But district attorneys and state judges are often considered (and in Alabama are considered) state officials, eventhough they, too, have limited jurisdictions and are elected
locally. These characteristics are therefore consistent withan understanding of the 67 Alabama sheriffs as state officials
who have been locally placed throughout the State, with anelement of control granted to the officials and residents of
the county that receives the sheriff 's services.7

7 Petitioner also makes three other points that we believe have little
merit. First, he points out that when the sheriff's office is vacant or when
the sheriff is incapacitated, it is the county coroner that fills in for the
sheriff. Ala. Code $ 11-5-5 (1989). We note that this temporary assignment only lasts until the Governor appoints a replacement for the sheriff,
who then serves out the remainder of the sheriff's term. Ala. Code $ 36-
9-17 (1991). Thus, even assuming that the county coroner is a county
official, we place little weight on this assignment of temporary responsibility, which by its nature must fall to an official who is already in the county
and available to step in for the sheriff at any time. Second, petitioner
cites several instances in the code where a group of officials that includes
the sheriff is designated a group of "county officials" or "county employees." See, e. g., $$ 36-3-4, 36-15-1, 36-22-16. But in light of the Alabama Supreme Court's conclusion that (i) sheriffs are state officials according to the State Constitution, see Parker, 519 So. 2d, at 443, and (ii)
contrary statements in that court's prior decisions had ignored the Constitution and therefore should not be followed, id., at 445 (citing, among other
cases, In re Opinions of Justices, 225 Ala. 359, 143 So. 345 (1932)), we
think that any contrary implication in the code is entitled to little weight.
Finally, petitioner relies on the Monroe County Commission's insurance
policy--which, according to the District Court, "may cover . . . some, but
not all, of the claims made against" Monroe County and Sheriff Tate in this
suit, App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a--to establish that the commission will pay
any judgment rendered against Sheriff Tate. But this policy shows, at the
most, that there was uncertainty as to whether the courts would con520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

793Cite as: 520 U. S. 781 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
In sum, although there is some evidence in Alabama lawthat supports petitioner's argument, we think the weight of

the evidence is strongly on the side of the conclusion reachedby the Court of Appeals: Alabama sheriffs, when executing
their law enforcement duties, represent the State of Ala-bama, not their counties. Cf.

Praprotnik, 485 U. S., at 125("We are not, of course, predicting that state law will always

speak with perfect clarity"); id., at 126-127 ("It may not bepossible to draw an elegant line that will resolve this
conundrum"). C

Petitioner argues that this conclusion will create a lack ofuniformity in Alabama and throughout the country. First,
he argues that it is anomalous to have 67 different "statepolicymakers" in the person of Alabama's 67 county sheriffs,
all of whom may have different "state law enforcement poli-cies" in their counties. Second, he points out that most Federal Courts of Appeals have found county sheriffs to becounty, not state, officials, and he implies that our affirmance
of the Court of Appeals will either call those decisions intoquestion or create an unacceptable patchwork of rulings as
to $ 1983 liability of counties for the acts of their sheriffs.We reject both arguments: The first ignores the history of
sheriffs, and the second ignores our Nation's federal nature.English sheriffs (or "shire-reeves") were the King 's
"reeves" (officers or agents) in the "shires" (counties), at leastafter the Norman Conquest in 1066. See C. Wigan & D.
Meston, Mather on Sheriff and Execution Law 1-2 (1935).Although chosen locally by the shire's inhabitants, the sheriff
did "all the king's business in the county," 1 W. Blackstone,Commentaries on the Laws of England 328 (1765), and was
"the keeper of the king's peace," id., at 332. See also
Wigan & Meston, supra, at 2 ("It is this position of the Shersider Sheriff Tate a county policymaker in these circumstances, not that
the county would pay any judgment against him.

iff as the executive officer of the Crown which has all alongbeen the outstanding characteristic of the office").

As the basic forms of English government were trans-planted in our country, it also became the common understanding here that the sheriff, though limited in jurisdictionto his county and generally elected by county voters,

8 was in

reality an officer of the State, and ultimately represented theState in fulfilling his duty to keep the peace. See,

e. g.,Wager, Introduction, in County Government Across the Nation 5 (P. Wager ed. 1950) ("The office of sheriff has an unbro-ken lineage from the Anglo-Saxon shire-reeve"); 1 W. Anderson, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs, Coroners andConstables 5 (1941) ("In the exercise of executive and administrative functions, in conserving the public peace, in vindi-cating the law, and in preserving the rights of the government, he (the sheriff) represents the sovereignty of the Stateand he has no superior in his county"); R. Cooley, Handbook
on the Law of Municipal Corporations 512 (1914) ("Sheriffs,coroners, clerks and other so-called county officers are properly state officers for the county. Their functions and dutiespertain chiefly to the affairs of state in the county"); 3 J.
Bouvier, Bouvier's Law Dictionary 3058 (8th ed. 1914) (de-fining sheriff as "[a] county officer representing the executive
or administrative power of the state within his county").This historical sketch indicates that the common law itself
envisioned the possibility that state law enforcement "poli-cies" might vary locally, as particular sheriffs adopted varying practices for arresting criminals or securing evidence.9

8 See W. Murfree, A Treatise on the Law of Sheriffs and Other Ministerial Officers 6 (1890) (sheriffs elected by county voters in all States but
two).

9 Cf. McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F. 3d 1573, 1579 (CA11 1996) ("[W]e see

Such a situation would be no different than if each of a city's police precinct commanders had unreviewable authority over how arrestees were

Opinion of the Court
Thus, petiti oner 's disagreement with the concept that"county sheriffs" may actually be state officials is simply a

disagreement with the ancient understanding of what it hasmeant to be a sheriff.

Petitioner's second concern is that under our holding here,sheriffs will be characterized differently in different States.
But while it might be easier to decide cases arising under$ 1983 and

Monell if we insisted on a uniform, national char-acterization for all sheriffs, such a blunderbuss approach

would ignore a crucial axiom of our government: the Stateshave wide authority to set up their state and local governments as they wish. Understandably, then, the importanceof counties and the nature of county government have varied
historically from region to region, and from State to State.See,

e. g., Wager, supra, at 5-8 (describing different systemsof rural government that developed in the Massachusetts,

New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia colonies, which laterresulted in counties having widely varying roles in the four
regions); Martin, American County Government, in CountyGovernments in an Era of Change 3-5 (P. Berman ed. 1993)
(same); DeSantis & Renner, Governing the County, id., at
16-25 (describing varying levels of power currently exer-cised by counties in different States, and explaining how regional influences have resulted in different forms of countygovernment in different States);

id., at 19 (listing Alabama
as 37th among the 50 States in amount of discretionary au-thority granted to its counties). Thus, since it is entirely

natural that both the role of sheriffs and the importance of
counties vary from State to State, there is no inconsistencycreated by court decisions that declare sheriffs to be county

officers in one State, and not in another.10

10 Compare, e. g., Strickler v. Waters, 989 F. 2d 1375, 1390 (CA4 1993)

The final concern of petitioner and his amici is that stateand local governments will manipulate the titles of local officials in a blatant effort to shield the local governments fromliability. But such efforts are already foreclosed by our decision in Praprotnik. See 485 U. S., at 127 (plurality opin-ion) ("[E]gregious attempts by local governments to insulate
themselves from liability for unconstitutional policies areprecluded" by allowing plaintiffs to prove that "a widespread
practice" has been established by " `custom or usage' withthe force of law"). And there is certainly no evidence of
such manipulation here; indeed, the Alabama provisions thatcut most strongly against petitioner's position predate our
decision in Monell by some time.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore

Affirmed.

Seeking redress for an arrest and years of incarcerationin violation of his federal constitutional rights, McMillian

commenced the instant action under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983.He named as defendants both Monroe County and the County's Sheriff, Tom Tate. McMillian alleged that Sheriff Tatewithheld exculpatory evidence, generated false, inculpatory
evidence, and subjected him to gross racial insults and re-lentless intimidation.

Sheriff Tate, it is uncontested, has "final policymaking au-thority" under Alabama law over matters of law enforcement
in Monroe County. Our precedent instructs that, if thesheriff makes policy for the State, Monroe County would not
be accountable, under $ 1983, for that policy; if, on the otherhand, the sheriff acts as law enforcement policymaker for
Monroe County, then the county would be answerable under$ 1983. See Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.,
436 U. S. 658, 694 (1978).Alabama has 67 county sheriffs, each elected, paid, and
equipped locally, each with countywide, not statewide, au-thority. Unlike judges who work within the State's judicial
hierarchy, or prosecutors who belong to a prosecutorial corpssuperintended by the State's Attorney General, sheriffs are
not part of a state command and serve under no "State Sher-iff General." The Court, nonetheless, holds that the policies
set by Sheriff Tate in Monroe County, though discrete from,and uncoordinated with, the policies of sheriffs in other counties, "may fairly be said to represent [Alabama] policy." Seeibid. I disagree.

In my view, Alabama law defining the office of sheriff indi-cates that the sheriff acts within and for the county when

setting and implementing law enforcement policy.1 In ex1 The Court observes that this Court must "defer considerably" to the
Eleventh Circuit's construction of Alabama law. See ante, at 786. But
cf. Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499 U. S. 225, 231 (1991) (courts of
appeals review de novo district courts' state-law determinations). Deference, however, does not supplant careful review, see St. Louis v. Praprot520US3 Unit: $U61 [09-11-99 17:51:21] PAGES PGT: OPIN

plaining why it concludes otherwise and deems the sheriffthe State's, not the county's, policymaker, the Court leans

heavily on provisions of the State's Constitution. The Courtrelies on the Alabama Constitution's designation of "a sheriff
for each county" as a member of the State's "executive de-partment." See Ala. Const., Art. V, $ 112;

ante, at 787. Inaddition, the Court points to two 1901 amendments relating to the impeachment of sheriffs. See ante, at 788-789.These measures are the strongest supports for the Court's
classification of county sheriffs as state actors. They are notsturdy enough, however, to justify the Court's holding that
county sheriffs are state officials.Alabama law does not consistently designate sheriffs as
"executive department" officers; instead, Alabama law inseveral instances refers to sheriffs as county officials. See
In re Opinions of Justices, 225 Ala. 359, 143 So. 345 (1932)(sheriffs are county officers for purposes of 1912 constitutional amendment regarding county officers' salaries); Ala.Code $ 36-3-4(a) (1991) (sheriff, a "county officer," shall be
elected to four-year term); Ala. Code $ 36-22-16(a) (1991)(sheriffs shall be compensated out of the county treasury in
same manner as "other county employees"). Moreover, des-ignations Alabama attaches to sheriffs in its laws and decisions are not dispositive of a court's assessment of SheriffTate's status for $ 1983 purposes. Cf. Regents of Univ. of
Cal. v. Doe, 519 U. S. 425, 429, n. 5 (1997); Howlett v. Rose,496 U. S. 356, 376 (1990) (defenses to $ 1983 actions are questions of federal law); Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277,284, and n. 8 (1980) (state law granting immunity to parole

free to nullify for their own people the legislative decisionsthat Congress has made on behalf of all the People."

Howlett, 496 U. S., at 383.Nor are the 1901 impeachment measures secure indicators

that a sheriff acts on behalf of the State, not the county.
As the Court explains, the impeachment amendments wereintended to provide a state check on county sheriffs in view

of their glaring lapses in acquiescing to abductions andlynchings in the late 1800's. See

ante, at 788. However,
making an officer eligible for impeachment, by itself, doesnot change the governmental unit to which the officer belongs. See Ala. Const., Art. VII, $ 175 (listing numerous
county officials subject to impeachment); Ala. Code $ 36-11-
1(a) (1991) (same). And transferring impeachment proceedings from county courts to the State Supreme Court, see
Ala. Const., Art. VII, $ 174, is sensibly seen as an acknowledgment of the power wielded by sheriffs within their own
counties, and the consequent need for placement of removal
authority outside a sheriff 's bailiwick. Furthermore, impeachment of sheriffs is not a power reserved exclusively
to state officials; "five resident taxpayers" of the sheriff 's
county can initiate an impeachment. See Ala. Code $ 36-
11-6 (1991). Impeachment, in sum, provides an ultimate
check on flagrant behavior, but does not serve as a tight control rein.

The prime controllers of a sheriff 's service are the county
residents, the people who select their sheriff at quadrennial
elections. Sheriff Tate owes his position as chief law enforcement officer of Monroe County to the county residents
who elected him, and who can unseat him. See Ala. Const.,
Art. V, $ 138, as amended by Amdt. No. 35 ("A sheriff shall
be elected in each county by the qualified electors thereof
. . . ."). On the ballot, candidates for the office of sheriff are
grouped with candidates for other county offices, and are not
listed with state office candidates. See Ala. Code $ 17-8-5
(1995).

Ginsburg, J., dissenting
Traditionally, Alabama sheriffs have had autonomy to formulate and execute law enforcement policy within the geographic confines of their counties. Under Alabama law, "[i]t
shall be the duty of sheriffs in their respective counties . . .
to ferret out crime, to apprehend and arrest criminals and
. . . to secure evidence of crimes." Ala. Code $ 36-22-3(4)
(1991) (emphasis added); see also Ala. Code $ 15-6-1 (1995)
("The sheriff is the principal conservator of the peace in his
county, and it is his duty to suppress riots, unlawful assemblies and affrays. In the execution of such duty, he may
summon to his aid as many of the men of his county as he
thinks proper." (emphasis added)); $ 15-10-1 (sheriffs may
make arrests "within their respective counties").

Monroe County pays Sheriff Tate's salary, see Ala. Code

$ 36-22-16(a) (1991) (sheriffs shall be paid "out of the county
treasury as the salaries of other county employees are paid"),
and the sheriff operates out of an office provided, furnished,
and equipped by the county, see $ 36-22-18. The obligation
to fully equip the sheriff is substantial, requiring a county
commission to "furnish the sheriff with the necessary quarters, books, stationery, office equipment, supplies, postage
and other conveniences and equipment, including automobiles and necessary repairs, maintenance and all expenses
incidental thereto." Ibid. These obligations are of practical importance, for they mean that purse strings can be
pulled at the county level; a county is obliged to provide a
sheriff only what is "reasonably needed for the proper and
efficient conduct of the affairs of the sheriff 's office," ibid.
(emphasis added). How generously the sheriff will be
equipped is likely to influence that officer's day-to-day conduct to a greater extent than the remote prospect of impeachment. See ibid.; see also Geneva Cty. Comm'n v. Tice,

increased "by law by general or local act"); $ 36-22-3(3)
(sheriff must render to county treasurer a periodic written
statement of moneys collected by sheriff on behalf of county).

Sheriff Tate, in short, is in vital respects a county official.
Indeed, one would be hard pressed to think of a single official
who more completely represents the exercise of significant
power within a county. See Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 746
F. 2d 337, 340-341 (CA6 1984) (sheriff elected by residents
of county to be county's chief law enforcement officer, paid
and equipped by county, is "obvious[ly]" a county official),
rev'd on other grounds, 475 U. S. 469 (1986).2

The Court observes that it is "most importan[t]" to its
holding that Alabama sheriffs "are given complete authority
to enforce the state criminal law in their counties." See
ante, at 790. If the Court means to suggest that Sheriff
Tate should be classified as a state actor because he is enforcing state (as opposed to county or municipal) law, the Court
proves far too much. Because most criminal laws are of
statewide application, relying on whose law the sheriff enforces yields an all-state categorization of sheriffs, despite
the Court's recognition that such blanket classification is
inappropriate. See ante, at 786. Sheriffs in Arkansas,
Texas, and Washington, just like sheriffs in Alabama, enforce

2 The majority of Courts of Appeals to have addressed this question
have similarly concluded that sheriffs, when engaged in a variety of activities, are county actors. See, e. g., cases cited ante, at 795-796, n. 10; see
also Parker v. Williams, 862 F. 2d 1471, 1477-1481 (CA11 1989) (Alabama

the State's law, but that does not make them policymakersfor the State rather than the county. See

ante, at 795-796,
n. 10.In emphasizing that the Monroe County Commission cannot instruct Sheriff Tate how to accomplish his law enforcement mission, see ante, at 790, the Court indirectly endorsesthe Eleventh Circuit's reasoning: Because under Alabama

law a county commission does not possess law enforcementauthority, a sheriff 's law enforcement activities cannot represent county policy. See McMillian v. Johnson, 88 F. 3d1573, 1578 (CA11 1996). There is an irony in this approach:
If a county commission lacks law enforcement authority, thenthe sheriff becomes a state official; but if a county commission possesses such authority and directs the sheriff 's activities, then the sheriff presumably would not be a final policy-maker in the realm of law enforcement, see

St. Louis v.
Praprotnik, 485 U. S. 112, 127 (1988) (plurality opinion).Moreover, in determining who makes county policy, this

Court has never reasoned that all policymaking authoritymust be vested in a single body that either exercises that
power or formally delegates it to another. Few local gov-ernments would fit that rigid model. Cf.

id., at 124-125
("The States have extremely wide latitude in determining
the form that local government takes . . . . [O]ne may expect to find a rich variety of ways in which the power of
government is distributed among a host of different officials
and official bodies."). Nor does Monell support such a constricted view of the exercise of municipal authority; there,
we spoke of $ 1983 liability for acts by "lawmakers or by
those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent
official policy." 436 U. S., at 694 (emphasis added). In this
case, Sheriff Tate is "the county's final policymaker in the
area of law enforcement, not by virtue of delegation by the
county's governing body but, rather, by virtue of the office
to which the sheriff has been elected." Turner v. Upton
Cty., 915 F. 2d 133, 136 (CA5 1990); see also Blackburn v.
Snow, 771 F. 2d 556, 571 (CA1 1985); accord, Vera v. Tue, 73

F. 3d 604, 609 (CA5 1996) ("[T]he Sheriff, an elected county
official [in Texas], had equal authority to the county commissioners in that jurisdiction [so] that his actions constituted
those of the county just as much as those of the commissioners."). An Alabama sheriff is a county policymaker because
he independently exercises law enforcement authority for
the county. In this most crucial respect, the Alabama arrangement resembles the "unique structure of county government" in Texas. See Turner, 915 F. 2d, at 136-137, cited
ante, at 796, n. 10.

The Court also suggests that because the Governor can
direct a sheriff to investigate a violation of law in the county,
an Alabama sheriff must be a state, not a county, official.
See ante, at 791 (citing Ala. Code $ 36-22-5 (1991)). It is
worth noting that a group of county citizens can likewise
trigger an investigation by the sheriff. See $ 36-22-6(b).
The respondent, Monroe County, did not inform us whether
the Governor directs county sheriffs to conduct investigations with any regularity. More important, there is no suggestion that Sheriff Tate was proceeding under the Governor's direction when Tate pursued the investigation that led
to McMillian's Death Row confinement. If Sheriff Tate were
acting on instruction from the Governor, this would be a
very different case. But the bare possibility that a Governor might sometime direct a sheriff 's law enforcement activities does not lessen the sheriff 's authority, as the final county
policymaker, in the general run of investigations the sheriff
undertakes.

II

The Court's reliance on "the ancient understanding of
what it has meant to be a sheriff," ante, at 795, is no more
persuasive than its interpretation of Alabama law. This emphasis on the historical understanding of the office of sheriff
implies, again, an all-state categorization of sheriffs throughout the Nation; but because the Court expressly disclaims
such a "blunderbuss" approach, ibid., that cannot be what

this history lesson is intended to convey. In England, it istrue, the sheriff did perform "the king's business in the

county." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *339. But theEnglish sheriff, as Blackstone described him, was far closer
to the crown than his contemporary counterpart is to thecentral state government. While sheriffs were for a time
chosen locally, "[t]his election," according to Blackstone, "wasin all probability not absolutely vested in the [inhabitants of
the counties], but required the royal approbation." Id., at*340. Eventually, the king chose the sheriff from a list proposed by the judges and other great officers. See id., at*340-*341.

Whatever English history may teach, "[t]hroughout U. S.history, the sheriff has remained the principal law enforcement officer in the county." G. Felkenes, The Criminal Jus-tice System: Its Functions and Personnel 53 (1973); see id.,
at 52-53 (referring specifically to Alabama sheriffs). In theUnited States, "[i]n order to reserve control over the sheriff 's department and its police functions, the people made thesheriff an elective officer."

Id., at 53. It is this status asthe county's law enforcement officer chosen by the county's

residents that is at the root of the contemporary understand-ing of the sheriff as a county officer.

* * *A sheriff locally elected, paid, and equipped, who autonomously sets and implements law enforcement policies opera-tive within the geographic confines of a county, is ordinarily
just what he seems to be: a county official. Nothing in Ala-bama law warrants a different conclusion. It makes scant
sense to treat sheriffs' activities differently based on thepresence or absence of state constitutional provisions of the
limited kind Alabama has adopted.The Court's Alabama-specific approach, however, assures
that today's immediate holding is of limited reach. TheCourt does not appear to question that an Alabama sheriff
may still be a county policymaker for some purposes, such

as hiring the county's chief jailor, see Parker v. Williams,862 F. 2d 1471, 1477-1481 (CA11 1989). And, as the Court

acknowledges, under its approach sheriffs may be policymak-ers for certain purposes in some States and not in others.
See ante, at 795, and n. 10. The Court's opinion does notcall into question the numerous Court of Appeals decisions,
some of them decades old, ranking sheriffs as county, notstate, policymakers. Furthermore, the Court's recognition
of the historic reasons why Alabama listed sheriffs as mem-bers of the State's "executive department," see

ante, at 788-789, should discourage endeavors to insulate counties and

municipalities from Monell liability by change-the-label de-vices. Thus, the Court's opinion, while in my view misguided, does little to alter $ 1983 county and municipal liabil-ity in most jurisdictions.

De BUONO, NEW YORK COMMISSIONER OF

HEALTH, et al. v. NYSA-ILA MEDICAL AND

CLINICAL SERVICES FUND, by its

trustees, BOWERS, et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe second circuit

No. 95-1594. Argued February 24, 1997--Decided June 2, 1997
New York's Health Facility Assessment (HFA) imposes a tax on gross

receipts for patient services at, inter alia, diagnostic and treatment centers. The NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund (Fund),
which administers a plan subject to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), owns and operates New York treatment
centers for longshore workers, retirees, and their dependents. Respondents, the Fund's trustees, discontinued paying the tax and filed
this action to enjoin petitioner state officials from making future assessments and to obtain a refund, alleging that the HFA is a state law that
"relates to" the Fund within the meaning of $ 514(a) of ERISA, and is
therefore pre-empted as applied to hospitals run by ERISA plans. The
District Court concluded that the HFA is not pre-empted because it is
a tax of general application having only an incidental impact on benefit
plans. The Second Circuit reversed, reasoning that the HFA relates to
the Fund by reducing the amount of Fund assets that would otherwise
be available to provide plan members with benefits, and could cause the
plan to limit its benefits or to charge plan members higher fees. On
remand from this Court in light of New York State Conference of Blue
Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645--in which
this Court held that ERISA did not pre-empt a New York statute requiring hospitals to collect surcharges from patients covered by a commercial insurer but not from patients insured by a Blue Cross/Blue
Shield plan--the Second Circuit reinstated its judgment, distinguishing
Travelers on the ground that the statute there at issue had only an
indirect economic influence on the decisions of ERISA plan administrators, whereas the HFA depletes the Fund's assets directly, and thus has
an immediate impact on an ERISA plan's operations.

Held: Section 514(a) does not preclude New York from imposing a gross

receipts tax on ERISA funded medical centers. Pp. 812-816.

(a) When the Second Circuit initially found the HFA pre-empted, it
relied substantially on an expansive and literal interpretation of the

520US3 Unit: $U62 [09-11-99 17:56:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

807Cite as: 520 U. S. 806 (1997)
Syllabus
words "relate to" in $ 514(a). It appears to have adhered to that approach on remand, failing to give proper weight to Travelers' rejection
of such a strictly literal reading. In Travelers, the Court unequivocally
concluded that the "relates to" language was not intended to modify
"the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant
state law." 514 U. S., at 654. In evaluating whether the normal presumption against pre-emption has been overcome in a particular case,
this Court must look to the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide
to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive.
Id., at 656. Pp. 812-814.

(b) Following that approach here, the HFA clearly operates in a field
that has been traditionally occupied by the States: the regulation of
health and safety matters. Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 715. Nothing in the HFA's operation convinces this Court that it is the type of state law that Congress
intended ERISA to supersede. It is one of myriad state laws of general
applicability that impose some burdens on the administration of ERISA
plans but nevertheless do not relate to them within the statute's meaning. See, e. g., Travelers, 514 U. S., at 668. The supposed difference
between direct and indirect impact--upon which the Second Circuit relied in distinguishing this case from Travelers--cannot withstand scrutiny. While the Fund has arranged to provide medical benefits for its
beneficiaries directly, had it chosen to purchase the services at independently run hospitals, those hospitals would have passed their HFA costs
onto the Fund through their rates. Although the tax would be "indirect," its impact on the Fund's decisions would be in all relevant respects identical to the "direct" impact felt here. Pp. 814-816.

question presented is whether hospitals operated by ERISA
plans are subject to the same laws as other hospitals. More
precisely, the question is whether the opaque language in
ERISA's $ 514(a) 2 precludes New York from imposing a
gross receipts tax on the income of medical centers operated
by ERISA funds. We hold that New York may collect its
tax.

I

In 1990, faced with the choice of either curtailing its Medicaid program or generating additional revenue to reduce the
program deficit, the New York General Assembly enacted
the Health Facility Assessment (HFA).3 The HFA imposes
a tax on gross receipts for patient services at hospitals, residential health care facilities, and diagnostic and treatment

of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645
(1995); John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Harris Trust and Sav. Bank,
510 U. S. 86 (1993); District of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of
Trade, 506 U. S. 125 (1992); Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S.
133 (1990); FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U. S. 52 (1990); Massachusetts v.

U. S. 85 (1983); and Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S. 504
(1981). The issue has also generated an avalanche of litigation in the
lower courts. See Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S., at 135,
and n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (observing that in 1992, a LEXIS search
uncovered more than 2,800 opinions on ERISA pre-emption).

2 Section 514(a) of ERISA informs us that "[e]xcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of this [statute] shall supersede
any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any
employee benefit plan" covered by the statute. 88 Stat. 897, 29 U. S. C.

Opinion of the Court

centers.4 The assessments become a part of the State's gen-eral revenues.

Respondents are the trustees of the NYSA-ILA Medi-cal and Clinical Services Fund (Fund), which administers a
self-insured, multiemployer welfare benefit plan. The Fundowns and operates three medical centers--two in New York
and one in New Jersey--that provide medical, dental, andother health care benefits primarily to longshore workers,
retirees, and their dependents. The New York centers arelicensed by the State as "diagnostic and treatment centers,"
App. 80, and are thus subject to a 0.6 percent tax on grossreceipts under the HFA. N. Y. Pub. Health Law $ 2807-
d(2)(c) (McKinney 1993).During the period from January through November of
1991, respondents paid HFA assessments totaling $7,066based on the two New York hospitals' patient care income of
$1,177,670. At that time, they discontinued the paymentsand brought this action against appropriate state officials
(petitioners) to enjoin future assessments and to obtain arefund of the tax paid in 1991. The complaint alleged that
the HFA is a state law that "relates to" the Fund within themeaning of $ 514(a) of ERISA, and is therefore pre-empted
as applied to hospitals run by ERISA plans.The District Court denied relief. It concluded that HFA
was not pre-empted because it was a "tax of general applica-tion" that did not "interfere with the calculation of benefits
or the determination of an employee's eligibility for benefits"and thus had only an incidental impact on benefit plans.
App. to Pet. for Cert. 21a.5

4 In addition to taxing the income derived from patient services at
these facilities, the HFA taxes investment income and certain operating
income. N. Y. Pub. Health Law $$ 2807-d(3)(c), 2807-d(3)(d) (McKinney
1993). The taxation of these activities is not challenged here.

5 In response to the complaint filed in 1992, petitioners objected to federal jurisdiction, relying on the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1341,
which provides that federal courts "shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain
the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where
a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such

Opinion of the Court
The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. Itdistinguished cases in which we had found that certain "laws

of general application" were not pre-empted by ERISA,6 ex-plaining that the HFA "targets only the health care industry," which is, "by definition, the realm where ERISA wel-fare plans must operate,"

NYSA-ILA Medical and ClinicalServices Fund v. Axelrod, M. D., 27 F. 3d 823, 827 (1994).

The court reasoned that because the HFA "operates as animmediate tax on payments and contributions which were
intended to pay for participants' medical benefits," it directlyaffects "the very operations and functions that make the
Fund what it is, a provider of medical, surgical, and hospital
State." Respondents contended that the statute did not apply because
the New York courts do not provide the "plain" remedy required to bar
federal jurisdiction. The District Court appears to have agreed with respondents, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a, but when it ultimately granted
summary judgment and dismissed the complaint, it did not squarely decide
the question, id., at 19a, 22a-23a. The Court of Appeals did not address
the Tax Injunction Act in either of its two opinions in this case and there
is no suggestion anywhere in the papers that the State raised the issue
before that court. The Second Circuit had previously held, however, that
the Tax Injunction Act is not a bar to actions such as this. See Travelers
Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, 14 F. 3d 708, 713-714 (1993), rev'd on other grounds,
New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645 (1995). In Travelers, we noted, but did not
reexamine, that conclusion. See id., at 652-653, n. 4. In the case at bar,
the Court of Appeals presumably was satisfied that its jurisdiction was
secure for the reasons given in Travelers. Before this Court, no party in
either Travelers or the current case has mentioned the Tax Injunction Act
or questioned the Court of Appeals' conclusion that a "plain" remedy is
unavailable in the New York courts. Given our settled practice of according respect to the courts of appeals' greater familiarity with issues of state
law, cf. Bishop v. Wood, 426 U. S. 341, 346-347, and n. 10 (1976), and the
State's active participation in nearly four years of federal litigation with
no complaint about federal jurisdiction, it is appropriate for us to presume
that the Court of Appeals correctly determined that, under these circumstances, New York courts did not provide a "plain" remedy barring federal
consideration of the state tax.

6 See, e. g., Mackey, 486 U. S., at 838 (generally applicable garnishment

law not pre-empted); Fort Halifax Packing Co., 482 U. S., at 19 (state law
requiring one-time severance payment not pre-empted).

care to its participants and their beneficiaries." Ibid. TheHFA, concluded the court, thus "related to" the Fund because it reduced the amount of Fund assets that would other-wise be available to provide plan members with benefits, and
could cause the plan to limit its benefits, or to charge planmembers higher fees.

The first petition for certiorari in this case was filed beforewe handed down our opinion in

New York State Conferenceof Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514

U. S. 645 (1995). In that case we held that ERISA did notpre-empt a New York statute that required hospitals to collect surcharges from patients covered by a commercial in-surer but not from patients insured by a Blue Cross/Blue
Shield plan. Id., at 649-651. After deciding Travelers, wevacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case
and remanded for further consideration in light of that opin-ion. 514 U. S. 1094 (1995).

On remand the Court of Appeals reinstated its originaljudgment. The court distinguished the statute involved in
Travelers on the ground that--by imposing a tax on thehealth insurance carriers who provided coverage to plans
and their beneficiaries--it had only an indirect economicinfluence on the decisions of ERISA plan administrators,
whereas the HFA "depletes the Fund's assets directly, andthus has an immediate impact on the operations of an ERISA
plan," NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund v.
Axelrod, M. D., 74 F. 3d 28, 30 (1996). We granted the NewYork officials' second petition for certiorari, 519 U. S. 926

(1996), and now reverse. II

When the Second Circuit initially found the HFA pre-empted as applied to Fund-operated hospitals, that court relied substantially on an expansive and literal interpretationof the words "relate to" in $ 514(a) of ERISA. 27 F. 3d, at
826. In reconsidering the case on remand, the court appearsto have adhered to that approach, failing to give proper

Opinion of the Court
weight to Travelers' rejection of a strictly literal readingof $ 514(a).

In Travelers, as in our earlier cases, we noted that theliteral text of $ 514(a) is "clearly expansive." 514 U. S., at
655. But we were quite clear in that case that the text couldnot be read to "extend to the furthest stretch of its indeterminacy, [or] for all practical purposes pre-emption wouldnever run its course, for `[r]eally, universally, relations stop
nowhere,' H. James, Roderick Hudson xli (New York ed.,World's Classics 1980)."

Ibid.7In our earlier ERISA pre-emption cases, it had not been

necessary to rely on the expansive character of ERISA's lit-eral language in order to find pre-emption because the state
laws at issue in those cases had a clear "connection with orreference to," Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85,
96-97 (1983), ERISA benefit plans. But in Travelers weconfronted directly the question whether ERISA's "relates
to" language was intended to modify "the starting presump-tion that Congress does not intend to supplant state law."
514 U. S., at 654.8 We unequivocally concluded that it didnot, and we acknowledged "that our prior attempt[s] to
construe the phrase `relate to' d[o] not give us much helpdrawing the line here."

Id., at 655. In order to evaluatewhether the normal presumption against pre-emption has

been overcome in a particular case, we concluded that we"must go beyond the unhelpful text and the frustrating difficulty of defining its key term, and look instead to the objec7 See also Dillingham Constr., 519 U. S., at 335 (Scalia, J., concurring)
("[A]pplying the `relate to' provision according to its terms was a project
doomed to failure, since, as many a curbstone philosopher has observed,
everything is related to everything else").

8 Where "federal law is said to bar state action in fields of traditional

state regulation . . . we have worked on the `assumption that the historic
police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act
unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' " Travelers,
514 U. S., at 655 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U. S. 218,
230 (1947). See also Dillingham Constr., 519 U. S., at 325.

tives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of thestate law that Congress understood would survive." Id., at

656. We endorsed that approach once again earlier thisTerm in concluding that California's prevailing wage law
was not pre-empted by ERISA. California Div. of Labor
Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc.,519 U. S. 316, 325 (1997).

9

Following that approach here, we begin by noting that thehistoric police powers of the State include the regulation of

matters of health and safety. Hillsborough County v. Auto-mated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 715 (1985).
While the HFA is a revenue raising measure, rather than aregulation of hospitals, it clearly operates in a field that " `has
been traditionally occupied by the States.' " Ibid. (quoting
Jones v. Rath Packing Co., 430 U. S. 519, 525 (1977)).10 Re-spondents therefore bear the considerable burden of overcoming "the starting presumption that Congress does notintend to supplant state law." Travelers, 514 U. S., at 654.

There is nothing in the operation of the HFA that con-vinces us it is the type of state law that Congress intended
ERISA to supersede.11 This is not a case in which New

9 "The prevailing wage statute alters the incentives, but does not dictate
the choices, facing ERISA plans. In this regard, it is `no different from
myriad state laws in areas traditionally subject to local regulation, which
Congress could not possibly have intended to eliminate.' Travelers, 514
U. S., at 668. We could not hold pre-empted a state law in an area of
traditional state regulation based on so tenuous a relation without doing
grave violence to our presumption that Congress intended nothing of the
sort. We thus conclude that California's prevailing wage laws and apprenticeship standards do not have a `connection with,' and therefore do
not `relate to,' ERISA plans." Dillingham Constr., 519 U. S., at 334.

10 Indeed, the Court of Appeals rested its conclusion in no small part on

the fact that the HFA "targets only the health care industry." NYSA-
ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund v. Axelrod, M. D., 27 F. 3d 823,
827 (CA2 1994). Rather than warranting pre-emption, this point supports
the application of the "starting presumption" against pre-emption.

11 The respondents place great weight on the fact that in 1983 Congress

added a specific provision to ERISA to save Hawaii's Prepaid Health Care
Act from pre-emption, and that in so doing, the Legislature noted that

Opinion of the Court
York has forbidden a method of calculating pension benefits
that federal law permits,12 or required employers to provide
certain benefits.13 Nor is it a case in which the existence of
a pension plan is a critical element of a state-law cause of
action,14 or one in which the state statute contains provisions
that expressly refer to ERISA or ERISA plans.15

A consideration of the actual operation of the state statute
leads us to the conclusion that the HFA is one of "myriad
state laws" of general applicability that impose some burdens
on the administration of ERISA plans but nevertheless do
not "relate to" them within the meaning of the governing statute. See Travelers, 514 U. S., at 668; Dillingham

ERISA generally does pre-empt "any State tax law relating to employee
benefit plans." 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(b)(5)(B)(i). See Brief for Respondents
17-23. But there is no significant difference between the language in this
provision and the pre-emption provision in $ 514(a), and we are unconvinced that a stricter standard of pre-emption should apply to state tax
provisions than to other state laws.

12 See, e. g., Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U. S., at 524-525

("Whatever the purpose or purposes of the New Jersey statute, we conclude that it `relate[s] to pension plans' governed by ERISA because it
eliminates one method for calculating pension benefits--integration--that
is permitted by federal law").

13 See, e. g., Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S. 85 (1983) (ERISA

pre-empted state law requiring the provision of pregnancy benefits); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts, 471 U. S. 724 (1985) (law that
required benefit plans to include minimum mental health benefits "related
to" ERISA plans).

14 See, e. g., Ingersoll-Rand Co., 498 U. S., at 139-140 ("We are not dealing here with a generally applicable statute that makes no reference to,
or indeed functions irrespective of, the existence of an ERISA plan. . . .
Here, the existence of a pension plan is a critical factor in establishing
liability under the State's wrongful discharge law. As a result, this cause
of action relates not merely to pension benefits, but to the essence of the
pension plan itself").

15 See Mackey, 486 U. S., at 828-830 (a provision that explicitly refers to

ERISA in defining the scope of the state law's application is pre-empted);
Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U. S., at 130-131 ("Section 2(c)(2)
of the District's Equity Amendment Act specifically refers to welfare benefit plans regulated by ERISA and on that basis alone is pre-empted").

816 De BUONO v. NYSA-ILA MEDICAL AND CLINICAL

SERVICES FUND

Scalia, J., dissenting

Constr., 519 U. S., at 333-334. The HFA is a tax on hospi-tals. Most hospitals are not owned or operated by ERISA

funds. This particular ERISA fund has arranged to providemedical benefits for its plan beneficiaries by running hospitals directly, rather than by purchasing the same services atindependently run hospitals. If the Fund had made the
other choice, and had purchased health care services from ahospital, that facility would have passed the expense of the
HFA onto the Fund and its plan beneficiaries through therates it set for the services provided. The Fund would then
have had to decide whether to cover a more limited range ofservices for its beneficiaries, or perhaps to charge plan members higher rates. Although the tax in such a circumstancewould be "indirect," its impact on the Fund's decisions would
be in all relevant respects identical to the "direct" impactfelt here. Thus, the supposed difference between direct and
indirect impact--upon which the Court of Appeals relied indistinguishing this case from Travelers--cannot withstand
scrutiny. Any state tax, or other law, that increases the costof providing benefits to covered employees will have some
effect on the administration of ERISA plans, but that simplycannot mean that every state law with such an effect is preempted by the federal statute.16The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

economic effects, intentionally or otherwise, were so acute "as to force an
ERISA plan to adopt a certain scheme of substantive coverage or effectively restrict its choice of insurers" and such a state law "might indeed

statute, is not exceeded." Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v.
Mottley, 211 U. S. 149, 152 (1908). Despite our obligation to
examine federal-court jurisdiction even if the issue is not
raised by either party, ibid., and despite the Court's explicit
acknowledgment, ante, at 810-811, n. 5, of the possibility
that jurisdiction over this case is barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 1341, the Court proceeds to decide the
merits of respondents' Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) pre-emption challenge. The Court
offers two grounds for passing over the threshold question
of jurisdiction: our "settled practice of according respect to
the courts of appeals' greater familiarity with issues of state
law," and petitioners' "active participation in nearly four
years of federal litigation with no complaint about federal
jurisdiction." Ante, at 811, n. 5. In my view, neither of
these factors justifies our proceeding without resolving the
issue of jurisdiction.

The Tax Injunction Act bars federal-court jurisdiction
over an action seeking to enjoin a state tax (such as the one
at issue here) where "a plain, speedy and efficient remedy
may be had in the courts of such State." 28 U. S. C. $ 1341;
see Arkansas v. Farm Credit Servs. of Central Ark., post, at
825 (describing the Act as a "jurisdictional rule" and "broad
jurisdictional barrier"). The District Court in this case suggested that the Tax Injunction Act might not bar jurisdiction
here, since New York courts might not afford respondents a
"plain" remedy within the meaning of the Act. See NYSA-
ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund v. Axelrod, No. 92
Civ. 2779 (SDNY, Feb. 18, 1993), App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a.
That suggestion was not, however, based upon the District
Court's resolution of any "issues of state law," as today's
opinion intimates, ante, at 811, n. 5; rather, it rested upon
the District Court's conclusion that uncertainty over the
implications of a federal statute--$ 502(e)(1) of ERISA, 29
U. S. C. $ 1132(e)(1)--might render the availability of a state520US3 Unit: $U62 [09-11-99 17:56:05] PAGES PGT: OPIN

court remedy not "plain." App. to Pet. for Cert. 19a.* TheCourt of Appeals, in turn, made no mention of the jurisdictional issue, presumably because, under controlling Circuitprecedent, jurisdiction was secure: The Second Circuit had
previously held that state courts could not provide any rem-edy for ERISA-based challenges to state taxes within the
meaning of the Tax Injunction Act, since "Congress has di-vested the state courts of jurisdiction" over ERISA claims.

grounds sub nom. New York State Conference of Blue
Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S.645 (1995). That holding (like the District Court's discussion of the issue in this case) in no way turns on New Yorkstate law, so I am at a loss to understand the Court's invoca*That the District Court rested its conclusion on 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(e)(1)
is demonstrated by the sole authorities it cited in support of that conclusion: Travelers Ins. Co. v. Cuomo, 813 F. Supp. 996 (SDNY 1993), aff 'd in

Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645 (1995); and National Carriers' Conference
Committee v. Heffernan, 440 F. Supp. 1280, 1283 (Conn. 1977). The only
argument in Travelers that supports the conclusion reached here is the
argument that "[b]ecause ERISA generally confers exclusive jurisdiction
on the federal courts [under 29 U. S. C. $ 1132(e)(1)], a New York state
court might well feel compelled to dismiss a state court action on the
grounds that its jurisdiction has been preempted . . . . Thus, at a minimum the availability of a state court remedy is not `plain.' " 813 F. Supp.,
at 1001 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Likewise, Heffernan (which arose in Connecticut, not New York) offers pertinent reasoning based only on federal law: "Jurisdiction over suits arising under
ERISA is, with minor exceptions, vested exclusively in the federal courts.
29 U. S. C. $ 1132(e)(1). If this suit were brought before a . . . state court,
that court might well feel compelled to dismiss the action on the grounds
that its jurisdiction had been preempted by federal legislation and the
supremacy clause. Consequently the plaintiff cannot be said to have a
`plain, speedy and efficient' remedy in state court . . . ." 440 F. Supp., at

tion of "our settled practice of according respect to the courts
of appeals' greater familiarity with issues of state law," ante,
at 811, n. 5, as a basis for overlooking the question whether
the Tax Injunction Act bars federal-court jurisdiction.

The second factor relied upon by the Court in support of
its treatment of the jurisdictional issue is that petitioners
dropped the issue after the District Court failed to adopt
their interpretation of the Tax Injunction Act. But the fact
that petitioners have "active[ly] participat[ed] in nearly four
years of federal litigation with no complaint about federal
jurisdiction," ibid., cannot possibly confer upon us jurisdiction that we do not otherwise possess. It is our duty to
resolve the jurisdictional question, whether or not it has
been preserved by the parties. Sumner v. Mata, 449 U. S.
539, 548, n. 2 (1981); Louisville & Nashville R. Co., supra, at
152. In Sumner we confronted the identical circumstance
presented here--a jurisdictional argument raised before the
District Court but abandoned before the Court of Appeals--
and felt the need to address the jurisdictional issue. 449
U. S., at 547, n. 2.

I have previously noted the split among the Circuits on
the question whether the Tax Injunction Act deprives federal courts of jurisdiction over ERISA-based challenges to
state taxes. See Barnes v. E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital
Medical & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U. S. 1301, 1302-1303
(1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers). In a prior case, we expressly left the question open, saying that "[w]e express no
opinion [on] whether a party [can] sue under ERISA to enjoin or to declare invalid a state tax levy, despite the Tax
Injunction Act"; we noted that the answer would depend on
whether "state law provide[s] no `speedy and efficient remedy' " and on whether "Congress intended $ 502 of ERISA to
be an exception to the Tax Injunction Act." Franchise Tax

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe eighth circuit

No. 95-1918. Argued April 21, 1997--Decided June 2, 1997
The Tax Injunction Act (Act) restricts the federal district courts' power

to prevent collection or enforcement of state taxes, but makes an exception to that jurisdictional bar where no plain, speedy, or efficient
state-court remedy may be had. This Court has established another
exception where the United States sues to protect itself or its instrumentalities from state taxation. Department of Employment v.
United States, 385 U. S. 355, 358. Production Credit Associations
(PCA's) are federally chartered corporate financial institutions organized by farmers primarily to make loans to farmers. During the relevant time period, federal law has exempted PCA's from state taxes on
their notes, debentures, and other obligations. Respondent PCA's,
claiming that they are also immune from Arkansas sales and income
taxes, sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the
State from levying such taxes on them. Seeking to overcome the Act's
jurisdictional bar, they contended that, as instrumentalities of the
United States, they are not subject to the Act's provisions any more
than the United States itself. The District Court granted them summary judgment, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.

Held: PCA's are not included within the judicial exception to the Act by

virtue of their designation as instrumentalities of the United States and
so may not sue in federal court for an injunction against state taxation
without the United States as co-plaintiff. Pp. 825-832.

(a) The Act, which has been interpreted and applied as a "jurisdictional rule" and a "broad jurisdictional barrier," Moe v. Confederated
Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 470,
was enacted to confine federal-court intervention in state government.
The federal balance is well served when the several States define and
elaborate their own laws through their own courts and administrative
processes and without undue interference from the Federal Judiciary.
A State's power to tax is basic to its power to exist. Given the federal
balance and the basic principle that statutory language is to be enforced
according to its terms, federal courts must guard against interpretations
of the Act which might defeat its purpose and text. Where the United
States Government is a party, the other side of the federal balance must

be considered. The necessity to respect the National Government's authority underlies the rule that the Act does not constrain federal judicial
power when the United States sues to protect itself and its instrumentalities from state taxation. Pp. 825-828.

(b) When the United States is not a party, the mere fact that a party
challenging a tax has interests closely related to those of the Federal
Government is not enough, in and of itself, to overcome the Act's bar.
Moe, supra, at 471-472. An instrumentality of the United States can
enjoy the benefits and immunities conferred by explicit statutes without
the further inference that it has all of the rights and privileges of the
National Government. The Courts of Appeals have adopted different
standards for deciding whether a federal instrumentality may sue in
federal court to enjoin state taxation where the United States is not a
co-plaintiff. Under any of those tests, PCA's would not be exempt from
the Act's restrictions. The United States is not joined as a co-plaintiff
and opposes the exercise of jurisdiction. Regardless of whether a federal agency or body with substantial regulatory authority is exempt
from the Act when it brings suit in its own name, cf. NLRB v. NashFinch Co., 404 U. S. 138, PCA's are not entities of that description.
Despite their formal and undoubted designation as instrumentalities of
the United States, and despite their entitlement to those tax immunities
accorded by the explicit statutory mandate, they do not have or exercise
power analogous to that of the National Labor Relations Board or other
United States departments or regulatory agencies. Their business is
making commercial loans, and their stock is owned by private entities.
Their interests are not coterminous with those of the Government
any more than most commercial interests. A holding that they are subject to the Act's restriction on federal-court jurisdiction furthers the
State's interests without sacrificing those of the Federal Government.

824 ARKANSAS v. FARM CREDIT SERVS. OF

CENTRAL ARK.

Opinion of the Court

United States sues to protect itself or its instrumentalities
from state taxation. Department of Employment v. United
States, 385 U. S. 355, 358 (1966). The present case explores
the limits of this judicial exception. We decide here
whether instrumentalities called Production Credit Associations, corporations chartered under federal law, are included
within the exception when they sue by themselves. We hold
they are not and so may not sue in federal court for an injunction against state taxation without the United States as
co-plaintiff. The action must be dismissed, and, as a result,
we do not reach the merits of the taxation dispute.

I
Production Credit Associations (PCA's) are corporations
chartered by the Farm Credit Administration under the
Farm Credit Act of 1971, 85 Stat. 583, as amended, 12 U. S. C.

$ 2001 et seq. A PCA is a corporate financial institution organized by 10 or more farmers and designed in large part
to make loans to farmers. $$ 2071, 2075. PCA's have had
differing tax-exempt status at different times, depending on
whether the United States owned shares of their stock.
See, e. g., Farm Credit Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 267. In the period relevant here (when all PCA stock has been in private
hands) they have been exempted, by explicit federal statute,
from state taxes on their "notes, debentures, and other obligations." 12 U. S. C. $ 2077.

Four PCA's, respondents here, brought suit in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas
claiming a tax exemption going beyond the express statutory
language of $ 2077. They assert immunity not only from the
taxes described in the exemption statute we have quoted but
also from Arkansas sales and income taxes. They seek a
declaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting the State
from levying the taxes against them. The District Court
granted the PCAs' motion for summary judgment, and a di520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

825Cite as: 520 U. S. 821 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
vided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for theEighth Circuit affirmed. 76 F. 3d 961 (1996).

Entitlement to the immunity is the underlying substantiveissue, were we to reach it. The Tax Injunction Act, however, is an initial obstacle, for by its terms it would bar the
relief the PCA's seek absent some exception. Seeking toovercome the bar under the Tax Injunction Act, the PCA's,

first in the trial court and now here, contended that they areinstrumentalities of the United States and so not subject to
the provisions of the Act any more than the United Statesitself. The first point is correct: PCA's are instrumentalities
of the United States because the statute which charters
them says so. 12 U. S. C. $$ 2071(b)(7), 2077. The PCAs'
argument about what follows from the designation, however,
is incorrect. Instrumentalities of the United States, by virtue of that designation alone, do not have the same right as
does the United States to avoid the prohibitions of the Tax
Injunction Act.

An observation is proper respecting our consideration of
this threshold question. Although the trial court addressed
the meaning and operation of the Tax Injunction Act, in the
Court of Appeals the whole question seemed to disappear,
though it goes to the heart of judicial authority. Neither
party, we are advised, addressed the point and neither opinion in the Court of Appeals, majority or dissent, mentions it.
While the question of the Act's applicability was not raised
in the State's petition for certiorari, the United States, in an
amicus brief in support of the petition, called our attention
to the point. In granting the petition, we asked the parties
to address, in addition to the merits, whether the District
Court should have dismissed the case for lack of subjectmatter jurisdiction in light of the Act. 519 U. S. 805 (1997).

We have interpreted and applied the Tax Injunction Act
as a "jurisdictional rule" and a "broad jurisdictional barrier."
Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, 425 U. S. 463, 470 (1976). In dismissing

Opinion of the Court

an action filed in a United States District Court to challengestate taxes we held that the Tax Injunction Act "deprived

the District Court of jurisdiction to hear [the] challenges."California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U. S. 393, 396
(1982). Further, we found no jurisdiction even though thedefendant State argued in favor of the federal court's jurisdiction. Id., at 417, n. 38. In explaining our holding in
Grace Brethren that declaratory relief is as violative of theTax Injunction Act as an injunction itself, we said the Act

was first and foremost a vehicle " `to limit drastically federaldistrict court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a
local concern as the collection of taxes.' " Id., at 408-409(quoting

Rosewell v. LaSalle Nat. Bank, 450 U. S. 503, 522(1981)). These statements underscore the fundamental importance of the restrictions imposed by the Tax InjunctionAct, restrictions we proceed to address.

II
The federal balance is well served when the several Statesdefine and elaborate their own laws through their own courts

and administrative processes and without undue interferencefrom the Federal Judiciary. The States' interest in the integrity of their own processes is of particular moment re-specting questions of state taxation. In our constitutional
system, the power of the State to tax is a concurrent power."That the power of taxation is one of vital importance; that
it is retained by the States; that it is not abridged by thegrant of a similar power to the government of the Union;
that it is to be concurrently exercised by the two govern-ments: are truths which have never been denied."

McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 425 (1819). The power totax is basic to the power of the State to exist. Wisconsin v.

J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435, 444 (1940); Rosewell, supra,at 522.

Enactment of the Tax Injunction Act of 1937 reflects acongressional concern to confine federal-court intervention

520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
in state government, a concern prominent after the Court'sruling in

Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), that the Eleventh Amendment is not in all cases a bar to federal-courtinterference with individual state officers alleged to have

acted in violation of federal law. See Rosewell, supra, at
522, n. 28; Perez v. Ledesma, 401 U. S. 82, 104-115 (1971)(Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

Given the systemic importance of the federal balance, andgiven the basic principle that statutory language is to be
enforced according to its terms, federal courts must guardagainst interpretations of the Tax Injunction Act which
might defeat its purpose and text.

Where the Government of the United States is a party, of
course, the other side of the federal balance must be considered. In our constitutional system the National Government has sovereign interests of its own. The necessity to
respect the authority and prerogatives of the National Government underlies the now settled rule that the Tax Injunction Act is not a constraint on federal judicial power when
the United States sues to protect itself and its instrumentalities from state taxation. The importance of allowing the
United States to proceed in federal court to determine tax
immunity questions is no doubt one reason why the exception was established with little discussion in Department of
Employment v. United States. There the Court indicated
the exception was consistent with a well-settled understanding that the Government is not bound by its own legislative
restrictions on the exercise of remedial rights unless the intent to bind it is express. 385 U. S., at 358, n. 6 (citing
United States v. Livingston, 179 F. Supp. 9, 12 (EDSC 1959)
(three-judge District Court), aff 'd, 364 U. S. 281 (1960);
United States v. Arlington County, 326 F. 2d 929, 931 (CA4
1964); United States v. Bureau of Revenue of N. M., 291 F. 2d
677, 679 (CA10 1961)). See also Dollar Savings Bank v.
United States, 19 Wall. 227, 239 (1874). The Court concluded, "in accord with an unbroken line of authority, and

Opinion of the Court

convincing evidence of legislative purpose, that $ 1341 doesnot act as a restriction upon suits by the United States to

protect itself and its instrumentalities from unconstitutionalstate exactions." 385 U. S., at 358 (footnotes omitted). In
all the District Court and Court of Appeals cases cited in
Department of Employment, the United States was eitherthe sole plaintiff or a co-plaintiff. The United States had

joined as co-plaintiff with the Red Cross in Department of
Employment, arguing that the Red Cross was a federal instrumentality immune from state taxation, and we held thatthe Tax Injunction Act did not deprive the District Court of

jurisdiction to decide the merits and order relief.

We have not before now considered whether federal instrumentalities fall under the exception to the Tax Injunction Act when they sue without the United States as coplaintiff. In Moe v. Confederated Salish and Kootenai
Tribes, we reasoned that when the United States is not a
party, the mere fact that a party challenging the tax has
interests closely related to those of the Federal Government
is not enough, in and of itself, to avoid the bar of the Act.
We considered whether the Act barred the exercise of federal judicial power when Indian tribes were challenging the
lawfulness and constitutionality of certain state taxes. Although the tribes did not have formal designations as instrumentalities of the United States, we assumed the interests
they asserted were aligned with the interests of the Federal
Government. Reserving the question of the precise significance of a federal instrumentality designation, the Court
said this congruence of interests was not sufficient to give
the tribes an exemption from the Act. 425 U. S., at 471-472.
We went on to find the tribes exempt from the Act only because a second federal statute granted sweeping federalcourt jurisdiction where an Indian tribe was a party. Id., at
472 (citing 28 U. S. C. $ 1362 (1976 ed.)). Moe is instructive
here. As in Moe, the PCA's say their own mission is defined
and controlled by federal law and that their interests are the

520US3 Unit: $U63 [09-11-99 17:58:14] PAGES PGT: OPIN

829Cite as: 520 U. S. 821 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
same as those of the United States. We conclude here, aswe did in

Moe, that this argument is insufficient to justify an
exception to the Tax Injunction Act.True, important consequences flow from the congressional

decision to designate a PCA formed pursuant to statute
as "an instrumentality of the United States." 12 U. S. C.$ 2071(b)(7). The tax immunity a PCA has under $ 2077 is a

permitted consequence of its status as a federal instrumen-tality. An instrumentality of the United States can enjoy
the benefits and immunities conferred by explicit statutes,however, without the further inference that the instrumentality has all of the rights and privileges of the National
Government.

Respondents attempt to counter this point by arguing that
NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138 (1971), is applicable
here and supports their cause. Nash-Finch involved not the
Tax Injunction Act, but the Anti-Injunction Act, the statute
which restricts the authority of federal courts to enjoin proceedings in state courts. 28 U. S. C. $ 2283. The AntiInjunction Act provides: "A court of the United States may
not grant an injunction to stay proceedings in a State court
except as expressly authorized by Act of Congress, or where
necessary in aid of its jurisdiction, or to protect or effectuate
its judgments." Just as the Tax Injunction Act is inapplicable where the United States is a party, a parallel rule prevails under $ 2283. Leiter Minerals, Inc. v. United States,
352 U. S. 220, 225-226 (1957) (The restrictions of $ 2283 are
inapplicable in a suit brought by the National Government).
The question in Nash-Finch was whether the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB) came within the United

we observed the NLRB's regulatory power "pre-empts the
field." 404 U. S., at 144; see also id., at 147 ("The exclusiveness of the federal domain is clear . . ."). The case does not
aid the PCA's, for their powers are far different from those
of the NLRB. As will be discussed in more detail below, the

Opinion of the Court

PCA's more closely resemble the private entities Nash-Finchdistinguished from the Federal Government and its agencies.

Id., at 146.As to the Tax Injunction Act itself, the Courts of Appeals
have adopted different standards over time for deciding
whether a federal instrumentality may sue in federal courtto enjoin state taxation where the United States is not a

co-plaintiff. Under the most restrictive approach, there isno exception to the Tax Injunction Act for federal instrumentalities unless the United States sues as a co-plaintiff.See,

e. g., United States v. State Tax Commission, 481 F. 2d
963, 975 (CA1 1973) ("It is reasonable, as a prerequisite to
by-passing normal state tax collection and litigation channels, that [the instrumentalities] persuade the Attorney General of the United States . . . to join in their claim"); Housing
Authority of Seattle v. State of Washington, Dept. of Revenue, 629 F. 2d 1307, 1311 (CA9 1980) (agreeing with the First
Circuit in State Tax Commission that "such joinder [with the
United States as co-plaintiff] is necessary before a federal
instrumentality can overcome the restrictions" of the Tax
Injunction Act). After its decision in State Tax Commission, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit modified
what had seemed to be a bright-line rule to produce a different test: "[E]ach instrumentality must be examined in light
of its governmental role and the wishes of Congress as expressed in relevant legislation." Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston v. Commissioner of Corporations and Taxation of
Mass., 499 F. 2d 60, 64 (1974). Federal Reserve banks, the
Court of Appeals noted, are not analogous to private corporations, but rather are "plainly and predominantly fiscal
arms of the federal government" with interests "indistinguishable from those of the sovereign." Id., at 62. The
court also pointed to a federal statute giving a Federal Reserve bank "unrestricted access to the district courts," id., at
63 (referring to 12 U. S. C. $ 632); and to the Federal Reserve
System's unusual position "outside the executive chain of

command," 499 F. 2d, at 63. See also Bank of New England
Old Colony v. Clark, 986 F. 2d 600, 602-603 (CA1 1993) (describing Federal Reserve bank standard as a "flexible test").Under any of the tests we have described, PCA's would

not be exempt from the restrictions of the Tax Injunction
Act. The United States has not joined as a co-plaintiff andindeed opposes the District Court's exercise of jurisdiction.

We need not inquire whether the holding of Nash-Finch--tothe effect that an agency with broad regulatory power is
exempt from $ 2283 when it sues in its own name and notthrough the Attorney General or in the name of the United
States--is applicable as well to the Tax Injunction Act.
Whatever may be the rule under the Tax Injunction Act
where a federal agency or body with substantial regulatory authority brings suit, PCA's are not entities of that
description. PCA's are not granted the right to exercise
government regulatory authority but rather serve specific
commercial and economic purposes long associated with various corporations chartered by the United States. Other
examples include the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company
(chartered under an Act of 1866 to construct and maintain
a railroad and telegraph line from Springfield, Missouri, to
the Pacific Ocean, see Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 436-

437 (1900)); the Rural Telephone Bank (7 U. S. C. $ 941); the
United States Enrichment Corporation (42 U. S. C. $ 2297a,
repealed effective on date of privatization, Pub. L. 104-134,

$ 3116, 110 Stat. 1321). Indeed, in Smith v. Reeves, we
treated the federally chartered corporation as a private citizen, not as an arm of the United States, and held it to be
subject to the Eleventh Amendment bar on suits against
States. 178 U. S., at 446-447.

The PCAs' business is making commercial loans, and all
their stock is owned by private entities. Their interests are
not coterminous with those of the Government any more
than most commercial interests. Despite their formal and
undoubted designation as instrumentalities of the United

Opinion of the Court

States, and despite their entitlement to those tax immunitiesaccorded by the explicit statutory mandate, PCA's do not

have or exercise power analogous to that of the NLRB orany of the departments or regulatory agencies of the United
States. This suffices for us to conclude that instrumentalitystatus does not in and of itself entitle an entity to the same
exemption the United States has under the Tax InjunctionAct.

The Tax Injunction Act is grounded in the need of Statesto administer their fiscal affairs without undue interference
from federal courts. As all parties concede, respondentshave a "speedy, plain, and efficient remedy" in state court.
In holding that the PCA's are subject to the Act's restrictionon federal-court jurisdiction, we further the State's interests
without sacrificing those of the Government of the UnitedStates.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

It is so ordered.

BOGGS v. BOGGS et al.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-79. Argued January 15, 1997--Decided June 2, 1997
Respondents are the sons of Isaac and Dorothy Boggs. After Dorothy's

death in 1979, Isaac married petitioner Sandra Boggs. When Isaac retired in 1985, he received various benefits from his employer's retirement plans, including a lump-sum savings plan distribution, which he
rolled over into an individual retirement account (IRA); shares of stock
from the company's employee stock ownership plan (ESOP); and a
monthly annuity payment. Following his death in 1989, this dispute
over ownership of the benefits arose between Sandra and the sons. The
sons' claim is based on Dorothy's purported testamentary transfer to
them, under Louisiana law, of a portion of her community property interest in Isaac's undistributed pension plan benefits. Sandra contested
the validity of that transfer, arguing that the sons' claim is pre-empted
by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),
29 U. S. C. $ 1001 et seq. The Federal District Court disagreed and
granted summary judgment against Sandra, and the Fifth Circuit

affirmed.

Held: ERISA pre-empts a state law allowing a nonparticipant spouse to

transfer by testamentary instrument an interest in undistributed pension plan benefits. Pp. 839-854.

(a) In order to resolve this case, the Court need not interpret
ERISA's pre-emption clause, $ 1144(a), but can simply apply conventional conflict pre-emption principles, asking whether Louisiana's community property law conflicts with ERISA and frustrates its purposes.
Pp. 839-841.

(b) To the extent Louisiana law provides the sons with a right to a
portion of Sandra's survivor's annuity, it is pre-empted. That annuity
is a qualified joint and survivor annuity mandated by $ 1055, the object
of which is to ensure a stream of income to surviving spouses. ERISA's
solicitude for the economic security of such spouses would be undermined by allowing a predeceasing spouse's heirs and legatees to have a
community property interest in the survivor's annuity. Even a plan
participant cannot defeat a nonparticipant surviving spouse's statutory
entitlement to such an annuity. See $ 1055(c)(2). Nothing in ERISA's
language supports the conclusion that Congress decided to permit a predeceasing nonparticipant spouse to do so. Testamentary transfers such

834 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Syllabus
as the one at issue could reduce the annuity below the ERISA minimum.
See $ 1055(d)(1). Perhaps even more troubling, the recipient of the
transfer need not be a family member; e. g., the annuity might be substantially reduced so that funds could be diverted to support an unrelated stranger. In the face of this direct clash between state law and
ERISA's provisions and objectives, the state law cannot stand. See
Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 98.
Pp. 841-844.

(c) The sons' state-law claim to a portion of Isaac's monthly annuity
payments, IRA, and ESOP shares is also pre-empted. ERISA's principal object is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries. See, e. g.,

$$ 1001(b), (c), 1103(c)(1), 1104(a)(1), 1108(a)(2), 1132(a)(1)(B). The Act
confers pension plan beneficiary status on a nonparticipant spouse or
dependent only to the extent that a survivor's annuity is required
in covered plans, $ 1055(a), or a "qualified domestic relations order"
awards the spouse or dependent an interest in a participant's benefits,

$$ 1056(d)(3)(K) and (J). These provisions, which acknowledge and protect specific pension plan community property interests, give rise to
the strong implication that other community property claims are not
consistent with the statutory scheme. ERISA's silence with respect to
the right of a nonparticipant spouse to control pension plan benefits by
testamentary transfer provides powerful support for the conclusion that
the right does not exist. Cf. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 147-148. The sons have no claim to a share of the
benefits at issue because they are neither participants nor beneficiaries
under $$ 1002(7) and (8), but base their claims on Dorothy's attempted
testamentary transfer. It would be inimical to ERISA's purposes to
permit them to prevail. Early cases holding that ERISA did not preempt spousal community property interests in pension benefits, regardless of who was the plan participant or beneficiary, are not applicable
here in light of subsequent amendments to ERISA. Reading ERISA
to permit nonbeneficiary interests, even if not enforced against the plan,
would result in troubling anomalies that do not accord with the statutory scheme. That Congress intended to pre-empt respondents' interests is given specific and powerful reinforcement by $ 1056(d)(1), which
requires pension plans to specify that benefits "may not be assigned
or alienated." Dorothy's testamentary transfer to her sons is such a
prohibited "assignment or alienation" under the applicable regulations.
Community property laws have, in the past, been pre-empted in order
to prevent the diversion of retirement benefits. See, e. g., Free v.
Bland, 369 U. S. 663, 669. It does not matter that respondents have
sought to enforce their purported rights only after Isaac's benefits were

Opinion of the Court
participant spouse to transfer by testamentary instrumentan interest in undistributed pension plan benefits. Given

the pervasive significance of pension plans in the nationaleconomy, the congressional mandate for their uniform and
comprehensive regulation, and the fundamental importanceof community property law in defining the marital partnership in a number of States, the question is of undoubted im-portance. We hold that ERISA pre-empts the state law.

I
Isaac Boggs worked for South Central Bell from 1949 untilhis retirement in 1985. Isaac and Dorothy, his first wife,

were married when he began working for the company, andthey remained husband and wife until Dorothy's death in
1979. They had three sons. Within a year of Dorothy'sdeath, Isaac married Sandra, and they remained married
until his death in 1989.Upon retirement, Isaac received various benefits from his
employer's retirement plans. One was a lump-sum distribu-tion from the Bell System Savings Plan for Salaried Employees (Savings Plan) of $151,628.94, which he rolled over intoan Individual Retirement Account (IRA). He made no withdrawals and the account was worth $180,778.05 when he died.He also received 96 shares of AT&T stock from the Bell
South Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). In addi-tion, Isaac enjoyed a monthly annuity payment during his
retirement of $1,777.67 from the Bell South Service Retire-ment Program.

The instant dispute over ownership of the benefits is be-tween Sandra (the surviving wife) and the sons of the first
marriage. The sons' claim to a portion of the benefits isbased on Dorothy's will. Dorothy bequeathed to Isaac onethird of her estate, and a lifetime usufruct in the remainingtwo-thirds. A lifetime usufruct is the rough equivalent of a
common-law life estate. See La. Civ. Code Ann., Art. 535(West 1980). She bequeathed to her sons the naked owner520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:41] PAGES PGT: OPIN

837Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
ship in the remaining two-thirds, subject to Isaac's usufruct.All agree that, absent pre-emption, Louisiana law controls

and that under it Dorothy's will would dispose of her commu-nity property interest in Isaac's undistributed pension plan
benefits. A Louisiana state court, in a 1980 order entitled
"Judgment of Possession," ascribed to Dorothy's estate acommunity property interest in Isaac's Savings Plan account

valued at the time at $21,194.29.Sandra contests the validity of Dorothy's 1980 testamentary transfer, basing her claim to those benefits on her in-terest under Isaac's will and 29 U. S. C. $ 1055. Isaac bequeathed to Sandra outright certain real property including
the family home. His will also gave Sandra a lifetime usufruct in the remainder of his estate, with the naked ownership interest being held by the sons. Sandra argues that
the sons' competing claim, since it is based on Dorothy's 1980
purported testamentary transfer of her community property
interest in undistributed pension plan benefits, is pre-empted
by ERISA. The Bell South Service Retirement Program
monthly annuity is now paid to Sandra as the surviving
spouse.

After Isaac's death, two of the sons filed an action in state
court requesting the appointment of an expert to compute
the percentage of the retirement benefits they would be entitled to as a result of Dorothy's attempted testamentary
transfer. They further sought a judgment awarding them a
portion of: the IRA; the ESOP shares of AT&T stock; the
monthly annuity payments received by Isaac during his
retirement; and Sandra's survivor annuity payments, both
received and payable.

In response, Sandra Boggs filed a complaint in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana,
seeking a declaratory judgment that ERISA pre-empts the
application of Louisiana's community property and succession laws to the extent they recognize the sons' claim to an
interest in the disputed retirement benefits. The District

838 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Opinion of the Court
Court granted summary judgment against Sandra Boggs.849 F. Supp. 462 (1994). It found that, under Louisiana community property law, Dorothy had an ownership interest inher husband's pension plan benefits built up during their
marriage. The creation of this interest, the court explained,
does not violate 29 U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1), which prohibits pen-sion plan benefits from being "assigned" or "alienated," since

Congress did not intend to alter traditional familial and sup-port obligations. In the court's view, there was no assignment or alienation because Dorothy's rights in the benefitswere acquired by operation of community property law and
not by transfer from Isaac. Turning to Dorothy's testamentary transfer, the court found it effective because "[ERISA]
does not display any particular interest in preserving maximum benefits to any particular beneficiary." 849 F. Supp.,
at 465.

A divided panel of the Fifth Circuit affirmed. 82 F. 3d 90
(1996). The court stressed that Louisiana law affects only
what a plan participant may do with his or her benefits after
they are received and not the relationship between the pension plan administrator and the plan beneficiary. Id., at 96.
For the reasons given by the District Court, it found
ERISA's pension plan anti-alienation provision, $ 1056(d)(1),
inapplicable to Louisiana's creation of Dorothy Boggs' community property interest in the pension plan benefits. It
concluded that the transfer of the interest from Dorothy to
her sons was not a prohibited assignment or alienation, as
this transfer was "two steps removed from the disbursement
of benefits." Id., at 97.

Six members of the Court of Appeals dissented from the
failure to grant rehearing en banc. 89 F. 3d 1169 (1996). In
their view, a testamentary transfer of an interest in undistributed retirement benefits frustrates ERISA's goals of
securing national uniformity in pension plan administration
and of ensuring that retirees, and their dependents, are the
actual recipients of retirement income. They believed that

839Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
Congress' creation of the qualified domestic relations order(QDRO) mechanism in $ 1056(d)(3), whose requirements were

not met by the 1980 judgment of possession, further sup-ported their position. (A QDRO is a limited exception to
the pension plan anti-alienation provision and allows courtsto recognize a nonparticipant spouse's community property
interest in pension plans under specific circumstances.)The reasoning and holding of the Fifth Circuit's decision
is in substantial conflict with the decision of the Court ofAppeals for the Ninth Circuit in

Ablamis v. Roper, 937 F. 2d1450 (1991), which held that ERISA pre-empts a testamentary transfer by a nonparticipant spouse of her communityproperty interest in undistributed pension plan benefits.
The division between the Circuits is significant, for the FifthCircuit has jurisdiction over the community property States
of Louisiana and Texas, while the Ninth Circuit includes thecommunity property States of Arizona, California, Idaho,
Nevada, and Washington. Having granted certiorari to re-solve the issue, 519 U. S. 957 (1996), we now reverse.

ERISA pre-emption questions are recurrent, two othercases on the subject having come before the Court in the

current Term alone, see California Div. of Labor StandardsEnforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S.
316 (1997); De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and ClinicalServices Fund, ante, p. 806. In large part the number of
ERISA pre-emption cases reflects the comprehensive natureof the statute, the centrality of pension and welfare plans in
the national economy, and their importance to the financialsecurity of the Nation's work force. ERISA is designed to
ensure the proper administration of pension and welfareplans, both during the years of the employee's active service
and in his or her retirement years.This case lies at the intersection of ERISA pension law
and state community property law. None can dispute the

Opinion of the Court
central role community property laws play in the nine com-munity property States. It is more than a property regime.

It is a commitment to the equality of husband and wife andreflects the real partnership inherent in the marital relationship. State community property laws, many of ancient lin-eage, "must have continued to exist through such lengths of
time because of their manifold excellences and are not lightlyto be abrogated or tossed aside." 1 W. de Funiak, Principles
of Community Property 11 (1943). The community propertyregime in Louisiana dates from 1808 when the territorial legislature of Orleans drafted a civil code that adopted Spanishprinciples of community property.

Id., at 85-89. Louisi-ana's community property laws, and the community property

regimes enacted in other States, implement policies and val-ues lying within the traditional domain of the States. These
considerations inform our pre-emption analysis. See Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U. S. 572, 581 (1979).The nine community property States have some 80 million

residents, with perhaps $1 trillion in retirement plans. SeeBrief for Estate Planning, Trust and Probate Law Section of
the State Bar of California as Amicus Curiae 1. This caseinvolves a community property claim, but our ruling will affect as well the right to make claims or assert interests basedon the law of any State, whether or not it recognizes community property. Our ruling must be consistent with the con-gressional scheme to assure the security of plan participants
and their families in every State. In enacting ERISA, Con-gress noted the importance of pension plans in its findings
and declaration of policy, explaining:

"[T]he growth in size, scope, and numbers of employeebenefit plans in recent years has been rapid and

substantial; . . . the continued well-being and security ofmillions of employees and their dependents are directly
affected by these plans; . . . they are affected with anational public interest [and] they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and

Opinion of the Court
the successful development of industrial relations . . . ."29 U. S. C. $ 1001(a).

ERISA is an intricate, comprehensive statute. Its federalregulatory scheme governs employee benefit plans, which
include both pension and welfare plans. All employee bene-fit plans must conform to various reporting, disclosure, and
fiduciary requirements, see $$ 1021-1031, 1101-1114, whilepension plans must also comply with participation, vesting,
and funding requirements, see $$ 1051-1086. The survivingspouse annuity and QDRO provisions, central to the dispute
here, are part of the statute's mandatory participation and
vesting requirements. These provisions provide detailedprotections to spouses of plan participants which, in some

cases, exceed what their rights would be were communityproperty law the sole measure.

ERISA's express pre-emption clause states that the Act"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may
now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . ."$ 1144(a). We can begin, and in this case end, the analysis
by simply asking if state law conflicts with the provisions of
ERISA or operates to frustrate its objects. We hold thatthere is a conflict, which suffices to resolve the case. We

need not inquire whether the statutory phrase "relate to"provides further and additional support for the pre-emption
claim. Nor need we consider the applicability of field pre-emption, see

Fidelity Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. De la
Cuesta, 458 U. S. 141, 153 (1982).We first address the survivor's annuity and then turn to

the other pension benefits.

Sandra Boggs, as we have observed, asserts that federal
law pre-empts and supersedes state law and requires the
surviving spouse annuity to be paid to her as the sole beneficiary. We agree.

520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
842 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Opinion of the Court
The annuity at issue is a qualified joint and survivor annuity mandated by ERISA. Section 1055(a) provides:

"Each pension plan to which this section applies shall
provide that--

"(1) in the case of a vested participant who does not
die before the annuity starting date, the accrued benefit
payable to such participant shall be provided in the form
of a qualified joint and survivor annuity."

ERISA requires that every qualified joint and survivor annuity include an annuity payable to a nonparticipant surviving spouse. The survivor's annuity may not be less than
50% of the amount of the annuity which is payable during
the joint lives of the participant and spouse. $ 1055(d)(1).
Provision of the survivor's annuity may not be waived by the
participant, absent certain limited circumstances, unless the
spouse consents in writing to the designation of another beneficiary, which designation also cannot be changed without
further spousal consent, witnessed by a plan representative
or notary public. $ 1055(c)(2). Sandra Boggs, as the surviving spouse, is entitled to a survivor's annuity under these
provisions. She has not waived her right to the survivor's
annuity, let alone consented to having the sons designated as
the beneficiaries.

Respondents say their state-law claims are consistent with
these provisions. Their claims, they argue, affect only the
disposition of plan proceeds after they have been disbursed
by the Bell South Service Retirement Program, and thus
nothing is required of the plan. ERISA's concern for securing national uniformity in the administration of employee
benefit plans, in their view, is not implicated. They argue
Sandra's community property obligations, after she receives
the survivor annuity payments, "fai[l] to implicate the regulatory concerns of ERISA." Fort Halifax Packing Co. v.
Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 15 (1987).

843Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
We disagree. The statutory object of the qualified jointand survivor annuity provisions, along with the rest of

$ 1055, is to ensure a stream of income to surviving spouses.Section 1055 mandates a survivor's annuity not only where
a participant dies after the annuity starting date but also
guarantees one if the participant dies before then. See$$ 1055(a)(2), (e). These provisions, enacted as part of the

Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA), Pub. L. 98-397, 98Stat. 1426, enlarged ERISA's protection of surviving spouses
in significant respects. Before REA, ERISA only requiredthat pension plans, if they provided for the payment of benefits in the form of an annuity, offer a qualified joint and survivor annuity as an option entirely within a participant's discretion. 29 U. S. C. $$ 1055(a), (e) (1982 ed.). REA modified
ERISA to permit participants to designate a beneficiary for
the survivor's annuity, other than the nonparticipant spouse,
only when the spouse agrees. $ 1055(c)(2). Congress' concern for surviving spouses is also evident from the expansive
coverage of $ 1055, as amended by REA. Section 1055's requirements, as a general matter, apply to all "individual account plans" and "defined benefit plans." $ 1055(b)(1). The
terms are defined, for $ 1055 purposes, so that all pension
plans fall within those two categories. See $ 1002(35).
While some individual account plans escape $ 1055's surviving spouse annuity requirements under certain conditions,
Congress still protects the interests of the surviving spouse
by requiring those plans to pay the spouse the nonforfeitable
accrued benefits, reduced by certain security interests, in a
lump-sum payment. $ 1055(b)(1)(C).

ERISA's solicitude for the economic security of surviving
spouses would be undermined by allowing a predeceasing
spouse's heirs and legatees to have a community property
interest in the survivor's annuity. Even a plan participant
cannot defeat a nonparticipant surviving spouse's statutory
entitlement to an annuity. It would be odd, to say the least,
if Congress permitted a predeceasing nonparticipant spouse

Opinion of the Court
to do so. Nothing in the language of ERISA supports con-cluding that Congress made such an inexplicable decision.

Testamentary transfers could reduce a surviving spouse'sguaranteed annuity below the minimum set by ERISA (defined as 50% of the annuity payable during the joint lives ofthe participant and spouse). In this case, Sandra's annuity
would be reduced by approximately 20%, according to thecalculations contained in the sons' state-court filings. There
is no reason why testamentary transfers could not reduce asurvivor's annuity by an even greater amount. Perhaps
even more troubling, the recipient of the testamentary trans-fer need not be a family member. For instance, a surviving spouse's $ 1055 annuity might be substantially reducedso that funds could be diverted to support an unrelated
stranger.In the face of this direct clash between state law and the
provisions and objectives of ERISA, the state law cannotstand. Conventional conflict pre-emption principles require
pre-emption "where compliance with both federal and stateregulations is a physical impossibility, . . . or where state law
stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and executionof the full purposes and objectives of Congress."

Gade v.National Solid Wastes Management Assn., 505 U. S. 88, 98

(1992) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Itwould undermine the purpose of ERISA's mandated survivor's annuity to allow Dorothy, the predeceasing spouse, byher testamentary transfer to defeat in part Sandra's entitlement to the annuity $ 1055 guarantees her as the survivingspouse. This cannot be. States are not free to change
ERISA's structure and balance.Louisiana law, to the extent it provides the sons with a
right to a portion of Sandra Boggs' $ 1055 survivor's annuity,is pre-empted.

Opinion of the Court
ments made to Isaac Boggs during his retirement; the IRA;and the ESOP shares of AT&T stock. As before, the claim

is based on Dorothy Boggs' attempted testamentary transferto the sons of her community property interest in Isaac's
undistributed pension plan benefits. Respondents argue
further--and somewhat inconsistently--that their claimagain concerns only what a plan participant or beneficiary

may do once plan funds are distributed, without imposingany obligations on the plan itself. Both parties agree that
the ERISA benefits at issue here were paid after Dorothy'sdeath, and thus this case does not present the question
whether ERISA would permit a nonparticipant spouse to obtain a devisable community property interest in benefits paid
out during the existence of the community between the participant and that spouse.

A brief overview of ERISA's design is necessary to put
respondents' contentions in the proper context. The principal object of the statute is to protect plan participants and
beneficiaries. See Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 463 U. S.
85, 90 (1983) ("ERISA is a comprehensive statute designed
to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries
in employee benefit plans"). Section 1001(b) states that the
policy of ERISA is "to protect . . . the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries."
Section 1001(c) explains that ERISA contains certain safeguards and protections which help guarantee the "equitable
character and the soundness of [private pension] plans" in
order to protect "the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries." The general policy is implemented by ERISA's specific provisions. Apart from a
few enumerated exceptions, a plan fiduciary must "discharge
his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries." $ 1104(a)(1). The assets of
a plan, again with certain exceptions, are "held for the exclusive purposes of providing benefits to participants in the plan
and their beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of

Opinion of the Court
administering the plan." $ 1103(c)(1). The Secretary ofLabor has authority to create exemptions to ERISA's prohibition on certain plan holdings, acquisitions, and transac-tions, but only if doing so is in the interests of the plan's
"participants and beneficiaries." $ 1108(a)(2). Persons with
an interest in a pension plan may bring a civil suit underERISA's enforcement provisions only if they are either a

participant or beneficiary. Section 1132(a)(1)(B), for in-stance, provides that a civil action may be brought "by a
participant or beneficiary . . . to recover benefits due to himunder the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the
terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits
under the terms of the plan."

ERISA confers beneficiary status on a nonparticipant
spouse or dependent in only narrow circumstances delineated by its provisions. For example, as we have discussed,

$ 1055(a) requires provision of a surviving spouse annuity in
covered pension plans, and, as a consequence, the spouse is a
beneficiary to this extent. Section 1056's QDRO provisions
likewise recognize certain pension plan community property
interests of nonparticipant spouses and dependents. A
QDRO is a type of domestic relations order that creates or
recognizes an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, a portion of the benefits payable
with respect to a participant under a plan. $ 1056(d)(3)(B)(i).
A domestic relations order, in turn, is any judgment, decree,
or order that concerns "the provision of child support,
alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse,
former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant"
and is "made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law)." $ 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii). A
domestic relations order must meet certain requirements
to qualify as a QDRO. See $$ 1056(d)(3)(C)-(E). QDRO's,
unlike domestic relations orders in general, are exempt
from both the pension plan anti-alienation provision,

$ 1056(d)(3)(A), and ERISA's general pre-emption clause,

520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

847Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Opinion of the Court

$ 1144(b)(7). In creating the QDRO mechanism Congresswas careful to provide that the alternate payee, the "spouse,

former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant,"is to be considered a plan beneficiary. $$ 1056(d)(3)(K), (J).
These provisions are essential to one of REA's central purposes, which is to give enhanced protection to the spouse anddependent children in the event of divorce or separation, and

in the event of death the surviving spouse. Apart fromthese detailed provisions, ERISA does not confer beneficiary
status on nonparticipants by reason of their marital or de-pendent status.

Even outside the pension plan context and its antialienation restriction, Congress deemed it necessary to enact
detailed provisions in order to protect a dependent's interest
in a welfare benefit plan. Through a $ 1169 "qualified medical child support order" a child's interest in his or her parent's group health care plan can be enforced. A "medical
child support order" is defined as any judgment, decree, or
order that concerns the provision of child support "made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law) and relates to benefits under such plan."

$ 1169(a)(2)(B)(i). As with a QDRO, a "medical child support
order" must satisfy certain criteria in order to qualify. See

$$ 1169(a)(3)-(4). In accordance with ERISA's care in conforming entitlements to benefits with participant or beneficiary status, the statute treats a child subject to such a qualifying order as a participant for ERISA's reporting and
disclosure requirements and as a beneficiary for other purposes. $ 1169(a)(7).

The surviving spouse annuity and QDRO provisions,
which acknowledge and protect specific pension plan community property interests, give rise to the strong implication
that other community property claims are not consistent
with the statutory scheme. ERISA's silence with respect to
the right of a nonparticipant spouse to control pension plan
benefits by testamentary transfer provides powerful support

520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
848 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Opinion of the Court
for the conclusion that the right does not exist. Cf. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Russell, 473 U. S. 134, 147-148
(1985). It should cause little surprise that Congress choseto protect the community property interests of separated

and divorced spouses and their children, a traditional subject
of domestic relations law, but not to accommodate testamen-tary transfers of pension plan benefits. As a general matter,

"[t]he whole subject of the domestic relations of husband andwife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and
not to the laws of the United States." In re Burrus, 136U. S. 586, 593-594 (1890). Support obligations, in particular,
are "deeply rooted moral responsibilities" that Congress is
unlikely to have intended to intrude upon. See Rose v.
Rose, 481 U. S. 619, 632 (1987); see also id., at 636-640
(O'Connor, J., concurring). In accord with these principles,
Congress ensured that state domestic relations orders, as
long as they meet certain statutory requirements, are not
pre-empted.

We conclude the sons have no claim under ERISA to a
share of the retirement benefits. To begin with, the sons
are neither participants nor beneficiaries. A "participant"
is defined as an "employee or former employee of an employer, or any member or former member of an employee
organization, who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit." $ 1002(7). A "beneficiary" is a "person designated by
a participant, or by the terms of an employee benefit plan,
who is or may become entitled to a benefit thereunder."

$ 1002(8). Respondents' claims are based on Dorothy Boggs'
attempted testamentary transfer, not on a designation by
Isaac Boggs or under the terms of the retirement plans.
They do not even attempt to argue that they are beneficiaries by virtue of the judgment of possession qualifying as a
QDRO.

An amicus, the Estate Planning, Trust and Probate Law
Section of the State Bar of California, in support of respondents' position, points to pre-REA case law holding that

849Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
ERISA does not pre-empt spousal community property in-terests in pension benefits, regardless of who is the plan participant or beneficiary. As did the District Court below, the
amicus relies in particular upon In re Marriage of Campa,
89 Cal. App. 3d 113, 152 Cal. Rptr. 362 (1979), in which the
California Court of Appeal for the First District held thatERISA does not bar California courts from joining pension

funds in marriage dissolution proceedings and ordering thepension plan to divide pension payments between the employee and his or her former nonparticipant spouse. We dis-missed the pension plan's appeal for want of a substantial
federal question, 444 U. S. 1028 (1980), and, although not
entitled to full precedential weight, see Edelman v. Jordan,
415 U. S. 651, 670-671 (1974), that disposition constitutes a
decision on the merits, see Hicks v. Miranda, 422 U. S. 332,
344 (1975). The state court in Marriage of Campa was not
alone in refusing to find ERISA pre-emption in the divorce
context. See, e. g., Stone v. Stone, 450 F. Supp. 919 (ND Cal.
1978), aff 'd, 632 F. 2d 740 (CA9 1980), cert. denied, 453 U. S.
922 (1981); Savings and Profit Sharing Fund of Sears Employees v. Gago, 717 F. 2d 1038 (CA7 1983); Eichelberger v.
Eichelberger, 584 F. Supp. 899 (SD Tex. 1984). This judicial
consensus, amicus argues, was codified by the QDRO provisions which were contained in the 1984 REA amendments.
The amicus contends that since REA, or the pre-REA case
law which it allegedly adopted, did not consider the community property rights of a nonparticipant spouse in the testamentary context, it should not be construed to pre-empt
state law governing this different subject.

We disagree with this reasoning. It is true that the subject of testamentary transfers is somewhat removed from
domestic relations law. The QDRO provisions address the
rights of divorced and separated spouses, and their dependent children, which are the traditional concern of domestic
relations law. The pre-REA federal common-law extension
of $ 1002(8)'s definition of "beneficiary" by courts in the con520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
850 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Opinion of the Court
text of marital dissolution was in part based on an apprecia-tion of the fact that domestic relations law is primarily an

area of state concern, see Marriage of Campa, supra, at 124,152 Cal. Rptr., at 367-368, and the basic principle that a beneficiary's interest in a spendthrift trust, despite otherwise
applicable protections, can be reached in the context of di-vorce and separation. See E. Griswold, Spendthrift Trusts

389-391 (2d ed. 1947) (summarizing state case law); Restate-ment (Second) of Trusts $ 157 (1959). The state court in
Marriage of Campa took its implicit determination that thenonparticipant spouse was a beneficiary to its logical conclusion, forcing the pension plan to join the marital dissolution
proceedings as a party and compelling it to pay the spouse
her share of the pension benefits. Whether or not this extension of the definition of "beneficiary" was consistent with
the statute then in force, these authorities are not applicable
in light of the REA amendments. The QDRO and the surviving spouse annuity provisions define the scope of a nonparticipant spouse's community property interests in pension
plans consistent with ERISA.

Respondents and their amicus in effect ask us to ignore

$ 1002(8)'s definition of "beneficiary" and, through case law,
create a new class of persons for whom plan assets are to be
held and administered. The statute is not amenable to this
sweeping extratextual extension. It is unpersuasive to
suggest that third parties could assert their claims without being counted as "beneficiaries." A plan fiduciary's
responsibilities run only to participants and beneficiaries.

$ 1104(a)(1). Assets of a plan are held for the exclusive
purposes of providing benefits to participants and beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administration.

$ 1103(c)(1). Reading ERISA to permit nonbeneficiary interests, even if not enforced against the plan, would result
in troubling anomalies. Either pension plans would be run
for the benefit of only a subset of those who have a stake in
the plan or state law would have to move in to fill the appar520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ent gaps between plan administration responsibilities andownership rights, resulting in a complex set of requirements

varying from State to State. Neither result accords withthe statutory scheme.

The conclusion that Congress intended to pre-empt respondents' nonbeneficiary, nonparticipant interests in theretirement plans is given specific and powerful reinforcement by the pension plan anti-alienation provision. Section1056(d)(1) provides that "[e]ach pension plan shall provide
that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned oralienated." Statutory anti-alienation provisions are potent
mechanisms to prevent the dissipation of funds. In Hisquierdo we interpreted an anti-alienation provision to bar a
divorced spouse's interest in her husband's retirement benefits. See 439 U. S., at 583-590. ERISA's pension plan antialienation provision is mandatory and contains only two explicit exceptions, see $$ 1056(d)(2), (d)(3)(A), which are not
subject to judicial expansion. See Guidry v. Sheet Metal
Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365, 376 (1990). The
anti-alienation provision can "be seen to bespeak a pension
law protective policy of special intensity: Retirement funds
shall remain inviolate until retirement." J. Langbein & B.
Wolk, Pension and Employee Benefit Law 547 (2d ed. 1995).

Dorothy's 1980 testamentary transfer, which is the source
of respondents' claimed ownership interest, is a prohibited
"assignment or alienation." An "assignment or alienation"
has been defined by regulation, with certain exceptions not
at issue here, as "[a]ny direct or indirect arrangement
whereby a party acquires from a participant or beneficiary"
an interest enforceable against a plan to "all or any part
of a plan benefit payment which is, or may become, payable to the participant or beneficiary." 26 CFR $ 1.401(a)-
13(c)(1)(ii) (1997). Those requirements are met. Under
Louisiana law community property interests are enforceable
against a plan. See Eskine v. Eskine, 518 So. 2d 505, 508
(La. 1988). If respondents' claims were allowed to succeed

852 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Opinion of the Court
they would have acquired, as of 1980, an interest in Isaac'spension plan at the expense of plan participants and

beneficiaries.As was true with survivors' annuities, it would be inimical
to ERISA's purposes to permit testamentary recipients to
acquire a competing interest in undistributed pension bene-fits, which are intended to provide a stream of income to

participants and their beneficiaries. See Guidry, supra, at376 ("[The anti-alienation provision] reflects a considered
congressional policy choice, a decision to safeguard a streamof income for pensioners . . . and their dependents . . .").
Pension benefits support participants and beneficiaries in
their retirement years, and ERISA's pension plan safeguards
are designed to further this end. See $ 1001(c). Besides
the anti-alienation provision, Congress has enacted other
protective measures to guarantee that retirement funds are
there when a plan's participants and beneficiaries expect
them. There are, for instance, minimum funding standards
for pension plans and a pension plan termination insurance
program which guarantees benefits in the event a plan is
terminated before being fully funded. See $$ 1082, 1301-
1461. Under respondents' approach, retirees could find
their retirement benefits reduced by substantial sums because they have been diverted to testamentary recipients.
Retirement benefits and the income stream provided for by
ERISA-regulated plans would be disrupted in the name of
protecting a nonparticipant spouses' successors over plan
participants and beneficiaries. Respondents' logic would
even permit a spouse to transfer an interest in a pension
plan to creditors, a result incompatible with a spendthrift
provision such as $ 1056(d)(1).

Community property laws have, in the past, been preempted in order to ensure the implementation of a federal
statutory scheme. See, e. g., McCune v. Essig, 199 U. S. 382
(1905); Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655 (1950); Free v.
Bland, 369 U. S. 663 (1962); Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439

U. S. 572 (1979); McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S. 210 (1981);
Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U. S. 581 (1989); cf. Ridgway v.
Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46 (1981). Free v. Bland, supra, is ofparticular relevance here. A husband had purchased United

States savings bonds with community funds in the name of
both spouses. Under Treasury regulations then in effect,when a co-owner of the bonds died, the surviving co-owner

received the entire interest in the bonds. After the wifedied, her son--the principal beneficiary of her will--demanded either one-half of the bonds or reimbursement forloss of the community property interest. The Court held
that the regulations pre-empted the community propertyclaim, explaining:

"One of the inducements selected by the Treasury is thesurvivorship provision, a convenient method of avoiding complicated probate proceedings. Notwithstandingthis provision, the State awarded full title to the coowner but required him to account for half of the value
of the bonds to the decedent's estate. Viewed realisti-cally, the State has rendered the award of title meaningless." Id., at 669.
The same reasoning applies here. If state law is not pre-empted, the diversion of retirement benefits will occur

regardless of whether the interest in the pension plan is enforced against the plan or the recipient of the pension benefit.The obligation to provide an accounting, moreover, as with

the probate proceedings referred to in Free, is itself a burdenof significant proportions. Under respondents' view, a pension plan participant could be forced to make an accounting
of a deceased spouse's community property interest years
after the date of death. If the couple had lived in several
States, the accounting could entail complex, expensive, and
time-consuming litigation. Congress could not have intended that pension benefits from pension plans would be
given to accountants and attorneys for this purpose.

854 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Breyer, J., dissenting
Respondents contend it is anomalous and unfair that a di-vorced spouse, as a result of a QDRO, will have more control

over a portion of his or her spouse's pension benefits thana predeceasing spouse. Congress thought otherwise. The
QDRO provisions, as well as the surviving spouse annuity
provisions, reinforce the conclusion that ERISA is concernedwith providing for the living. The QDRO provisions protect

those persons who, often as a result of divorce, might notreceive the benefits they otherwise would have had available
during their retirement as a means of income. In the caseof a predeceased spouse, this concern is not implicated. The
fairness of the distinction might be debated, but Congresshas decided to favor the living over the dead and we must
respect its policy.

The axis around which ERISA's protections revolve is the
concepts of participant and beneficiary. When Congress has
chosen to depart from this framework, it has done so in a
careful and limited manner. Respondents' claims, if allowed
to succeed, would depart from this framework, upsetting the
deliberate balance central to ERISA. It does not matter
that respondents have sought to enforce their rights only
after the retirement benefits have been distributed since
their asserted rights are based on the theory that they had
an interest in the undistributed pension plan benefits. Their
state-law claims are pre-empted. The judgment of the Fifth
Circuit is

Reversed.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice O'Connor joins,

The question in this case is whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U. S. C.

$ 1001 et seq., "pre-empts," and thereby nullifies, state community property law. The state law in question would permit a wife to leave to her children her share of the pension

assets that her husband has earned (or, to put the matter
in "community property" terms, that she and her husband
together have earned) during their marriage. From the
perspective of property law, the issue is unusually important,
for, we are told, the answer potentially affects nine community property States, with more than 80 million residents,
and over $1 trillion in ERISA-qualified pension plans--plans
that are often a couple's most important lifetime assets. In
my view, Congress did not intend ERISA to pre-empt this
testamentary aspect of community property law--at least
not in the circumstances present here, where a first wife's
bequest need not prevent a second wife from obtaining
precisely those benefits that ERISA specifically sets aside
for her. See $ 1055(a). The Fifth Circuit's determination
is consistent with this view. I would therefore affirm its
judgment.

I

A

This case concerns the disposition of pension plan assets
earned by an employee who was married; who had children;
whose first wife died; who remarried; who retired; and who
then died, survived by his second wife. To be more specific,
the employee, Isaac Boggs, a resident of Louisiana, began
work for South Central Bell Telephone Company (now
known as BellSouth) in 1949. He participated in its
ERISA-qualified pension plan for about 36 years. He was
married to his first wife, Dorothy Boggs, during almost all
of that time--from 1949 until 1979, when Dorothy died. The
couple had three children. Isaac married his second wife,
Sandra, in 1980. He retired in 1985. He died in 1989.
Sandra survives him.

When Dorothy died, she left a will providing that Isaac
would receive " `the maximum [share of her estate] permitted
under the law,' " as well as a lifetime " `usufruct' " (rather
like a common-law life estate) in the remainder. Brief for

Breyer, J., dissenting
Respondents 1, 2. The parties agree that this meant thatIsaac received one-third of her estate outright. Under Louisiana law, the three sons of Dorothy and Isaac would receivewhat was left of the remaining two-thirds at Isaac's death
(i. e., the "naked ownership," or the equivalent of a common-law remainder).

Throughout his working life, and during his entire 30-yearmarriage to Dorothy, Isaac participated in a set of BellSouth's ERISA-qualified retirement plans. When Isaac re-tired in 1985 (six years after Dorothy's death), he received
three assets from those plans: (1) 96 shares of AT&T stock(from BellSouth's Employee Stock Ownership Plan); (2)

a
cash payment of about $150,000 (from BellSouth's SavingsPlan for Salaried Employees); and (3) an annuity of about

$1,800 per month (from BellSouth's Management PensionPlan) for his life and afterwards for that of his surviving
second spouse, Sandra. Isaac almost immediately placedthe $150,000 cash payment in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), thereby avoiding immediate payment of an in-come tax. See 26 U. S. C. $ 408(e)(1); see also S. Bruce, Pension Claims: Rights and Obligations 7 (2d ed. 1993). Isaacbequeathed a lifetime usufruct in his property, presumably
including some or all of the AT&T stock and the funds in theIRA, to his second wife, Sandra. Sandra, as his survivor,
also began to receive the $1,800 monthly annuity.

On December 17, 1992, Sandra Boggs filed an action fordeclaratory judgment in Federal District Court. See 29

U. S. C. $ 1132(a)(1)(B) (plan participant or beneficiary maybring action to "clarify . . . rights to future benefits"). She
said that the three children of Isaac and Dorothy had them-selves brought an action in state court against her and
against Isaac's estate, seeking a portion of the pension bene-fits from the BellSouth plans. The children said that under
Louisiana law, their mother, Dorothy, had owned a one-half

share in Isaac's rights under the BellSouth retirement plans(insofar as they had accrued prior to Dorothy's death) and

that she had left them a portion of that share (two-thirds ofthe "naked interest" after Isaac's death). They asked (in
Sandra's words) for "an accounting" as well as "for an undi-vided interest in, and/or the value of an undivided interest
in, the assets and/or benefits" that were paid out of the pen-sion plans. Petition for Declaratory Judgment in No. 92-
4174 (ED La., Nov. 16, 1992), p. 3. Sandra asked the DistrictCourt to declare that, insofar as state law entitled the children to some of the plan benefits, ERISA pre-empted thatstate law. In a nutshell, she asked the court to say that the
shares of stock, the cash, and the annuity payments wereentirely hers.

The District Court disagreed with Sandra. It denied hermotion for summary judgment and declared that "ERISA
does not preempt Louisiana's community property laws."849 F. Supp. 462, 467 (ED La. 1994); see also Judgment in
No. 92-4174 (ED La., Mar. 9, 1994), p. 1. The Fifth CircuitCourt of Appeals affirmed. We are reviewing the Fifth Circuit's decision in respect to pre-emption; and we must there-fore assume its view of the relevant facts and state law.

riage to Dorothy belongs both to Isaac and to Dorothy--thatis, to them as a community--and not to the one any more

community property even if the employee spouse makes nocash contributions to plan).

Louisiana law, like the law of other States, today allowsboth women and men to leave their property to their children. La. Civ. Code Ann., Art. 2346 (West 1985) ("Each

Matrimonial Regimes 1-2 (1989) (until 1980, Louisiana law
considered a husband to be the " `head and master' " and exclusive manager of community property). And we must assume, as did the Fifth Circuit, that Louisiana law would permit Dorothy's children, to whom she left her property, to
obtain an accounting to determine the extent to which the
stock, the IRA, and the monthly annuity, in fact belong to
them. See 82 F. 3d, at 97 ("[Dorothy's] spouse, or his estate,

the equivalent cash value). See generally La. Civ. CodeAnn., Art. 4 (West 1993) ("When no rule for a particular situation can be derived from legislation or custom, the court isbound to proceed according to equity").

We ask here whether--or the extent to which--ERISAstands as an obstacle to the enforcement of this state law as
applied in this case. It does so if state law "relate[s] to anyemployee benefit plan," 29 U. S. C. $ 1144(a), or if it conflicts
with specific provisions of ERISA. Applying the relevantcriteria, I can find no basis for pre-emption.

A
Louisiana community property law "relates to" an ERISAplan within the meaning of $ 1144(a) if it expressly "refer[s]"

to such a plan, or if it has an impermissible "connection with"a plan.

California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcementv. Dillingham Constr., N. A., Inc., 519 U. S. 316, 324 (1997).

Neither of these grounds for pre-emption is present here.The relevant Louisiana statute does not refer to ERISA
or to pensions at all. It simply says that "property acquiredduring the existence of the legal regime through the effort,
skill, or industry of either spouse" is "community property."La. Civ. Code Ann., Art. 2338 (West 1985). Nor does the
statute act exclusively on, or rely on the existence of, ERISAplans. See

Dillingham, supra, at 324-325. The statute'sapplication to this case arises out of judicial interpretation,

see T. L. James, supra, at 841; McClanahan $ 6:21, p. 365, ofa sort that is likely to be present whenever a generally

phrased state statute affects an ERISA plan, among otherthings. Hence there is no specific "reference" problem.

The "connection" problem is more difficult. Insofar asthat term refers to a conflict with an ERISA purpose, I discuss the matter primarily in Part II-B, infra. The term
"connection," however, might also encompass the questionwhether state law intrudes into an area Congress (given

ERISA's basic objectives) would have wanted to reserve ex-clusively for federal legislation.

Dillingham, supra, at 324
(quoting New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue
Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U. S. 645, 655 (1995)).
Cf. Malone v. White Motor Corp., 435 U. S. 497, 504 (1978)
(state law is pre-empted when it falls within a field that Congress has sought to occupy); San Diego Building Trades
Council v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 244-245 (1959) (States may
not regulate activities that are protected or prohibited under
National Labor Relations Act); Garner v. Teamsters, 346
U. S. 485, 498-499 (1953) (States may not add to or subtract
from remedies provided in National Labor Relations Act).
In my view, this latter problem (sometimes called "field preemption," see Dillingham, supra, at 336 (Scalia, J., concurring)) is not present here.

The state law in question concerns the ownership of benefits. I concede that a primary concern of ERISA is the
proper financial management of pension and welfare benefit
funds themselves, Dillingham, supra, at 326-327 (citing
Massachusetts v. Morash, 490 U. S. 107, 115 (1989)), and that
payment of benefits (which amounts to the writing of checks
from those funds) is closely "connected with" that management. I also concede that state laws that affect those payments lie closer to ERISA's federal heart than do state laws
that, say, affect those goods and services that ERISA benefit
plans purchase, such as apprenticeship training programs,
519 U. S., at 332-334, or medical benefits, De Buono v.
NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund, ante, at
814-816. But, even so, I cannot say that the state law at

861Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
issue here concerns a subject that Congress wished to placeoutside the State's legal reach.

My reason in part lies in the fact that the state law inquestion involves family, property, and probate--all areas of
traditional, and important, state concern. Rose v. Rose, 481
U. S. 619, 625 (1987) (domestic relations law traditionally leftto state regulation);

Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U. S. 572,
581 (1979) (same); Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U. S. 429, 440(1968) ("The several States, of course, have traditionally regulated the descent and distribution of estates"). But see
ante, at 848 (majority's effort to distinguish property interests passing at divorce from those passing by devise).
When this Court considers pre-emption, it works "on the `assumption that the historic police powers of the States were
not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was
the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' " Dillingham,
supra, at 325 (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331

U. S. 218 (1947)).

I can find no reasonably defined relevant category of state
law that Congress would have intended to displace. Obviously, Congress did not intend to pre-empt all state laws that
govern property ownership. After all, someone must own
an interest in ERISA plan benefits. Nor, for similar reasons, can one believe that Congress intended to pre-empt
state laws concerning testamentary bequests. This is not
an area like, say, labor relations, where Congress intended
to leave private parties to work out certain matters on their
own. See Machinists v. Wisconsin Employment Relations
Comm'n, 427 U. S. 132, 144-148 (1976). The question, "who
owns the property?" needs an answer. Ordinarily, where
federal law does not provide a specific answer, state law will
have to do so.

Nor can I find some appropriately defined forbidden category by looking to the congressional purpose of establishing
uniform laws to regulate the administration of pension funds.
Cf. Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon, 498 U. S. 133 (1990);

Breyer, J., dissenting
Massachusetts v. Morash, supra, at 115. This case does not
involve a lawsuit against a fund. I agree with the majority
that ERISA would likely pre-empt state law that permittedsuch a suit. But this is not such a case; nor is there reason to believe Louisiana law would produce such a case.
(Eskine v. Eskine, 518 So. 2d 505 (La. 1988), which is citedby the majority, involved a governmental plan that was not

covered by ERISA. See id., at 506; 29 U. S. C. $$ 1002(32),1003(b)(1).)

The lawsuit before us concerns benefits that the fund hasalready distributed; it asks not the fund, but others, for a
subsequent accounting. And, as I discuss in Part II-B-3
below, this lawsuit will not interfere with the payment of
a survivor annuity to Sandra. See $ 1055(a). Under these
circumstances, I do not see how allowing the respondents'
suit to go forward could interfere with the administration of
the BellSouth pension plan according to ERISA's requirements. Whether or not the children are allowed to seek an
accounting, the plan fiduciaries will continue to owe a duty
only to plan participants and beneficiaries. See $$ 1103(c)(1),
1104(a)(1). Contrary to the majority's suggestion, Dorothy's
children are not the equivalent of plan "participants" or
"beneficiaries," see $$ 1002(7), 1002(8), any more than would
be a grocery store, a bank, an IRA, or any other recipient of
funds that have emerged from a pension plan in the form of
a distributed benefit, and no one here claims the contrary.
Moreover, the children here are seeking an accounting only
after the plan participant has died. But even were that not
so, any threat the children's lawsuit could pose to plan administration is far less than that posed by the division of plan
assets upon separation or divorce, which is allowed under

$ 1056(d). See Part II-B-2, infra.

Of course, one could look for a still more narrowly defined
category, such as the category of "testamentary bequests of
ERISA pension benefits by one spouse who dies before the
other." But to narrow the category to this extent is to

Breyer, J., dissenting
change the question from one about occupying the field, to
one about whether, or the extent to which, Louisiana law
frustrates or interferes with an important federal purpose.

That question is important. Indeed, the Court, in other
cases, has found conflicts between state community property
law and federal statutes governing retirement, insurance,
and savings funds operated and/or funded by the Federal
Government. See Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U. S. 581, 587-
595 (1989); McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U. S. 210, 221-236
(1981); Ridgway v. Ridgway, 454 U. S. 46, 53-61 (1981); Hisquierdo, supra, at 582-590; Free v. Bland, 369 U. S. 663
(1962); Wissner v. Wissner, 338 U. S. 655, 658-660 (1950).
But those cases turned on the particular federal purposes
embodied in the particular federal statutes at issue. The
question posed here similarly requires an examination of
ERISA's specific statutory provisions to see whether they
reveal language or an important purpose with which the
State's community property laws conflict--either directly, or
in the sense that the state laws "frustrate" the achievement
of a statutory purpose. See Malone, 435 U. S., at 504. I
now turn to that question.

B

Sandra Boggs, supported by the Acting Solicitor General,
points to three statutory provisions with which, she believes,
Louisiana law conflicts--an anti-alienation provision, 29
U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1), a provision dealing with an exception to
the anti-alienation section for "qualified domestic relations
order[s]," $ 1056(d)(3)(A), and a provision that concerns joint
and survivor pension annuities, $ 1055. I shall consider each
in turn.

1

ERISA's "anti-alienation" provision, $ 1056(d)(1), says that
"benefits provided under the [qualified ERISA plan] may not
be assigned or alienated." We have stated that this provision reflects "a decision to safeguard a stream of income for

Breyer, J., dissenting
pensioners (and their dependents . . .)." Guidry v. Sheet
Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365, 376 (1990).
Sandra Boggs and the Acting Solicitor General claim thatLouisiana law interferes with a significant "anti-alienation"

objective, both (1) by permitting Dorothy, the nonparticipant
spouse, to obtain an undivided interest in the pension ofIsaac, the participant spouse; and (2) by permitting Dorothy

to transfer that interest on her death to her children, who,as far as ERISA is concerned, are third parties.

The first claim--simply attacking Dorothy's possession ofan undivided one-half interest in that portion of retirement
benefits that accrued during her marriage to Isaac--does not
attack any "assign[ment]" of an interest nor any "aliena[tion]" of an interest, for Dorothy's interest arose not
through assignment or alienation, but through the operation
of Louisiana's community property law itself. Thus, Sandra's claim must be that community property law's grant of
an undivided one-half interest in retirement benefits to a
nonparticipant wife or husband itself violates some congressional purpose. But what purpose could that be? Congress
has recognized that community property law, like any other
kind of property law, can create various property interests
for nonparticipant spouses. See 29 U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(3)(B)
(ii)(II). Community property law, like other property law,
can provide an appropriate legal framework for resolving
disputes about who owns what. $ 1056(d)(3). The antialienation provision is designed to prevent plan beneficiaries
from prematurely divesting themselves of the funds they will
need for retirement, not to prevent application of the property laws that define the legal interest in those funds. One
cannot find frustration of an "anti-alienation" purpose simply
in the state law's definition of property.

The second claim--attacking Dorothy's testamentary
transfer to her children--is more plausible. Nonetheless,
with one exception discussed below, ERISA does not concern
itself with what a pension fund beneficiary, such as Isaac,

520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

865Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
does with his pension money at his death. That is not sur-prising, for after the death of a beneficiary the money is no

longer needed for that beneficiary's support. And if ERISAdoes not embody a congressional purpose to restrict what
Isaac can do with his pension funds after his death, there is
no reason to believe it embodies some similar general pur-pose with respect to Dorothy. Insofar as the pension is community property, it belongs to both Dorothy and Isaacequally; it is just as much hers as his. Why, then, should
ERISA restrict her testamentary power in respect to herproperty any more than it restricts his?

I see one possible answer to this question. One might
argue that, because Dorothy was the first to die, her testamentary transfer gave to third parties (persons to whom
ERISA is indifferent) funds that Isaac might otherwise have
used during his retirement; and, for that reason, the testamentary transfer tends to frustrate the purpose of the "antialienation" provision or some more general ERISA purpose.
This argument (with one exception, see Part II-B-3, infra)
is beside the point, however, for the state-law action here
seeks an accounting that will take place after the deaths of
both Dorothy and Isaac. Moreover, the argument depends
upon doubtful assumptions about Congress' purposes. Consider the 96 shares of stock and $150,000 cash that Isaac received from the plans when he retired. Dorothy's bequest
affects those assets--the stock and the cash--not while they
remain in BellSouth's pension plan funds, but only after they
have emerged from the plan in the form of a distributed payment. As far as ERISA is concerned, Isaac could have used
the retirement benefits to pay for a vacation, to buy a house,
or to bet at the races, or he could have given the money to
his children. ERISA would have left Dorothy similarly free
to do what she wished with her share of the stock and the
cash, had she been alive at the time of their receipt. That
being so, I do not understand why or how ERISA could be
concerned about Dorothy's creation of a will, which affected

866 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Breyer, J., dissenting
the retirement assets only after Isaac received them. I recognize that Isaac did not use the $150,000 to buy a new
house, or to pay for medical expenses, or to gamble; rather,
he put the money into an IRA. But no one has explained
why that fact--which in all likelihood reflects the exigencies
of tax law, see 26 U. S. C. $ 408(e)(1)--should make any difference here.

2

Sandra Boggs and the Acting Solicitor General look for
support to another portion of the anti-alienation section--an
amendment that was part of the Retirement Equity Act of
1984 (REA), Pub. L. 98-397, 98 Stat. 1426--that affects the
division of assets upon divorce. That section says that the
"anti-alienation" provision, 29 U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1), "shall not
apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic
relations order" (QDRO). $ 1056(d)(3)(A). The provision
defines QDRO's to include certain court orders that are
"made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including
a community property law)," $ 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii)(II), and meet
certain other requirements, $$ 1056(d)(3)(B)(i), 1056(d)(3)(C),
1056(d)(3)(D). The Government argues that this provision
shows that court orders count as "alienations" prohibited
under $ 1056(d)(1), and that since the probate court orders
effectuating Dorothy's testamentary transfers do not fall
within the QDRO exception, the "anti-alienation" section, as
amended and taken as a whole, pre-empts Louisiana law.

The QDRO provisions, in my view, do not support the
Government's argument. The QDRO exception does not
purport to interpret the "anti-alienation" provision (quoted
supra, at 863). Rather, it simply says that the provision

"shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition
of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order . . . ."

$ 1056(d)(3)(A).

520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

867Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
The section defines "domestic relations order" (not "quali-fied domestic relations order") as a court order, judgment, or

decree made pursuant to state domestic relations law, which

"relates to the provision of child support, alimony pay-ments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former

spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant."$ 1056(d)(3)(B)(ii)(I).

It then exempts "qualified" orders from the scope of theanti-alienation provision. $ 1056(d)(3)(A). This language
does not tell us what the word "alienation" would cover inits absence. It does not tell us whether the amendment
taken as a whole clarified that the anti-alienation provisioncovers court orders (which would help Sandra) or extended
that coverage so that it included domestic relations orders(which would help the children). Hence, the amendment
tells us virtually nothing relevant about whether the prohibi-tion on anti-alienation applies to matters not covered by the
term "domestic relations orders," such as probate courtorders.

Second, the amendment, taken as a whole, concerns di-vorce and separation, not probate. See Department of
Labor Advisory Opinion 90-46A, issued Dec. 4, 1990 (citing130 Cong. Rec. 13327 (1984); S. Rep. No. 98-575, pp. 18-19
(1984)) (in enacting REA, Congress focused on marital disso-lution and dependent support). The amendment says that
state-court judges cannot award pension-related property toa nonparticipant spouse unless the order doing so meets
certain requirements, such as recordkeeping requirementsand a prohibition against increasing the amount of benefits that an ERISA plan would otherwise have to pay.$$ 1056(d)(3)(C), 1056(d)(3)(D). As I have said, Congress did
this by stating that the anti-alienation section coversdivorce-related court orders, and then exempting "qualified"
orders from the additional coverage just created. Theamendment thus regulates transfers between living spouses;

520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN
868 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Breyer, J., dissenting
it does not intend to affect testamentary transfers takingplace after death.

Third, the QDRO provision shows that Congress did notobject to court orders that transfer pension benefits from an
ERISA plan participant to a former spouse who is alive--atleast if those court orders meet certain procedural requirements. Why then, one might ask, would Congress object tocourt orders that transfer benefits to a former spouse after
her death? Had Dorothy Boggs remained with Isaac formany years and then divorced him, she could have obtained
a QDRO that would have declared her community propertyinterest in Isaac's pension benefits, and she could then have
left that interest to her children. That being so, it would beanomalous to find a congressional purpose in ERISA--despite the absence of express statutory language and any indi-cation that Congress even considered the question--that
would in effect deprive Dorothy of her interest because, in-stead of divorcing Isaac, she "stay[ed] with him till her last
breath." Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.Finally, the language of $ 1056(d), even if taken literally,
does not help Sandra significantly, for a probate court orderawarding property to an estate or to children cannot easily
be squeezed into the definition of "domestic relations order."An order placing property in the estate is not an order that
provides property rights to a "spouse, former spouse, child,or dependent," and an order distributing an estate's property
to a child is not readily described as an order relating to"marital property rights." See Department of Labor Advisory Opinion, supra (probate orders are not "domestic rela-tions orders").

Sandra Boggs and the Acting Solicitor General rely on athird statutory provision, $ 1055, which sets forth specific provisions concerning the payment of annuities to a plan par-ticipant's surviving spouse. Section 1055(a) says that an
ERISA plan must ensure that "the accrued benefit" that is

520US3 Unit: $U64 [09-11-99 18:44:42] PAGES PGT: OPIN

869Cite as: 520 U. S. 833 (1997)
Breyer, J., dissenting
"payable" to the plan "participant" takes "the form of a qual-ified joint and survivor annuity," $ 1055(a)(1). The term

"qualified joint and survivor annuity" means an "annuity" toa plan participant for his life, with a surviving spouse, such
as Sandra, that is "not less than 50 percent of (and is not
greater than 100 percent of) the amount of the annuity whichis payable during the joint lives of the participant and the

spouse." $ 1055(d).The parties have not argued that this provision affects the
shares of stock or the $150,000 lump sum. I need not decidewhether that is so. That is because, if these assets do count
as "accrued benefits" under $ 1055(d), the plan would then
have had to insist on a waiver from Sandra in order to pay
them out in the way that it did--i. e., in a form other than
an annuity. Thus, I assume either that the stock and cash
were not "accrued benefits" under $ 1055(d), or that Sandra
waived her rights under $ 1055. Either way, $ 1055 would
not affect the outcome as to the stock and the cash.

The $1,800 monthly annuity payments, however, are a different matter. They were paid from the BellSouth Management Pension Plan, a "defined benefit" pension plan, initially
to Isaac during his lifetime, and then to his second wife, Sandra, for her life. These annuities do fall within the scope of

$ 1055. This ERISA provision seeks to guarantee that the
person who was a participant's spouse at the time of the participant's death will receive an annuity as described (unless
the spouse has waived the right to receive the survivor annuity, $$ 1055(c) (waiver of survivor portion of annuity), 1055(g)
(election of cash distribution rather than annuity)). See
S. Rep. No. 98-575, at 12; 26 CFR $ 1.401(a)-11 (1996). I
agree with the majority that Louisiana cannot give Dorothy's
children a share of the pension annuity that Sandra is receiving without frustrating the purpose of this provision.

This inconsistency does not end the matter, however, for
Dorothy's children here sought different relief. Although
the children apparently requested a portion of Sandra's

Breyer, J., dissenting
monthly annuity payments in their state-court pleading, Rec-ord 134, they stipulated at oral argument that they are seeking only an accounting, Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34. And accord-ing to Sandra's complaint for declaratory judgment, the
children have asked for an "accounting"; the Fifth Circuit,
too, spoke only of an "accounting," and did not mention reliefin the form of a percentage of Sandra's annuity. See 82 F.

3d, at 94, 97, 98.The difference is important, for, as the children pointed
out at oral argument, an accounting would simply declarethat, when Dorothy died, she had a community property interest in Isaac's pension benefits. And it is possible that
Louisiana law would permit Dorothy (or her heirs) to collect
not the pension benefits themselves, but other nonpension
community assets of equivalent value. See La. Civ. Code
Ann., Art. 3261 (West 1961) (succession representative has
broad power, subject to probate court approval, to liquidate
an estate through sale or exchange of estate assets "to pay
debts and legacies, or for any other purpose"). Cf. La. Rev.
Stat. Ann. $ 9:2801 (West 1991 and Supp. 1997) ( judicial partition of assets on divorce); Hare v. Hodgins, 586 So. 2d, at 123
(to equalize allocation of community assets on termination,
court may grant "cash or other property in lieu of an actual
percentage of the pension payments"); T. L. James, 332 So.
2d, at 851, n. 2 (opinion on rehearing) (same); Sims v. Sims,
358 So. 2d, at 924 (setting forth formula for calculating a
former spouse's share of pension benefits); McClanahan

$ 12:15, pp. 547-550 (state courts may allocate entire pension
to employee spouse and allocate to other spouse other community property equal in value to half of pension).

In this case, Isaac apparently retained possession of other,
nonpension assets from the Dorothy-Isaac community after
Dorothy's death because her will gave him a lifetime usufruct in the portion of her estate that she did not bequeath
to him outright. (And if Dorothy had not bequeathed that
portion of her estate to anyone, it appears that Louisiana law

Breyer, J., dissenting
would automatically have given him a usufruct until his
death or remarriage. See La. Civ. Code Ann., Art. 890
(West Supp. 1997).) In such a circumstance, Louisiana law
might provide an accounting to allow Dorothy's estate, or
her heirs, to recover Dorothy's community property share of
those nonpension assets from Isaac's estate, or from his
heirs, after his death. In applying such a law, a Louisiana
court might allocate property so that federally granted property rights, such as Sandra's right to a survivor annuity, are
fully protected. Cf. Bendler v. Marshall, 513 So. 2d 369 (La.
App. 1987) (first wife is entitled to reimbursement of her
community property share of husband's pension contributions, but not from second, surviving wife; first wife is not
entitled to share of second wife's survivor annuity); Succession of McVay, 476 So. 2d, at 1073-1074 (decedent's IRA,
which contained community property assets, could not be
listed as an asset of his estate because he had designated a
beneficiary; however, his estate would be deemed to contain
the equivalent cash value). See generally La. Civ. Code
Ann., Art. 4 (West 1993) ("When no rule for a particular situation can be derived from legislation or custom, the court is
bound to proceed according to equity").

Of course, the lower courts did not describe the precise
nature of Dorothy's state-law interest, nor did they explain
exactly how the accounting worked. They did no more than
deny Sandra's request for a declaratory judgment that
ERISA prohibits an accounting. But that may reflect the
fact that no one raised a $ 1055 argument until after the
Court of Appeals panel's decision in this case. We therefore
should not grant Sandra her declaratory judgment unless we
are certain Louisiana law could not lawfully permit Dorothy
to leave her community property interest in the pension
assets to her children. And, given the authority just cited,
state law might lawfully do so, very roughly in the way the
following imaginary example illustrates:

872 BOGGS v. BOGGS

Breyer, J., dissenting
Assume at the time of Dorothy's death Dorothy and Isaacowned the following community property:

Pension assets $ 60,000Stock investments 140,000
Total $200,000
Louisiana law might then provide that Dorothy and Isaaceach owned $100,000 worth of community assets. Louisiana
law might also provide (or permit a probate court to decide)that the share belonging to Dorothy's estate consisted of
$100,000 worth of stock, leaving Isaac with $40,000 in stockand $60,000 in pension assets. If that is so, why should
ERISA care? And if Louisiana law should simply postponethe division of the Dorothy-Isaac community's property until
after Isaac's death because of his lifetime usufruct, whyshould ERISA care any more? Moreover, if Isaac bequeathed the entire $140,000 worth of stock to a charity, Iassume that the probate court would block most of the bequest on the ground that $100,000 worth of stock was notIsaac's to give away. I assume it would do the same if he
tried to give Sandra the entire $140,000. And I do not seewhy ERISA would care about the stock (which, after all,
belonged to Dorothy) in either case.I cannot understand why Congress would want to preempt Louisiana law if (or insofar as) that law provides for anaccounting and collection from other property--i. e., property other than the annuity that $ 1055 requires the Bell-South plans to pay to Sandra. The survivor annuity provision assures Sandra that she will receive an annuity for therest of her life. Louisiana law (on my assumption) would
not take from her either that annuity or any other asset thatbelongs to her. The most one could say is that Sandra will
not receive certain other assets--assets that belonged to theDorothy-Isaac community and that Isaac had no right to give
to anyone in the first place.

Breyer, J., dissenting
Nothing in ERISA suggests that it cares about what hap-pens to those other assets. The survivor annuity provision

says nothing about them. Indeed, Isaac, or the Dorothy-Isaac community, might, or might not, have had other assets.
Isaac might, or might not, have tried to leave all, or some, of
those other assets to Sandra, or to his children, or to charity.ERISA seems to be indifferent to the presence, or absence,

of other assets and to what Isaac did or did not try to dowith them. After all, if Dorothy had divorced Isaac, ERISA
would have permitted state law to give her not only otherassets, but also half of the pension itself (which would have
left a later-appearing Sandra with a diminished annuity).
See $ 1056(d)(3)(A). Given Congress' purpose of allowing
state courts to give first wives their community property
share of pension assets, why would Congress have intended
to include a silent implication that strips Dorothy of an asset
that may be the bulk of her community property--simply
because, instead of divorcing Isaac, she remained his wife
until she died?

On the assumptions I have made, to find a conflict in this
case, one would have to depart from what Congress actually
said in ERISA and infer some more abstract general purpose, say to help a second wife at the expense of a first wife's
state-law-created interest in other property. But should we
take anything like this latter approach, there would be no
logical stopping place. Confusion and unnecessary interference with state property laws would become inevitable.
Moreover, we should be particularly careful in making assumptions about the interaction of $ 1055 and Louisiana law,
as the courts below did not consider $ 1055 as a possible
ground for conflict pre-emption.

In sum, an annuity goes to Sandra, a surviving spouse; but
otherwise Dorothy would remain free not only to have, but
to bequeath, her share of the marital estate to her children.
This reading of the relevant statutory provisions and purposes protects Sandra, limits ERISA's interference with

basic state property and family law, and minimizes the ex-tent to which ERISA would interfere with Dorothy's preexisting property. Cf. Hodel v. Irving, 481 U. S. 704, 717(1987) (federal statute stripping property owner of right to
pass interest by descent or devise constitutes taking underFifth Amendment);

Babbitt v. Youpee, 519 U. S. 234, 244-245(1997) (statutory restriction on class of permissible heirs constitutes taking).These general reasons, as well as the specific reasons provided above, convince me that ERISA does not pre-empt theLouisiana law in question. And I would therefore affirm the
judgment below.

SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.

et al.

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-1764. Argued February 18, 1997--Decided June 2, 1997
In East River S. S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U. S. 858,

this Court held that an admiralty tort plaintiff cannot recover for the
physical damage a defective product causes to the "product itself," but
can recover for physical damage the product causes to "other property."
The parties here agree that the "product itself" consists at least of a
ship as built and outfitted by its original manufacturer and sold to an
initial user. Respondent J. M. Martinac & Co. built the fishing vessel
M/V Saratoga, installing a hydraulic system designed by respondent
Marco Seattle Inc. Joseph Madruga, the Initial User, bought the ship
new, added extra equipment, used the ship, and resold it to petitioner
Saratoga Fishing Co., the Subsequent User, who used it until it caught
fire and sank. In this admiralty tort suit against respondents, the District Court found that the hydraulic system had been defectively designed and awarded Saratoga Fishing damages, including damages for
the loss of the equipment added by Madruga. The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the added equipment was part of the ship when it
was resold to Saratoga Fishing, and, for that reason, the equipment was
part of the defective product that itself caused the harm.

Held: Equipment added by the Initial User before he sold the ship to the

Subsequent User is "other property," not part of the product that itself
caused physical harm. This Court held in East River that an injury to
the defective product itself, even though physical, was a kind of "economic loss," for which tort law did not provide compensation. 476 U. S.,
at 871. Reasoning that "[c]ontract law, and the law of warranty in particular, is well suited" to setting the responsibilities of a seller of a product that fails to perform its intended function, id., at 872-873, the Court
found that, given the availability of warranties, the courts should not
ask tort law to perform a job that contract law might perform better,
ibid. The Ninth Circuit's holding that recovery should be denied for
added equipment because the Subsequent User could have asked the
Initial User for a warranty creates a tort damage immunity beyond that
set by any relevant tort precedent. Had the ship remained in the Initial User's hands, the added equipment's loss could have been recovered
in tort, and there is no suggestion in state or federal law that these

Opinion of the Court
results would change with a subsequent sale. Indeed, other things
being equal, a rule that diminishes liability because of resale would diminish a basic incentive of defective-product tort law: to encourage the
manufacture of safer products. East River provides an unsatisfactory
answer to the question why a series of resales should progressively immunize a manufacturer from liability for foreseeable physical damage
that would otherwise fall upon it, since the Subsequent User does not
contract directly with the manufacturer, and it is likely more difficult for
a consumer to offer the appropriate warranty on used products. While
nothing prevents a user/reseller from offering a warranty, respondents
have not explained why the ordinary rules of a manufacturer's tort liability should be supplanted merely because the user/reseller may in theory incur an overlapping contract liability. The holding here does not
affect East River's rule that it is not a component part, but the vessel--
as placed in the stream of commerce by the manufacturer and its distributors--that is the "product" that itself causes the harm. Nor does the
holding impose too great a potential tort liability upon a manufacturer
or a distributor. It merely maintains liability, for equipment added
after the initial sale, despite the presence of a resale by the Initial
User. Pp. 878-885.

Opinion of the Court
S. S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc., 476 U. S. 858(1986), the Court held that an admiralty tort plaintiff cannot

recover for the physical damage the defective product causesto the "product itself "; but the plaintiff can recover for physical damage the product causes to "other property." In thiscase all agree that the "product itself " consists

at least of aship as built and outfitted by its original manufacturer and

sold to an initial user. This case asks how this corner of tortlaw treats the physical destruction of extra equipment (a
skiff, a fishing net, spare parts) added by the initial userafter the first sale and then resold as part of the ship when
the ship itself is later resold to a subsequent user. Is thatadded equipment part of the "product itself," in which case
the plaintiff cannot recover in tort for its physical loss? Oris it "other property," in which case the plaintiff can recover?
We conclude that it is "other property." Hence (assumingother tort law requirements are satisfied) admiralty's tort
rules permit recovery. I

This case arises out of an engine room fire and flood thatled to the sinking of the fishing vessel M/V Saratoga in January 1986. We must assume that a hydraulic system defec-tively designed by respondent Marco Seattle Inc. was one
significant cause of the accident. About 15 years before theaccident, respondent J. M. Martinac & Co. had built the ship,
installed the hydraulic system, and sold the ship new to Jo-seph Madruga. Madruga then added extra equipment--a
skiff, a seine net, and various spare parts--and used the shipfor tuna fishing. In 1974, Madruga resold the ship to petitioner, Saratoga Fishing Co., which continued to use the shipfor fishing. In 1987, after the ship caught fire and sank,
Saratoga Fishing brought this tort suit in admiralty againstMarco Seattle and J. M. Martinac.

The District Court found that the hydraulic system hadbeen defectively designed, and it awarded Saratoga Fishing
damages (adjusted to reflect Saratoga Fishing's own partial

Opinion of the Court
fault). Those damages included damages for the loss of theequipment that Madruga had added after the initial purchase

of the ship.The Ninth Circuit held that the District Court should not
have awarded damages for the added equipment. Saratoga
Fishing Co. v. Marco Seattle Inc., 69 F. 3d 1432, 1445 (1995).A majority noted that the equipment, though added by Madruga, was part of the ship when Madruga resold the ship toSaratoga Fishing, and, for that reason, the majority held, the
added equipment was part of the defective product that itselfcaused the harm. Applying East River's distinction between the product that itself caused the harm and "otherproperty," the majority concluded that Saratoga Fishing
could not recover in tort for the loss. A dissenting judgebelieved that the "product itself " was the ship when
launched into the stream of commerce by Martinac, its origi-nal builder. Consequently, the added equipment was "other
property." We granted certiorari to resolve this uncer-tainty about the proper application of

East River. We nowagree with the dissenting judge.

II
The facts before us show: (1) a Component Supplier who(2) provided a defective component (the hydraulic system)

to a Manufacturer, who incorporated it into a manufacturedproduct (the ship), which (3) the Manufacturer sold to an
Initial User, who (4) after adding equipment and using theship, resold it to a Subsequent User (Saratoga Fishing).
The applicable law is general maritime law, "an amalgam oftraditional common-law rules, modifications of those rules,
and newly created rules," drawn from both state and federalsources. East River, supra, at 865; see also Fitzgerald v.
United States Lines Co., 374 U. S. 16, 20 (1963); Kermarecv. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U. S. 625, 630
(1959). The context is purely commercial. The particularquestion before us requires us to interpret the Court's deci520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

879Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
sion in East River: Does the term "other property," as usedin that case, include the equipment added by the Initial User

before he sold the ship to the Subsequent User? We con-clude that it does: When a manufacturer places an item in
the stream of commerce by selling it to an Initial User, that
item is the "product itself " under East River. Items addedto the product by the Initial User are therefore "other property," and the Initial User's sale of the product to a Subse-quent User does not change these characterizations.

East River arose at the intersection of two principles thatgovern recovery in many commercial cases involving defective products. The first principle is that tort law in this area
ordinarily (but with exceptions) permits recovery from a
manufacturer and others in the initial chain of distribution
for foreseeable physical harm to property caused by product
defects. See Restatement (Second) of Torts $ 402A (1965);
W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and
Keeton on Law of Torts $ 101 (5th ed. 1984); East River, 476
U. S., at 867. The second principle is that tort law in this
area ordinarily (but with exceptions) does not permit recovery for purely economic losses, say, lost profits. See Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability $ 6, Comment
d (Proposed Final Draft, Preliminary Version, Oct. 18, 1996);
e. g., Rardin v. T & D Machine Handling, Inc., 890 F. 2d
24, 27-30 (CA7 1989). The Court in East River favored the
second principle, for it held that an injury to the defective
product itself, even though physical, was a kind of "economic
loss," for which tort law did not provide compensation. 476
U. S., at 871.

The Court reasoned that the loss of the value of a product
that suffers physical harm--say, a product that destroys itself by exploding--is very much like the loss of the value of
a product that does not work properly or does not work at
all. See id., at 870. In all such cases, the Court held,
"[c]ontract law, and the law of warranty in particular, is well
suited" to setting the responsibilities of a seller of a product

Opinion of the Court
that fails to perform the function for which it was intended.
Id., at 872-873. The commercial buyer and commercial
seller can negotiate a contract--a warranty--that will setthe terms of compensation for product failure. If the buyer

obtains a warranty, he will receive compensation for the
product's loss, whether the product explodes or just refusesto start. If the buyer does not obtain a warranty, he will

likely receive a lower price in return. Given the availabilityof warranties, the courts should not ask tort law to perform
a job that contract law might perform better. Ibid.; Seelyv.

White Motor Co., 63 Cal. 2d 9, 18-19, 403 P. 2d 145, 151
(1965) (en banc).

The Ninth Circuit reasoned that East River required it to
define the defective "product itself " by looking to that which
the plaintiff had purchased, for that is the product that, in
principle, the plaintiff could have asked the seller to warrant.
Since Saratoga Fishing, the Subsequent User, might have
asked Madruga, the Initial User, to warrant the M/V Saratoga, skiff, nets, and all, that product, skiff, nets, and all,
is the "product itself " that stands outside the reach of tort
recovery. In our view, however, this holding pushes East
River's principle beyond the boundary set by the principle's
rationale.

For one thing, the Ninth Circuit's holding creates a tort
damage immunity beyond that set by any relevant tort precedent that we have found. State law often distinguishes between items added to or used in conjunction with a defective
item purchased from a Manufacturer (or its distributors) and
(following East River) permits recovery for the former when
physically harmed by a dangerously defective product.
Thus the owner of a chicken farm, for example, recovered for
chickens killed when the chicken house ventilation system
failed, suffocating the 140,000 chickens inside. A. J. Decoster Co. v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 333 Md. 245, 634 A.
2d 1330 (1994). A warehouse owner recovered for damage
to a building caused by a defective roof. United Air Lines,

Opinion of the Court
Inc. v. CEI Industries of Ill., Inc., 148 Ill. App. 3d 332, 499
N. E. 2d 558 (1986). And a prior case in admiralty (not unlike the one before us) held that a ship charterer, who adds
expensive seismic equipment to the ship, may recover for its
loss in a fire caused by a defective engine. Nicor Supply
Ships Assocs. v. General Motors Corp., 876 F. 2d 501 (CA5
1989). Indeed, respondents here conceded that, had the ship
remained in the hands of the Initial User, the loss of the
added equipment could have been recovered in tort. See
Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30. We have found no suggestion in
state (or in federal) law that these results would change with
a subsequent sale--that is, we have found no case, other than
the Ninth Circuit case before us, that suggests that the
courts would deny recovery to a subsequent chicken farmer,
who had later purchased the farm, chickens, coop, ventilation
system, and all.

Indeed, the denial of recovery for added equipment simply
because of a subsequent sale makes the scope of a manufacturer's liability turn on what seems, in one important respect, a fortuity, namely, whether a defective product causes
foreseeable physical harm to the added equipment before or
after an Initial User (who added the equipment) resells the
product to a Subsequent User. One important purpose of
defective-product tort law is to encourage the manufacture
of safer products. The various tort rules that determine
which foreseeable losses are recoverable aim, in part, to provide appropriate safe-product incentives. And a liability
rule that diminishes liability simply because of some such
resale is a rule that, other things being equal, diminishes
that basic incentive. That circumstance requires a justification. That is to say, why should a series of resales, after
replacement and additions of ever more physical items, progressively immunize a manufacturer to an ever greater extent from the liability for foreseeable physical damage that
would otherwise fall upon it?

882 SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.

Opinion of the Court
The East River answer to this question--because the par-ties can contract for appropriate sharing of the risks of

harm--is not as satisfactory in the context of resale after aninitial use. That is because, as other courts have suggested,
the Subsequent User does not contract directly with the
manufacturer (or distributor). Cf. Peterson v. Idaho First
Nat. Bank, 117 Idaho 724, 727, 791 P. 2d 1303, 1306 (1990);
Tillman v. Vance Equipment Co., 286 Ore. 747, 755-756, 596P. 2d 1299, 1304 (1979). Moreover, it is likely more difficult

for a consumer--a commercial user and reseller--to offer anappropriate warranty on the used product he sells akin to a
manufacturer's (or distributor's) warranty of the initial product. The user/reseller did not make (or initially distribute)
the product and, to that extent, he normally would know
less about the risks that such a warranty would involve. Cf.
Tillman, supra, at 755, 596 P. 2d, at 1303-1304; Peterson,
supra, at 726-727, 791 P. 2d, at 1305-1306. That is to say, it
would seem more difficult for a reseller to warrant, say, a
ship's engine; as time passes, the ship ages, the ship undergoes modification, and it passes through the hands of users
and resellers.

Of course, nothing prevents a user/reseller from offering a
warranty. But neither does anything prevent a Manufacturer and an Initial User from apportioning through their
contract potential loss of any other items--say, added equipment or totally separate physical property--that a defective
manufactured product, say, an exploding engine, might cause.
No court has thought that the mere possibility of such a contract term precluded tort recovery for damage to an Initial
User's other property. Similarly, in the absence of a showing that it is ordinary business practice for user/resellers to
offer a warranty comparable to those typically provided by
sellers of new products, the argument for extending East
River, replacing tort law with contract law, is correspondingly weak. That is to say, respondents have not explained
why the ordinary rules governing the manufacturer's tort

520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

883Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
liability should be supplanted merely because the user/reseller may in theory incur an overlapping liability in

contract.Respondents make two other important arguments.
First, they say that our reasoning proves too much. They
argue that, if a Subsequent User can recover for damage adefective manufactured product causes to property added by

the Initial User, then a user might recover for damage adefective component causes the manufactured product, other
than the component itself. Saratoga Fishing, for example,could recover the damage the defective hydraulic system
caused to any other part of the ship. But the lower courts,following

East River, have held that it is not a component
part, but the vessel--as placed in the stream of commerce
by the manufacturer and its distributors--that is the "prod-uct" that itself caused the harm. See

Shipco 2295, Inc. v.
Avondale Shipyards, Inc., 825 F. 2d 925, 928 (CA5 1987); seealso,

e. g., National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v.
Pratt & Whitney Canada, Inc., 107 Nev. 535, 539-542, 815P. 2d 601, 604-605 (1991). As the Court said in

East River:

" `Since all but the very simplest of machines have com-ponent parts, [a contrary] holding would require a finding of "property damage" in virtually every case wherea product damages itself. Such a holding would eliminate the distinction between warranty and strict prod-ucts liability.' " 476 U. S., at 867 (quoting

Northern
Power & Engineering Corp. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co.,
623 P. 2d 324, 330 (Alaska 1981)).

Our holding here, however, does not affect this rule, for
the relevant relations among initial users, manufacturers,
and component suppliers are typically different from those
at issue here. Initial users, when they buy, typically depend upon, and likely seek warranties that depend upon, a
manufacturer's primary business skill, namely, the assembly
of workable product components into a marketable whole.

884 SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.

Opinion of the Court
King v. Hilton-Davis, 855 F. 2d 1047, 1052 (CA3 1988);
Shipco 2295, supra, at 929; National Union Fire Ins., supra,
at 541, 815 P. 2d, at 605. Moreover, manufacturers and com-ponent suppliers can allocate through contract potential liability for a manufactured product that does not work,
thereby ensuring that component suppliers have appropriateincentives to prevent component defects that might destroy

the product. King, supra, at 1054; cf. Shipco 2295, supra, at930. There is no reason to think that initial users systematically control the manufactured product's quality or, as wehave said, systematically allocate responsibility for useradded equipment, in similar ways. Regardless, the case law
does suggest a distinction between the components added to
a product by a manufacturer before the product's sale to a
user, e. g., Airlift Int'l, Inc. v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 685
F. 2d 267 (CA9 1982); King, supra; Shipco 2295, supra; and
those items added by a user to the manufactured product,
e. g., Nicor Supply Ships Assocs. v. General Motors Corp.,
876 F. 2d 501 (CA5 1989); and we would maintain that
distinction.

Second, respondents argue that our holding would impose
too great a potential tort liability upon a manufacturer or a
distributor. But we do not see how that is so. For one
thing, a host of other tort principles, such as foreseeability,
proximate cause, and the "economic loss" doctrine, already
do, and would continue to, limit liability in important ways.
For another thing, where such principles are satisfied, liability would exist anyway had the manufactured product simply
remained in the hands of the Initial User. Our holding
merely maintains liability, for equipment added after the initial sale, despite the presence of a resale by the Initial User.

We conclude that equipment added to a product after the
Manufacturer (or distributor selling in the initial distribution
chain) has sold the product to an Initial User is not part
of the product that itself caused physical harm. Rather,

speaking, of course, of added equipment that itself played nocausal role in the accident that caused the physical harm.)

Thus the extra skiff, nets, spare parts, and miscellaneousequipment at issue here, added to the ship by a user after
an initial sale to that Initial User, are not part of the product
(the original ship with the defective hydraulic system) thatitself caused the harm.

The decision of the Ninth Circuit is

Reversed.

Justice O'Connor, dissenting.
I do not disagree with our decision to grant certiorari
in this case, but I agree with Justice Scalia--and for the
reasons he states--that we should affirm the judgment of
the Court of Appeals.

Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Thomas joins,
dissenting.

In East River S. S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval Inc.,
476 U. S. 858 (1986), we adopted as part of admiralty law the
so-called "economic loss" rule, which denies the purchaser of
a defective product a tort action against the seller or manufacturer for purely economic losses sustained as a result of
the product's failure. Applying this rule, we held that a
plaintiff may not recover in tort when a defective product
damages only itself, but may recover for personal injuries
and for damage to other property. See id., at 871-875. The
present case involves a relative detail of application of the
East River holding: whether, and under what circumstances,
"other property" can include property added to the defective
product, not by the plaintiff-purchaser himself, but by some
earlier purchaser in the chain of ownership leading back to
the manufacturer. In the context of the present case, the
question is whether a skiff, a net, and communications and
navigational electronics added by Joseph Madruga to the
M/V Saratoga before she was sold to petitioner constitute

part of the product itself (for which recovery is not available)or "other property" (for which recovery is available).

It would have been better, in my view, not to grant certio-rari in this case. By the time

East River was decided, we
had a wealth of lower court development to draw upon, including well-reasoned opinions taking no less than three dis-tinct positions on the economic-loss rule. See

id., at 868-
871. We could be confident in our decision, knowing that itbroke little new ground; the rule we adopted had been endorsed by a majority of state courts and had been tested fortwo decades since its enunciation by Chief Justice Traynor
in Seely v. White Motor Co., 63 Cal. 2d 9, 403 P. 2d 145 (1965).
In the present case, by contrast, the Court sets sail into uncharted seas. Not a single lower court decision (other than
the one under review) has addressed the precise question
presented: the status as "other property" of additions made
by a prior purchaser who was a user. I would feel less uncomfortable about our plying these unknown waters if we
were skilled navigators. But unlike state courts, we have
little first-hand experience in the development of new
common-law rules of tort and contract governing commercial transactions. Better to have followed some state-court
pilots than to proceed on our own--and even, perhaps, to
lead state courts aground. With this disclaimer, and with
the admission that I am only modestly more confident of my
resolution of this case than I am of the Court's, I proceed
(reluctantly) to discussion of the merits.

The Court's opinion suggests that this is a rather straightforward case. The relevant facts--according to the Court--
are quite simple, showing: "(1) a Component Supplier who
(2) provided a defective component . . . to a Manufacturer,
who incorporated it into a manufactured product (the ship),
which (3) the Manufacturer sold to an Initial User, who (4)
after adding equipment and using the ship, resold it to a
Subsequent User." Ante, at 878. What the Court's opinion
does not disclose is that Madruga--the Court's "Initial

Scalia, J., dissenting
User"--was perhaps not only a user of the boat but also anentrepreneur in the business of designing, assembling, and

distributing what might be described as "fully equippedtuna-fishing machines." The M/V Saratoga was not an isolated purchase by tuna-fisherman Madruga from Martinac,
but was the third of seven steel-hull tuna seiners Madrugacommissioned. She was designed, in part by Madruga, specifically for use as a tuna seiner, and her construction at Mar-tinac's shipyard was supervised personally by Madruga and
by an engineer in Madruga's employ. Madruga negotiatedover the specifications and equipment for the vessel and ordered numerous changes to it during the course of construction. When delivered by Martinac, the M/V Saratoga was
certainly functional as a boat, but it was not yet capable of
performing the task for which it was specially designed. It
was arguably still just a component of a larger tuna-fishing
machine that would not be complete until Madruga installed
the seine, skiff, and electronic equipment; and arguably a
component of a tuna-fishing machine that Madruga was in
the business of marketing.

As respondents point out, there is no finding in the record
as to whether Madruga was engaged in the business of selling such products and the issue was never raised or considered. Brief for Respondents 33, n. 28. I assume that the
Court disregards this issue (neither resolving it nor remanding for its consideration) because the Court deems the question irrelevant. Under the Court's test, as I understand it,
the "product" is fixed when it is sold to an "Initial User,"
even if that user is also in the business of modifying and
reselling the product. In my view, there is little to recommend such a rule.

The Court is driven to take the position it does by the
concern that liability would otherwise turn on "a fortuity,
namely, whether a defective product causes . . . harm to the
added equipment before or after an Initial User (who added
the equipment) resells the product to a Subsequent User."

888 SARATOGA FISHING CO. v. J. M. MARTINAC & CO.

Scalia, J., dissenting
Ante, at 881. But the initial-user rule the Court embraces
simply makes liability turn on a different fortuity, namely,
whether the person who adds additional equipment to the
product uses that product before selling it. If Madruga was
engaged in the business of assembling and distributing tuna
seiners, why should the fact that he briefly used the vessel
before selling it enable petitioner to obtain tort damages that
would plainly not be recoverable if Madruga had simply installed the components and sold the vessel? Or put in more
commonplace terms: Why should the buyer of a car whose
engine catches fire and destroys the entire vehicle be able to
recover in a tort action against the manufacturer for the
value of the dealer-added hi-fi stereo system if the car was
a "demo," but not if the car was brand new?

One rule that generally avoids making liability turn on
either of the above described "fortuities" is what might be
called the "last-402A-seller rule." Under this rule, the
"product" would be fixed when it is sold by the last person
in the chain of distribution who is, in the words of $ 402A of
the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1964), "engaged in the
business of selling such a product." This would offer at
least as much predictability as can be expected from the
Court's approach, would ensure that the availability of tort
remedies will be uniform with regard to all end-users, and
would avoid making liability turn on the seemingly irrelevant question whether the distributor of the product used it
before sale. The last-402A-seller rule is also more consistent with one of the principal considerations underlying our
decision in East River: the desirability of invoking tort protection only where contract-warranty protection is infeasible.
Defining the product as what was sold by the last person
engaged in the business of selling such products denies tort
recovery for those additions to the originally manufactured
product which the purchaser could have covered by warranty protection (persons in the business will generally offer

889Cite as: 520 U. S. 875 (1997)
Scalia, J., dissenting
warranties covering the entire product; user-sellers will generally not).

The last-402A-seller rule appears to me superior to the
initial-user rule adopted by the Court today, but the two are
in reality quite similar and will in most cases produce the
same result. Each essentially attempts to differentiate between additions made before and after the product has left
the market chain of distribution. I doubt, however, whether
leaving the market chain of distribution ought to be so momentous an event for the purpose at hand. So long as the
plaintiff is a commercial entity (and I understand the rule
under consideration to be one applicable only to commercial,
as opposed to consumer, transactions, see ante, at 878-879)
it seems to me to make no difference whether the purchase
was made from a "402A seller" or not. Commercial entities
do not typically suffer, at the time they make their purchase,
a disparity in bargaining power that makes it impossible for
them to obtain warranty protection on the entire product;
nor are they unable to insure the product they have purchased, including those portions of it added by upstream
owners. Our decision in East River suggests that in such
circumstances there is inadequate reason to interfere with
private ordering by importing tort liability--that is, inadequate reason to permit the purchaser to recover any tort
damages for loss of the product he purchased. See East
River, 476 U. S., at 872-873.

In recognition of that reality, an impressive line of lower
court decisions, applying both federal and state law, has held
that the purchaser of a product damaged by a defective component cannot recover in tort against the manufacturer of
the component on the theory that the remainder of the product is "other property." See, e. g., Pulte Home Corp. v. Osmose Wood Preserving, Inc., 60 F. 3d 734, 741-742 (CA11
1995) (Florida law); American Eagle Ins. Co. v. United Technologies Corp., 48 F. 3d 142, 144-145 (CA5 1995) (Texas law);

Transport Corp. of America, Inc. v. International BusinessMachines Corp., 30 F. 3d 953, 957 (CA8 1994) (Minnesota

U. S. 1007 (1988). Although the holdings of these cases arenot precisely on point (since the plaintiff was the initial
purchaser-user of the defective product), the rationale ofthose decisions is in tension with the Court's holding today,
and supports what might be called an "object-of-the-bargain"rule. They rest on the premise that one must look to the
product purchased or bargained for by the plaintiff in deter-mining whether additions constitute "other property." See,
e. g., King, supra, at 1051 ("In determining whether a prod-uct `injures only itself ' for purposes of applying the East
River rule . . . [one must] look to the product purchased bythe plaintiff "); Shipco 2295, supra, at 928; American Eagle,
supra, at 145; Casa Clara Condominium Assn. v. Charley
Toppino and Sons, Inc., 620 So. 2d 1244, 1247 (Fla. 1993)("The character of a loss determines the appropriate remedies, and, to determine the character of a loss, one must lookto the product purchased by the plaintiff, not the product
sold by the defendant"); see also Fox & Loftus, Riding theChoppy Waters of East River: Economic Loss Doctrine Ten
Years Later, 64 Def. Couns. J. 260, 264, n. 29 (1997) (citingnumerous other cases and observing that "[t]he trend in defining `economic loss' is to focus on what the plaintiff pur-chased rather than what the defendant agreed to provide").
These courts have adopted this purchaser-oriented approachon the belief, which I think correct, that it is in accord with
the policy judgments underlying our decision in East River.As the Third Circuit in

King explained:

"As we read East River, it is the character of theplaintiff 's loss that determines the nature of the available remedies. When loss of the benefit of a bargain is

520US3 Unit: $U65 [09-15-99 13:02:19] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Scalia, J., dissenting
the plaintiff 's sole loss, the judgment of the SupremeCourt was that the undesirable consequences of affording a tort remedy in addition to a contract-based recov-ery were sufficient to outweigh the limited interest of
the plaintiff in having relief beyond that provided by
warranty claims. The relevant bargain in this contextis that struck by the plaintiff. It is that bargain that

determines his or her economic loss and whether he orshe has been injured beyond that loss." 855 F. 2d, at
1051.
There are undoubtedly other rules that can be--and have
been--conceived of. One recent article describes the cur-rent state of the law regarding damage to "other property"

on construction projects as follows:

"There has been a growing trend in many jurisdictions to interpret `economic loss' broadly to includedamage that formerly was considered `other property.'

Courts that follow this trend have utilized the follow-ing rationales:

"x There is no damage to `other property' where thedamage extends only to property within the confines of
the bargain. . . . `Other property' does not include dam-age to property if those losses are direct and consequential losses that were within the contemplation of the parties and could have been the subject of negotiationsbetween the parties.

"x The phrase `other property' does not include thetype of property that one would reasonably expect, on
a foreseeability test, to be damaged as a direct consequence of the failure of the product at issue.

"x No `other property' has been damaged, because the
allegedly defective product has been incorporated into
the structure that has been damaged.

"x Losses caused by the inferior quality of the product
must be considered `economic' and therefore cannot be

considered `property.' " Fox & Loftus, supra, at 265-266 (footnotes omitted).

And there can of course be combinations of the various rules.For example, one might adopt an "integrated unit" exception
to the initial-user rule that the Court announces today.As I have confessed above, I have little confidence in my
ability to make the correct policy choice in an area wherecourts more experienced than we have not yet come to rest.
I would have been inclined to let the lower federal courtsstruggle with this issue somewhat longer, in the hope that
there would develop a common-law consensus to which wecould refer for our admiralty rule, as we did in

East River.Put to a choice, however, I would not select the rule adopted

by the Court today. I would adopt the rule proposed byrespondents and define the "product" for purposes of East
River's economic-loss rule as the object of the purchaser'sbargain. That was essentially the approach followed by the
Court of Appeals below, and I would accordingly affirm itsjudgment.

I respectfully, and indeed diffidently, dissent.

LORDS LANDING VILLAGE CONDOMINIUM COUN-CIL OF UNIT OWNERS

v. CONTINENTALINSURANCE CO.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the fourth circuit

No. 96-1033. Decided June 2, 1997
Petitioner, a condominium owners' association, filed suit in Maryland state

court to compel respondent insurer to pay a $1.1 million judgment it
had obtained against respondent's insured, the condominium developer,
for numerous defects in the complex. Under the insurance policy, only
property damage caused by an "accident" was covered. Respondent
removed the action to the Federal District Court based on diversity of
citizenship. That court granted respondent summary judgment, and
the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that, as a matter of Maryland law,
a negligent act does not constitute an "accident." When petitioner subsequently learned that Maryland's highest court had recently decided,
in Sheets v. Brethren Mutual Ins. Co., 342 Md. 634, 679 A. 2d 540, that
a negligent act constitutes an "accident" under a liability insurance policy when the resulting damage took place without the insured's foresight
or expectations, it asked the Fourth Circuit to recall or stay its mandate.
The court denied the request, finding it "without merit."

Held: In these circumstances, it is proper for this Court to grant the certiorari petition, vacate the lower court's judgment, and remand the case
(GVR) for further consideration. This order is in keeping with the
Court's longstanding practice of vacating a court of appeals' decision
based on a state-law construction that appears to contradict a recent
decision of the highest state court. Sheets' explicit disapproval of the
cases on which the Court of Appeals relied calls into question the correctness of that court's decision, and the ambiguous statement that petitioner's request to recall the mandate was "without merit" does not
establish that the court actually considered and rejected the Sheets argument. The most likely ground on which the Fourth Circuit rested its
denial of petitioner's motion is, as respondent contended, that it lacked
authority to recall its mandate. Moreover, this Court has previously
issued a GVR order where petitioners notified the Federal Court of
Appeals of an intervening State Supreme Court's opinion in a second
rehearing petition, which the Court of Appeals denied. See Huddleston v. Dwyer, 322 U. S. 232, 235 (per curiam).

Per Curiam.
In this diversity case, the holding of the federal appellatecourt below has been called into question by a recent decision of the highest state court in Maryland. We must decidewhether it is appropriate, in these circumstances, for this
Court to grant the petition for certiorari, vacate the judg-ment of the lower court, and remand the case (GVR) for
further consideration.Petitioner, an association of condominium owners, sued
respondent in Maryland state court, seeking to compel re-spondent to pay a $1.1 million judgment it had obtained
against respondent's insured, the developer of its condomin-ium complex. In a previous action, a jury had held the
developer liable for numerous defects in the complex, find-ing that the developer had made misrepresentations and
breached various warranty obligations. Respondent hadissued a general liability insurance policy covering the developer. The policy provided that respondent would pay" `those sums that [the developer] becomes legally obligated
to pay as damages because of . . . "property damage" towhich this insurance applies.' " App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.
Under the policy, "property damage" was covered only if itwas caused by an "accident."

Respondent removed the action to the United States Dis-trict Court for the District of Maryland, based on the parties'
diversity of citizenship. The District Court granted sum-mary judgment in favor of respondent. On August 6, 1996,
the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. TheCourt of Appeals held that, as a matter of Maryland law, an

of warranties and misrepresentations relating to poor work-manship, the Court of Appeals concluded that the damages

were not caused by an "accident" within the meaning of re-spondent's insurance policy. The Court of Appeals denied a
petition for rehearing on September 3, 1996, and issued the
mandate on September 11, 1996.On September 17, 1996, petitioner's counsel learned of

Sheets v. Brethren Mutual Ins. Co., 342 Md. 634, 679 A. 2d540, a recent decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals--
the highest court in Maryland. (Although Sheets washanded down on July 26, 1996, 11 days before the Court of
Appeals' decision, the parties were not aware of the decision
until after the mandate was issued, and therefore had not
brought the case to the attention of the Court of Appeals.
Pet. for Cert. 11.) Sheets cast doubt on the soundness of the
Court of Appeals' decision because it held that "an act of
negligence constitutes an `accident' under a liability insurance policy when the resulting damage was `an event that
takes place without [the insured's] foresight or expectation.' "
342 Md., at 652, 679 A. 2d, at 548 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Maryland Court of Appeals also
expressly disapproved Ed. Winkler & Son, supra, at 1132,
and IA Construction Corp., supra, at 1215, two decisions on
which the Court of Appeals had primarily relied. 342 Md.,
at 654-655, and n. 4, 679 A. 2d, at 549-550, and 550, n. 4.

On September 20, 1996, petitioner filed a motion asking
the Court of Appeals to recall or stay its mandate based on
this development in Maryland law. In its response, respondent argued in part that the Court of Appeals lacked authority to recall an already issued mandate. In a brief order,
the Court of Appeals denied petitioner's request, ruling only
that "the said petition and motions are without merit."

certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand the case
to the Court of Appeals for further consideration in light of
Sheets. Pet. for Cert. 13-14.

This case fits within the category of cases in which wehave held it is proper to issue a GVR order. "Where intervening developments, or recent developments that we havereason to believe the court below did not fully consider, reveal a reasonable probability that the decision below rests
upon a premise that the lower court would reject if giventhe opportunity for further consideration, and where it appears that such a redetermination may determine the ulti-mate outcome of the litigation, a GVR order is . . . potentially
appropriate." Lawrence v. Chater, 516 U. S. 163, 167 (1996)
(per curiam). The situation here is virtually identical to
that in Thomas v. American Home Products, Inc., 519 U. S.
913 (1996), a state-law case from earlier in this Term.
There, after the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
ruled against petitioners, the Georgia Supreme Court overruled the holding that was the basis for the federal appeals
court's holding. Id., at 914 (Scalia, J., concurring). The
appellate court nevertheless denied a petition for rehearing,
and we GVR'd. As Justice Scalia wrote in concurrence,
our order was in keeping with our "longstanding practice"
of vacating a court of appeals' decision based on a construction of state law that appears to contradict a recent decision
of the highest state court. Id., at 915. "[A] judgment of a
federal court ruled by state law and correctly applying that
law as authoritatively declared by the state courts when the
judgment was rendered, must be reversed on appellate review if in the meantime the state courts have disapproved
of their former rulings and adopted different ones." Huddleston v. Dwyer, 322 U. S. 232, 236 (1944) (per curiam).

Given Sheets' explicit disapproval of the cases on which
the Court of Appeals based its decision, there is reason to
question the correctness of the Court of Appeals' decision.
It is true that petitioner brought Sheets to the attention of
the Court of Appeals in a motion to stay or recall its mandate
and that the Court of Appeals denied this motion. But the
Court of Appeals' ambiguous statement that petitioner's re520US3$66J 08-04-98 13:40:05 PAGES OPINPGT

quest was "without merit" does not establish that it actuallyconsidered and rejected petitioner's

Sheets argument. In
opposing petitioner's motion, respondent argued that a courtof appeals lacks authority to recall its mandate, and the

Court of Appeals may have rested its denial of petitioner's
motion on this procedural ground. Respondent does notargue otherwise. Indeed, the procedural ground is by far

the most likely, given Sheets' explicit repudiation of the prec-edent on which the Court of Appeals' original judgment
hinged. Moreover, we have at least once before issued aGVR order where petitioners notified the Federal Court of
Appeals of an intervening State Supreme Court's opinion ina second petition for rehearing, which the Court of Appeals
denied. See Huddleston, supra, at 235.

In these circumstances, we now grant certiorari, vacate
the judgment below, and remand the case to the Court of
Appeals for further consideration.

Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice Breyer
joins, dissenting.

In Thomas v. American Home Products, Inc., 519 U. S.
913 (1996), the Court granted, vacated, and remanded a decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit
for reconsideration in the light of a decision of the Georgia
Supreme Court that was handed down after the Court of
Appeals had denied a petition for rehearing. The lower
court there had had no opportunity to consider the impact
of the new state-law decision.

Here, by contrast, Sheets v. Brethren Mutual Ins. Co., 342
Md. 634, 679 A. 2d 540 (1996), was expressly considered by
the court below. Although Sheets was not brought to the
attention of the Fourth Circuit until after it had rendered its
decision and denied rehearing, petitioner raised it nonetheless before that court in a motion to recall or stay the mandate. Petitioner's motion did not fall on deaf ears; indeed,
the Fourth Circuit went to the unusual lengths of requesting

a response to the motion and then, after the response wasreceived, issuing a written order rejecting the claim. The

only question discussed in that order is whether "Sheetsshould have required a different disposition of this case than
the [original] disposition." App. to Pet. for Cert. 10a. Andthe court resolved that question, concluding "[w]e are of [the]
opinion the said petition and motions are without merit." *
Id., at 11a.If this Court has, without any briefs on the merits, concluded that the Court of Appeals' refusal to alter its opinionin the light of Sheets was wrong, it should either set the
case for argument or summarily reverse. True, this wouldrequire the investment of still more time and effort in a case
that is in the federal courts only by reason of diversity ofcitizenship, see

Thomas, supra, at 917 (Rehnquist, C. J.,dissenting), but it would have the virtue of explicitly telling

the Court of Appeals how to dispose of the case. TheCourt's decision to grant, vacate, and remand in the light of
Sheets, on the contrary, is muddled and cryptic. Surely thejudges of the Court of Appeals are, in fairness, entitled to
some clearer guidance from this Court than what they arenow given.

*Although it is possible to construe this statement as being based on
the procedural impropriety of raising such an issue on a motion to recall
the mandate, such a construction is nowhere suggested in the order, nor
is it the natural implication of the language ("without merit") used by the
court below. I see no reason for us not to take the Fourth Circuit's order
at face value.

BRACY v. GRAMLEY, WARDEN
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe seventh circuit

No. 96-6133. Argued April 14, 1997--Decided June 9, 1997
Petitioner was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death before then-Judge

Thomas J. Maloney, an Illinois judge who was later convicted on federal
charges of taking bribes from criminal defendants. In this federal habeas petition, petitioner claims that Maloney had an interest in his conviction to deflect suspicion that the judge was taking bribes in other
murder cases during and around the time of petitioner's trial, and that
this interest violated the fair-trial guarantee of the Due Process Clause.
The District Court denied both the claim and a supplemental discovery
motion. In affirming, the Seventh Circuit held, inter alia, that petitioner had not shown "good cause" for discovery to prove his claim, as
required by Rule 6(a) of the Rules Governing $ 2254 Cases.

Held: Petitioner has made a sufficient factual showing, under Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a), to establish "good cause" for discovery on his claim of
actual judicial bias in his case. Pp. 904-910.

(a) Before addressing whether petitioner is entitled to discovery, his
claim's essential elements must be identified. See United States v.
Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 468. Due process requires a fair trial before
a judge without actual bias against the defendant or an interest in the
outcome of his particular case. Petitioner claims that Maloney's acceptance of bribes from criminal defendants not only rendered him biased
against the State in those cases, but also induced a compensatory bias
against defendants who did not bribe him, since he did not want to
appear "soft" on criminal defendants. There is no question that, if
proved, such compensatory, camouflaging bias in petitioner's own case
would violate due process. Pp. 904-905.

(b) Petitioner has shown good cause for appropriate discovery to
prove his claim. The usual presumption that public officials have properly discharged their official duties has been soundly rebutted here.
Maloney's public trial and conviction show that he was thoroughly corrupt. A Government proffer in that case details his corruption as both
a trial attorney and a judge. Additional evidence supports the claim
that Maloney was biased in petitioner's own case. His trial attorney
was a former associate of Maloney's in a law practice that was familiar
and comfortable with corruption, who announced that he was ready for
trial just a few weeks after his appointment and requested no additional

time before trial to prepare for the penalty phase of the case. Petitioner alleges that Maloney appointed the attorney with the understanding that he would not object to, or interfere with, a prompt trial, so that
petitioner's case could camouflage bribe negotiations being conducted in
another murder case. The Government's proffer confirms that petitioner's murder trial was sandwiched tightly between other murder trials
that Maloney fixed. Although petitioner may be unable to obtain evidence sufficient to support a finding of actual judicial bias in his trial,
he has made a sufficient showing to establish "good cause" for discovery.
Although, given the facts of this particular case, it would be an abuse
of discretion not to permit any discovery, Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a) provides that the scope and extent of discovery is a matter confided to the
District Court's discretion. Pp. 906-909.

role in an execution-style triple murder.1 Maloney was later
convicted of taking bribes from defendants in criminal cases.
Although he was not bribed in this case, he "fixed" other
murder cases during and around the time of petitioner's trial.
Petitioner contends that Maloney therefore had an interest
in a conviction here to deflect suspicion that he was taking
bribes in other cases, and that this interest violated the fairtrial guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process
Clause. We hold that petitioner has made a sufficient factual showing to establish "good cause," as required by Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a), for discovery on his claim of actual
judicial bias in his case.

Maloney was one of many dishonest judges exposed and
convicted through "Operation Greylord," a labyrinthine federal investigation of judicial corruption in Chicago. See
United States v. Maloney, 71 F. 3d 645 (CA7 1995), cert.
denied, 519 U. S. 927 (1996); see generally J. Tuohy & R.
Warden, Greylord: Justice, Chicago Style (1989). Maloney
served as a judge from 1977 until he retired in 1990, and it
appears he has the dubious distinction of being the only Illinois judge ever convicted of fixing a murder case.2 Before
he was appointed to the bench, Maloney was a criminal defense attorney with close ties to organized crime who often

the first American judge to be convicted of taking bribes in murder cases.

App. 54-66; 81 F. 3d 684,696 (CA7 1996) (Rovner, J., dissenting) ("[B]y the time Maloney ascended to the bench in 1977, he was well groomed inthe art of judicial corruption"). Once a judge, Maloney exploited many of the relationships and connections he had de-veloped while bribing judges to solicit bribes for himself.
For example, Lucius Robinson, a bailiff through whom Malo-ney had bribed judges while in practice, and Robert McGee,
one of Maloney's former associates, both served as "bagmen," or intermediaries, between Maloney and lawyers looking for a fix. Two such lawyers, Robert J. Cooley and Wil-liam A. Swano, were key witnesses against Maloney at his
trial. Maloney, supra, at 650-652.Maloney was convicted in Federal District Court of conspiracy, racketeering, extortion, and obstructing justice inApril 1993. Four months later, petitioner filed this habeas
petition in the United States District Court for the NorthernDistrict of Illinois, claiming, among other things, that he was
denied a fair trial because "in order to cover up the fact that[Maloney] accepted bribes from defendants in some cases,
[he] was prosecution oriented in other cases." United
States ex rel. Collins v. Welborn, 868 F. Supp. 950, 990 (NDIll. 1994). Petitioner also sought discovery in support of

this claim. Specifically, he requested (1) the sealed tran-script of Maloney's trial; (2) reasonable access to the prosecution's materials in Maloney's case; (3) the opportunity to de-pose persons associated with Maloney; and (4) a chance to
search Maloney's rulings for a pattern of pro-prosecutionbias.

claim and denied his supplemental motion for discovery, con-cluding that "[petitioner's] allegations contain insufficient

specificity or good cause to justify further discovery." Id.,
at 991.

The Court of Appeals affirmed by a divided vote. The
court conceded the "appearance of impropriety" in petitioner's case but reasoned that this appearance did not require a
new trial because it "provide[d] only a weak basis for supposing the original trial an unreliable test of the issues presented for decision in it." 81 F. 3d, at 688-689. Next, the
court agreed that petitioner's theory--that Maloney's corruption "permeate[d] his judicial conduct"--was "plausible,"
id., at 689, but found it not "sufficiently compelling [an] empirical proposition" to justify presuming actual judicial bias
in petitioner's case, id., at 690. Finally, the court held that
petitioner had not shown "good cause" for discovery to prove
his claim, as required by 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 6(a). 81
F. 3d, at 690. This was because, in the court's view, even if
petitioner were to uncover evidence that Maloney sometimes
came down hard on defendants who did not bribe him, "it
would not show that he followed the practice in this case."
Id., at 691 (emphasis added). In any event, the court added,
because petitioner had failed to uncover any evidence of actual bias without discovery, "the probability is slight that a
program of depositions aimed at crooks and their accomplices
. . . will yield such evidence." Ibid.4 We granted certiorari
to address whether, on the basis of the showing made in this
particular case, petitioner should have been granted discovery under Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a) to support his judicialbias claim. 519 U. S. 1074 (1997). We now reverse.

4 The dissenting judge insisted that petitioner had shown "good cause"
for discovery to support his judicial-bias claim, 81 F. 3d, at 696-699 (opinion of Rovner, J.), and went on to state that, in her view, petitioner was
entitled to relief whether or not he could prove that Maloney's corruption
had any impact on his trial, id., at 699-703. The latter conclusion, of
course, would render irrelevant the discovery-related question presented
in this case.

904 BRACY v. GRAMLEY

Opinion of the Court
A habeas petitioner, unlike the usual civil litigant in fed-eral court, is not entitled to discovery as a matter of ordinary

course. Thus, in Harris v. Nelson, 394 U. S. 286, 295 (1969),we concluded that the "broad discovery provisions" of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure did not apply in habeas
proceedings. We held, however, that the All Writs Act, 28U. S. C. $ 1651, gave federal courts the power to "fashion appropriate modes of procedure," 394 U. S., at 299, includingdiscovery, to dispose of habeas petitions "as law and justice
require," id., at 300. We then recommended that "the rule-making machinery . . . be invoked to formulate rules of practice with respect to federal habeas corpus . . . proceedings."
Id., at 300, n. 7. Accordingly, in 1976, we promulgated and
Congress adopted the Rules Governing $ 2254 Cases. Of
particular relevance to this case is Rule 6(a), which provides:

"A party shall be entitled to invoke the processes of dis-covery available under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure if, and to the extent that, the judge in the exercise
of his discretion and for good cause shown grants leaveto do so, but not otherwise."

Before addressing whether petitioner is entitled to discovery under this Rule to support his judicial-bias claim, wemust first identify the "essential elements" of that claim.

See United States v. Armstrong, 517 U. S. 456, 468 (1996).
Of course, most questions concerning a judge's qualificationsto hear a case are not constitutional ones, because the Due

Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment establishes aconstitutional floor, not a uniform standard.

Aetna Life Ins.
Co. v. Lavoie, 475 U. S. 813, 828 (1986). Instead, these questions are, in most cases, answered by common law, statute,
or the professional standards of the bench and bar. See,
e. g., id., at 820-821; Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510, 523 (1927);
28 U. S. C. $$ 144, 455; ABA Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon

Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U. S. 35, 46 (1975), before a judge
with no actual bias against the defendant or interest in the
outcome of his particular case. See, e. g., Aetna, supra, at
821-822; Tumey, supra, at 523.

The facts of this case are, happily, not the stuff of typical
judicial-disqualification disputes. A judge who accepts
bribes from a criminal defendant to fix that defendant's case
is "biased" in the most basic sense of that word, but his bias
is directed against the State, not the defendant. Petitioner
contends, however, that Maloney's taking of bribes from
some criminal defendants not only rendered him biased
against the State in those cases, but also induced a sort of
compensatory bias against defendants who did not bribe
Maloney. Maloney was biased in this latter, compensatory
sense, petitioner argues, to avoid being seen as uniformly
and suspiciously "soft" on criminal defendants. The Court
of Appeals, in its opinion, pointed out that this theory is quite
speculative; after all, it might be equally likely that a judge
who was "on the take" in some criminal cases would be careful to at least appear to favor all criminal defendants, so as
to avoid apparently wild and unexplainable swings in decisions and judicial philosophy. 81 F. 3d, at 689-690.5 In any

event, difficulties of proof aside, there is no question that, if
it could be proved, such compensatory, camouflaging bias on
Maloney's part in petitioner's own case would violate the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. We
now turn to the question whether petitioner has shown "good

5 At Maloney's trial, however, attorney William Swano provided testimony that lends some support to petitioner's compensatory-bias theory.
See 81 F. 3d, at 697 (Rovner, J., dissenting). According to Swano, Maloney
retaliated against one of Swano's clients in one of the rare cases when
Swano failed to offer Maloney a bribe and, in bribe negotiations in a later
case, Maloney's bag man Robert McGee admitted as much. Swano testified that he learned that in order " `to practice in front of Judge Maloney
. . . we had to pay.' " Ibid.

cause" for appropriate discovery to prove his judicial-biasclaim.

In the District Court, petitioner contended that he was"deprived of his right to a fair trial" because "[t]here is cause
to believe that Judge Maloney's discretionary rulings in thiscase may have been influenced by a desire on his part to
allay suspicion of his pattern of corruption and dishonesty."App. 5.

6 In support, he submitted a copy of Maloney's 1991

indictment, App. 16-35, and a newspaper article describingtestimony from Maloney's trial, in which attorney William

Swano described an additional, uncharged incident where hebribed Maloney to fix a murder case. App. 12, n. 1, 36-38.
In a supplemental motion for discovery, petitioner's co-defendant Roger Collins alleged that "[a] Government witness in the Maloney case has advised . . . that co-defendantBracy's trial attorney was a former partner of Thomas Maloney." App. 51. Collins attached to that motion a copy ofthe United States' proffer of evidence in aggravation in Maloney's case, which describes in considerable detail Maloney'scorruption both before and after he became a judge. See
App. 54 ("Although [it is] difficult to imagine, Thomas Malo-ney's life of corruption was considerably more expansive
than proved at trial"). The United States' proffer asserts,for example, that Maloney fixed serious felony cases regularly while a practicing criminal defense attorney; 7 that, asa judge, he continued to corrupt justice through the same

6 We express no opinion on the correctness of the various discretionary
rulings cited by petitioner as examples of Maloney's bias. See Brief for
Petitioner 5-6. We note, however, that many of these rulings have been
twice upheld, and that petitioner's convictions and sentence have been
twice affirmed, by the Illinois Supreme Court. See n. 1, supra.

7 The Government introduced evidence that Maloney regularly bribed

Judge Maurice Pompey and Cook County Deputy Sheriff Lucius Robinson
(who would later serve as Maloney's "bag man"); that on numerous occasions, using his organized-crime connections, Maloney fixed cases for his
client Michael Bertucci; and that Maloney helped orchestrate the fix in the
murder case of underworld hit man Harry Aleman. App. 54-66.

political relationships and organized-crime connections hehad exploited as a lawyer;

8 and that at least one attorney

from Maloney's former law firm, Robert McGee, was activelyinvolved in assisting Maloney's corruption, both before and

after he became a judge, and also bribed Maloney himself,
App. 55, 68-72. In addition, the proffer confirms that peti-tioner's murder trial was sandwiched tightly between other

murder trials that Maloney fixed.9As just noted above, petitioner's attorney at trial was a
former associate of Maloney's, App. 51, and Maloney ap-pointed him to defend this case in June 1981. The lawyer
announced that he was ready for trial just a few weeks later.He did not request additional time to prepare penalty-phase
evidence in this death penalty case even when the State an8 For example, Lucius Robinson and Robert McGee, who were involved
in Maloney's corruption as a lawyer, later facilitated his bribe taking when
he became a judge. United States v. Maloney, 71 F. 3d 645, 650-652 (CA7
1995), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 927 (1996); App. 22-24; 54-55. As the Government alleged in its proffer: "Maloney was closely tied to the [sic] La
Cosa Nostra prior to his appointment to the bench and . . . major organized
crime figures looked forward to [his] appointment as an opportunity to
have a `good friend' on the bench . . . [and] after his elevation to the bench,
Maloney continued his close First Ward/organized crime connections, fixing the results of several murder cases of import to organized crime."
App. 54-55.

9 Petitioner was tried in July 1981. William Swano testified at Maloney's trial that, in October 1980, he bribed Maloney in the murder case of
Swano's client, Wilfredo Rosario. Maloney excluded Rosario's confession
and, in May 1981, acquitted Rosario after a bench trial. Maloney, supra,
at 650; App. 12, n. 1, 53, n. 1. Also in May 1981, Maloney took a bribe to
throw the murder case of Lenny Chow, a hit man for a Chinatown crime
organization. At a bench trial that August, Maloney admitted a dying
declaration, but found it unreliable, and acquitted Chow. Maloney, supra,
at 650; App. 20-22, 27. In 1982, Maloney and Swano fixed another murder
case in which one Owen Jones was charged with beating a man to death
with a lead pipe. Maloney took $4,000-$5,000 from Jones' mother, using
his former associate Robert McGee as a "bag man," to acquit Jones on the
felony-murder charge, and to convict him of voluntary manslaughter only.

nounced at the outset that, if petitioner were convicted, itwould introduce petitioner's then-pending Arizona murder

charges as evidence in aggravation. Tr. of Oral Arg. 43.10At oral argument before this Court, counsel for petitioner
suggested, given that at least one of Maloney's former lawassociates--Robert McGee--was corrupt and involved in
bribery, see supra, at 907, that petitioner's trial lawyermight have been appointed with the understanding that he
would not object to, or interfere with, a prompt trial, so thatpetitioner's case could be tried before, and camouflage the
bribe negotiations in, the Chow murder case. Tr. of OralArg. 17-18, 43-44.

11 This is, of course, only a theory at this

point; it is not supported by any solid evidence of petition-er's trial lawyer's participation in any such plan. It is true,

however, that McGee was corrupt and that petitioner's trialcoincided with bribe negotiations in the

Chow case andclosely followed the
Rosario murder case, which was alsofixed. See n. 9, supra.

We conclude that petitioner has shown "good cause" fordiscovery under Rule 6(a). In Harris, we stated that

it is the duty of the court to provide the necessary facilitiesand procedures for an adequate inquiry." 394 U. S., at 300.
Habeas Corpus Rule 6 is meant to be "consistent" with
Harris. Advisory Committee's Note on Habeas CorpusRule 6, 28 U. S. C., p. 479. Ordinarily, we presume that public officials have " `properly discharged their official duties.' "
Armstrong, 517 U. S., at 464 (quoting United States v. Chemical Foundation, Inc., 272 U. S. 1, 14-15 (1926)). Were itpossible to indulge this presumption here, we might well

agree with the Court of Appeals that petitioner's submission
and his compensatory-bias theory are too speculative to warrant discovery. But, unfortunately, the presumption has
been soundly rebutted: Maloney was shown to be thoroughly
steeped in corruption through his public trial and conviction.
We emphasize, though, that petitioner supports his discovery
request by pointing not only to Maloney's conviction for
bribe taking in other cases, but also to additional evidence,
discussed above, that lends support to his claim that Maloney
was actually biased in petitioner's own case. That is, he
presents "specific allegations" that his trial attorney, a former associate of Maloney's in a law practice that was familiar
and comfortable with corruption, may have agreed to take
this capital case to trial quickly so that petitioner's conviction would deflect any suspicion the rigged Rosario and
Chow cases might attract. It may well be, as the Court of
Appeals predicted, that petitioner will be unable to obtain
evidence sufficient to support a finding of actual judicial bias
in the trial of his case, but we hold that he has made a sufficient showing, as required by Habeas Corpus Rule 6(a), to
establish "good cause" for discovery. Although, given the
facts of this particular case, it would be an abuse of discretion not to permit any discovery, Rule 6(a) makes it clear that
the scope and extent of such discovery is a matter confided to
the discretion of the District Court.

JOHNSON et al. v. FANKELL
certiorari to the supreme court of idaho
No. 96-292. Argued February 26, 1997--Decided June 9, 1997
Respondent filed this 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 damages action in Idaho state

court, alleging that the termination of her state employment by petitioner officials deprived her of property without due process in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment. The trial court denied petitioners' motion to dismiss, which asserted that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The Idaho Supreme Court dismissed their appeal from that
ruling, explaining that the denial was neither an appealable final order
under Idaho Appellate Rule 11(a)(1) nor appealable as a matter of federal right under $ 1983.

Held: Defendants in a state-court $ 1983 action do not have a federal right

to an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunity.
Pp. 914-923.

(a) State officials performing discretionary functions have a "qualified
immunity" defense that, in appropriate circumstances, shields them both
from liability for damages under $ 1983 and from the burdens of trial.
Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818. A federal district court order
rejecting such a defense on the ground that the defendant's actions--if
proved--would have violated clearly established law may be appealed
immediately as a "final decision" under the general federal appellate
jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1291. Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S.
511, 524-530. Relying on respondent's federal statutory claim and their
own federal defense, petitioners submit that the Idaho courts must protect their right to avoid the burdens of trial by allowing the same interlocutory appeal that would be available in a federal court. Pp. 914-916.

(b) This Court rejects petitioners' argument that when the Idaho
courts construe their own Rule 11(a)(1), they must accept the federal
definition of a "final decision" in cases brought under $ 1983. Even if
the Idaho Rule and $ 1291 contained identical language--and they do
not--the Idaho Supreme Court's interpretation of the Rule would be
binding on federal courts, which have no authority to place a different
construction upon it. See, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 767.
Idaho could voluntarily place the same construction on the Rule as the
Mitchell Court placed on $ 1291, but this Court cannot command that
choice. Pp. 916-918.

(c) Also unpersuasive is petitioners' contention that Rule 11(a)(1) is
pre-empted by $ 1983 to the extent that it does not allow an interlocu520us3$68Z 08-19-98 15:30:26 PAGES OPINPGT

tory appeal. Petitioners' arguments are not strong enough to overcome
two considerable hurdles. First, the normal presumption against preemption is buttressed here by the fact that the Idaho Supreme Court's
dismissal of the appeal rested squarely on a neutral state rule for administering state courts. Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 372. Second, because the qualified immunity defense's ultimate purpose is to protect
the State and its officials from overenforcement of federal rights, Rule
11(a)(1)'s application in this context is less an interference with federal
interests, as petitioners claim, than a judgment about how best to balance competing state interests. In arguing that pre-emption is necessary to avoid different "outcomes" in $ 1983 litigation based solely on
whether the claim is asserted in state or federal court, petitioners misplace their reliance on Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S. 131, 138. "[O]utcom[e]," as used there, referred to the ultimate disposition of the case,
whereas the postponement of the appeal until after final judgment will
not affect the ultimate outcome of this case if petitioners' qualified immunity claim is meritorious. Their argument that Rule 11(a)(1) does
not adequately protect their right to prevail on the immunity question
in advance of trial also fails, given the precise source and scope of the
federal right at issue. In contrast to the right to have the trial court
rule on the immunity defense's merits, which presumably has its source
in $ 1983 and is fully protected by Idaho, the right to immediate appellate review of such a ruling in a federal case has its source in $ 1291,
not $ 1983, see Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304, 317, and is a federal
procedural right that simply does not apply in a nonfederal forum.

Opinion of the Court
Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court.
The question presented is whether defendants in an actionbrought under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, in state

court have a federal right to an interlocutory appeal from adenial of qualified immunity. We hold that they do not.

Petitioners are officials of the Idaho Liquor Dispensary.Respondent, a former liquor store clerk, brought this action

for damages under $ 1983 in the District Court for theCounty of Bonner, Idaho. She alleged that petitioners deprived her of property without due process of law in viola-tion of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution when they terminated her employment. Petitionersmoved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that they were
entitled to qualified immunity. They contended that, at thetime of respondent's dismissal, they reasonably believed that
she was a probationary employee who had no property inter-est in her job. Accordingly, petitioners argued, her termination did not violate clearly established law. The trial court

914 JOHNSON v. FANKELL

Opinion of the Court
denied the motion,1 and petitioners filed a timely notice ofappeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Idaho.

The State Supreme Court entered an order dismissing theappeal. The court explained that an order denying a motion
for summary judgment is not appealable under Idaho Appel-late Rule 11(a)(1) "for the reason it is not from a final order
or Judgment." App. 67. It also rejected petitioners' argu-ments that the order was appealable under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983
and Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U. S. 299 (1996). Petitionerssought rehearing, again arguing that the order was final
within the meaning of the Idaho Appellate Rule, and, in thealternative, that they had a right to appeal as a matter of
federal law. The court denied rehearing and dismissed theappeal.

Petitioners then filed a petition in this Court seekingeither a writ of certiorari or a writ of mandamus. They
pointed out that some state courts, unlike the Idaho SupremeCourt, allow interlocutory appeals of orders denying qualified immunity on the theory that such review is necessary toprotect a substantial federal right, see

McLin v. Trimble,795 P. 2d 1035, 1037-1038 (Okla. 1990); Lakewood v. Brace,

sonable person would have known." Harlow v. Fitzgerald,457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).

This "qualified immunity" defense is valuable to officialsasserting it for two reasons. First, if it is found applicable
at any stage of the proceedings, it determines the outcome ofthe litigation by shielding the official from damages liability.
Second, when the complaint fails to allege a violation ofclearly established law or when discovery fails to uncover
evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue whether the de-fendant committed such a violation, it provides the defendant
with an immunity from the burdens of trial as well as a de-fense to liability.

2 Indeed, one reason for adopting the objective test announced in Harlow was to "permit the resolu-tion of many insubstantial claims on summary judgment."

Ibid.Consistent with that purpose, we held in

Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511, 524-530 (1985), that a Federal DistrictCourt order rejecting a qualified immunity defense on the

ground that the defendant's actions--if proved--would haveviolated clearly established law may be appealed immediately as a "final decision" within the meaning of the generalfederal appellate jurisdiction statute, 28 U. S. C. $ 1291.

3 If

this action had been brought in a federal court, therefore,petitioners would have had a right to take an appeal from

the trial court's order denying their motion for summaryjudgment.

Relying on the facts (a) that respondent has asserted afederal claim under a federal statute, and (b) that they are

2 Of course, when a case can be dismissed on the pleadings or in an early
pretrial stage, qualified immunity also provides officials with the valuable
protection from "the burdens of broad-reaching discovery," Harlow v.
Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800, 818 (1982).

3 While Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985), involved a Bivens v.

Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), action against
a federal official, we have also construed $ 1291 to authorize similar appeals in actions brought against state officials under $ 1983. See, e. g.,
Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304 (1995).

916 JOHNSON v. FANKELL

Opinion of the Court
asserting a defense provided by federal law, petitioners submit that the Idaho courts must protect their right to avoid
the burdens of trial by allowing the same interlocutory appeal that would be available in a federal court. They support this submission with two different arguments: First,
that when the Idaho courts construe their own rules allowing
appeals from final judgments, they must accept the federal
definition of finality in cases brought under $ 1983; and
second, that if those rules do not authorize the appeal, they
are pre-empted by federal law. We find neither argument
persuasive.

III

We can easily dispense with petitioners' first contention
that Idaho must follow the federal construction of a "final
decision." Even if the Idaho and federal statutes contained
identical language--and they do not 4--the interpretation of
the Idaho statute by the Idaho Supreme Court would be
binding on federal courts. Neither this Court nor any other
federal tribunal has any authority to place a construction on
a state statute different from the one rendered by the highest court of the State. See, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458
U. S. 747, 767 (1982); Exxon Corp. v. Department of Revenue
of Wis., 447 U. S. 207, 226, n. 9 (1980); Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U. S. 456, 465 (1967). This proposition,
fundamental to our system of federalism, is applicable to
procedural as well as substantive rules. See Wardius v.
Oregon, 412 U. S. 470, 477 (1973).

The definition of the term "final decision" that we adopted
in Mitchell was an application of the "collateral order" doctrine first recognized in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan

4 "Final decision" is the operative term of $ 1291, whereas "[j]udgments,
orders and decrees which are final" is the language of Idaho Appellate
Rule 11(a)(1).

Corp., 337 U. S. 541 (1949). In that case, as in all of ourcases following it, we were construing the federal statutory

language of 28 U. S. C. $ 1291.5 While some States haveadopted a similar "collateral order" exception when construing their jurisdictional statutes,6 we have never suggested
that federal law compelled them to do so. Indeed, a number
of States employ collateral order doctrines that reject the
limitations this Court has placed on $ 1291.7 Idaho could, of

5 Thus, in Mitchell we explained: "In holding these and similar issues of
absolute immunity to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine,
see Abney v. United States, [431 U. S. 651 (1977)]; Helstoski v. Meanor,
442 U. S. 500 (1979); Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 731 (1982), the Court
has recognized that a question of immunity is separate from the merits of
the underlying action for purposes of the Cohen test even though a reviewing court must consider the plaintiff's factual allegations in resolving the
immunity issue. Accordingly, we hold that a district court's denial of a
claim of qualified immunity, to the extent that it turns on an issue of law,
is an appealable `final decision' within the meaning of 28 U. S. C. $ 1291
notwithstanding the absence of a final judgment." 472 U. S., at 528-530
(footnote omitted).

as interlocutory, . . . [w]e have followed Mitchell in accepting the State

claim of qualified immunity met these [collateral order] requirements, and
we agree with this determination"); Park County v. Cooney, 845 P. 2d 346,

the reasons detailed in Mitchell . . . , are better reasoned; and we therefore
hold that an order denying dismissal of a claim based on qualified immunity is an order appealable to this court").

course, place the same construction on its Appellate Rule11(a)(1) as we have placed on $ 1291. But that is clearly

a choice for that court to make, not one that we have anyauthority to command.

IV
Petitioners also contend that, to the extent that Idaho Ap-pellate Rule 11(a)(1) does not allow an interlocutory appeal,

it is pre-empted by $ 1983. Relying heavily on Felder v.Casey, 487 U. S. 131 (1988), petitioners first assert that preemption is necessary to avoid "different outcomes in $ 1983litigation based solely on whether the claim is asserted in
state or federal court," id., at 138. Second, they argue thatthe state procedure "impermissibly burden[s]" the federal
immunity from suit because it does not adequately protecttheir right to prevail on the immunity question in advance
of trial.8For two reasons, petitioners have a heavy burden of persuasion in making this argument. First, our normal pre-sumption against pre-emption is buttressed by the fact that
the Idaho Supreme Court's dismissal of the appeal restedsquarely on a neutral state Rule regarding the administration of the state courts.9 As we explained in Howlett v.
Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 372 (1990):

8 See Brief for Petitioners 22.
9 Unlike the notice-of-claim rule at issue in Felder v. Casey, 487 U. S., at

140-145, Idaho Appellate Rule 11(a)(1) does not target civil rights claims
against the State. See also Howlett v. Rose, 496 U. S. 356, 380-381 (1990).
Instead, it generally permits appeals only of "[j]udgments, orders and decrees which are final," without regard to the identity of the party seeking
the appeal or the subject matter of the suit. Petitioners claim that the
rule is not neutral because it permits interlocutory appeals in certain limited circumstances but denies an appeal here. But we have never held
that a rule must be monolithic to be neutral. Absent evidence that Appellate Rule 11(a)(1) discriminates against interlocutory appeals of $ 1983
qualified immunity determinations by defendants--as compared with
other types of appeals--we must deem the state procedure neutral.

Opinion of the Court
"When a state court refuses jurisdiction because of aneutral state rule regarding the administration of the

courts, we must act with utmost caution before decidingthat it is obligated to entertain the claim. See Missouri
ex rel. Southern R. Co. v. Mayfield, 340 U. S. 1 (1950);
Georgia Rail Road & Banking Co. v. Musgrove, 335U. S. 900 (1949) (per curiam); Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S.

117 (1945); Douglas v. New York, N. H. & H. R. Co., 279U. S. 377 (1929). The requirement that a state court of
competent jurisdiction treat federal law as the law ofthe land does not necessarily include within it a requirement that the State create a court competent to hearthe case in which the federal claim is presented. The
general rule, `bottomed deeply in belief in the impor-tance of state control of state judicial procedure, is that
federal law takes the state courts as it finds them.'Hart, [The Relations Between State and Federal Law],
54 Colum. L. Rev. [489, 508 (1954)]; see also Southland
Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1, 33 (1984) (O'Connor, J.,dissenting);

FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. [742, 774(1982)] (opinion of Powell, J.). The States thus have

great latitude to establish the structure and jurisdictionof their own courts."

A second barrier to petitioners' argument arises from thenature of the interest protected by the defense of qualified
immunity. Petitioners' argument for pre-emption is bot-tomed on their claims that the Idaho rules are interfering
with their federal rights. While it is true that the defensehas its source in a federal statute ($ 1983), the ultimate purpose of qualified immunity is to protect the State and itsofficials from overenforcement of federal rights. The Idaho
Supreme Court's application of the State's procedural rulesin this context is thus less an interference with

federal inter-ests than a judgment about how best to balance the competing state interests of limiting interlocutory appeals and pro520us3$68I 08-19-98 15:30:27 PAGES OPINPGT
920 JOHNSON v. FANKELL

Opinion of the Court
viding state officials with immediate review of the merits of
their defense.10

Petitioners' arguments for pre-emption are not strong
enough to overcome these considerable hurdles. Contrary
to petitioners' assertions, Idaho's decision not to provide appellate review for the vast majority of interlocutory orders--
including denials of qualified immunity in $ 1983 cases--is not
"outcome determinative" in the sense that we used that term
when we held that Wisconsin's notice-of-claim statute could
not be applied to defeat a federal civil rights action brought
in state courts under $ 1983. Felder, 487 U. S., at 153. The
failure to comply with the Wisconsin statute in Felder resulted in a judgment dismissing a complaint that would not
have been dismissed--at least not without a judicial determination of the merits of the claim--if the case had been filed
in a federal court. One of the primary grounds for our decision was that, because the notice-of-claim requirement would
"frequently and predictably produce different outcomes" depending on whether $ 1983 claims were brought in state or
federal court, it was inconsistent with the federal interest in
uniformity. Id., at 138.11

10 It does warrant observation that Rule 12(a) of the Idaho Appellate
Rules provides that the State Supreme Court may grant permission "to
appeal from an interlocutory order or decree . . . which is not otherwise
appealable under these rules, but which involves a controlling question of
law as to which there is substantial grounds for difference of opinion and
in which an immediate appeal . . . may materially advance the orderly
resolution of the litigation." Presumably, petitioners could have sought
review under this permissive provision, and the Idaho Supreme Court
might have granted review if, in the view of that court, the officials' claim
to immunity was so substantial that the suit should not proceed.

11 See also Brown v. Western R. Co. of Ala., 338 U. S. 294, 296-299 (1949)

(Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA) pre-empted different state
pleading requirements when effect was to defeat plaintiff's cause of action); Garrett v. Moore-McCormack Co., 317 U. S. 239, 243-244 (1942) (federal Jones Act pre-empted different state burden of proof regarding releases when effect was to defeat plaintiff's cause of action).

Opinion of the Court
Petitioners' reliance on Felder is misplaced because "out-come," as we used the term there, referred to the ultimate

disposition of the case. If petitioners' claim to qualified im-munity is meritorious, there is no suggestion that the application of the Idaho rules of procedure will produce a finalresult different from what a federal ruling would produce.
Petitioners were able to argue their immunity from suitclaim to the trial court, just as they would to a federal court.
And the claim will be reviewable by the Idaho SupremeCourt after the trial court enters a final judgment, thus providing petitioners with a further chance to urge their immu-nity. Consequently, the postponement of the appeal until
after final judgment will not affect the ultimate outcome ofthe case.

Petitioners' second argument for pre-emption of the stateprocedural Rule is that the Rule does not adequately protect
their right to prevail in advance of trial. In evaluating thiscontention, it is important to focus on the precise source and
scope of the federal right at issue. The right to have thetrial court rule on the merits of the qualified immunity defense presumably has its source in $ 1983, but the right toimmediate appellate review of that ruling in a federal case
has its source in $ 1291. The former right is fully protectedby Idaho. The latter right, however, is a federal procedural
right that simply does not apply in a nonfederal forum.12The locus of the right to interlocutory appeal in $ 1291,
rather than in $ 1983 itself, is demonstrated by our holding

12 Petitioners' reliance on Dice v. Akron, C. & Y. R. Co., 342 U. S. 359
(1952), is therefore misplaced. In Dice we held that the FELA preempted a state rule denying a right to a jury trial. In that case, however,
we made clear that Congress had provided in FELA that the jury trial
procedure was to be part of claims brought under the Act. Id., at 363
(citing Bailey v. Central Vermont R. Co., 319 U. S. 350, 354 (1943)). In
this case, by contrast, Congress has mentioned nothing about interlocutory
appeals in $ 1983; rather, the right to an immediate appeal in the federal
court system is found in $ 1291, which obviously has no application to
state courts.

922 JOHNSON v. FANKELL

Opinion of the Court
in Johnson v. Jones, 515 U. S. 304 (1995). In that case, gov-ernment officials asserting qualified immunity claimed entitlement to an interlocutory appeal of a District Court orderdenying their motion for summary judgment on the ground
that the record showed a genuine issue of material factwhether the officials actually engaged in the conduct that
constituted a clear violation of constitutional law. Id., at307-308. We concluded that this circumstance was different
from that presented in Mitchell, 472 U. S., at 528, in whichthe subject of the interlocutory appeal was whether a given
set of facts showed a violation of clearly established law, andheld that although $ 1291 did allow an interlocutory appeal
in the latter circumstance, such an appeal was not allowed inthe former.

In so holding, we acknowledged that "whether a districtcourt's denial of summary judgment amounts to (a) a determination about pre-existing `clearly established' law, or (b) adetermination about `genuine' issues of fact for trial, it still
forces public officials to trial." 515 U. S., at 317. But weconcluded that the strong "countervailing considerations"
surrounding appropriate interpretation of $ 1291 were ofsufficient importance to outweigh the officials' interest in
avoiding the burdens of litigation.The "countervailing considerations" at issue here are even
stronger than those presented in Johnson. When pre-emption of state law is at issue, we must respect the "principles [that] are fundamental to a system of federalism inwhich the state courts share responsibility for the application and enforcement of federal law." Howlett, 496 U. S., at372-373. This respect is at its apex when we confront a
claim that federal law requires a State to undertake some-thing as fundamental as restructuring the operation of its
courts.13 We therefore cannot agree with petitioners that

13 We have made it quite clear that it is a matter for each State to decide
how to structure its judicial system. See, e. g., M. L. B. v. S. L. J., 519

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe third circuit

No. 96-651. Argued March 24, 1997--Decided June 9, 1997
On August 26, 1992, while employed as a policeman at East Stroudsburg

University (ESU), a Pennsylvania state institution, respondent was arrested by state police and charged with a drug felony. Petitioners,
ESU officials, suspended him without pay, effective immediately, pending their own investigation. Although the criminal charges were dismissed on September 1, his suspension remained in effect. On September 18, he was provided the opportunity to tell his side of the story to
ESU officials. Subsequently, he was demoted to groundskeeper. He
then filed suit under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983, claiming, inter alia, that petitioners' failure to provide him with notice and a hearing before suspending
him without pay violated due process. The District Court granted petitioners summary judgment, but the Third Circuit reversed.

Held: In the circumstances here, the State did not violate due process by

failing to provide notice and a hearing before suspending a tenured public employee without pay. Pp. 928-936.

(a) In Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532, this Court
held that before being fired a public employee dismissable only for cause
was entitled to a limited pretermination hearing, to be followed by a
more comprehensive posttermination hearing. The Third Circuit erred
in relying on dictum in Loudermill to conclude that a suspension without pay must also be preceded by notice and a hearing. Due process
is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 481; FDIC v.
Mallen, 486 U. S. 230, 240. Pp. 929-931.

(b) Three factors are relevant in determining what process is constitutionally due: (1) the private interest that will be affected by the official
action; (2) the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through
the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or
substitute procedural safeguards; and (3) the Government's interest.

income is relatively insubstantial, and fringe benefits such as health and
life insurance are often not affected at all. On the other side of the
balance, the State has a significant interest in immediately suspending
employees charged with felonies who occupy positions of public trust
and visibility, such as police officers. While this interest could have
been accommodated by suspending respondent with pay, the Constitution does not require the government to give an employee charged with
a felony paid leave at taxpayer expense. The remaining Mathews
factor is the most important in this case: The purpose of a presuspension hearing--to assure that there are reasonable grounds to
support the suspension without pay, cf. Loudermill, supra, at 545-546--
has already been assured by the arrest and the filing of charges. See
FDIC, supra. That there may have been discretion not to suspend does
not mean that respondent had to be given the opportunity to persuade
officials of his innocence before the decision was made. See id., at 234-
235. Pp. 931-935.

(c) Whether respondent received an adequately prompt postsuspension hearing should be considered by the Third Circuit in the first
instance. Pp. 935-936.

Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case presents the question whether a State violatesthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by

failing to provide notice and a hearing before suspending atenured public employee without pay.

Respondent Richard J. Homar was employed as a policeofficer at East Stroudsburg University (ESU), a branch of

Pennsylvania's State System of Higher Education. On Au-gust 26, 1992, when respondent was at the home of a family
friend, he was arrested by the Pennsylvania State Police ina drug raid. Later that day, the state police filed a criminal
complaint charging respondent with possession of marijuana,

Opinion of the Court
possession with intent to deliver, and criminal conspiracy toviolate the controlled substance law, which is a felony. The

state police notified respondent's supervisor, University Po-lice Chief David Marazas, of the arrest and charges. Chief
Marazas in turn informed Gerald Levanowitz, ESU's Director of Human Resources, to whom ESU President James Gil-bert had delegated authority to discipline ESU employees.

Levanowitz suspended respondent without pay effective im-mediately. Respondent failed to report to work on the day
of his arrest, and learned of his suspension the next day,when he called Chief Marazas to inquire whether he had
been suspended. That same day, respondent received a letter from Levanowitz confirming that he had been suspended
effective August 26 pending an investigation into the criminal charges filed against him. The letter explained that any
action taken by ESU would not necessarily coincide with the
disposition of the criminal charges.

Although the criminal charges were dismissed on September 1, respondent's suspension remained in effect while ESU
continued with its own investigation. On September 18,
Levanowitz and Chief Marazas met with respondent in order
to give him an opportunity to tell his side of the story. Respondent was informed at the meeting that the state police
had given ESU information that was "very serious in nature," Record, Doc. No. 26, p. 48, but he was not informed
that that included a report of an alleged confession he had
made on the day of his arrest; he was consequently unable
to respond to damaging statements attributed to him in the
police report.

In a letter dated September 23, Levanowitz notified respondent that he was being demoted to the position of
groundskeeper effective the next day, and that he would receive backpay from the date the suspension took effect at
the rate of pay of a groundskeeper. (Respondent eventually
received backpay for the period of his suspension at the rate
of pay of a university police officer.) The letter maintained

928 GILBERT v. HOMAR

Opinion of the Court
that the demotion was being imposed "as a result of admis-sions made by yourself to the Pennsylvania State Police on

August 26, 1992 that you maintained associations with indi-viduals whom you knew were dealing in large quantities of
marijuana and that you obtained marijuana from one of thoseindividuals for your own use. Your actions constitute a clear
and flagrant violation of Sections 200 and 200.2 of the [ESU]Police Department Manual." App. 82a. Upon receipt of
this letter, the president of respondent's union requested ameeting with President Gilbert. The requested meeting
took place on September 24, at which point respondent hadreceived and read the police report containing the alleged
confession. After providing respondent with an oppor-tunity to respond to the charges, Gilbert sustained the
demotion.Respondent filed this suit under Rev. Stat. $ 1979, 42
U. S. C. $ 1983, in the United States District Court for theMiddle District of Pennsylvania against President Gilbert,
Chief Marazas, Levanowitz, and a Vice President of ESU,Curtis English, all in both their individual and official capacities. He contended, inter alia, that petitioners' failure toprovide him with notice and an opportunity to be heard before suspending him without pay violated due process. TheDistrict Court entered summary judgment for petitioners.
A divided Court of Appeals reversed the District Court'sdetermination that it was permissible for ESU to suspend
respondent without pay without first providing a hearing.89 F. 3d 1009 (CA3 1996). We granted certiorari. 519 U. S.

The protections of the Due Process Clause apply to gov-ernment deprivation of those perquisites of government employment in which the employee has a constitutionally pro-tected "property" interest. Although we have previously
held that public employees who can be discharged only forcause have a constitutionally protected property interest in

their tenure and cannot be fired without due process, seeBoard of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U. S. 564, 578

(1972); Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U. S. 593, 602-603 (1972),we have not had occasion to decide whether the protections
of the Due Process Clause extend to discipline of tenuredpublic employees short of termination. Petitioners, however, do not contest this preliminary point, and so withoutdeciding it we will, like the District Court, "[a]ssum[e] that
the suspension infringed a protected property interest,"App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a, and turn at once to petitioners'
contention that respondent received all the process he wasdue.

A
In Cleveland Bd. of Ed. v. Loudermill, 470 U. S. 532(1985), we concluded that a public employee dismissable only

for cause was entitled to a very limited hearing prior to histermination, to be followed by a more comprehensive posttermination hearing. Stressing that the preterminationhearing "should be an initial check against mistaken decisions--essentially, a determination of whether there are rea-sonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action," id., at545-546, we held that pretermination process need only include oral or written notice of the charges, an explanation ofthe employer's evidence, and an opportunity for the employee to tell his side of the story, id., at 546. In the courseof our assessment of the governmental interest in immediate
termination of a tenured employee, we observed that "inthose situations where the employer perceives a significant
hazard in keeping the employee on the job, it can avoid theproblem by suspending

with pay." Id., at 544-545 (empha-sis added; footnote omitted).

Relying on this dictum, which it read as "strongly suggest-[ing] that suspension without pay must be preceded by notice
and an opportunity to be heard in all instances," 89 F. 3d,at 1015 (emphasis added), and determining on its own that

520US3 Unit: $U69 [09-11-99 19:00:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
930 GILBERT v. HOMAR

Opinion of the Court
such a rule would be "eminently sensible," id., at 1016, theCourt of Appeals adopted a categorical prohibition: "[A] governmental employer may not suspend an employee withoutpay unless that suspension is preceded by some kind of presuspension hearing, providing the employee with notice and
an opportunity to be heard." Ibid. Respondent (as well asmost of his

amici) makes no attempt to defend this absolute
rule, which spans all types of government employment andall types of unpaid suspensions. Brief for Respondent 8, 12-

13. This is eminently wise, since under our precedents suchan absolute rule is indefensible.

It is by now well established that " `due process,' unlike
some legal rules, is not a technical conception with a fixed
content unrelated to time, place and circumstances." Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers v. McElroy, 367 U. S. 886, 895
(1961). "[D]ue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands."
Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, 481 (1972). This Court
has recognized, on many occasions, that where a State must
act quickly, or where it would be impractical to provide predeprivation process, postdeprivation process satisfies the
requirements of the Due Process Clause. See, e. g., United
States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 53
(1993); Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U. S. 113, 128 (1990) (collecting cases); Barry v. Barchi, 443 U. S. 55, 64-65 (1979); Dixon
v. Love, 431 U. S. 105, 115 (1977); North American Cold Storage Co. v. Chicago, 211 U. S. 306, 314-320 (1908). Indeed, in
Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U. S. 527 (1981), overruled in part on
other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327 (1986), we
specifically noted that "we have rejected the proposition that
[due process] always requires the State to provide a hearing
prior to the initial deprivation of property." 451 U. S., at
540. And in FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U. S. 230 (1988), where we
unanimously approved the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC's) suspension, without prior hearing, of an indicted private bank employee, we said: "An important gov520US3 Unit: $U69 [09-11-99 19:00:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
ernment interest, accompanied by a substantial assurancethat the deprivation is not baseless or unwarranted, may in

limited cases demanding prompt action justify postponingthe opportunity to be heard until after the initial deprivation." Id., at 240.*

The dictum in Loudermill relied upon by the Court of Ap-peals is of course not inconsistent with these precedents. To

say that when the government employer perceives a hazard
in leaving the employee on the job it "can avoid the problem
by suspending with pay" is not to say that that is the only
way of avoiding the problem. Whatever implication the
phrase "with pay" might have conveyed is far outweighed by
the clarity of our precedents which emphasize the flexibility
of due process as contrasted with the sweeping and categorical rule adopted by the Court of Appeals.

B
To determine what process is constitutionally due, we have
generally balanced three distinct factors:

"First, the private interest that will be affected by the
official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and
the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute pro*It is true, as respondent contends, that in Mallen we did not expressly
state whether the bank president's suspension was with or without pay.
But the opinion in Mallen recites no order from the FDIC, if it had authority to issue such an order, that the bank pay its president; only an order
that the bank suspend its president's participation in the bank's affairs.
Our opinion in Mallen certainly reflects the assumption that the suspension would be without pay. For example, in discussing the private interest at stake we considered "the severity of depriving someone of his or
her livelihood." 486 U. S., at 243 (citing cases). And, Mallen argued to
this Court that "denial of an income stream to underwrite these extraordinary expenses can be crucial, not only to Mallen's financial condition
in general, but to his ability to pay for his criminal defense." Brief for
Appellee in FDIC v. Mallen, O. T. 1987, No. 87-82, pp. 7-8.

cedural safeguards; and finally, the Government's inter-est." Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 335 (1976).

See also, e. g., Mallen, supra, at 242; Logan v. ZimmermanBrush Co., 455 U. S. 422, 434 (1982).

Respondent contends that he has a significant private in-terest in the uninterrupted receipt of his paycheck. But
while our opinions have recognized the severity of deprivingsomeone of the means of his livelihood, see, e. g., Mallen,
supra, at 243; Loudermill, 470 U. S., at 543, they have alsoemphasized that in determining what process is due, account
must be taken of "the length" and "finality of the depriva-tion,"

Logan, supra, at 434 (emphasis added). Unlike theemployee in Loudermill, who faced termination, respondent

faced only a temporary suspension without pay. So long asthe suspended employee receives a sufficiently prompt postsuspension hearing, the lost income is relatively insubstan-tial (compared with termination), and fringe benefits such as
health and life insurance are often not affected at all, Brieffor United States as

Amicus Curiae 18; Record, Doc. No.19, p. 7.

On the other side of the balance, the State has a significantinterest in immediately suspending, when felony charges are
filed against them, employees who occupy positions of greatpublic trust and high public visibility, such as police officers.
Respondent contends that this interest in maintaining publicconfidence could have been accommodated by suspending
him with pay until he had a hearing. We think, however,that the government does not have to give an employee
charged with a felony a paid leave at taxpayer expense. Ifhis services to the government are no longer useful once the
felony charge has been filed, the Constitution does not re-quire the government to bear the added expense of hiring a
replacement while still paying him. ESU's interest in pre-serving public confidence in its police force is at least as significant as the State's interest in preserving the integrity ofthe sport of horse racing, see Barry v. Barchi, supra, at 64,

Opinion of the Court
an interest we "deemed sufficiently important . . . to justifya brief period of suspension prior to affording the suspended

trainer a hearing," Mallen, 486 U. S., at 241.The last factor in the

Mathews balancing, and the factor
most important to resolution of this case, is the risk of erroneous deprivation and the likely value of any additional pro-cedures. Petitioners argue that any presuspension hearing

would have been worthless because pursuant to an Execu-tive Order of the Governor of Pennsylvania a state employee
is automatically to be suspended without pay "[a]s soon aspracticable after [being] formally charged with . . . a felony."
4 Pa. Code $ 7.173 (1997). According to petitioners, supervisors have no discretion under this rule, and the mandatory
suspension without pay lasts until the criminal charges are
finally resolved. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 20. If petitioners' interpretation of this order is correct, there is no need for any
presuspension process since there would be nothing to consider at the hearing except the independently verifiable fact
of whether an employee had indeed been formally charged
with a felony. See Codd v. Velger, 429 U. S. 624, 627-628
(1977) (per curiam). Cf. Loudermill, supra, at 543. Respondent, however, challenges petitioners' reading of the
Code, and contends that in any event an order of the Governor of Pennsylvania is a "mere directiv[e] which do[es] not
confer a legally enforceable right." Brief for Respondent
20. We need not resolve this disputed issue of state law
because even assuming the Code is only advisory (or has no
application at all), the State had no constitutional obligation
to provide respondent with a presuspension hearing. We
noted in Loudermill that the purpose of a pre-termination
hearing is to determine "whether there are reasonable
grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are
true and support the proposed action." 470 U. S., at 545-
546. By parity of reasoning, the purpose of any presuspension hearing would be to assure that there are reasonable grounds to support the suspension without pay.

520US3 Unit: $U69 [09-11-99 19:00:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN
934 GILBERT v. HOMAR

Opinion of the Court
Cf. Mallen, 486 U. S., at 240. But here that has alreadybeen assured by the arrest and the filing of charges.

In Mallen, we concluded that an "ex parte finding of proba-ble cause" such as a grand jury indictment provides adequate
assurance that the suspension is not unjustified. Id., at 240-
241. The same is true when an employee is arrested andthen formally charged with a felony. First, as with an indictment, the arrest and formal charges imposed upon re-spondent "by an independent body demonstrat[e] that the
suspension is not arbitrary." Id., at 244. Second, like anindictment, the imposition of felony charges "itself is an objective fact that will in most cases raise serious public concern." Id., at 244-245. It is true, as respondent argues,
that there is more reason to believe an employee has committed a felony when he is indicted rather than merely arrested and formally charged; but for present purposes arrest
and charge give reason enough. They serve to assure that
the state employer's decision to suspend the employee is not
"baseless or unwarranted," id., at 240, in that an independent
third party has determined that there is probable cause to
believe the employee committed a serious crime.

Respondent further contends that since (as we have
agreed to assume) Levanowitz had discretion not to suspend
despite the arrest and filing of charges, he had to be given
an opportunity to persuade Levanowitz of his innocence
before the decision was made. We disagree. In Mallen,
despite the fact that the FDIC had discretion whether to
suspend an indicted bank employee, see 64 Stat. 879, as
amended, 12 U. S. C. $ 1818(g)(1); Mallen, supra, at 234-235,
and n. 5, we nevertheless did not believe that a presuspension hearing was necessary to protect the private interest.
Unlike in the case of a termination, where we have recognized that "the only meaningful opportunity to invoke the
discretion of the decisionmaker is likely to be before the termination takes effect," Loudermill, supra, at 543, in the case
of a suspension there will be ample opportunity to invoke

520US3 Unit: $U69 [09-11-99 19:00:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

935Cite as: 520 U. S. 924 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
discretion later--and a short delay actually benefits the em-ployee by allowing state officials to obtain more accurate information about the arrest and charges. Respondent "hasan interest in seeing that a decision concerning his or her
continued suspension is not made with excessive haste."
Mallen, 486 U. S., at 243. If the State is forced to act tooquickly, the decisionmaker "may give greater weight to the

public interest and leave the suspension in place." Ibid.

C
Much of respondent's argument is dedicated to the proposi-tion that he had a due process right to a presuspension hearing because the suspension was open-ended and he "theoreti-cally may not have had the opportunity to be heard for
weeks, months, or even years after his initial suspensionwithout pay." Brief for Respondent 23. But, as respondent himself asserts in his attempt to downplay the govern-mental interest, "[b]ecause the employee is entitled, in any
event, to a prompt post-suspension opportunity to be heard,the period of the suspension should be short and the amount
of pay during the suspension minimal." Id., at 24-25.Whether respondent was provided an adequately prompt
post-suspension hearing in the present case is a separatequestion. Although the charges against respondent were
dropped on September 1 (petitioners apparently learned ofthis on September 2), he did not receive any sort of hearing
until September 18. Once the charges were dropped, therisk of erroneous deprivation increased substantially, and, as
petitioners conceded at oral argument, there was likely valuein holding a prompt hearing, Tr. of Oral Arg. 19. Cf.

Mallen, supra, at 243 (holding that 90 days before the agencyhears and decides the propriety of a suspension does not exceed the permissible limits where coupled with factors thatminimize the risk of an erroneous deprivation). Because
neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court ad-dressed whether, under the particular facts of this case, peti520US3 Unit: $U69 [09-11-99 19:00:36] PAGES PGT: OPIN

HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v. UNITED STATES

ex rel. SCHUMER

certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe ninth circuit

No. 95-1340. Argued February 25, 1997--Decided June 16, 1997
In 1989, respondent Schumer filed an action against petitioner Hughes

Aircraft Company under the qui tam provision of the False Claims Act
(FCA), which permits, in certain circumstances, suits by private parties
on behalf of the United States against anyone submitting a false claim
to the Government. Hughes' allegedly false claims were submitted between 1982 and 1984. Prior to 1986, qui tam suits were barred if the
information on which they were based was already in the Government's
possession. A 1986 amendment, however, permits qui tam suits based
on information in the Government's possession, except where the suit is
based on publicly disclosed information and was not brought by an original source of the information. Hughes moved to dismiss, contending,
inter alia, that the 1986 amendment was not retroactive, and that the
qui tam provision in effect when Hughes engaged in its allegedly wrongful conduct precluded the suit because it was based on information that
Hughes had already disclosed to the Government. The District Court
denied the motion, but ultimately granted Hughes summary judgment
on the merits. Schumer appealed that judgment, and Hughes crossappealed from the denial of the motion to dismiss. The Ninth Circuit
rejected the cross-appeal, holding that the 1986 amendment should be
applied retroactively to suits based on pre-1986 conduct because the
amendment involved only the courts' subject-matter jurisdiction to hear
qui tam claims and did not affect qui tam defendants' substantive liability. Finding, further, that the action was not barred under the 1986
amendment, the court reversed in part and remanded for further consideration on the merits.

Held: Because the 1986 amendment does not apply retroactively to qui

tam suits regarding allegedly false claims submitted prior to its enactment, this action should have been dismissed, as required by the pre1986 version of the FCA. Pp. 945-952.

(a) This Court applies the time-honored presumption against retroactive legislation unless Congress has clearly manifested its intent to the
contrary. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 268. Nothing in the 1986 amendment evidences a clear intent by Congress that
it be applied retroactively. Thus, under Landgraf's analysis, if the

amendment has a retroactive effect, then it will not apply to the conduct
alleged here, which occurred before its effective date. P. 946.

(b) Schumer's contention that the 1986 amendment lacks retroactive
effect is rejected. His argument that the amendment does not impose
new duties with respect to transactions already completed because it
has been unlawful to knowingly submit a false claim to the United
States since 1863 was made, and rejected, in Landgraf. 511 U. S., at
281-282. He is also mistaken in contending that the amendment does
not change the substance of the extant cause of action. By eliminating
a defense to a qui tam suit--prior disclosure to the Government--the
amendment attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or
considerations already past. Id., at 269. Nor is it the case that the
amendment does not create a new cause of action. As Schumer himself
recognizes, it extended an FCA cause to private parties in circumstances where the action was previously foreclosed. This extension is
not insignificant. Qui tam relators are motivated primarily by prospects of monetary reward rather than the public good and, thus, are less
likely than is the Government to forgo an action involving a technical
violation but no harm to the public fisc. The amendment essentially
creates a new cause of action, not just an increased likelihood that an
existing cause of action will be pursued. See, e. g., Winfree v. Northern
Pacific R. Co., 227 U. S. 296, 302. Before the amendment, Schumer's
action was completely barred because of Hughes' disclosure. The
amendment would revive that action, subjecting Hughes to previously
foreclosed qui tam litigation. Finally, Schumer errs in contending that
the amendment is jurisdictional and, hence, an exception to the general
Landgraf presumption against retroactivity. Statutes merely addressing where a suit may be brought may not meet the conditions for the
Landgraf presumption, for they regulate only the secondary conduct of
the litigation and not the underlying primary conduct of the parties.
However, the amendment speaks to the parties' substantive rights by
creating jurisdiction where none previously existed; it is therefore subject to the presumption against retroactivity. Pp. 946-952.

ex rel. SCHUMER

Opinion of the Court

that the 1986 amendment does not apply to this action andtherefore that this action should have been dismissed, as

required by the 1982 version of the Act.

I
In December 1981, the Northrop Corporation awardedpetitioner Hughes Aircraft Company a subcontract to design

and develop a radar system for the B-2 bomber, which Nor-throp was then constructing under contract with the Air
Force. Both Northrop's subcontract with Hughes and theAir Force's contract with Northrop were "cost-plus" contracts, which provided that the subcontractor and the con-tractor, respectively, were to be reimbursed for all costs
properly incurred plus a reasonable profit. Several monthsafter Hughes was awarded the B-2 subcontract, the
McDonnell-Douglas Corporation awarded Hughes a "fixed-price" subcontract to design and develop an upgraded radar
system for the F-15 fighter aircraft, which McDonnell-Douglas was then building for the Air Force. (Under the
fixed-price contract, Hughes was to receive a set price, re-gardless of costs.) When it became apparent to Hughes that
the projects overlapped in significant respects, Hughesadopted two internal "commonality agreements" allocating
between its F-15 and B-2 divisions various costs that werecommon to the two projects.

After costs in the B-2 program escalated, Northrop re-quested a Government audit of Hughes' accounting practices
to ascertain whether Hughes had improperly shifted costsfrom the fixed-price F-15 subcontract to the cost-plus B-2
subcontract. The Air Force initially concluded, in a June1986 preliminary classified audit report, that Hughes had improperly billed the B-2 program for certain developmentcosts that should have been charged solely to the F-15 program. Between October 1986 and September 1988, the De-fense Contract Audit Agency prepared a series of unclassified audit reports similarly concluding that Hughes had

Opinion of the Court
misallocated costs between the two programs, and also con-cluding that Hughes had not adequately disclosed the company's commonality accounting practices in a Cost Account-ing Standards report it had submitted to the Government
in 1984. Based on those audits, the Government directedNorthrop to withhold $15.4 million in B-2 contract payments
from Hughes.1On January 20, 1989, respondent William J. Schumer, formerly the Division Contracts Manager for Hughes' B-2 Divi-sion, commenced this action against Hughes pursuant to 31
U. S. C. $ 3730(b), the qui tam provision of the FCA that au-thorizes private individuals, "relators," to bring claims on
behalf of the United States against any person who know-ingly presented false or fraudulent claims to the United
States in violation of $ 3729. Schumer's complaint allegedthat Hughes knowingly mischarged Northrop--and through
it the United States--for certain radar development coststhat should have been allocated to the fixed-price F-15 subcontract with McDonnell-Douglas instead of to the cost-plusB-2 subcontract with Northrop. App. 72-80. Schumer's
amended complaint alleged that Hughes' accounting prac-tices resulted in a $50 million net overcharge, and sought
treble damages in the amount of $150 million. Id., at 102.2Hughes moved to dismiss Schumer's action, contending
that the 1986 FCA amendment was not retroactive and that

1 The Government ultimately reversed its preliminary determination,
concluding that the commonality agreements had actually benefited the
Government by charging costs to the fixed-price F-15 program that otherwise would have been borne solely by the cost-plus B-2 program. Accordingly, the Government withdrew its earlier finding of noncompliance,
determined that any noncompliance with accounting disclosure requirements was immaterial, and directed that Hughes be paid the $15.4 million
previously withheld on the B-2 project. App. 136-137; App. to Pet. for
Cert. 68a.

2 The Government chose not to intervene in the action, as it was entitled

to do under 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(2), nor did it move to dismiss the action,
as it was likewise entitled to do, see $ 3730(c)(2)(A).

Opinion of the Court

the qui tam provision in effect when Hughes engaged in itsallegedly wrongful conduct precluded qui tam suits based on

information already possessed by the Government. See 31U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(4) (1982 ed.). Hughes argued in the alternative that the suit was barred even under the 1986 versionof the Act because it was "based upon the public disclosure
of allegations . . . in a[n] . . . administrative . . . audit," withinthe meaning of 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(e)(4)(A).

3 The District

Court denied Hughes' motion.Hughes then moved for summary judgment on the merits,

contending that it had fully disclosed the basis of its costaccounting system to all of its customers and had complied
with all applicable contractual and regulatory requirementsrelating to cost allocation. After full briefing, the District
Court concluded that Hughes had allocated some costs be-tween the F-15 and B-2 programs consistent with disclosures Hughes made to Northrop, App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a,had allocated other costs to the fixed-price F-15 contract
that could have been charged to the cost-plus B-2 contractalone (thereby benefiting the Government), id., at 50a, and
had properly disclosed the contents of the commonalityagreements to Northrop and the Air Force,

id., at 46a-48a,56a. Accordingly, the District Court held that "Schumer has

not shown that Hughes violated the False Claims Act." Id.,at 64a.

Schumer appealed from the grant of summary judgmentagainst him, and Hughes cross-appealed from the denial of
its motion to dismiss. The Ninth Circuit rejected Hughes'cross-appeal, holding that the 1986 amendment removing
certain defenses to qui tam suits should be applied retroac-tively to suits based on pre-1986 conduct because the amendment involved only the "subject matter jurisdiction" of

3 Hughes also raised several constitutional challenges to the qui tam
provisions of the Act that are not presently before us. See 519 U. S. 926
(1996) (limiting grant of certiorari to the nonconstitutional questions presented by the petition).

Opinion of the Court
courts to hear qui tam claims and did not affect the substantive liability of qui tam defendants. 63 F. 3d 1512, 1517
(1995). The court further determined that the action was
not barred under the 1986 version of the Act because no
"public disclosure" of information possessed by the Government had been made. Id., at 1518. Finally, the court reversed in part and remanded for further consideration on the
merits, holding that a material factual dispute existed as to
whether Hughes had made misleading and incomplete disclosures about its commonality agreements, whether or not the
allegedly incomplete disclosures resulted in any harm to the
public fisc. Id., at 1522-1525.

We granted the petition for certiorari to consider whether
the 1986 amendment is applicable to pre-1986 conduct and, if
so, whether the Government's release of its audits to Hughes
employees constituted a public disclosure bar under the 1986
amendment and whether harm to the public fisc is an essential element of a qui tam action under the amended Act. 519
U. S. 926 (1996). Because we conclude that the lower courts
should not have applied the 1986 amendment and therefore
that this action should have been dismissed, we express no
opinion as to the Ninth Circuit's "public disclosure" and "public fisc" holdings, or as to the merits of respondent's factual
contentions.

II

The allegedly false claims at issue in this case were submitted by Hughes between 1982 and 1984. At that time, the
FCA required a district court to "dismiss [a qui tam] action
. . . based on evidence or information the Government had
when the action was brought." 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(4) (1982
ed.). The Ninth Circuit accepted, and respondent does not
dispute, that because "the government was aware of [respondent's] allegations before he filed his suit, the [1982
provision] would bar his claim," were it applicable. 63 F.
3d, at 1517.

946 HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v. UNITED STATES

ex rel. SCHUMER

Opinion of the Court

Congress amended the FCA in 1986, however, to permitqui tam suits based on information in the Government's possession, except where the suit was based on information thathad been publicly disclosed and was not brought by an original source of the information. See 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(e)(4)(A). Because the 1986 amendment became effective before
this suit was commenced, respondent contends that it, ratherthan the 1982

qui tam provision, controls. We disagree.We have frequently noted, and just recently reaffirmed,

that there is a "presumption against retroactive legislation[that] is deeply rooted in our jurisprudence." Landgraf v.
USI Film Products, 511 U. S. 244, 265 (1994). "The `princi-ple that the legal effect of conduct should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct tookplace has timeless and universal appeal.' "

Ibid. (quotingKaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U. S.

827, 855 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring)). Accordingly, weapply this time-honored presumption unless Congress has
clearly manifested its intent to the contrary. 511 U. S., at268.

Nothing in the 1986 amendment evidences a clear intentby Congress that it be applied retroactively, and no one
suggests otherwise. Thus, under the analysis the Courtadopted in

Landgraf, if the 1986 amendment has a retroac-tive effect, then we presume it will not apply to the conduct

alleged in this case, which occurred prior to its effectivedate.

4

Respondent argues that the 1986 amendment has no retro-active effect because it does not fit within Justice Story's

"influential definition" of impermissibly retroactive legisla-tion, which we quoted with approval in Landgraf:

4 Because both the allegedly false claim submission and the disclosure to
the Government of information about that submission occurred prior to
the effective date of the 1986 amendments, we need not address which
of these two events constitutes the relevant conduct for purposes of our
retroactivity analysis.

Opinion of the Court
" `[E]very statute, which takes away or impairs vestedrights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new

obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new dis-ability, in respect to transactions or considerations already past, must be deemed retrospective.' " 511 U. S.,at 269 (quoting

Society for Propagation of the Gospel v.Wheeler, 22 F. Cas. 756, 767 (No. 13,156) (CC NH 1814)

(Story, J.)).
To the extent respondent contends that only statutes withone of these effects are subject to our presumption against

retroactivity, he simply misreads our opinion in Landgraf.The language upon which he relies does not purport to define
the outer limit of impermissible retroactivity. Rather, ouropinion in

Landgraf, like that of Justice Story, merely de-scribed that any such effect constituted a sufficient, rather

than a necessary, condition for invoking the presumptionagainst retroactivity. Indeed, we recognized that the Court
has used various formulations to describe the "functionalconceptio[n] of legislative `retroactivity,' " and made no suggestion that Justice Story's formulation was the exclusivedefinition of presumptively impermissible retroactive legislation. 511 U. S., at 269.In any event, even applying Justice Story's formulation,
we reject respondent's contention that the 1986 amendmentlacks retroactive effect. Respondent first argues that the
1986 amendment does not " `impose new duties with respectto transactions already completed' " because, since 1863, "the
FCA has made it unlawful to knowingly submit a false claimfor payment to the United States." Brief for Respondent
15 (quoting Landgraf, supra, at 280). The same argumentwas made, and rejected, in

Landgraf. There, we noted thatthe provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 authorizing compensatory damages "does not make unlawful conduct thatwas lawful when it occurred," but we "[n]onetheless" held
that "the new compensatory damages provision would oper-ate `retrospectively' if it were applied to conduct occurring

before" its effective date. 511 U. S., at 281-282; see also
Rivers v. Roadway Express, Inc., 511 U. S. 298, 303 (1994)
(holding that an increase in monetary liability could not beapplied retroactively even though the "normative scope of

Title VII's prohibition on workplace discrimination" was
not altered).Respondent next contends that "the 1986 Amendments to

the qui tam bar do not create a new cause of action wherethere was none before, change the substance of the extant
cause of action, or alter a defendant's exposure for a falseclaim by even a single penny [and] thus d[o] not `increase a
party's liability for past conduct.' " Brief for Respondent 15
(quoting Landgraf, supra, at 280). See also Brief for United
States as Amicus Curiae 13-14. Again, respondent is mistaken. While we acknowledge that the monetary liability
faced by an FCA defendant is the same whether the action
is brought by the Government or by a qui tam relator, the
1986 amendment eliminates a defense to a qui tam suit--
prior disclosure to the Government--and therefore changes
the substance of the existing cause of action for qui tam
defendants by " `attach[ing] a new disability, in respect to
transactions or considerations already past.' " Landgraf,
supra, at 269 (quoting Wheeler, supra, at 767); see also Brief
for United States as Amicus Curiae 14, n. 6 ("[P]roof that
the government had the information when suit was brought
was . . . a jurisdictional defense to an action brought by a
qui tam relator" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U. S. 37, 49 (1990) ("A law that abolishes an affirmative defense" violates the Ex Post Facto
Clause); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167, 169-170 (1925) ("[A]ny
statute . . . which deprives one charged with crime of any
defense available according to law at the time when the act
was committed, is prohibited as ex post facto").

Nor is it the case that the 1986 amendment does not "create a new cause of action." As respondent himself recognizes, "as a result of the 1986 Amendments, the federal

Opinion of the Court
courts are open to an FCA action brought by a private rela-tor on behalf of the United States," whereas "[p]rior to 1986,

once the United States learned of a false claim, only the Gov-ernment could assert its rights under the FCA against the
false claimant." Brief for Respondent 16; see also Brief forUnited States as

Amicus Curiae 14 (recognizing that the1986 amendment "expanded the circumstances under which

qui tam relators may pursue actions to enforce" a falseclaimant's liability to the Government).

The extension of an FCA cause of action to private partiesin circumstances where the action was previously foreclosed
is not insignificant. As a class of plaintiffs, qui tam relatorsare different in kind than the Government. They are motivated primarily by prospects of monetary reward ratherthan the public good. As we have previously recognized:

" `[Qui tam statutes are] passed upon the theory, basedon experience as old as modern civilization, that one of
the least expensive and most effective means of prevent-ing frauds on the Treasury is to make the perpetrators
of them liable to actions by private persons acting, if youplease, under the strong stimulus of personal ill will or
the hope of gain. Prosecutions conducted by suchmeans compare with the ordinary methods as the enterprising privateer does to the slow-going public vessel.' "United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 541,
n. 5 (1943) (quoting United States v. Griswold, 24 F. 361,366 (Ore. 1885)).

Qui tam relators are thus less likely than is the Governmentto forgo an action arguably based on a mere technical noncompliance with reporting requirements that involved noharm to the public fisc.

5

5 That a qui tam suit is brought by a private party "on behalf of the
United States," see Brief for Respondent 17, does not alter the fact that
a relator's interests and the Government's do not necessarily coincide.
Moreover, as the statute specifies, qui tam actions are brought both

950 HUGHES AIRCRAFT CO. v. UNITED STATES

ex rel. SCHUMER

Opinion of the Court

In permitting actions by an expanded universe of plaintiffswith different incentives, the 1986 amendment essentially

creates a new cause of action, not just an increased likelihoodthat an existing cause of action will be pursued. See, e. g.,
Winfree v. Northern Pacific R. Co., 227 U. S. 296, 302 (1913).Prior to the 1986 amendment, respondent's

qui tam actionwas completely barred because of Hughes' disclosure to the

Government of information about its claim submissions.The 1986 amendment would revive that action, subjecting
Hughes to previously foreclosed qui tam litigation, much likeextending a statute of limitations after the pre-existing period of limitations has expired impermissibly revives a mori-bund cause of action, see,

e. g., Chenault v. U. S. Postal Serv-ice, 37 F. 3d 535, 537, 539 (CA9 1994) (relying on Landgraf

in concluding that "a newly enacted statute that lengthensthe applicable statute of limitations may not be applied retroactively to revive a plaintiff 's claim that was otherwisebarred under the old statutory scheme because to do so
would alter the substantive rights of a party and increase aparty's liability" (internal quotation marks omitted)). This
is true even if a cause of action remained open to some otherparty. It is simply not the case that, as respondent asserts,
the elimination of a prior defense to qui tam actions doesnot "create a new cause of action" or "change the substance
of the extant cause of action."Finally, respondent contends that the 1986 amendment is
jurisdictional, and hence that it is an exception to the generalLandgraf presumption against retroactivity. Indeed, the
Ninth Circuit went further, holding that, absent a clearstatement of congressional intent, there is a strong presumption in favor of retroactivity for jurisdictional statutes. 63F. 3d, at 1517. The Ninth Circuit simply misread our decision in Landgraf, for the only "presumption" mentioned inthat opinion is a general presumption

against retroactivity.

951Cite as: 520 U. S. 939 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
The fact that courts often apply newly enacted jurisdiction-allocating statutes to pending cases merely evidences certain

limited circumstances failing to meet the conditions for ourgenerally applicable presumption against retroactivity, not
an exception to the rule itself, as the United States recog-nizes. See Brief for United States as

Amicus Curiae 15,and n. 8. As we stated in Landgraf:

"Application of a new jurisdictional rule usually `takesaway no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.' Present law normally gov-erns in such situations because jurisdictional statutes
`speak to the power of the court rather than to the rightsor obligations of the parties.' " 511 U. S., at 274 (emphasis added; citations omitted).
Statutes merely addressing which court shall have jurisdic-tion to entertain a particular cause of action can fairly be

said merely to regulate the secondary conduct of litigationand not the underlying primary conduct of the parties. Cf.
id., at 275; id., at 291 (Scalia, J., concurring). Such statutesaffect only where a suit may be brought, not whether it may
be brought at all. The 1986 amendment, however, does notmerely allocate jurisdiction among forums. Rather, it creates jurisdiction where none previously existed; it thusspeaks not just to the power of a particular court but to the
substantive rights of the parties as well. Such a statute,even though phrased in "jurisdictional" terms, is as much
subject to our presumption against retroactivity as anyother.

III
In sum, whether we consider the relevant conduct to beHughes' disclosure to the Government or its submission of

the allegedly false claim, disclosure of information about theclaim to the Government constituted a full defense to a qui
tam action prior to 1986. If applied in this case, the legaleffect of the 1986 amendment would be to deprive Hughes of

Opinion of the Court

that defense. Given the absence of a clear statutory expres-sion of congressional intent to apply the 1986 amendment to

conduct completed before its enactment, we apply our pre-sumption against retroactivity and hold that, under the relevant 1982 version of the FCA, the District Court was obligedto dismiss this action because it was "based on evidence or
information the Government had when the action wasbrought." 31 U. S. C. $ 3730(b)(4) (1982 ed.). We therefore
vacate the judgment below, and remand the case for furtherproceedings consistent with this opinion.

It is so ordered.

ASSOCIATES COMMERCIAL CORP. v. RASH et ux.
certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fifth circuit

No. 96-454. Argued April 16, 1997--Decided June 16, 1997
Petitioner Associates Commercial Corporation (ACC) holds a loan and lien

on a tractor truck purchased by respondent Elray Rash for use in his
freight-hauling business. Elray and Jean Rash, also a respondent, filed
a joint petition and repayment plan under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy
Code (Code), listing ACC as a secured creditor. Under the Code, ACC's
claim for the $41,171 balance owed on the truck was secured only to the
extent of the value of the collateral; its claim over and above that value
was unsecured. See 11 U. S. C. $ 506(a). The Rashes could gain confirmation of their Chapter 13 plan only if ACC accepted it, if the Rashes
surrendered the truck to ACC, or if the Rashes invoked the so-called
"cram down" provision. See $ 1325(a)(5). The cram down option
allows the debtor to keep the collateral over the objection of the creditor; the creditor retains the lien securing the claim, see $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(i),
and the debtor is required to provide the creditor with payments, over
the life of the plan, that will total the present value of the collateral,
see $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). The value of the allowed secured claim is governed by $ 506(a) of the Code. The Rashes invoked the cram down
power, proposing to keep the truck for use in the freight-hauling business. ACC objected to the plan, sought to repossess the truck, and
disputed the value the Rashes had assigned to the truck. At an evidentiary hearing held to resolve the dispute, ACC maintained that the
proper valuation was the price the Rashes would have to pay to purchase a like vehicle (the replacement-value standard), estimated to be
$41,000. The Rashes, however, maintained that the proper valuation
was the net amount ACC would realize upon foreclosure and sale of the
collateral (the foreclosure-value standard), estimated to be $31,875.
The Bankruptcy Court adopted the Rashes' valuation figure and approved the plan. The District Court and the Fifth Circuit affirmed.

Held: Under $ 506(a), the value of property retained because the

debtor has exercised Chapter 13's "cram down" option is the cost the
debtor would incur to obtain a like asset for the same proposed use.
Pp. 960-965.

(a) The words "the creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such
property" contained in the first sentence of $ 506(a) do not call for the
foreclosure-value standard adopted by the Fifth Circuit. Even read in

Syllabus
isolation, the phrase imparts no valuation standard. The first sentence,
read as a whole, instructs that a secured creditor's claim is to be divided
into secured and unsecured portions. The sentence tells a court what
it must evaluate, but it is not enlightening on how to value collateral.
Section 506(a)'s second sentence, however, speaks to the how question,
providing that "[s]uch value shall be determined in light of the purpose
of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property."
By deriving a foreclosure-value standard from $ 506(a)'s first sentence,
the Fifth Circuit rendered inconsequential the sentence that expressly
addresses how "value shall be determined." The "proposed disposition
or use" of the collateral is of paramount importance to the valuation
question. Such "disposition or use" turns on which alternative the
debtor chooses when a secured creditor refuses to accept the debtor's
Chapter 13 plan--in one case the collateral will be surrendered to the
creditor, and in the other, the collateral will be retained and used by
the debtor. Applying a foreclosure-value standard attributes no significance to the different consequences of the debtor's choice. A
replacement-value standard, on the other hand, distinguishes retention
from surrender and renders meaningful the key statutory words "disposition or use." Surrender and retention are not equivalent acts. When
a debtor surrenders the property, a creditor obtains it immediately, and
is free to sell it and reinvest the proceeds. If a debtor keeps the property and continues to use it, the creditor obtains at once neither the
property nor its value, and is exposed to double risks against which the
Code affords incomplete protection: The debtor may again default and
the property may deteriorate from extended use. Of prime significance, the replacement-value standard accurately gauges the debtor's
"use" of the property. The debtor in this case elected to use the collateral to generate an income stream. That actual use, rather than a foreclosure sale that will not take place, is the proper guide under a prescription hinged to the property's "disposition or use." Pp. 960-963.

(b) The Fifth Circuit considered the replacement-value standard disrespectful of Texas law, which permits the secured creditor to sell the
collateral, thereby obtaining only its net foreclosure. In allowing Chapter 13 debtors to retain and use collateral over the objection of secured
creditors, however, the Bankruptcy Code has reshaped debtor and creditor rights in marked departure from state law. It no more disrupts
state law to make "disposition or use" the guide for valuation than
to authorize the rearrangement of rights the cram down power entails. There is also no warrant in the Code for a valuation standard
that uses the midpoint between foreclosure and replacement values.

the collateral to be determined by (1) what the secured credi-tor could obtain through foreclosure sale of the property (the

the replacement-value standard.

I
In 1989, respondent Elray Rash purchased for $73,700 aKenworth tractor truck for use in his freight-hauling business. Rash made a downpayment on the truck, agreed topay the seller the remainder in 60 monthly installments, and
pledged the truck as collateral on the unpaid balance. Theseller assigned the loan, and its lien on the truck, to petitioner Associates Commercial Corporation (ACC).In March 1992, Elray and Jean Rash filed a joint petition
and a repayment plan under Chapter 13 of the BankruptcyCode (Code), 11 U. S. C. $$ 1301-1330. At the time of the
bankruptcy filing, the balance owed to ACC on the truck loanwas $41,171. Because it held a valid lien on the truck, ACC
was listed in the bankruptcy petition as a creditor holding asecured claim. Under the Code, ACC's claim for the balance
owed on the truck was secured only to the extent of thevalue of the collateral; its claim over and above the value of
the truck was unsecured. See 11 U. S. C. $ 506(a).To qualify for confirmation under Chapter 13, the Rashes'
plan had to satisfy the requirements set forth in $ 1325(a) ofthe Code. The Rashes' treatment of ACC's secured claim,
in particular, is governed by subsection (a)(5).1 Under this

1 Section 1325(a)(5) states:
"(a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the court shall confirm a
plan if--. . . . .

"(5) with respect to each allowed secured claim provided for by the
plan--

"(A) the holder of such claim has accepted the plan;
"(B)(i) the plan provides that the holder of such claim retain the lien
securing such claim; and

"(ii) the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be
distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the
allowed amount of such claim; or

Opinion of the Court
provision, a plan's proposed treatment of secured claims can
be confirmed if one of three conditions is satisfied: The secured creditor accepts the plan, see 11 U. S. C. $ 1325(a)(5)
(A); the debtor surrenders the property securing the claim
to the creditor, see $ 1325(a)(5)(C); or the debtor invokes the
so-called "cram down" power, see $ 1325(a)(5)(B). Under the
cram down option, the debtor is permitted to keep the property over the objection of the creditor; the creditor retains
the lien securing the claim, see $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(i), and the
debtor is required to provide the creditor with payments,
over the life of the plan, that will total the present value
of the allowed secured claim, i. e., the present value of the
collateral, see $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii). The value of the allowed
secured claim is governed by $ 506(a) of the Code.

The Rashes' Chapter 13 plan invoked the cram down
power. It proposed that the Rashes retain the truck for use
in the freight-hauling business and pay ACC, over 58 months,
an amount equal to the present value of the truck. That
value, the Rashes' petition alleged, was $28,500. ACC objected to the plan and asked the Bankruptcy Court to lift
the automatic stay so ACC could repossess the truck. ACC
also filed a proof of claim alleging that its claim was fully
secured in the amount of $41,171. The Rashes filed an objection to ACC's claim.

The Bankruptcy Court held an evidentiary hearing to resolve the dispute over the truck's value. At the hearing,
ACC and the Rashes urged different valuation benchmarks.
ACC maintained that the proper valuation was the price the
Rashes would have to pay to purchase a like vehicle, an
amount ACC's expert estimated to be $41,000. The Rashes,
however, maintained that the proper valuation was the net
amount ACC would realize upon foreclosure and sale of the
collateral, an amount their expert estimated to be $31,875.

"(C) the debtor surrenders the property securing such claim to such
holder."

958 ASSOCIATES COMMERCIAL CORP. v. RASH

Opinion of the Court
The Bankruptcy Court agreed with the Rashes and fixed theamount of ACC's secured claim at $31,875; that sum, the

court found, was the net amount ACC would realize if it ex-ercised its right to repossess and sell the truck. See

In re
Rash, 149 B. R. 430, 431-432 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Tex. 1993).
The Bankruptcy Court thereafter approved the plan, and theUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of

Texas affirmed.A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. In re Rash, 31 F. 3d 325 (1994). On rehearing enbanc, however, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the District Court,
holding that ACC's allowed secured claim was limited to
$31,875, the net foreclosure value of the truck. In re Rash,
90 F. 3d 1036 (1996).

In reaching its decision, the Fifth Circuit highlighted, first,
a conflict it perceived between the method of valuation ACC
advanced, and the law of Texas defining the rights of secured
creditors. See id., at 1041-1042 (citing Tex. Bus. & Com.
Code Ann. $$ 9.504(a), (c), 9.505 (1991)). In the Fifth
Circuit's view, valuing collateral in a federal bankruptcy proceeding under a replacement-value standard--thereby setting an amount generally higher than what a secured creditor could realize pursuing its state-law foreclosure remedy--
would "chang[e] the extent to which ACC is secured from
what obtained under state law prior to the bankruptcy filing." 90 F. 3d, at 1041. Such a departure from state law,
the Fifth Circuit said, should be resisted by the federal
forum unless "clearly compel[led]" by the Code. Id., at
1042.

The Fifth Circuit then determined that the Code provision
governing valuation of security interests, $ 506(a), does not
compel a replacement-value approach. Instead, the court
reasoned, the first sentence of $ 506(a) requires that collateral be valued from the creditor's perspective. See id., at
1044. And because "the creditor's interest is in the nature
of a security interest, giving the creditor the right to repos520US3 Unit: $U72 [09-11-99 19:07:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

Opinion of the Court
sess and sell the collateral and nothing more[,] . . . the valu-ation should start with what the creditor could realize by

exercising that right." Ibid. This foreclosure-value stand-ard, the Fifth Circuit found, was consistent with the other
relevant provisions of the Code, economic analysis, and thelegislative history of the pertinent provisions. See

id., at1045-1059. Judge Smith, joined by five other judges, dissented, urging that the Code dictates a replacement-valuestandard. See id., at 1061-1075.

Courts of Appeals have adopted three different standardsfor valuing a security interest in a bankruptcy proceeding
when the debtor invokes the cram down power to retain thecollateral over the creditor's objection. In contrast to the
Fifth Circuit's foreclosure-value standard, a number of Cir-cuits have followed a replacement-value approach. See,
e. g., In re Taffi, 96 F. 3d 1190, 1191-1192 (CA9 1996) (enbanc), cert. pending

sub nom. Taffi v. United States, No. 96-881;
2 In re Winthrop Old Farm Nurseries, Inc., 50 F. 3d 72,

74-75 (CA1 1995); In re Trimble, 50 F. 3d 530, 531-532 (CA81995). Other courts have settled on the midpoint between

foreclosure value and replacement value. See In re Hos-kins, 102 F. 3d 311, 316 (CA7 1996); cf. In re Valenti, 105
F. 3d 55, 62 (CA2 1997) (bankruptcy courts have discretionto value at midpoint between replacement value and foreclosure value). We granted certiorari to resolve this conflictamong the Courts of Appeals, see 519 U. S. 1086 (1997), and
we now reverse the Fifth Circuit's judgment.

2 In In re Taffi, the Ninth Circuit contrasted replacement value with
fair-market value and adopted the latter standard, apparently viewing the
two standards as incompatible. See 96 F. 3d, at 1192. By using the term
"replacement value," we do not suggest that a creditor is entitled to recover what it would cost the debtor to purchase the collateral brand new.
Rather, our use of the term replacement value is consistent with the Ninth
Circuit's understanding of the meaning of fair-market value; by replacement value, we mean the price a willing buyer in the debtor's trade, business, or situation would pay a willing seller to obtain property of like age
and condition. See also infra, at 965, n. 6.

Opinion of the Court

II
The Code provision central to the resolution of this case is$ 506(a), which states:

"An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien onproperty in which the estate has an interest . . . is a
secured claim to the extent of the value of such credi-tor's interest in the estate's interest in such property,
. . . and is an unsecured claim to the extent that thevalue of such creditor's interest . . . is less than the
amount of such allowed claim. Such value shall be de-termined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of
the proposed disposition or use of such property . . . ."11 U. S. C. $ 506(a).

Over ACC's objection, the Rashes' repayment plan proposed,pursuant to $ 1325(a)(5)(B), continued use of the property in
question, i. e., the truck, in the debtor's trade or business.In such a "cram down" case, we hold, the value of the property (and thus the amount of the secured claim under$ 506(a)) is the price a willing buyer in the debtor's trade,
business, or situation would pay to obtain like property froma willing seller.

Rejecting this replacement-value standard, and selectinginstead the typically lower foreclosure-value standard, the
Fifth Circuit trained its attention on the first sentence of$ 506(a). In particular, the Fifth Circuit relied on these first
sentence words: A claim is secured "to the extent of thevalue of such

creditor's interest in the estate's interest insuch property." See 90 F. 3d, at 1044 (emphasis added) (citing $ 506(a)). The Fifth Circuit read this phrase to instructthat the "starting point for the valuation [is] what the creditor could realize if it sold the estate's interest in the propertyaccording to the security agreement," namely, through "repossess[ing] and sell[ing] the collateral." Ibid.We do not find in the $ 506(a) first sentence words--"the
creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property"--

520US3 Unit: $U72 [09-11-99 19:07:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN

961Cite as: 520 U. S. 953 (1997)
Opinion of the Court
the foreclosure-value meaning advanced by the Fifth Circuit.Even read in isolation, the phrase imparts no valuation

standard: A direction simply to consider the "value of suchcreditor's interest" does not expressly reveal

how that interest is to be valued.

Reading the first sentence of $ 506(a) as a whole, we aresatisfied that the phrase the Fifth Circuit considered key is

not an instruction to equate a "creditor's interest" with thenet value a creditor could realize through a foreclosure sale.
The first sentence, in its entirety, tells us that a secured cred-itor's claim is to be divided into secured and unsecured portions, with the secured portion of the claim limited to the
value of the collateral. See United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 238-239 (1989); 4 L. King, Collier on Bankruptcy || 506.02[1][a], p. 506-6 (15th ed. rev.
1996). To separate the secured from the unsecured portion
of a claim, a court must compare the creditor's claim to the
value of "such property," i. e., the collateral. That comparison is sometimes complicated. A debtor may own only a
part interest in the property pledged as collateral, in which
case the court will be required to ascertain the "estate's interest" in the collateral. Or, a creditor may hold a junior or
subordinate lien, which would require the court to ascertain
the creditor's interest in the collateral. The $ 506(a) phrase
referring to the "creditor's interest in the estate's interest in
such property" thus recognizes that a court may encounter,
and in such instances must evaluate, limited or partial interests in collateral. The full first sentence of $ 506(a), in short,
tells a court what it must evaluate, but it does not say more;
it is not enlightening on how to value collateral.

The second sentence of $ 506(a) does speak to the how
question. "Such value," that sentence provides, "shall be
determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of
the proposed disposition or use of such property." $ 506(a).
By deriving a foreclosure-value standard from $ 506(a)'s first
sentence, the Fifth Circuit rendered inconsequential the

520US3 Unit: $U72 [09-11-99 19:07:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
962 ASSOCIATES COMMERCIAL CORP. v. RASH

Opinion of the Court
sentence that expressly addresses how "value shall bedetermined."

As we comprehend $ 506(a), the "proposed disposition oruse" of the collateral is of paramount importance to the valuation question. If a secured creditor does not accept a debtor's Chapter 13 plan, the debtor has two options for handlingallowed secured claims: surrender the collateral to the creditor, see $ 1325(a)(5)(C); or, under the cram down option, keepthe collateral over the creditor's objection and provide the
creditor, over the life of the plan, with the equivalent of thepresent value of the collateral, see $ 1325(a)(5)(B). The
"disposition or use" of the collateral thus turns on the alternative the debtor chooses--in one case the collateral will
be surrendered to the creditor, and in the other, the collateral will be retained and used by the debtor. Applying a
foreclosure-value standard when the cram down option is
invoked attributes no significance to the different consequences of the debtor's choice to surrender the property or
retain it. A replacement-value standard, on the other hand,
distinguishes retention from surrender and renders meaningful the key words "disposition or use."

Tying valuation to the actual "disposition or use" of the
property points away from a foreclosure-value standard
when a Chapter 13 debtor, invoking cram down power, retains and uses the property. Under that option, foreclosure
is averted by the debtor's choice and over the creditor's objection. From the creditor's perspective as well as the debtor's, surrender and retention are not equivalent acts.

When a debtor surrenders the property, a creditor obtains
it immediately, and is free to sell it and reinvest the proceeds.
We recall here that ACC sought that very advantage. See
supra, at 957. If a debtor keeps the property and continues
to use it, the creditor obtains at once neither the property
nor its value and is exposed to double risks: The debtor may
again default and the property may deteriorate from extended use. Adjustments in the interest rate and secured

Opinion of the Court
creditor demands for more "adequate protection," 11 U. S. C.$ 361, do not fully offset these risks. See 90 F. 3d, at 1066

(Smith, J., dissenting) ("vast majority of reorganizations fail. . . leaving creditors with only a fraction of the compensation
due them"; where, as here, "collateral depreciates rapidly,
the secured creditor may receive far less in a failed reorgani-zation than in a prompt foreclosure" (internal cross-reference

omitted)); accord, In re Taffi, 96 F. 3d, at 1192-1193.3Of prime significance, the replacement-value standard accurately gauges the debtor's "use" of the property. It val-ues "the creditor's interest in the collateral in light of the
proposed [repayment plan] reality: no foreclosure sale andeconomic benefit for the debtor derived from the collateral
equal to . . . its [replacement] value." In re Winthrop Old
Farm Nurseries, 50 F. 3d, at 75. The debtor in this case
elected to use the collateral to generate an income stream.
That actual use, rather than a foreclosure sale that will not
take place, is the proper guide under a prescription hinged
to the property's "disposition or use." See ibid.4

3 On this matter, amici curiae supporting ACC contended: " `Adequate
protection' payments under 11 U. S. C. $$ 361, 362(d)(1) typically are based
on the assumption that the collateral will be subject to only ordinary depreciation. Hence, even when such payments are made, they frequently
fail to compensate adequately for the usually more rapid depreciation of
assets retained by the debtor." Brief for American Automobile Manufacturers Association, Inc., et al. as Amici Curiae 21, n. 9.

4 We give no weight to the legislative history of $ 506(a), noting that

it is unedifying, offering snippets that might support either standard of
valuation. The Senate Report simply repeated the phrase contained in
the second sentence of $ 506(a). See S. Rep. No. 95-989, p. 68 (1978). The
House Report, in the Fifth Circuit's view, rejected a " `replacement cost' "
valuation. See In re Rash, 90 F. 3d 1036, 1056 (CA5 1996) (quoting
H. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 124 (1977)). That Report, however, appears to use
the term "replacement cost" to mean the cost of buying new property to
replace property in which a creditor had a security interest. See ibid.
In any event, House Report excerpts are not enlightening, for the provision pivotal here--the second sentence of $ 506(a)--did not appear in the
bill addressed by the House Report. The key sentence originated in the

520US3 Unit: $U72 [09-11-99 19:07:54] PAGES PGT: OPIN
964 ASSOCIATES COMMERCIAL CORP. v. RASH

Opinion of the Court
The Fifth Circuit considered the replacement-value stand-ard disrespectful of state law, which permits the secured

creditor to sell the collateral, thereby obtaining its net fore-closure value "and nothing more." See 90 F. 3d, at 1044.
In allowing Chapter 13 debtors to retain and use collateralover the objection of secured creditors, however, the Code
has reshaped debtor and creditor rights in marked departurefrom state law. See,

e. g., Uniform Commercial Code $$ 9-504, 9-505, 3B U. L. A. 127, 352 (1992). The Code's cram

down option displaces a secured creditor's state-law right toobtain immediate foreclosure upon a debtor's default. That
change, ordered by federal law, is attended by a directionthat courts look to the "proposed disposition or use" of the
collateral in determining its value. It no more disruptsstate law to make "disposition or use" the guide for valuation
than to authorize the rearrangement of rights the cram downpower entails.

Nor are we persuaded that the split-the-difference ap-proach adopted by the Seventh Circuit provides the appropriate solution. See In re Hoskins, 102 F. 3d, at 316.Whatever the attractiveness of a standard that picks the
midpoint between foreclosure and replacement values, thereis no warrant for it in the Code.

5 Section 506(a) calls for the

value the property possesses in light of the "disposition oruse" in fact "proposed," not the various dispositions or uses

that might have been proposed. Cf. BFP v. Resolution
Trust Corporation, 511 U. S. 531, 540 (1994) (court-made ruledefining, for purposes of Code's fraudulent transfer proviSenate version of the bill, compare H. R. 8200, 95th Cong., 1st Sess.,

$ 506(a) (1977), with S. 2266, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., $ 506(a) (1977), and was
included in the final text of the statute after the House-Senate conference,
see 124 Cong. Rec. 33997 (1978).

5 As our reading of $ 506(a) makes plain, we also reject a ruleless approach allowing use of different valuation standards based on the facts
and circumstances of individual cases. Cf. In re Valenti, 105 F. 3d 55,
62-63 (CA2 1997) (permissible for bankruptcy courts to determine valuation standard case-by-case).

Opinion of the Court
sion, "reasonably equivalent value" to mean 70% of fair mar-ket value "represent[s] [a] policy determinatio[n] that the

Bankruptcy Code gives us no apparent authority to make").The Seventh Circuit rested on the "economics of the situation," In re Hoskins, 102 F. 3d, at 316, only after concludingthat the statute suggests no particular valuation method.
We agree with the Seventh Circuit that "a simple rule ofvaluation is needed" to serve the interests of predictability
and uniformity. Id., at 314. We conclude, however, that$ 506(a) supplies a governing instruction less complex than
the Seventh Circuit's "make two valuations, then split thedifference" formulation.

In sum, under $ 506(a), the value of property retained be-cause the debtor has exercised the $ 1325(a)(5)(B) "cram
down" option is the cost the debtor would incur to obtain alike asset for the same "proposed . . . use."

6

* * *
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court ofAppeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further

proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.

6 Our recognition that the replacement-value standard, not the
foreclosure-value standard, governs in cram down cases leaves to bankruptcy courts, as triers of fact, identification of the best way of ascertaining replacement value on the basis of the evidence presented. Whether
replacement value is the equivalent of retail value, wholesale value, or
some other value will depend on the type of debtor and the nature of the
property. We note, however, that replacement value, in this context,
should not include certain items. For example, where the proper measure
of the replacement value of a vehicle is its retail value, an adjustment to
that value may be necessary: A creditor should not receive portions of the
retail price, if any, that reflect the value of items the debtor does not
receive when he retains his vehicle, items such as warranties, inventory
storage, and reconditioning. Cf. 90 F. 3d, at 1051-1052. Nor should the
creditor gain from modifications to the property--e. g., the addition of accessories to a vehicle--to which a creditor's lien would not extend under
state law.

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, dissenting.
Although the meaning of 11 U. S. C. $ 506(a) is not entirelyclear, I think its text points to foreclosure as the proper

method of valuation in this case. The first sentence in$ 506(a) tells courts to determine the value of the "

creditor'sinterest in the estate's interest" in the property. 11 U. S. C.

$ 506(a) (emphasis added). This language suggests that thevalue should be determined from the creditor's perspective,
i. e., what the collateral is worth, on the open market, in thecreditor's hands, rather than in the hands of another party.

The second sentence explains that "[s]uch value shall bedetermined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of
the proposed disposition or use of such property." Ibid. Inthis context, the "purpose of the valuation" is determined by
11 U. S. C. $ 1325(a)(5)(B). Commonly known as the Bank-ruptcy Code's "cram down" provision, this section authorizes
the debtor to keep secured property over the creditor's ob-jections in a Chapter 13 reorganization, but, if he elects to
do so, directs the debtor to pay the creditor the "value" ofthe secured claim. The "purpose" of this provision, and
hence of the valuation under $ 506(a), is to put the creditor
in the same shoes as if he were able to exercise his lien andforeclose.*

*The Court states that "surrender and retention are not equivalent
acts" from the creditor's perspective because he does not receive the property and is exposed to the risk of default and deterioration. Ante, at 962.
I disagree. That the creditor does not receive the property is irrelevant
because, as $ 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) directs, he receives the present value of his
security interest. Present value includes both the underlying value and
the time value of that interest. The time-value component similarly vitiates the risk concern. Higher risk uses of money must pay a higher premium to offset the same opportunity cost. In this case, for instance, the
creditor was receiving nine percent interest, see In re Rash, 90 F. 3d 1036,

It is crucial to keep in mind that $ 506(a) is a provision thatapplies throughout the various chapters of the Bankruptcy

Code; it is, in other words, a "utility" provision that operatesin many different contexts. Even if the words "proposed
disposition or use" did not gain special meaning in the cramdown context, this would not render them surplusage because they have operational significance in their many otherCode applications. In this context, I also think the foreclosure standard best comports with economic reality. Allow-ing any more than the foreclosure value simply grants a
general windfall to undersecured creditors at the expenseof unsecured creditors. Cf.

In re Hoskins, 102 F. 3d 311,320 (CA7 1996) (Easterbrook, J., concurring in judgment).

MAZUREK, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MONTANA v.ARMSTRONG

et al.

on petition for writ of certiorari to the unitedstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit

No. 96-1104. Decided June 16, 1997
Respondents, licensed physicians and a physician assistant practicing in

Montana, challenged a state law restricting the performance of abortions to licensed physicians. In denying their motion for preliminary
injunction, the Federal District Court found that they had not established any likelihood of prevailing on their claim that the law imposed
an undue burden under Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833. The Ninth Circuit vacated the judgment, holding
that respondents had met the Circuit's threshold requirement for a preliminary injunction by showing a fair chance of success on the merits.
On remand, the District Court entered an injunction pending appeal
and postponed hearing the merits of the preliminary injunction motion
pending the disposition of petitioner's certiorari petition. As a consequence, the physician-only requirement is unenforceable at the present
time against the only nonphysician licensed to perform abortions in
Montana.

Held: The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. Since the

physician-only requirement at issue in Casey did not pose a "substantial
obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion," it was not an undue burden
on the right to abortion. 505 U. S., at 884-885. This precise passage
was quoted by the District Court when it concluded that there was
insufficient evidence to find a substantial obstacle in Montana. The
Ninth Circuit never contested that conclusion, finding instead that the
law's purpose made it arguably invalid. However, there is no evidence
of a vitiating legislative purpose here. The Court of Appeals' decision
is also contradicted by this Court's repeated statements that the performance of abortions may be restricted to physicians. See, e. g., Roe
v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 165. Since the Ninth Circuit's decision is clearly
erroneous under this Court's precedents, and since its judgment has
produced immediate consequences for Montana--in the form of an injunction against the law's implementation--and has raised a real threat
of such consequences for the six other States in the Circuit that have
physician-only requirements, summary reversal is appropriate.

Certiorari granted; 94 F. 3d 566, reversed and remanded.

The District Court has not yet reconsidered the merits ofthe preliminary injunction motion, but it has entered (based

on the parties' stipulations) an injunction pending appealpursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(c), and has
postponed its hearing on the preliminary injunction motion
until our disposition of petitioner's certiorari petition.Order Granting Injunction Pending Appeal, No. CV 95-083-

GF-PGH (Mont., Nov. 5, 1996), App. to Pet. for Cert. 31a-32a. As a consequence, Montana's physician-only requirement is unenforceable at the present time against respondentSusan Cahill, who is the only nonphysician licensed to perform abortions in Montana.

The Court of Appeals' conclusion that respondents had established a "fair chance of success on the merits" of their
constitutional challenge is inconsistent with our treatment
of the physician-only requirement at issue in Casey. That
requirement involved only the provision of information to
patients, and not the actual performance of abortions, yet
we nonetheless held--overruling our prior holding in Akron
v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416,
448 (1983)--that the limitation to physicians was valid.
Casey, supra, at 884-885. We found that "[s]ince there is no
evidence on this record that requiring a doctor to give the
information as provided by the statute would amount in
practical terms to a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking
an abortion, . . . it is not an undue burden." 505 U. S., at
884-885 (emphasis added). The District Court, quoting this
precise passage, held: "There exists insufficient evidence in
the record to support the conclusion [that] the requirement
that a licensed physician perform an abortion would amount,
`in practical terms, to a substantial obstacle to a woman
seeking an abortion.' Accordingly, it is unlikely that [respondents] will prevail upon their suggestion that the requirement constitutes an `undue burden' within the meaning
of Casey." 906 F. Supp., at 567 (quoting Casey, supra, at 884
(emphasis added)).

Per Curiam
The Court of Appeals never contested this District Court
conclusion that there was "insufficient evidence" in the record that the requirement posed a " `substantial obstacle to
a woman seeking an abortion.' " Instead, it held that the
physician-only requirement was arguably invalid because its
purpose, according to the Court of Appeals, may have been
to create a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions.
94 F. 3d, at 567. But even assuming the correctness of the
Court of Appeals' implicit premise--that a legislative purpose to interfere with the constitutionally protected right to
abortion without the effect of interfering with that right
(here it is uncontested that there was insufficient evidence
of a "substantial obstacle" to abortion) could render the Montana law invalid--there is no basis for finding a vitiating legislative purpose here. We do not assume unconstitutional
legislative intent even when statutes produce harmful results, see, e. g., Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 246
(1976); much less do we assume it when the results are harmless. One searches the Court of Appeals' opinion in vain for
any mention of any evidence suggesting an unlawful motive
on the part of the Montana Legislature. If the motion at
issue here were a defendant's motion for summary judgment,
and if the plaintiff 's only basis for proceeding with the suit
were a claim of improper legislative purpose, one would demand some evidence of that improper purpose in order to
avoid a nonsuit. And what is at issue here is not even a
defendant's motion for summary judgment, but a plaintiff 's
motion for preliminary injunctive relief, as to which the
requirement for substantial proof is much higher. "It
frequently is observed that a preliminary injunction is an
extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not
be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries
the burden of persuasion." 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &
M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 2948, pp. 129-130

Respondents claim in this Court that the Montana lawmust have had an invalid purpose because "all health evidence contradicts the claim that there is any health basis"for the law. Brief in Opposition 7. Respondents contend
that "the only extant study comparing the complication rates
for first-trimester abortions performed by [physician-assistants] with those for first-trimester abortions performed

by physicians found no significant difference." Ibid. Butthis line of argument is squarely foreclosed by

Casey itself.
In the course of upholding the physician-only requirement atissue in that case, we emphasized that "[o]ur cases reflect the

fact that the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to
decide that particular functions may be performed only by
licensed professionals, even if an objective assessment might
suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others."
505 U. S., at 885 (emphasis added). Respondents fall back
on the fact that an antiabortion group drafted the Montana
law. But that says nothing significant about the legislature's purpose in passing it.

Today's dissent, for its part, claims that "there is substantial evidence indicating that the sole purpose of the statute
was to target a particular licensed professional" (respondent
Susan Cahill). Post, at 979-980. It is true that the law
"targeted" Cahill in the sense that she was the only nonphysician performing abortions at the time it was passed. But
it is difficult to see how that helps rather than harms respondents' case. The dissent does not claim that this was
an unconstitutional bill of attainder, nor was that the basis
on which the Court of Appeals relied. (Such a contention
would be implausible as applied to a provision so commonplace as to exist in 40 other States, see n. 1, supra.) And
the basis on which the Court of Appeals did rely (that the
purpose of the law may have been to create a "substantial
obstacle" to abortion) is positively contradicted by the fact
that only a single practitioner is affected. That is especially
so since under the old scheme Cahill could only perform

abortions with a licensed physician (who also performs abor-tions) present, see Brief in Opposition 4, meaning that no

woman seeking an abortion would be required by the newlaw to travel to a different facility than was previously available. All this strongly supports the District Court's finding,after hearing testimony, that there was insufficient evidence
that the law created a "substantial obstacle" to abortion.And there is simply no evidence that the legislature intended
the law to do what it plainly did not do.2The Court of Appeals' decision is also contradicted by our
repeated statements in past cases--none of which was somuch as cited by the Court of Appeals, despite the District
Court's discussion of two of them--that the performance ofabortions may be restricted to physicians. We first expressed this view (although it was not necessary to our hold-ing) in

Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 165 (1973), saying that"[t]he State may define the term `physician,' . . . to mean only

a physician currently licensed by the State, and may pro-scribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician as so
defined." We reiterated this view in Connecticut v. Menillo, 423 U. S. 9, 11 (1975) (per curiam), where, in the courseof holding that the Federal Constitution posed no bar to the

conviction of a person with no medical training for the per-formance of an abortion, we said that "prosecutions for abortions conducted by nonphysicians infringe upon no realm ofpersonal privacy secured by the Constitution against state
interference." Finally, in Akron, in the course of strikingdown a requirement that licensed physicians rather than
other medical personnel provide specified information to pa-tients (the holding overruled in

Casey), we emphasized thatour prior cases "left no doubt that, to ensure the safety of

2 Since the record does not support a conclusion that "the legislature's
predominant motive," post, at 980, was to create a "substantial obstacle" to
abortion, it is quite unnecessary to address "whether the Court of Appeals

and Shaw," post, at 981.

the abortion procedure, the States may mandate that onlyphysicians perform abortions." 462 U. S., at 447 (citing Roe,

supra, at 165, and Menillo, supra, at 11).Respondents urge us to ignore the error in the Court of
Appeals' judgment because the case comes to us prior to theentry of a final judgment in the lower courts. It is true
that we are ordinarily reluctant to exercise our certiorarijurisdiction in that circumstance. See,

e. g., Hamilton-Brown Shoe Co. v. Wolf Brothers & Co., 240 U. S. 251, 258

(1916). But our cases make clear that there is no absolutebar to review of nonfinal judgments of the lower federal
courts, see, e. g., Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U. S. 97, 98 (1976);
United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U. S. 373, 377(1945); see also R. Stern, E. Gressman, S. Shapiro, & K. Geller, Supreme Court Practice $ 4.18 (7th ed. 1993) (citingcases), and we conclude here that reversal of the Court of
Appeals' judgment in a summary disposition is appropriate,for two reasons. First, as already noted, the Court of Appeals' decision is clearly erroneous under our precedents.3Second, the lower court's judgment has produced immediate
consequences for Montana--in the form of a Rule 62(c) in-junction against implementation of its law pending the District Court's resolution of respondents' motion for a prelimi-nary injunction--and has created a real threat of such
consequences for the six other States in the Ninth Circuitthat have physician-only requirements.

3 The dissent says that the Court of Appeals did not resolve any important issue of law in this case, but instead merely remanded to the District
Court after "determin[ing] that a further inquiry into the facts [was] appropriate." Post, at 981. We disagree. The Court of Appeals expressly
found, and it was necessary to its disposition, that respondents had shown
a "fair chance of success" on their claim of undue burden. 94 F. 3d 566,
567-568 (CA9 1996). As already explained, that determination of law is
inconsistent with our precedents.

in the Ninth Circuit seeking to challenge those States' laws
may well be able to meet the threshold "fair chance of success" requirement for a preliminary injunction merely by alleging an improper purpose for the physician-only rule, since,
as noted above, the Court of Appeals did not appear to rely
on any evidence suggesting an unlawful motive on the part
of the Montana Legislature.5

For the foregoing reasons, we grant the petition for certiorari, reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.

It is so ordered.

5 The dissent contends that some States which restrict the performance

of abortions to licensed physicians may define "licensed physician" to include "physician-assistant" when the latter works under the former's supervision; thus, the dissent says, the Court of Appeals' decision may not
in fact be inconsistent with the physician-only regimes of other States.
Post, at 980-981. But the provisions of state law to which the dissent
points reflect the general definition of what qualifies as the "authorized
practice" of medicine, without making any specific reference to abortion.
See, e. g., Fla. Stat. $$ 458.303(1)(a), 458.327(1), 458.347 (1991 and Supp.
1997); post, at 980-981, n. 7 (citing statutes). Thus, for example, under
Florida law, the performance of an abortion by a physician-assistant would
not constitute "practic[ing] medicine . . . without a license" for purposes
of the felony defined in Fla. Stat. Ann. $ 458.327(1) (Supp. 1997), but there
is no reason to think it would not violate the more specific prohibition on
the performance of abortions by persons other than "a doctor of medicine
or osteopathic medicine licensed by the state under chapter 458 or chapter
459," Fla. Stat. $$ 390.001(1)(a), 390.001(3) (1993). A formal opinion by
the Attorney General of California has reached precisely this conclusion
under that State's law: "[W]e cannot accept the notion that the Legislature
meant to gainsay th[e] carefully tailored and highly specific determination
[that abortions should be performed by licensed physicians] when it . . .
adopted the general language of the Physician Assistant Practice Act."

Stevens, J., dissenting
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and
Justice Breyer join, dissenting.

The Court may ultimately prove to be correct in its conclusion that the Court of Appeals should have affirmed the District Court's refusal to preliminarily enjoin that portion of
the statute disqualifying Susan Cahill from performing abortions in Montana. Nevertheless, I do not agree that this
decision has sufficient importance to justify review of the
merits at this preliminary stage of the proceeding. The
background of the litigation and a comment on the Court of
Appeals' discussion of legislative motive will help to explain
why I am not persuaded that the Court's summary disposition is appropriate.

Since 1977, respondent Cahill, a licensed physician's assistant, has been performing first-trimester abortions in
Kalispell, Montana, under the supervision of Dr. James
Armstrong. She is the only nonphysician in Montana who
performs abortions.

Since 1974, Montana law has provided that an abortion
could be performed only by a licensed physician. See Mont.
Code Ann. $ 50-20-109(1)(a) (1995). Because the term "licensed physician," as used in that statute, was construed to
include licensed physician assistants working under the direct supervision of a physician pursuant to a state approved
plan,1 it did not disqualify Cahill from continuing her work
with Dr. Armstrong.

Pet. for Cert. 33a (enjoining State from enforcing the licensed physician
provision against a physician assistant, supervised by a licensed physician,
who has received approval from the State Board of Medical Examiners to
conduct abortions); see also Mont. Code Ann. $ 37-20-403 (1993) (recognizing physician assistant as agent of the supervising physician); id., $ 37-20-

Stevens, J., dissenting
In 1995, the Montana Legislature enacted the statute atissue in this litigation. This statute banned physician assistants from performing abortions, provided that second-trimester abortions could only be performed in licensed
hospitals, and prohibited any form of advertising of abor-tion services. See 1995 Mont. Laws, ch. 321. The record
strongly indicates that the physician assistant provision wasaimed at excluding one specific person--respondent Cahill--
from the category of persons who could perform abortions.Although this is not apparent on the face of the statute, the
parties agree that because Cahill is the only physician assist-ant who performs abortions in the State of Montana, she
is the only person affected by the ban. Furthermore, thelegislative hearings preceding the enactment of the statute
contain numerous references to Cahill by name,2 and the in-junction against enforcement of this provision of the statute
pending the appeal applies only to Cahill.3The likelihood that the legislature may have enacted the
statute for the sole purpose of targeting Cahill is suggestedby the fact that the other two provisions in the 1995 Act--
the hospitalization requirement and the advertising ban--were clearly invalid because they were reenactments of two
provisions that already had been held unconstitutional in
Board of Medical Examiners construed its authority to include approval
of Cahill's utilization plan allowing her to perform first-trimester
abortions).

2 See Minutes of Committee on Public Health, Welfare & Safety, Montana Senate, 54th Legislature (Mar. 10, 1995), reprinted in App. to Pet. for
Cert. 50a-60a.

3 "1. The injunction shall apply only to Plaintiff Susan Cahill and will

allow her to practice under those terms in effect prior to October 1, 1995.
Plaintiff Cahill must be supervised by a licensed physician and shall operate under the physician assistant-certified utilization plan previously approved by the Montana State Board of Medical Examiners that includes
the performance of abortions pursuant to the provisions of Mont. Code
Ann. Title 37, chapter 20. No other physician assistants-certified will be
allowed to perform abortions in Montana under the terms of this stipulation or the Court's order." App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a.

earlier litigation,4 and that the State, in this litigation, con-ceded to be unconstitutional.

5 This history, together with

Cahill's claim that the same antiabortion groups who had re-peatedly targeted Cahill and Armstrong's practice were the

proponents of the 1995 legislation, provided the basis for Ca-hill's argument that the statute was invalid as a bill of attainder, as well as an undue burden on the right to an abortion.The discussion of legislative motive in the opinion of the
Court of Appeals was a response to two decisions of thisCourt that suggest that such an inquiry is sometimes proper.
In determining whether the "requirements serve no purposeother than to make abortions more difficult," within the
meaning of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 901 (1992), the Court of Appeals looked
to our recent decisions in Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900(1995), and Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899 (1996).

6 Today, the

Court ignores those cases, but concludes that the record isbarren of evidence of any improper motive. As the discussion above indicates, this is not quite accurate; there is sub-stantial evidence indicating that the sole purpose of the stat4 In Doe v. Esch, supra, the court enjoined enforcement of the hospitalization requirement, and in Doe v. Deschamps, 461 F. Supp. 682 (Mont.
1976), the court held that the advertising and solicitation prohibition
were unconstitutional.

5 Respondents challenged these two provisions--along with the ban on

performance of abortions by physician assistants, and the State did not
contest that it was bound by the prior judgments from enforcing these
prohibitions. See 906 F. Supp., at 563.

6 The Court of Appeals reasoned: "Legislative purpose to accomplish a

constitutionally forbidden result may be found when that purpose was `the
predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision.' Miller[, 515
U. S., at 916]. Such a forbidden purpose may be gleaned both from the
structure of the legislation and from examination of the process that led
to its enactment. Shaw[, 517 U. S., at 905-907]. A determination of purpose in the present case, then, may properly require an assessment of the
totality of circumstances surrounding the enactment of Chapter 321, and
whether that statute in fact can be regarded as serving a legitimate health
function." 94 F. 3d 566, 567 (CA9 1996).

ute was to target a particular licensed professional. Thestatute removed the only physician assistant in the State

who could perform abortions, yet there was no evidence thather practice posed any greater health risks than those performed by doctors with the assistance of unlicensed person-nel. When one looks at the totality of circumstances surrounding the legislation, there is evidence from which onecould conclude that the legislature's predominant motive
was to make abortions more difficult.In any event, the Court of Appeals did not reach the constitutional issue that is presented by this litigation. TheCourt of Appeals simply remanded this action to the District
Court because it found that the District Court had undulyconfined its analysis of what constitutes an impermissible
purpose. Although the parties stipulated to the entry of alimited injunction pending appeal that temporarily protects
Cahill and no one else, there is no indication yet from eitherthe District Court or the Court of Appeals that either a
permanent or preliminary injunction will ever be enteredagainst enforcement of the physician-only provision of the
statute.As I read the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the
District Court, this case involves an extremely narrow issueconcerning the State's power to reduce by one the small
number of professionals in Montana who can lawfully per-form abortions in that State. I do not perceive the slightest
threat to the 40 "physician only" laws cited at the outset ofthe Court's opinion, particularly since some of these States
might allow licensed assistants to perform abortions underthe supervision of a physician as was the practice in Montana
prior to 1995.7 Because physician assistants working under

7 Some of the States that have physician-only laws also have statutes
that broadly define the medical duties that physicians can delegate to physician assistants. See, e. g., Conn. Gen. Stat. $$ 20-12a, 20-12d (Supp.
1997); Fla. Stat. $ 458.347 (Supp. 1997); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 225, $$ 95/1, 95/

the supervision of a physician might be included in the defi-nition of "physician," it is not clear at this stage that the

Court of Appeals' decision challenges any of this Court'sstatements (for the most part dicta), ante, at 974-975, that a
State may restrict the performance of abortions to physi-cians. I think the Court would be well advised to await further developments in the case before intervening. Surely,the Court of Appeals' determination that a further inquiry
into the facts is appropriate before making a final decisionon the motion for a preliminary injunction does not provide
a proper basis for summary action in this Court.Having decided to take the case, however, it does seem to
me that the Court should provide some enlightenment as towhether the Court of Appeals misread this Court's opinions
in Miller and Shaw v. Hunt.In my judgment, the petition for certiorari should be
denied.

The issue in this case is the constitutionality of an injunctionagainst abortion protesters. The injunction limits their First
Amendment activities to a sidewalk separated from the clinic thatis the object of their protest by a busy four-lane avenue. The

Court of California's earlier judgment approving the injunction,7 Cal. 4th 860, 873 P. 2d 1224 (1994), and remanded the case so
that the court could reconsider its holding in light of our decisionin Madsen v. Women's Health Center, Inc., 512 U. S. 753 (1994).
513 U. S. 956 (1994). On remand, the Supreme Court of Califor-nia concluded that the provision in question "is equally valid
under the new standard set forth in Madsen," and therefore "reaf-firm[ed] the judgment in favor of Planned Parenthood." 10 Cal.
4th 1009, 1012, 898 P. 2d 402, 404 (1995). That was in my viewpatent error, and has been confirmed as such by Schenck v. ProChoice Network of Western N. Y., 519 U. S. 357 (1997). I thinkit important to the dignity of this Court and the integrity of its
processes to set aside what can only be regarded as an intentionalevasion of its decrees. I would grant the petition for certiorari,
summarily reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Califor-nia, and remand for further proceedings.

This case--unlike Schenck--is not one in which the record re-veals instances of serious unlawful conduct by clinic protesters.
The following was the testimony of Janice Schoenfeld, the "escortcoordinator" of the clinic, at the hearing on the application for a
permanent injunction:

"Q. Did you ever see any of this group of defendants pre-vent somebody from getting in the front door of the clinic?

"A. No."Q. Did you ever see them manhandle any of your clients?
"A. No."Q. Was anybody, to the best of your knowledge, that
wanted to get an abortion, prevented from getting anabortion?

"A. No."Q. Did you ever attempt to make a citizen's arrest of any
of the defendants?"A. No, I did not.

"Q. Do you know if any of them were ever arrested?"A. Not at the Vallejo clinic, that I know of. Some have
been in other Operation Rescue activity.. . . . .

"Q. Did you ever see any of the defendants prevent anycars from parking in the parking lot?
"A. Not prevent them from parking, no." Tr. 54-55.

This is a record so devoid of threatening physical confrontation itwould make an old-fashioned union organizer blush. Yet the trial
court entered--and the Supreme Court of California approved--an injunction severely curtailing the speech rights of clinic protesters in a public forum.The basis for that injunction--and for the Supreme Court of
California's initial approval of it--was the perceived governmentinterest in preventing "increased stress and anxiety" among abortion patients. 7 Cal. 4th, at 872-876, 873 P. 2d, at 1230-1233(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the Supreme
Court of California explained, "emotionally jarring confrontationswith anti-abortion pickets or sidewalk `counselors' may pose serious health risks." Id., at 874, 873 P. 2d, at 1232. The "substan-tial governmental interest in protecting the patients' physical and
emotional health and safety" justified restricting the abortion op-ponents to areas far removed from the clinic. Id., at 876, 873
P. 2d, at 1233.This holding was no longer supportable after we vacated the
Supreme Court of California's judgment in light of Madsen, andremanded the case for further proceedings. Madsen, in disallowing an injunction which prevented abortion opponents from ap-proaching persons seeking services at an abortion clinic, said:

"Absent evidence that the protesters' speech is independentlyproscribable (i. e., `fighting words' or threats), or is so infused
with violence as to be indistinguishable from a threat of phys-ical harm, this provision cannot stand." 512 U. S., at 774
(citation omitted).
Despite this holding, the Supreme Court of California, on remand,did not abandon but reaffirmed its assertion that avoiding upset

to the clinic's clients justified keeping the protesters at a distance.10 Cal. 4th, at 1021, 898 P. 2d, at 410. When the defendants
again petitioned us for certiorari, we held the case pending ourdecision in Schenck.

Whatever glimmer of hope Madsen might have left regardingthe legitimacy of the Supreme Court of California's "emotional
upset" justification was entirely snuffed by Schenck, in which wereiterated, in the most unmistakable terms, that there is no legitimate government interest in protecting the "right of the peopleapproaching and entering [clinics] to be left alone" on the public
streets, 519 U. S., at 383. Schenck would require, without further

analysis, a reversal of the judgment here, but for one additionalfactor: In its second opinion in this case--after our remand in
light of Madsen--the California Supreme Court for the first timediscerned a second state interest in support of the injunction: an
interest in "ensuring unfettered access" to the clinic, 10 Cal. 4th,at 1022, 898 P. 2d, at 410. This, it should be noted with suspicion,
is an interest which the court had expressly disclaimed in its firstopinion, saying that "the critical issue [is] not access, but health
and safety." 7 Cal. 4th, at 879, n. 10, 873 P. 2d 1235, n. 10.It is not normally our practice to scrutinize the record support
for the grounds asserted by state courts or lower federal courtsas a basis for rejecting constitutional claims. We have, however,
sometimes been disposed to do so when the abridgment of FirstAmendment rights was at issue. See, e. g., NAACP v. Claiborne
Hardware Co., 458 U. S. 886, 915, and n. 50 (1982); Edwards v.South Carolina, 372 U. S. 229, 235 (1963). And we should in my
view always be disposed to do so when the grounds are newlyminted after a remand, contradict what was said before the remand, and bear indication of an attempt to evade the conse-quences of our holding prompting the remand. That is the case
here; and an examination of the record for support of the newlyminted ground discloses that it does not exist.

The trial court made many findings regarding activities tendingto cause, not blocking of the entrances to the clinic parking lot,
but "increased stress and anxiety" to clinic patrons and staff:protesters "confront and intimidate women seeking [respondent's]
services," "force . . . `counseling' upon [respondent's] staff andclients," "have called staff `murderers' or asked them not to `kill
babies' in the presence of small children," "have pursued [respond-ent's] clients to their cars or public transportation in an effort to
distribute literature and the plastic fetuses," and "bring smallchildren to the area who run up and down the public sidewalk
in front of plaintiff 's premises." App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a-43a.The trial court also made findings regarding the impact of these
activities on respondent, its patrons, and its staff: "[Respondent]must escort its clients through picket lines and [petitioners']
`picketers/counselors' in its parking lot," and "[t]he conduct of[petitioners] and their picketers/counselors have [sic] caused some
of the women seeking counselling or services from plaintiff tobecome emotionally distraught." Ibid. But the only finding remotely related to access to the clinic is the following: Protesters"stand directly in front of [respondent's] office door and interfer

Scalia, J., dissenting1133
[sic] with or obstruct entrance to and from [respondent's] clinic."Id., at 42a. This finding (which, by the way, has no support in
the record if it is interpreted to mean physical obstruction 1) per-tains to behavior

at the entrance to the clinic--which is some 100feet inside the parking lot, from which the injunction (without

objection) excludes the protesters entirely. It obviously cannotsupport excluding protesters from the public sidewalk adjoining
the entrances to the parking lot, where it has never been so muchas suggested that any blocking of access occurred. The Supreme
Court of California's opinion misrepresents this, saying that "thetrial court found here, that petitioners had significantly blocked
driveways . . . ." 10 Cal. 4th, at 1023, 898 P. 2d, at 411. Theonly authority cited for this proposition is that portion of the
court's own pre-Madsen opinion which recites (inter alia) thetrial court's finding that protesters "pursued patients to their cars
. . . to distribute literature." 7 Cal. 4th, at 867, 873 P. 2d, at1227. This obviously does not establish (or even suggest) that
petitioners "blocked driveways." 2

1 There was no testimony that petitioners had blocked the entrance, but
only statements that they had stood very close to the entrance, trying topass literature or other material to those going in. See Tr. 17-18 (testimony

of Janice Schoenfeld at hearing on preliminary injunction) ("I did not saythey blocked the door. I said they stand very close to the door") ("Q. Has
any one of your clients ever been prevented from entering the clinic? A.No"); id., at 54 (testimony of Schoenfeld at hearing on permanent injunction)
("Q. Did you ever see any of this group of defendants prevent somebodyfrom getting in the front door of the clinic? A. No"); id., at 65 (testimony
of Marsha Anderson at hearing on permanent injunction) ("Q. Did you ob-serve any of your patrons being denied entrance into the clinic by any of
the defendants? A. I know they progressed to the front door, interruptedthem, but not prohibited them"). Of course if, as the trial court believed,
subjecting abortion clients to "emotional upset" was unlawful, forcing clientsto expose themselves to such unlawful activity in order to enter or exit the
clinic would constitute "interfer[ing] with" their access--and that is evi-dently what the trial court had in mind.

2 In a separate portion of its opinion, the Supreme Court of California
stated (without any citation of record support) that "[o]ne of the tactics ofthe sidewalk picketers was to walk slowly across the driveway entrance,

thereby delaying cars attempting to turn into the parking lot from thestreet." 10 Cal. 4th, at 1012, 898 P. 2d, at 404. Apart from the fact that
the trial court made no such finding in connection with its entry of theinjunction, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a-43a, "delaying" the entry of cars
into the lot as an incidental result of lawful picket activity is by no meansequivalent to "blocking driveways."

Scalia, J., dissenting 520 U. S.
Of course, even if there had been a finding of interference withfree access to the parking lot, the challenged injunction would
require further findings to establish that no restraint short oftotal exclusion of free speech from the public sidewalk--such as
limiting the number of protesters--could have eliminated the in-terference. Cf. Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U. S. 821, 823
(1994) (injunction imposing numerical limit on picketers). A con-clusion that complete exclusion of protesters was necessary in
this case would be difficult to square with the history of whathappened: The trial court initially issued a temporary restraining
order drafted by respondent, which permitted two picketers onthe sidewalk in front of the clinic. App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a-66a.
Shortly thereafter, it issued a preliminary injunction increasingto four the number of picketers allowed on that sidewalk. Id.,
at 67a-68a. Despite this apparent sign of success--and withoutany request by respondent for more restrictive relief--11 months
later the trial court imposed the permanent injunction at issuehere, banning all picketing in front of the clinic. The reason, of
course, was that (as the Supreme Court of California concludedthe first time around) the trial court was not concerned about
"impeding access"; it was concerned about preventing "stressand anxiety."

Since the trial court did not find that the challenged injunctionprovision was necessary to secure access, the Supreme Court of
California took it upon itself to provide the requisite finding."[T]he evidence at trial," the court proclaimed, "indicated that
picketers had not followed the preliminary injunction . . . ." 10Cal. 4th, at 1024, 898 P. 2d, at 411-412. For this the court offers
no support other than citation of its earlier opinion in this case,7 Cal. 4th, at 866-867, n. 2, 873 P. 2d, at 1227, n. 2, which in turn
relies upon nothing more probative than the following testimonyof Janice Schoenfeld:

"Q. Have you observed picket activity since the injunction?"A. Yes, but they followed the injunction usually, except
for picketers."MS. RYER: Thank you. I have nothing further. Thank

Even if the record did establish some violation of the preliminaryinjunction, it would still not establish a violation related to access,
supporting the proposition that banishment to the other side ofthe avenue was "the only practicable means of ensuring unfettered access," 10 Cal. 4th, at 1022, 898 P. 2d, at 410. As far asappears, any failure to "follo[w] the injunction" might have related
to one of the many prohibitions that had nothing to do withobstructing access. Indeed, the odds are in favor of that, since
almost all of the prohibitions in the preliminary injunction wereof that character. The record simply does not contain the facts
necessary to support the challenged provision in the name ofprotection of access.

This case having been held pending the issuance of our opinionin Schenck; and Schenck having come out four-square against the

principal theory relied upon by the Supreme Court of California;it is quite impossible to understand why any disposition short of
a reversal and remand would be appropriate. If we were pre-pared to take at face value the court's post-Madsen-invented "obstruction of entrances" justification, then there was no reason tohold the case in the first place. The hold was correct, and today's
denial of certiorari smiles upon injustice to these petitioners anddisregard of the processes of this Court. I dissent.

No. A-702. Lui Kin-Hong v. United States. C. A. 1st Cir.Application for stay of mandate, addressed to Justice Breyer

and referred to the Court, denied.

Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins,dissenting.

The United Kingdom seeks to extradite petitioner to HongKong, where he will be charged with bribery. The District Court
granted petitioner's request for a writ of habeas corpus, holdingthat the extradition treaty between the United States and the
United Kingdom does not now permit his extradition to HongKong because his trial and any subsequent punishment would
likely take place under the authority of the People's Republic ofChina, a nation with whom the United States does not have an
applicable extradition treaty. The Court of Appeals for the FirstCircuit reversed. Lui now asks this Court for a stay pending a
petition for certiorari.The petition for certiorari that Lui intends to file would likely
raise three questions. First, the treaty with the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, 28 U. S. T. 227, as
amended, June 25, 1985, T. I. A. S. No. 12050 (Treaty), grants theUnited Kingdom the power to seek the extradition of a fugitive
offender. See Treaty, Art. I. This Court has defined "extradi-tion" to mean "the surrender by one nation to another . . . which,
being competent to try and to punish him, demands the surren-der." Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 289 (1902). Since Hong
Kong will revert to the People's Republic of China on July 1,1997, and, as the Government admits, no trial could be held before
that date, does the United Kingdom have the "competen[ce] to tryand to punish" Lui? And, if not, can it now seek his extradition?

Second, the Treaty provides that no person extradited shall "beextradited by [the requesting party] to a third State." Treaty,
Art. XII. Does this provision prohibit Lui's extradition?Third, under the terms of 18 U. S. C. $$ 3184 and 3186, does the
Executive Branch have the exclusive power to interpret theseprovisions of the Treaty?

In essence, petitioner says that the United States intends toextradite him, not to the United Kingdom or to a crown colony
of the United Kingdom, for trial, but rather to the People's Repub-lic of China. In my view, the papers accompanying his motion
for stay raise questions about the lawfulness of doing so, at leastto the point where I would issue the stay, pending a response
from the Solicitor General. For that reason I dissent from theCourt's denial of petitioner's application.

Statement of Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburgand Justice Breyer join, respecting the denial of certiorari.
It is well settled that our decision to deny a petition for writof certiorari does not in any sense constitute a ruling on the
merits of the case in which the writ is sought. United States v.Carver, 260 U. S. 482, 490 (1923). See Singleton v. Commissioner, 439 U. S. 940, 942 (1978) (opinion of Stevens, J., respectingdenial of certiorari); Maryland v. Baltimore Radio Show, Inc.,
338 U. S. 912, 919 (1950) (opinion of Frankfurter, J., respectingdenial of certiorari). That is certainly true of our decision to
deny certiorari in this case. It is worth noting the existence ofan arguable jurisdictional bar to our review. Our consideration of
state-court decisions is confined to "[f]inal judgments or decreesrendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision
could be had." 28 U. S. C. $ 1257(a). Petitioner has been neitherconvicted of nor sentenced for any crime. As we have indicated,
"in the context of a criminal prosecution, finality is normally de-fined by the imposition of the sentence." Flynt v. Ohio, 451 U. S.
619, 620 (1981). See Baltimore Radio, 338 U. S., at 918 (notingone reason for denial of certiorari is that "judgment of the lower
court may not be final").

CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1871. See also Appeals.

1. Section 1983--County sheriff's wrongdoing--County's liability.--
Monroe County, Alabama, is not liable under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 for its
sheriff's alleged wrongdoing in suppressing exculpatory evidence that
cleared McMillian of capital murder, because Alabama sheriffs, when
executing their law enforcement duties, are policymakers for State, not
county. McMillian v. Monroe County, p. 781.

2. Section 1983--Municipal liability--Judgment based on sheriff's
hiring decision.--A county is not liable under $ 1983 for its sheriff's isolated decision to hire a deputy without adequately screening his criminal
record absent a showing that sheriff consciously disregarded a high risk
that deputy would use excessive force. Board of Comm'rs of Bryan Cty.
v. Brown, p. 397.

3. Section 1983--Prison disciplinary proceeding.--Heck v. Humphrey,
512 U. S. 477, precludes respondent's claim for declaratory relief and damages--based on allegations that procedures used in his prison disciplinary proceeding violated due process--from being cognizable under $ 1983.

CONCURRENT SENTENCES. See Criminal Law, 1.
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW.
I. Appointments Clause.

Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals--Appointment of civilian
judges.--Title 49 U. S. C. $ 323(a) authorizes Secretary of Transportation
to appoint civilian judges to Coast Guard Court of Criminal Appeals, and
that authorization is constitutional under Appointments Clause. Edmond
v. United States, p. 651.

II. Case or Controversy.

Mootness--State law--English as official language.--Because this case
was moot once initiating plaintiff left state employment, Ninth Circuit
erred in considering whether Arizona State Constitution, which requires state business to be conducted exclusively in English, violates First
Amendment's Free Speech Clause. Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, p. 43.

III. Commerce Clause.

State property tax--Discrimination against charitable institutions
operated principally for nonresidents.--An otherwise generally applicable state property tax violates Commerce Clause if its exemption for
property owned by charitable institutions excludes organizations operated
principally for nonresidents' benefit. Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. v.
Town of Harrison, p. 564.

IV. Due Process.

1. Liberty interest--State preparole program--Procedural protections.--Oklahoma's Preparole Conditional Supervision Program for reducing overcrowding in its prisons was sufficiently like parole that a program participant was entitled to procedural protections of Morrissey v.
Brewer, 408 U. S. 471, before he could be removed from program. Young
v. Harper, p. 143.

2. Public employee's suspension--Notice and hearing requirement.--
A State does not violate Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause by
failing to provide notice and a hearing before suspending a tenured public
employee without pay. Gilbert v. Homar, p. 924.

V. Freedom of Association.

Elections--Multiple-party candidacies for elected office.--Minnesota
laws forbidding an individual from appearing on an electoral ballot as
candidate of more than one party, thus prohibiting multiple-party, or
fusion, candidacies for elected office, do not violate First and Fourteenth
Amendments. Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, p. 351.

1334 INDEX
CONSTITUTIONAL LAW--Continued.
VI. Freedom of Speech.

Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992--
"Must-carry" provisions.--Because record supports Congress' judgment
that Act's "must-carry" provisions are narrowly tailored to further important Government interests, they satisfy First Amendment. Turner
Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, p. 180.

VII. Immunity from Suit.

Separation of powers--Private action against President--Deferral
of litigation.--Constitution does not afford President temporary immunity from civil damages litigation arising out of his unofficial conduct before he took office, and separation of powers doctrine does not require
federal courts to stay such litigation until President leaves office. Clinton
v. Jones, p. 681.

VIII. Right to Abortion.

1. Montana parental notification law--Judicial bypass provision.--
Ninth Circuit's holding that Montana's Parental Notice of Abortion Act
is unconstitutional because its judicial bypass provision does not sufficiently protect minors' right to have abortions is in direct conflict with
this Court's precedents. Lambert v. Wicklund, p. 292.

2. Physician-only state law--Preliminary injunction.--Summary reversal of Ninth Circuit's decision finding threshold showing for preliminary injunction against Montana's physician-only abortion law is appropriate where decision conflicts with this Court's precedents and law is
unenforceable at present. Mazurek v. Armstrong, p. 968.

IX. Searches and Seizures.

1. Candidates for state office--Drug tests.--Georgia's requirement that
candidates for state office pass a drug test does not fit within suspicionless
searches permitted under Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. Chandler v. Miller, p. 305.

2. Knock and announce requirement--Felony drug investigations.--
Fourth Amendment does not permit a blanket exception to "knock and
announce" requirement for felony drug investigations, but facts in this
case support police officers' decision not to knock and announce before
entering petitioner's motel room. Richards v. Wisconsin, p. 385.

CRIMINAL LAW. See also Constitutional Law, IX, 2; Habeas Corpus; United States Sentencing Guidelines.

1. Drug-related firearms use--Mandatory prison term.--Plain language of 18 U. S. C. $ 924(c) forbids a federal district court to direct that
that section's mandatory 5-year prison term for drug-related firearms use
run concurrently with any other prison term, whether state or federal.
United States v. Gonzales, p. 1.

2. Perjury--Materiality.--A trial court's decision in a perjury case that
materiality was an issue for judge, rather than jury, was not a plain error
affecting substantial rights that can be noticed under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 52(b) even though no objection has been made. Johnson v. United States, p. 461.

3. Plea agreement--Withdrawal before sentencing.--Where a federal
court accepts a defendant's guilty plea, pursuant to a plea agreement,
but defers decision on whether to accept plea agreement, defendant must
have a fair and just reason under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
32(e) to withdraw plea before sentencing. United States v. Hyde, p. 670.

4. Sexual assault by state judge--Deprivation of victims' liberty interest.--In reversing a state judge's 18 U. S. C. $ 242 convictions for sexually assaulting women in violation of their due process right to liberty,
Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that such a "right" must first be identified
by this Court in a "fundamentally similar" case. United States v. Lanier, p. 259.

De Buono v. NYSA-ILA Medical and Clinical Services Fund, p. 806.

2. Interference with attainment of rights under plan.--Section 510 of
ERISA, which prohibits discharge of a plan participant in order to interfer
with attainment of any right to which participant may become entitled
under plan, is not limited to interference with vested rights. Inter-Modal
Rail Employees Assn. v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., p. 510.

3. Pre-emption of state law--Testamentary transfer of pension benefits.--ERISA pre-empts a Louisiana law allowing a nonparticipant spouse
to transfer by testamentary instrument a community property interest in
undistributed pension plan benefits. Boggs v. Boggs, p. 833.

HABEAS CORPUS.

1. New rule--Capital murder--Sentencing.--The rule announced in
Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U. S. 1079 (per curiam)--that if a sentencing
judge in a "weighing" State is required to give deference to a jury's advisory sentencing recommendation, neither jury nor judge is constitutionally permitted to weigh invalid aggravating circumstances--is a "new
rule" as defined in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, and thus, a state prisoner
whose first-degree murder conviction became final before Espinosa was
decided is foreclosed from relying on that decision in a federal habeas
proceeding. Lambrix v. Singletary, p. 518.

2. Rule 6(a)--Good cause--Denial of a fair trial.--Petitioner had good
cause, under Habeas Rule 6(a), to conduct discovery to prove that he was
denied a fair trial under Due Process Clause by a judge who wanted him
convicted to hide fact that judge was taking bribes in other murder cases.
