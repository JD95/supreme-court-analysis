Act.  They  are  being  treated  by  licensed,  board-certified family  practitioners,  who  have  concluded,  after  prescribing 

a  host  of  conventional  medicines  to  treat  respondents'  con-ditions  and  to  alleviate  their  associated  symptoms,  that 
marijuana  is  the  only  drug  available  that  provides  effective treatment.  Both  women  have  been  using  marijuana  as  a 
medication  for  several  years  pursuant  to  their  doctors'  rec-
ommendation,  and  both  rely  heavily  on  cannabis  to  function on  a  daily  basis.  Indeed,  Raich's  physician  believes  that 

forgoing  cannabis  treatments  would  certainly  cause  Raich excruciating pain and could very well prove fatal. 

Respondent Monson cultivates her own marijuana, and in-
gests  the  drug  in  a  variety  of  ways  including  smoking  and 
using a vaporizer.  Respondent Raich, by contrast, is unable 
to  cultivate  her  own,  and  thus  relies  on  two  caregivers, 
litigating  as  "John  Does,"  to  provide  her  with  locally  grown 
marijuana  at  no  charge.  These  caregivers  also  process  the 
cannabis  into  hashish  or  keif,  and  Raich  herself  processes 
some  of  the  marijuana  into  oils,  balms,  and  foods  for 
consumption. 

On  August  15,  2002,  county  deputy  sheriffs  and  agents 
from  the  federal  Drug  Enforcement  Administration  (DEA) 
came to Monson's home.  After a thorough investigation, the 
county  officials  concluded  that  her  use  of  marijuana  was  en-
tirely  lawful  as  a  matter  of  California  law.  Nevertheless, 
after  a  3-hour  standoff,  the  federal  agents  seized  and  de-
stroyed all six of her cannabis plants. 

Respondents  thereafter  brought  this  action  against  the 
Attorney  General  of  the  United  States  and  the  head  of  the 
DEA  seeking  injunctive  and  declaratory  relief  prohibiting 
the  enforcement  of  the  federal  Controlled  Substances  Act

Marijuana  itself  was  not  significantly  regulated  by  the Federal Government until 1937 when accounts of marijuana's 

addictive qualities and physiological effects, paired with dis-satisfaction with enforcement efforts at state and local levels, 
prompted Congress to pass the Marihuana Tax Act, 50 Stat. 551 (repealed 1970).

14  Like the Harrison Act, the Marihuana 

Tax  Act  did  not  outlaw  the  possession  or  sale  of  marijuana outright.  Rather,  it imposed registration  and reporting  re-

quirements  for  all  individuals  importing,  producing,  selling, or  dealing  in  marijuana,  and  required  the  payment  of  an-
nual  taxes  in  addition  to  transfer  taxes  whenever  the  drug changed  hands.

15  Moreover,  doctors  wishing  to  prescribe 

marijuana  for  medical  purposes  were  required  to  comply with rather burdensome administrative requirements.

16 

Noncompliance  exposed  traffickers  to  severe  federal  penal-ties, whereas compliance would often subject them to prose-

cution  under  state  law.17  Thus,  while  the  Marihuana  Tax Act  did  not  declare  the  drug  illegal  per

need  to  prevent  the  diversion  of  drugs  from  legitimate  to 
illicit channels.21 

To  effectuate  these  goals,  Congress  devised  a  closed  reg-
ulatory  system  making  it  unlawful  to  manufacture,  distrib-
ute,  dispense,  or  possess  any  controlled  substance  except  in 
a  manner  authorized  by  the  CSA.  21  U. S. C.  $$ 841(a)(1), 
844(a).  The  CSA  categorizes  all  controlled  substances  into 
five  schedules.  $ 812.  The  drugs  are  grouped  together 
based on their accepted medical uses, the potential for abuse, 
and  their  psychological  and  physical  effects  on  the  body. 

"(2)  The  illegal  importation,  manufacture,  distribution,  and  possession 
and  improper  use  of  controlled  substances  have  a  substantial  and  det-
rimental  effect  on  the  health  and  general  welfare  of  the  American 
people. 

"(3)  A major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows through 
interstate  and  foreign  commerce.  Incidents  of  the  traffic  which  are  not 
an  integral  part  of  the  interstate  or  foreign  flow,  such  as  manufacture, 
local  distribution,  and  possession,  nonetheless  have  a  substantial  and  di-
rect effect upon interstate commerce because-- 

"(A)  after manufacture, many controlled substances are transported in 
interstate commerce, 

"(B)  controlled  substances  distributed  locally  usually  have  been  trans-
ported in  interstate commerce immediately before  their  distribution, and 

"(C)  controlled substances possessed commonly flow through interstate 
commerce immediately prior to such possession. 

"(4)  Local distribution and possession of controlled substances contrib-
ute to swelling the interstate traffic in such substances. 

"(5)  Controlled substances manufactured and distributed intrastate 
cannot  be  differentiated  from  controlled  substances  manufactured  and 
distributed interstate.  Thus, it is not feasible to distinguish, in terms of 
controls,  between  controlled  substances  manufactured  and  distributed 
interstate and controlled substances manufactured and distributed 
intrastate. 

"(6)  Federal control of the intrastate incidents of the traffic in controlled 
substances  is  essential  to  the  effective  control  of  the  interstate  incidents 
of such traffic."  21 U. S. C. $$ 801(1)-(6).

III 
Respondents  in  this  case  do  not  dispute  that  passage  of the CSA, as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Preven-

tion  and  Control  Act,  was  well  within  Congress'  commerce power.  Brief for Respondents 22, 38.  Nor do they contend 
that  any  provision  or  section  of  the  CSA  amounts  to  an  un-constitutional  exercise  of  congressional  authority.  Rather, 
respondents'  challenge  is  actually  quite  limited;  they  argue that  the  CSA's  categorical  prohibition  of  the  manufacture 
and possession of marijuana as applied to the intrastate man-
ufacture  and  possession  of  marijuana  for  medical  purposes pursuant to California law exceeds Congress' authority 

under the Commerce Clause. In assessing the validity of congressional regulation, none 
of  our  Commerce  Clause  cases  can  be  viewed  in  isolation. As  charted  in  considerable  detail  in

To  support  their  contrary  submission,  respondents  rely 
heavily  on  two  of  our  more  recent  Commerce  Clause  cases. 
In  their  myopic  focus,  they  overlook  the  larger  context  of 
modern-era  Commerce  Clause  jurisprudence  preserved  by 
those  cases.  Moreover,  even  in  the  narrow  prism  of  re-
spondents'  creation,  they  read  those  cases  far  too  broadly.

Opinion of the Court 
Though Alaska's failure to demonstrate that the waters of the  Alexander  Archipelago  had  historically  been  treated  as 

inland waters would by itself justify granting summary judg-ment to the United States on count I, the Special Master also 
addressed other relevant factors, such as the acquiescence of other  nations  and  the  vital  interests  of  the  United  States. 
In the Special Master's view these factors only strengthened the  case  for  granting  summary  judgment  to  the  United 
States. Excepting  to  the  Special  Master's  recommendation  on 
count  I,  Alaska  contends  the  Special  Master  gave  too  little weight to historical events that tend to support Alaska's po-
sition.  By the same token Alaska argues the Special Master gave too much weight to historical events that tend to under-
mine  its  position.  Alaska  also  asserts  that  foreign  nations have  acquiesced  in the  treatment  of  the  waters of  the  Alex-
ander Archipelago as inland waters, and that the interests of the United States support such treatment.  We find Alaska's 
arguments unconvincing. Rather  than  canvassing  the  entire  historical  record  dis-
cussed  by  the  Special  Master  in  his  thorough,  commendable report,  we  turn  our  attention  to  the  events  Alaska  presents 
as its best evidence that the Alexander Archipelago's waters qualify as historic inland waters. 

A 
First  in  time  among  the  events  to  which  Alaska  points are incidents from the period of Russian sovereignty.  These 

incidents  are  pertinent  to  the  inquiry  because,  as  we  have held,  when  Russia  ceded  the  territory  of  Alaska  to  the 
United  States  in  1867,  "the  United  States  thereby  acquired whatever  dominion  Russia  had  possessed."

are these limits that even Alaska itself did not discover them until after it had filed its first complaint in this action.  Com-

Opinion of the Court 
We  conclude  that  Alaska's  narrow  reading  of  the  proviso is neither necessary nor preferred.  Section 6(e) begins with 

specificity.  It covers "[a]ll real and personal property" "spe-cifically used for the sole purpose of conservation and protec-
tion  of  the  fisheries  and  wildlife  of  Alaska"  as  identified under  three  particular  federal  game  and  wildlife  laws. 
Those provisions, in turn, make clear that the initial clause's transfer requirement applies to facilities such as certain fish 
hatcheries,  and  likely  would  include  specific  types  of  equip-ment or even vehicles. 

Having thus transferred the identified "property," the sec-tion proceeds to state a  more general reservation, using the 
word  "lands."  "Provided,

expressly  mention  cruise  ships,  there  is  no  doubt  that  the  NCL  ships 
in question  fall within both definitions under conventional principles of 
interpretation.  The Fifth Circuit nevertheless held Title III inapplica-
ble because the statute has no clear statement or explicit text mandating 
coverage for foreign-flag ships in U. S. waters.  This Court's cases, par-
ticularly  Benz  and  McCulloch,  do  hold,  in  some  circumstances,  that  a 
general  statute  will  not  apply  to  certain  aspects  of  the  internal  oper-
ations  of  foreign  vessels  temporarily  in  U.  S.  waters,  absent  a  clear 
statement.  The  broad  clear  statement  rule  adopted  by  the  Court  of 
Appeals,  however,  would  apply  to  every  facet  of  the  business  and 
operations  of  foreign-flag  ships.  That  formulation  is  inconsistent  with 
the Court's  case law and with sound principles  of statutory interpreta-
tion.  Pp. 128-130. 

(b)  Title  III  defines  "readily  achievable"  barrier  removal  as  that 
which is "easily accomplishable and able to be carried out without much 
difficulty  or  expense,"  $ 12181(9).  The  statute  does  not  further  define 
"difficulty," but the  section's  use of  the disjunctive indicates that it  ex-
tends  to  considerations in  addition  to  cost.  Furthermore,  Title  III  di-
rects that the "readily achievable" determination take into account "the 
impact  .  .  .  upon  the  [facility's]  operation,"  $ 12181(9)(B).  A  Title  III 
barrier-removal requirement that would  bring a vessel into noncompli-
ance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea or 
any other international legal obligation would create serious difficulties 
for  the  vessel  and  would  have  a  substantial  impact  on  its  operation, 
and  thus  would  not  be  "readily  achievable."  Congress  could  not  have 
intended  this  result.  It  is  logical  and  proper  to  conclude,  moreover, 
that  whether  a  barrier  modification  is  "readily  achievable"  must  take 
into  consideration  the  modification's  effect  on  shipboard  safety.  Title 
III's  nondiscrimination  and  accommodation  requirements  do  not  apply 
if  disabled  individuals  would  pose  "a  significant  risk  to  the  health  or 
safety of others that cannot be eliminated by  a modification  of policies, 
practices,  or  procedures."  $ 12182(b)(3).  It  would  be  incongruous  to 
attribute to Congress an intent to require modifications threatening oth-
ers' safety simply because the threat comes not from the disabled person 
but from the accommodation itself.  Pp. 135-136.

foreign  crew  not  because  foreign  ships  are  generally  exempt  from  the 
NLRA, but because that particular application of the NLRA would in-
terfere  with  matters  that  concern  only  the  ship's  internal  operations. 
These cases recognized a narrow rule, applicable only to statutory duties 
that implicate the foreign vessel's internal order rather than the welfare 
of American citizens.  E. g., McCulloch, supra, at 21.  In contrast, the 
Court  later  held  the  NLRA  fully  applicable  to  labor  relations  between 
a  foreign  vessel  and American longshoremen  because this  relationship, 
unlike the one between a  vessel and its own crew, does not implicate a 
foreign ship's internal order and discipline.  Longshoremen v.  Ariadne 
Shipping Co., 397 U. S. 195, 198-201.  This narrow clear statement rule 
is supported by sound principles of statutory construction.  It is reason-
able to presume Congress intends no interference with matters that are 
primarily of concern only to the ship and the foreign state in which it is 
registered.  It  is  also  reasonable,  however,  to  presume  Congress  does 
intend its statutes to apply to entities in U. S. territory that serve, em-
ploy, or otherwise affect American citizens, or that affect the peace and 
tranquility  of  the  United  States,  even  if  those  entities  happen  to  be 
foreign-flag ships.  Cruise ships flying foreign flags  of convenience but 
departing from and returning to U. S. ports accommodate and transport 
over  7  million  U.  S.  residents  annually,  including  large  numbers  of 
disabled  individuals.  To  hold  there  is  no  Title  III  protection  for  the 
disabled  would  be  a  harsh  and  unexpected  interpretation  of  a  statute 
designed to provide broad protection for them.  Pp. 130-133. 

(b)  Plainly, most of the Title III violations alleged below--that NCL 
required disabled passengers to pay higher fares and special surcharges; 
maintained evacuation programs and equipment in locations not accessi-
ble to them; required them, but not other passengers, to waive any po-
tential  medical  liability  and  to  travel  with  companions;  reserved  the 
right  to  remove  them  from  ships  if  they endangered  other  passengers' 
comfort;  and,  more  generally,  failed  to  make  reasonable  modifications 
necessary  to  ensure  their  full  enjoyment  of  the  services  offered--have 
nothing  to  do  with  a  ship's  internal  affairs.  However,  the  petitioners' 
allegations  concerning  physical  barriers  to  access  on  board--e. g.,  their 
assertion that most of NCL's cabins, including the most attractive ones 
in  the  most  desirable  locations,  are  not  accessible  to  disabled  passen-
gers--would appear to involve requirements that might be construed as 
relating to  internal  ship affairs.  The  clear statement rule would  most 
likely  come  into  play  if  Title  III  were  read  to  require  permanent  and 
significant structural modifications to foreign vessels.  Pp. 133-135. 

(c)  Because  Title  III  does  not  require  structural  modifications  that 
conflict  with  international  legal  obligations  or  pose  any  real  threat  to 
the safety of the crew or other passengers, it may well follow that Title

III does not require any permanent and significant structural modifica-
tions  that  interfere  with  cruise  ships'  internal  affairs.  If  so,  recourse 
to  the  internal  affairs  clear  statement  rule  would  not  be  necessary. 
Cases may arise, however, where it is prudent for a court to invoke that 
rule without determining whether Title III actually imposes a particu-
lar  barrier-removal  requirement  entailing  a  permanent  and  significant 
structural modification interfering with a foreign ship's internal affairs. 
Conversely, where  it is  not obvious that  a  particular  physical  modifica-
tion  relates  to  a  vessel's  basic  architecture  and  construction,  but  it  is 
clear  the modification  would  conflict  with  an  international  legal  obliga-
tion, the court may simply hold the modification not readily achievable, 
without resort to the clear statement rule.  P. 137. 

(d)  The  holding  that  the  clear  statement  rule  operates  only  when  a 
ship's internal affairs are affected does not implicate the Court's holding 
in Clark  v.  Martinez,  543 U. S.  371,  380,  that statutory  language  given 
a limiting construction in  one context must be interpreted  consistently 
in other contexts, "even though other of the statute's applications, stand-
ing  alone,  would  not  support  the  same  limitation."  Martinez  applied 
a  canon  for  choosing  among  plausible  meanings  of  an  ambiguous  stat-
ute,  not  a  clear  statement  rule  that  implies  a  special  substantive  limit 
on  the  application  of  an  otherwise  unambiguous  statutory  mandate.

126  SPECTOR  v.  NORWEGIAN  CRUISE  LINE  LTD. 

Opinion of the Court 

I 
The  respondent  Norwegian  Cruise  Line  Ltd.  (NCL),  a Bermuda  corporation  with  a  principal  place  of  business  in 

Miami,  Florida,  operates  cruise  ships  that  depart  from,  and return  to, ports  in  the  United States.  The  ships  are  essen-
tially floating resorts.  They provide passengers with state-rooms or cabins, food,  and entertainment.  The  cruise ships 
stop  at  different  ports  of  call  where  passengers  may  disem-bark.  Most  of  the  passengers  on  these  cruises  are  United 
States residents; under the terms and conditions of the tick-ets,  disputes  between  passengers  and  NCL  are  to  be  gov-
erned by United States law; and NCL relies upon extensive advertising  in  the  United  States  to  promote  its  cruises  and 
increase its revenues. Despite  the  fact  that  the  cruises  are  operated  by  a  com-
pany based in the United States, serve predominantly United States  residents,  and  are  in  most  other  respects  United 
States-centered  ventures,  almost  all  of  NCL's  cruise  ships are registered in other countries, flying so-called flags of con-
venience.  The two NCL cruise ships that are the subject of the present litigation, the Norwegian Sea and the Norwegian 
Star, are both registered in the Bahamas. The  petitioners  are  disabled  individuals  and  their  com-
panions who purchased tickets in 1998 or 1999 for round-trip cruises  on  the  Norwegian  Sea  or  the  Norwegian  Star,  with 
departures  from  Houston,  Texas.  Naming  NCL  as  the  de-fendant,  the  petitioners  filed  a  class  action  in  the  United 
States  District  Court  for  the  Southern  District  of  Texas  on behalf of all persons similarly situated.  They sought declar-
atory and injunctive relief under Title III of the ADA, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability.  The peti-
tioners  asserted  that  cruise  ships  are  covered  both  by  Title III's prohibition on discrimination in places of "public accom-
modation,"  $ 12182(a),  and  by  its  prohibition  on  discrimina-tion  in  "specified  public  transportation  services,"  $ 12184(a). 
Both  provisions  require  covered  entities  to  make  "reason-

able  modifications  in  policies,  practices,  or  procedures"  to accommodate disabled individuals, $$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii), 

12184(b)(2)(A),  and  require  removal  of  "architectural  bar-riers,  and  communication  barriers  that  are  structural  in 
nature, "  where  such  removal  is  "readily  achievable, " $$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv), 12184(b)(2)(C). 

The District Court held that, as a general matter, Title III 
applies  to  foreign-flag  cruise  ships  in  United  States  territo-rial  waters.  Civ.  Action  No.  H-00-2649  (SD  Tex.,  Sept.  10, 

2002), App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a.  The District Court found, however, that the petitioners' claims regarding physical bar-
riers  to  access  could  not  go  forward  because  the  agencies 
charged with promulgating architectural and structural 
guidelines for ADA compliance (the Architectural and Trans-
portation  Barriers  Compliance  Board,  the  Department  of 
Transportation, and the Department of Justice) had not done 
so  for  cruise  ships.  In  these  circumstances,  the  court  held, 
it  is  unclear  what  structural  modifications  NCL  would  need 
to  make.  Id.,  at  36a-42a.  The  District  Court  granted 
NCL's motion to dismiss the barrier-removal claims, but de-
nied  NCL's  motion  with  respect  to  all  the  other  claims. 
Id., at 47a. 

The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part 
and  reversed  in  part.  It  reasoned  that  our  cases,  particu-
larly  Benz  v.  Compania  Naviera  Hidalgo,  S.  A.,  353  U. S. 
138  (1957),  and  McCulloch  v.  Sociedad  Nacional  de  Mari-
neros de Honduras, 372 U. S. 10 (1963), stand for the proposi-
tion that general statutes do not apply to foreign-flag vessels 
in  United  States  territory  absent  a  clear  indication  of  con-
gressional  intent.  356  F.  3d,  at  644  ("[T]o  apply  domestic 
law  to  foreign  vessels  entering  United  States  waters,  there 
must  be  present  the  affirmative  intention  of  the  Congress 
clearly  expressed"  (quoting  Benz,  supra,  at  147;  internal 
quotation  marks  omitted));  356  F.  3d,  at  646  (Benz  and  McCulloch "prohibit United States courts from applying domes-
tic statutes to foreign-flagged ships without specific evidence

Opinion of the Court 
of  congressional  intent").  As  Title  III  does  not  contain  a 
specific  provision  mandating  its  application  to  foreign-flag 
vessels,  the  Court  of  Appeals  sustained  the  District  Court's 
dismissal  of  the  petitioners'  barrier-removal  claims  on  this 
alternative  ground  and  reversed  the  District  Court  on  the 
remaining Title III claims.  356 F. 3d, at 650-651. 

The  action  was  ordered  dismissed  for  failure  to  state  a 
claim, Fed.  Rule Civ. Proc. 12(b)(6), before extensive discov-
ery.  We cannot then discuss the specific allegations in much 
detail  but  must  confine  our  opinion  to  the  relevant  general 
principles.  (On November 24, 2004, the responsible agencies 
finally  did  issue  draft  guidelines  for large  passenger  vessels 
and  a  Notice  of  Proposed  Rulemaking.  See  69  Fed.  Reg. 
69244, 69249.  These developments are not dispositive of the 
legal question on which we granted certiorari, and we do not 
address how they might affect the ultimate resolution of the 
petitioners' claims.)

Title  III  of  the  ADA  prohibits  discrimination  against  the 
disabled  in  the  full  and  equal  enjoyment  of  public  accom-
modations,  42  U. S. C.  $ 12182(a),  and  public  transportation 
services,  $ 12184(a).  The  general  prohibitions  are  supple-
mented  by  various,  more  specific  requirements.  Entities 
that provide public accommodations or public transportation: 
(1)  may  not  impose  "eligibility  criteria"  that  tend  to  screen 
out  disabled  individuals,  $$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(i),  12184(b)(1); 
(2)  must  make  "reasonable  modifications  in  policies,  prac-
tices,  or  procedures,  when  such  modifications  are  neces-
sary"  to  provide  disabled  individuals  full  and  equal  enjoy-
ment,  $$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii),  12184(b)(2)(A);  (3)  must  provide 
auxiliary  aids  and  services  to  disabled  individuals, 

$$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii), 12184(b)(2)(B); and (4) must remove ar-
chitectural  and  structural  barriers,  or  if  barrier  removal  is

Opinion of the Court 
not readily achievable, must ensure equal access for the dis-abled  through  alternative  methods,  $$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v), 

12184(b)(2)(C). These specific requirements, in turn, are subject to impor-
tant  exceptions  and  limitations.  Eligibility  criteria  that screen  out  disabled  individuals  are  permitted  when  "neces-
sary  for  the  provision"  of  the  services  or  facilities  being  of-
fered,  $$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(i),  12184(b)(1).  Policies,  practices, and  procedures  need  not  be  modified,  and  auxiliary  aids 

need  not  be  provided,  if  doing  so  would  "fundamentally alter "  the  services  or  accommodati ons  being  offered. 

$$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iii).  Auxiliary  aids  are  also  unneces-
sary  when  they  would  "result  in  an  undue  burden, " 

$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iii).  As  we  have  noted,  moreover,  the 
barrier-removal  and  alternative  access  requirements  do  not 
apply when these requirements are not "readily achievable," 

$$ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv)-(v).  Additionally, Title III does not im-
pose nondiscrimination or accommodation requirements if, as 
a  result,  disabled  individuals  would  pose  "a  significant  risk 
to  the  health  or  safety  of  others  that  cannot  be  eliminated 
by  a  modification  of  policies,  practices,  or  procedures  or  by 
the provision of auxiliary aids or services," $ 12182(b)(3). 

Although  the  statutory  definitions  of  "public  accommoda-
tion"  and  "specified  public  transportation"  do  not  expressly 
mention  cruise  ships,  there  can  be  no  serious  doubt  that 
the  NCL  cruise  ships  in  question  fall  within  both  defini-
ti ons  under  conventional  principles  of  interpretati on. 

$$ 12181(7)(A)-(B), (I), (L), 12181(10).  The Court of Appeals 
for  the  Fifth  Circuit,  nevertheless,  held  that  Title  III  does 
not apply to foreign-flag cruise ships in United States waters 
because  the  statute  has  no  clear  statement  or  explicit  text 
mandating  coverage  for  these  ships.  This  Court's  cases, 
particularly  Benz  and  McCulloch,  do  hold,  in  some  circum-
stances,  that  a  general  statute  will  not  apply  to  certain  as-
pects of the internal operations of foreign vessels temporar-
ily  in  United  States  waters,  absent  a  clear  statement.  The

and  construction.  If  so,  these  applications  of  the  barrier-removal requirement likely would interfere with the internal 

affairs  of foreign  ships.  A  permanent and  significant  modi-fication  to  a  ship's  physical  structure  goes  to  fundamental 
issues of ship design and construction, and it might be impos-sible for a ship to comply with all the requirements different 
jurisdictions might impose.  The clear statement rule would most  likely  come  into  play  if  Title  III  were  read  to  require 
permanent and significant structural modifications to foreign vessels.  It  is  quite  a  different  question,  however,  whether 
Title  III  would  require  this.  The  Title  III  requirements that  might  impose  permanent  and  substantial  changes  to  a 
ship's  architecture  and  design,  are,  like  all  of  Title  III's  re-quirements,  subject  to  the  statute's  own  specific  limitations 
and  qualifications.  These  limitations  may  make  resort  to the clear statement rule unnecessary. 

2 
Title  III  requires  barrier  removal  if  it  is  "readily  achiev-able," $ 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv).  The statute defines that term as 

"easily  accomplishable  and  able  to  be  carried  out  without much  difficulty  or  expense,"  $ 12181(9).  Title  III  does  not 
define  "difficulty"  in  $ 12181(9),  but  use  of  the  disjunctive-- "easily  accomplishable  and  able  to  be  carried  out  without 
much difficulty or expense"--indicates that it extends to con-siderations  in  addition  to  cost.  Furthermore,  Title  III  di-
rects  that  the  "readily  achievable"  determination  take  into account  "the  impact  .  .  .  upon  the  operation  of  the  facility," 

$ 12181(9)(B). Surely a barrier-removal requirement under Title III that 
would  bring  a  vessel  into  noncompliance  with  the  Interna-tional  Convention  for  the  Safety  of  Life  at  Sea  (SOLAS), 
Nov. 1, 1974, [1979-1980] 32 U. S. T. 47, T. I. A. S. No. 9700, or any other international legal obligation, would create serious 
difficulties  for  the  vessel  and  would  have  a  substantial  im-

Opinion of the Court 
pact on its operation, and thus would not be "readily achiev-able."  This  understanding  of  the  statute,  urged  by  the 

United  States,  is  eminently  reasonable.  Brief  as  Amicus 
Curiae  27-28;  ADA  Title  III  Technical  Assistance  Manual 
III-1.2000(D)  (Supp.  1994),  available  at  http://www.usdoj. gov/crt/ada/taman3up.html  (as  visited  May  31,  2005,  and 

available  in  Clerk  of  Court's  case  file);  56  Fed.  Reg.  45600 
(1991).  If, moreover, Title III's "readily achievable" exemp-tion  were  not  to  take  conflicts  with  international  law  into 

account, it would lead to the anomalous result that American cruise  ships  are  obligated  to  comply  with  Title  III  even  if 
doing  so  brings  them  into  noncompliance  with  SOLAS, 
whereas  foreign  ships--which  unlike  American  ships  have 
the  benefit  of  the  internal  affairs  clear  statement  rule-- 
would  not  be  so  obligated.  Congress  could  not  have  in-
tended this result. 

It  is  logical  and  proper  to  conclude,  moreover,  that 
whether a barrier  modification is  "readily achievable"  under 
Title  III  must  take  into  consideration  the  modification's  ef-
fect  on  shipboard  safety.  A  separate  provision  of  Title  III 
mandates that the statute's nondiscrimination and accommo-
dation  requirements  do  not  apply  if  disabled  individuals 
would pose "a significant risk to the health or safety of others 
that cannot be eliminated by a modification of policies, prac-
tices,  or  procedures  or  by  the  provision  of  auxiliary  aids  or 
services," $ 12182(b)(3).  This reference is to a safety threat 
posed  by  a  disabled  individual,  whereas  here  the  question 
would be whether the structural modification itself may pose 
the safety threat.  It would be incongruous, nevertheless, to 
attribute to Congress an intent to require modifications that 
threaten  safety  to  others  simply  because  the  threat  comes 
not  from  the  disabled  person  but  from  the  accommodation 
itself.  The  anomaly  is  avoided  by  concluding  that  a  struc-
tural modification is not readily achievable within the mean-
ing of $ 12181(9) if it would pose a direct threat to the health 
or safety of others.

Opinion of the Court 
Stumpf entitled to resentencing had it not also considered the conviction 
invalid.  Likewise, the parties' briefing here, and the question on which 
this  Court  granted  certiorari,  largely  focused  on  the  conviction.  In 
these circumstances, it would be premature for this Court to resolve the 
merits of Stumpf's sentencing claim before giving the Sixth Circuit the 
opportunity  to  consider  in  the  first  instance  the  question  of  how  the 
prosecutor's conduct in the Stumpf and Wesley cases related to Stumpf 's 
death sentence in particular.  Pp. 187-188.

Opinion of the Court 
Ohio  Rev.  Code  Ann.  $ 2929.03  (Anderson  1982).*  The  case was  assigned  to  a  three-judge  panel  in  the  Court  of  Com-

mon Pleas. Rather  than  proceed  to  trial,  however,  Stumpf  and  the 
State  worked  out  a  plea  agreement:  Stumpf  would  plead guilty to aggravated murder and attempted aggravated mur-
der,  and  the  State  would  drop  most  of  the  other  charges; with  respect  to  the  aggravated  murder  charge,  Stumpf 
would  plead  guilty  to  one  of the  three  capital  specifications, with  the  State  dropping  the  other  two.  The  plea  was  ac-
cepted after a colloquy with the presiding judge, and after a hearing  in  which  the  panel  satisfied  itself  as  to  the  factual 
basis for the plea. Because the  capital specification  to which Stumpf  pleaded 
guilty left him eligible for the death penalty, a contested pen-alty  hearing  was  held  before  the  same  three-judge  panel. 
Stumpf 's  mitigation  case  was  based  in  part  on  his  difficult childhood, limited education, dependable work history, youth, 
and lack of prior serious offenses.  Stumpf 's principal argu-ment, however, was that he had participated in the plot only 
at  the  urging  and  under  the  influence  of Wesley,  that  it  was Wesley who had fired the fatal shots at Mrs. Stout, and that 
Stumpf 's  assertedly  minor  role  in  the  murder  counseled against  the  death  sentence.  See  $ 2929.04(B)(6)  (directing 
the  sentencer  to  consider  as  a  potential  mitigating  circum-stance, "[i]f the offender was a participant in the offense but 
not the principal offender, the degree of the offender's partic-ipation  in  the  offense").  The  State,  on  the  other  hand,  ar-
gued  that  Stumpf  had  indeed  shot  Mrs.  Stout.  Still,  while the  prosecutor  claimed  Stumpf 's  allegedly  primary  role  in 
the shooting as a special reason to reject Stumpf 's mitigation argument,  the  prosecutor  also  noted  that  Ohio  law  did  not 
restrict  the  death  penalty  to  those  who  commit  murder  by their own hands--an accomplice to murder could also receive

Opinion of the Court 
Eastman's  testimony,  and  the  prosecution's  endorsement  of that  testimony  in  Wesley's  trial,  cast  doubt  upon  Stumpf 's 

conviction  and  sentence.  The  State  (represented  again  by the  same  prosecutor  who  had  tried  both  Wesley's  case  and 
Stumpf 's  original  case)  disagreed.  According  to  the  prose-cutor,  the  court's  first task  was  to decide  whether the  East-
man testimony was sufficient to alter the court's prior deter-
mination  that  Stumpf  had  been  the  shooter.  Id.,

Respondents,  Integra  Lifesciences  I,  Ltd.,  and  the  Burn-ham  Institute,  own  five  patents  related  to  the  tripeptide 

sequence  Arg-Gly-Asp,  known  in  single-letter  notation  as the  "RGD  peptide."  U.  S.  Patent  Nos.  4,988,621,  4,792,525,

Opinion of the Court 
"[Petitioner]  does  not  need  to  show  that  the  informa-tion  gathered  from  a  particular  activity  was  actually 

submitted to the FDA. "  App.  57a (one paragraph break omitted). 

The jury found  that petitioner, Dr. Cheresh,  and  Scripps in-fringed  respondents'  patents  and  that  petitioner  had  failed 
to  show  that  its  activities  were  protected  by  $ 271(e)(1).  It awarded damages of $15 million. 

In  response  to  post-trial  motions,  the  District  Court  dis-missed  respondents'  suit  against  Dr.  Cheresh  and  Scripps, 
but affirmed the jury's damages award as supported by sub-stantial evidence, Civ. Action No. 961307 JMF (SD Cal., Mar. 
26,  2001),  App.  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  52a,  and  denied  petitioner's motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law,  Civ.  Action 
No.  96CV-1307  JMF  (SD  Cal.,  Mar.  6,  2001),  App.  to  Pet. for  Cert.  50a.  With  respect  to  the  last,  the  District  Court 
explained that the evidence was sufficient to show that "any connection  between  the  infringing  Scripps  experiments  and 
FDA  review  was  insufficiently  direct  to  qualify  for  the [$ 271(e)(1) exemption]."

Opinion of the Court 
Respondents  concede  the  breadth  of  $ 271(e)(1)  in  this  re-gard,  but  argue  that  the  only  preclinical  data  of  interest  to 

the  FDA  is  that  which  pertains  to  the  safety  of  the  drug  in humans.  In respondents' view, preclinical studies related to 
a drug's efficacy, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacology  are  not  reasonably  included  in  an  IND  or  an 
NDA, and are  therefore  outside the scope  of the  exemption. 
We  do  not  understand  the  FDA's  interest  in  information gathered  in  preclinical  studies  to  be  so  constrained.  To  be 

sure,  its  regulations  provide  that  the  agency's  "primary  ob-jectives  in  reviewing  an  IND  are  . . . to  assure  the  safety 
and rights of subjects," 21 CFR $ 312.22(a) (2005), but it does 
not follow that the FDA is not interested in reviewing infor-
mation  related  to  other  characteristics  of  a  drug.  To  the 
contrary, the FDA requires that applicants include in an IND 
summaries  of  the  pharmacological,  toxicological,  pharmaco-
kinetic, and biological qualities of the drug in animals.  See 

$ 312.23(a)(5);  U.  S.  Dept.  of  Health  and  Human  Services, 
Guidance  for  Industry,  Good  Clinical  Practice:  Consolidated 
Guidance 45 (Apr. 1996) ("The results of all relevant nonclini-

As we have noted, Ohio provides multiple levels of review 
for  any  decision  recommending  OSP  placement,  with  power 
to  overturn  the  recommendation  at  each  level.  In  addition 
to these safeguards, Ohio further reduces the risk of errone-
ous  placement  by  providing  for  a  placement  review  within 
30 days of an inmate's initial assignment to OSP.

ceptance of Woods, the one black juror, shows that race was not in play. 
When he was selected as  the eighth  juror,  the State had used  11 of its 
15  peremptory  challenges,  7  on  black  panel  members;  and  the  record 
shows that at least 3 of the remaining venire panel opposed capital pun-
ishment.  Because  the  prosecutors  had  to  exercise  prudent  restraint, 
the late-stage decision to accept a black panel member willing to impose 
the  death  penalty  does  not  neutralize  the  early-stage  decision  to  chal-
lenge a comparable venireman, Warren.  The Fifth Circuit's substituted 
reason for the elimination, Warren's general ambivalence about the pen-
alty,  was  erroneous  as  a  matter  of  fact  and  law.  As  to  fact,  Macaluso 
said nothing about general ambivalence, and Warren's answer to several 
questions was that he could impose the death penalty.  As for law, the

B 
The case for discrimination goes beyond these comparisons 
to include broader patterns of practice during the jury selec-
tion.  The prosecution's shuffling of the venire panel, its en-
quiry  into  views  on  the  death  penalty,  its  questioning  about 
minimum  acceptable  sentences:  all  indicate  decisions  prob-
ably  based  on  race.  Finally,  the  appearance  of  discrimina-
tion  is  confirmed  by  widely  known  evidence  of  the  general 
policy  of  the  Dallas  County  District  Attorney's  Office  to  ex-
clude  black  venire  members  from  juries  at  the  time  MillerEl's jury was selected. 

The  first  clue  to  the  prosecutors'  intentions,  distinct  from 
the peremptory challenges themselves, is their resort during

tors  were  trying,  the  argument  goes,  to  weed  out  noncom-mittal  or  uncertain  jurors,  not  black  jurors.  And  while 

some  white  venire  members  expressed  opposition  to  the death  penalty  on  their  questionnaires,  they  were  not  read 
the  graphic  script  because their  feelings were  already  clear. The State  says  that giving the  graphic  script  to these panel 
members would only have antagonized them.  Brief for Re-spondent 27-32.

worse in the instances of the five nonblacks who received the 
graphic script, missing the mark four times out of five: Vivian 
Sztybel and Filemon Zablan received it,21  although each was 
unambiguously  in  favor  of  the  death  penalty,22  while  Domi-
nick  Desinise  and  Clara  Evans  unambiguously  opposed  it 23 
but were given the graphic version.24 

The State's purported rationale  fails  again  if we look only 
to  the  treatment  of  ambivalent  panel  members,  ambivalent 
black  individuals  having  been  more  likely  to  receive  the 
graphic description than ambivalent nonblacks.  Three non-
black  members  of  the  venire  indicated  ambivalence  to  the 
death  penalty  on  their  questionnaires; 25  only  one  of  them,

Opinion of the Court 
The  same  is  true  for  another  kind  of  disparate  question-ing,  which  might  fairly  be  called  trickery.  The  prosecutors 

asked members  of the  panel how  low a  sentence they  would consider  imposing  for  murder.  Most  potential  jurors  were 
first told that Texas law provided for a minimum term of five years,  but  some  members  of  the  panel  were  not,  and  if  a 
panel member then  insisted on  a minimum above five years, 
the  prosecutor  would  suppress  his  normal  preference  for tough jurors and claim cause to strike.  Two Terms ago, we 

described  how  this  disparate  questioning  was  correlated with race: 

"Ninety-four  percent  of  whites  were  informed  of  the 
statutory  minimum  sentence,  compared  [with]  only 
twelve  and  a  half  percent  of  African-Americans.  No explanation  is  proffered  for  the  statistical  disparity.

Opinion of the Court 
Hence, only 27% of nonblacks questioned on the subject who expressed these views  were subjected to  the trick question, 

as against 100% of black members.  Once again, the implica-tion  of  race  in  the  prosecutors'  choice  of  questioning  cannot 
be explained away.36 There is a final body of evidence that confirms this conclu-
sion.  We know that for decades leading  up to the  time this case  was  tried  prosecutors  in  the  Dallas  County  office  had 
followed  a  specific  policy  of  systematically  excluding  blacks from juries, as we explained the last time the case was here.

Syllabus 
(b)  This  case  warrants  federal  jurisdiction.  Grable  premised  its  su-
perior title claim on the IRS's failure to give adequate notice, as defined 
by federal law.  Whether Grable received notice is an essential element 
of its quiet title claim, and the federal statute's meaning is actually dis-
puted.  The meaning of a federal tax provision is an important federal-
law issue that belongs in federal court.  The Government has a strong 
interest  in  promptly  collecting  delinquent  taxes,  and  the  IRS's  ability 
to  satisfy its  claims from  delinquents'  property requires  clear  terms  of 
notice to assure buyers like Darue that the IRS has good title.  Finally, 
because it will be the rare state title case that raises a federal-law issue, 
federal  jurisdiction  to  resolve  genuine  disagreement  over  federal  tax 
title  provisions  will  portend  only  a  microscopic  effect  on  the  federal-
state  division  of  labor.  This  conclusion  puts  the  Court  in  venerable 
company,  quiet  title  actions  having  been  the  subject  of  some  of  the 
earliest exercises of federal-question jurisdiction over state-law claims. 
E. g., Hopkins v.  Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490-491.  Pp. 314-316. 

(c)  Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.  Thompson, 478 U. S. 804, is 
not  to  the  contrary.  There,  in  finding  federal  jurisdiction  unavailable 
for a state tort claim resting in part on an allegation that the defendant 
drug company had violated a federal branding law, the Court noted that 
Congress  had  not  provided  a  private  federal  cause  of  action  for  such 
violations.  Merrell Dow cannot be read to make a federal cause of ac-
tion  a  necessary  condition  for  federal-question  jurisdiction.  It  dis-
claimed the adoption of any bright-line rule and expressly approved the 
exercise  of  jurisdiction  in  Smith,  where  there  was  no  federal  cause  of 
action.  Accordingly,  Merrell  Dow  should  be  read  in  its  entirety  as 
treating the absence of such cause as evidence relevant to, but not dis-
positive  of,  the  "sensitive  judgments  about  congressional  intent"  re-
quired  by  $ 1331.  Id.,  at  810.  In  Merrell  Dow,  the  principal  signifi-
cance of this absence was its bearing on the consequences to the federal 
system.  If the federal labeling standard without a cause of action could 
get a state claim into federal court, so could any other federal standards 
without  causes  of  action.  And  that  would  mean  an  enormous  number 
of  cases.  A  comparable  analysis  yields  a  different  jurisdictional  con-
clusion  here,  because  state  quiet  title  actions  rarely  involve  contested 
federal-law issues.  Pp. 316-320. 

377 F. 3d 592, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court 
had  passed,  the  Government  gave  Darue  a  quitclaim  deed, $ 6339. 

Five  years  later,  Grable  brought  a  quiet  title  action  in state  court,  claiming  that  Darue's  record  title  was  invalid 
because  the  IRS  had  failed  to  notify  Grable  of  its  seizure  of the  property  in  the  exact  manner  required  by  $ 6335(a), 
which  provides  that  written  notice  must  be  "given  by  the Secretary  to  the  owner  of  the  property  [or]  left  at  his  usual 
place  of  abode  or  business."  Grable  said  that  the  statute required personal service, not service by certified mail. 

Darue  removed  the  case  to  Federal  District  Court  as presenting  a  federal  question,  because  the  claim  of  title 
depended  on  the  interpretation  of  the  notice  statute  in  the federal tax law.  The District Court declined to remand the 
case at Grable's behest after finding that the "claim does pose a  `significant  question  of  federal  law,' "  Tr.  17  (Apr.  2,  2001), 
and  ruling  that  Grable's  lack  of  a  federal  right  of  action  to enforce  its  claim  against  Darue  did  not  bar  the  exercise  of 
federal jurisdiction.  On the merits, the  court granted  sum-mary judgment to Darue, holding that although $ 6335 by its 
terms required personal service, substantial compliance with the  statute  was  enough.  207  F.  Supp.  2d  694  (WD  Mich. 
2002). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth  Circuit affirmed.  377 
F.  3d  592  (2004).  On  the  jurisdictional  question,  the  panel thought it sufficed that the title claim raised an issue of fed-
eral law that had to be resolved, and implicated a substantial federal  interest  (in  construing  federal  tax  law).  The  court 
went on to affirm the District Court's judgment on the mer-its.  We  granted  certiorari  on  the  jurisdictional  question 
alone,1  543  U. S.  1042  (2005),  to  resolve  a  split  within  the Courts  of  Appeals  on  whether

Opinion of the Court 

a  federal  cause  of  action  as  a  condition  for  exercising federal-question jurisdiction.

2  We now affirm. 

II 
Darue was entitled to remove the quiet title action if Gra-ble could have brought  it in federal  district court originally, 

28 U. S. C. $ 1441(a), as a civil action "arising under the Con-stitution,  laws,  or  treaties  of  the  United  States,"  $ 1331. 
This provision for federal-question jurisdiction is invoked by and  large  by  plaintiffs  pleading  a  cause  of  action  created  by 
federal law (e. g., claims under  42 U. S. C.  $ 1983).  There  is, however,  another  longstanding,  if  less  frequently  encoun-
tered,  variety  of  federal  "arising  under"  jurisdiction,  this Court having recognized for nearly 100 years that in certain 
cases  federal-question  jurisdiction  will  lie  over  state-law claims  that  implicate  significant  federal  issues. 

E. g.,  Hop-kins v.  Walker, 244 U. S. 486, 490-491  (1917).  The doctrine 

captures the commonsense notion that a federal court ought to  be  able  to  hear  claims  recognized  under  state  law  that 
nonetheless turn on substantial questions of federal law, and thus  justify  resort  to  the  experience,  solicitude,  and  hope  of 
uniformity  that  a  federal  forum  offers  on  federal  issues,  see ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and 
Federal Courts 164-166 (1968). The classic example is 

Smith v.  Kansas City Title & Trust Co.,  255  U. S.  180  (1921),  a  suit  by  a  shareholder  claiming 

that the defendant corporation could not lawfully buy certain bonds  of  the  National  Government  because  their  issuance 
was  unconstitutional.  Although  Missouri  law  provided  the cause of action,  the  Court recognized  federal-question juris-
diction because the principal issue in the case was the federal constitutionality  of  the  bond  issue. 

Smith  thus  held,  in  a

federal-question jurisdiction over a state-law claim requires a parallel fed-
eral private right of action), with Ormet Corp. v.  Ohio Power Co., 98 F. 3d 
799, 806 (CA4 1996) (finding that a federal private action is not required).

Opinion of the Court 
somewhat  generous  statement  of  the  scope  of  the  doctrine, that a state-law claim could give  rise to federal-question ju-

risdiction so long as it "appears from the [complaint] that the right  to  relief  depends  upon  the  construction  or  application 
of [federal law]."  Id., at 199. The 

Smith  statement  has  been  subject  to  some  trimming 
to  fit  earlier  and  later  cases  recognizing  the  vitality  of  the 
basic  doctrine,  but  shying  away  from  the  expansive  view that mere need to apply federal law in a state-law claim will 

suffice  to  open  the  "arising  under"  door.  As  early  as  1912, this  Court  had  confined  federal-question  jurisdiction  over 
state-law  claims  to  those  that  "really  and  substantially  in-
volv[e] a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, con-
struction or effect of [federal] law."  Shulthis  v.  McDougal, 
225  U. S.  561,  569.  This  limitation  was  the  ancestor  of  Jus-
tice  Cardozo's  later  explanation  that  a  request  to  exercise 
federal-question  jurisdiction  over  a  state  action  calls  for  a 
"common-sense accommodation of judgment to [the] kaleido-
scopic situations" that present a federal issue, in "a selective 
process  which  picks  the  substantial  causes  out  of  the  web 
and lays the other ones aside."  Gully v.  First Nat. Bank in 
Meridian,  299  U. S.  109,  117-118  (1936).  It  has  in  fact  be-
come a constant refrain in such cases that federal jurisdiction 
demands not only a contested federal issue, but a substantial 
one,  indicating  a  serious  federal  interest  in  claiming  the  ad-
vantages  thought  to  be  inherent  in  a  federal  forum.  E. g., 
Chicago v.  International College of Surgeons, 522 U. S. 156, 
164 (1997); Merrell Dow, supra, at 814, and n. 12; Franchise 
Tax Bd. of Cal. v.  Construction Laborers Vacation Trust for 
Southern Cal., 463 U. S. 1, 28 (1983). 

But  even  when  the  state  action  discloses  a  contested  and 
substantial federal question, the exercise of federal jurisdic-
tion is subject to a possible veto.  For the federal issue will 
ultimately qualify for a federal forum only if federal jurisdic-
tion  is  consistent  with  congressional  judgment  about  the 
sound division of labor between state and federal courts gov-

erning  the  application  of  $ 1331.  Thus,  Franchise  Tax  Bd. 
explained that the appropriateness of a federal forum to hear 
an embedded issue could be evaluated only after considering 
the  "welter  of  issues  regarding  the  interrelation  of  federal 
and  state  authority  and  the  proper  management  of  the  fed-
eral  judicial  system."  Id.,  at  8.  Because  arising-under  ju-
risdiction to hear a state-law claim always raises the possibil-
ity  of  upsetting  the  state-federal  line  drawn  (or  at  least 
assumed)  by  Congress,  the  presence  of  a  disputed  federal 
issue  and  the  ostensible  importance  of  a  federal  forum  are 
never  necessarily  dispositive;  there  must  always  be  an  as-
sessment  of  any  disruptive  portent  in  exercising  federal  ju-
risdiction.  See also Merrell Dow, 478 U. S., at 810. 

These  considerations  have  kept  us  from  stating  a  "single, 
precise,  all-embracing"  test  for  jurisdiction  over  federal  is-
sues  embedded  in  state-law  claims  between  nondiverse  par-
ties.  Christianson v.  Colt  Industries  Operating  Corp.,  486

Opinion of the Court 
law.  Whether  Grable  was  given  notice  within  the  meaning of the federal statute is thus an essential element of its quiet 

title claim, and the meaning of the federal statute is actually in  dispute;  it  appears  to  be  the  only  legal  or  factual  issue 
contested in the case.  The meaning of the federal tax provi-sion is an important issue of federal law that sensibly belongs 
in a federal court.  The Government has a strong interest in the  "prompt  and  certain  collection  of  delinquent  taxes," 
United  States  v.  Rodgers,  461  U. S.  677,  709  (1983),  and  the ability  of  the  IRS  to  satisfy  its  claims  from  the  property  of 
delinquents  requires  clear  terms  of  notice  to  allow  buyers like Darue to satisfy themselves that the Service has touched 
the  bases  necessary  for  good  title.  The  Government  thus has  a direct  interest in the availability of a  federal forum  to 
vindicate  its  own  administrative  action,  and  buyers  (as  well as  tax  delinquents)  may  find  it  valuable  to  come  before 
judges  used to  federal tax  matters.  Finally, because  it  will be the  rare state  title  case  that  raises a  contested matter  of 
federal law, federal  jurisdiction to resolve genuine disagree-ment  over  federal  tax  title  provisions  will  portend  only  a 
microscopic effect on the federal-state division of labor.  See n. 3, infra. 

This  conclusion  puts  us  in  venerable  company,  quiet  title actions having been the subject of some of the earliest exer-
cises  of  federal-question  jurisdiction  over  state-law  claims. In  Hopkins,  244  U. S.,  at  490-491,  the  question  was  federal 
jurisdiction  over  a  quiet  title  action  based  on  the  plaintiffs' allegation  that  federal  mining  law  gave  them  the  superior 
claim.  Just as in this case, "the facts showing the plaintiffs' title  and  the  existence  and  invalidity  of  the  instrument  or 
record  sought  to  be  eliminated  as  a  cloud  upon  the  title  are essential  parts  of  the  plaintiffs'  cause  of  action." 

3  Id.,  at 

3 The  quiet  title  cases  also  show  the  limiting  effect  of  the  requirement 
that  the  federal  issue  in  a  state-law  claim  must  actually  be  in  dispute  to 
justify  federal-question  jurisdiction.  In  Shulthis  v.  McDougal, 225  U. S. 
561 (1912), this Court found that there was no federal-question jurisdiction

490.  As  in  this  case  again,  "it  is  plain  that  a  controversy respecting  the  construction  and  effect  of  the  [federal]  laws 

is  involved  and  is  sufficiently  real  and  substantial."  Id.,  at 489.  This  Court  therefore  upheld  federal  jurisdiction  in 
Hopkins,  as  well  as  in  the  similar  quiet  title  matters  of Northern  Pacific  R.  Co.  v.  Soderberg,  188  U. S.  526,  528 
(1903),  and  Wilson  Cypress  Co.  v.  Del  Pozo  y  Marcos,  236 U. S.  635,  643-644  (1915).  Consistent  with  those  cases,  the 
recognition of federal jurisdiction is in order here. 

B 
Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v.  Thompson, 478 U. S. 804  (1986),  on  which  Grable  rests  its  position,  is  not  to  the 

contrary.  Merrell Dow considered a state tort claim resting in  part  on  the  allegation  that  the  defendant  drug  company 
had violated a federal misbranding prohibition, and was thus presumptively  negligent  under  Ohio  law.  Id.,  at  806.  The 
Court assumed that federal law would have to be applied to resolve  the  claim,  but  after  closely  examining  the  strength 
of the federal interest at stake and the implications of open-ing  the  federal  forum,  held  federal  jurisdiction  unavailable. 
Congress  had  not  provided  a  private  federal  cause  of  action for  violation  of  the  federal  branding  requirement,  and  the 
Court  found  "it  would . . .  flout,  or  at  least  undermine,  con-gressional intent to conclude that federal courts might never-
theless  exercise  federal-question  jurisdiction  and  provide remedies for violations of that federal statute solely because 
the  violation  .  .  .  is  said  to  be  a  .  .  .  `proximate  cause'  under state law." 

Id., at 812. 

to  hear  a  plaintiff's  quiet  title  claim  in  part  because  the  federal  statutes 
on which title depended were not subject  to "any controversy  respecting 
their validity, construction,  or effect."  Id., at 570.  As  the  Court put  it, 
the  requirement  of  an  actual  dispute  about  federal  law  was  "especially" 
important  in  "suit[s]  involving rights  to land  acquired  under  a  law of  the 
United States," because otherwise "every suit to establish title to land in 
the  central  and  western  states  would  so  arise  [under  federal  law],  as  all 
titles in  those  States  are traceable  back  to  those  laws."  Id.,  at 569-570.

Opinion of the Court 
Because federal law provides  for no  quiet title action  that could  be  brought  against  Darue,

4  Grable  argues  that  there 

can be no federal jurisdiction here, stressing some broad lan-guage  in 

Merrell  Dow  (including  the  passage  just  quoted) 
that  on  its  face  supports  Grable's  positi on,  see  Note, Mr. 

Smith Goes to Federal Court: Federal Question Jurisdic-
tion over  State Law Claims  Post-Merrell  Dow, 115 Harv.  L. 
Rev. 2272, 2280-2282 (2002) (discussing split in Courts of Ap-peals over private right of action requirement after 

Merrell 
Dow).  But an opinion is to be read as a whole, and Merrell 
Dow  cannot be  read  whole  as  overturning  decades of  prece-
dent,  as  it  would  have  done  by  effectively  adopting  the Holmes  dissent  in 

Smith,  see  supra,  at  314,  and  converting 
a  federal  cause  of  action  from  a  sufficient  condition  for federal-question jurisdiction 

5  into a necessary one. 

In  the  first  place, Merrell  Dow  disclaimed  the  adoption  of any  bright-line  rule,  as  when  the  Court  reiterated  that  "in 

exploring  the  outer  reaches  of  $ 1331,  determinations  about 
federal  jurisdiction  require  sensitive  judgments  about  con-
gressional  intent,  judicial  power,  and  the  federal  system." 
478  U. S.,  at  810.  The  opinion  included  a  lengthy  footnote 
explaining  that  questions  of  jurisdiction  over  state-law 
claims require "careful judgments," id., at 814, about the "na-
ture  of  the  federal  interest  at  stake,"  id.,  at  814,  n.  12  (em-
phasis  deleted).  And  as  a  final  indication  that  it  did  not 
mean  to  make  a  federal  right  of  action  mandatory,  it  ex-
pressly  approved  the  exercise  of  jurisdiction  sustained  in 
Smith, despite the want of any federal cause of action avail-
able to Smith's shareholder plaintiff.  478 U. S., at 814, n. 12. 

4 Federal law does provide a quiet title cause of action against the Fed-
eral Government.  28 U. S. C. $ 2410.  That right of action is not relevant 
here, however, because the Federal Government no longer has any inter-
est in  the property,  having  transferred  its interest  to  Darue  through  the 
quitclaim deed. 

5 For an extremely rare exception to the sufficiency of a federal right of 

action, see Shoshone Mining Co. v.  Rutter, 177 U. S. 505, 507 (1900).

ENGINEERING  &  MFG. 

Opinion of the Court 

Merrell Dow then, did not toss out, but specifically retained, the  contextual  enquiry  that  had  been  Smith's  hallmark  for 

over  60  years.  At  the  end  of  Merrell  Dow,  Justice  Holmes was still dissenting. 

Accordingly, Merrell Dow should be read in its entirety as treating  the  absence  of  a  federal  private  right  of  action  as 
evidence  relevant  to,  but  not  dispositive  of,  the  "sensitive judgments  about  congressional  intent"  that  $ 1331  requires. 
The  absence  of  any  federal  cause  of  action  affected  Merrell 
Dow's  result  two  ways.  The  Court  saw  the  fact  as  worth some consideration in the assessment of substantiality.  But 

its primary importance emerged when the Court treated the combination of no federal cause of action and no preemption 
of  state  remedies  for  misbranding  as  an  important  clue  to Congress's conception of the scope of jurisdiction to be exer-
cised under $ 1331.  The  Court saw the missing cause of ac-tion  not  as  a  missing  federal  door  key,  always  required,  but 
as  a  missing  welcome  mat,  required  in  the  circumstances, when  exercising  federal  jurisdiction  over  a  state  misbrand-
ing  action  would  have  attracted  a  horde  of  original  filings 
and removal cases raising other state claims with embedded federal issues.  For  if the  federal  labeling standard  without 

a  federal cause  of  action  could get  a  state  claim into  federal court,  so  could any  other federal  standard without  a  federal 
cause  of  action.  And  that  would  have  meant  a  tremendous number of cases. 

One only needed to consider the treatment of federal viola-tions generally in garden variety state tort law.  "The viola-
tion  of  federal  statutes  and  regulations  is  commonly  given negligence  per  se  effect  in  state  tort  proceedings." 

6  Re-

6 Other jurisdictions treat a violation of a federal statute as evidence of 
negligence  or,  like  Ohio  itself  in  Merrell  Dow  Pharmaceuticals  Inc.  v. 
Thompson,  478  U. S.  804  (1986),  as  creating  a  rebuttable  presumption  of 
negligence.  Restatement  $ 14,  Reporters'  Note,  Comment  c,  at  196. 
Either approach could still implicate issues of federal law.

a,  p.  195  (Tent.  Draft  No.  1,  Mar.  28,  2001).  See  also  W. 
Keeton,  D.  Dobbs,  R.  Keeton,  &  D.  Owen,  Prosser  and  Kee-
ton  on  Law  of  Torts  $ 36,  p.  221,  n.  9  (5th  ed.  1984)  ("[T]he 
breach  of  a  federal  statute  may support  a  negligence  per  se 
claim  as  a  matter  of  state  law"  (collecting  authority)).  A 
general  rule  of  exercising  federal  jurisdiction  over  state 
claims resting on federal mislabeling and other statutory vio-
lations  would  thus  have  heralded  a  potentially  enormous 
shift  of  traditionally  state  cases  into  federal  courts.  Ex-
pressing  concern  over  the  "increased  volume  of  federal  liti-
gation,"  and  noting  the  importance  of  adhering  to  "legisla-
tive  intent,"  Merrell  Dow  thought  it  improbable  that  the 
Congress,  having  made  no  provision  for  a  federal  cause  of 
action, would have meant to welcome any state-law tort case 
implicating  federal  law  "solely  because  the  violation  of  the 
federal  statute  is  said  to  [create]  a  rebuttable  presumption 
[of  negligence] . . .  under  state  law."  478  U. S.,  at  811-812 
(internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  In  this  situation,  no 
welcome  mat  meant  keep  out.  Merrell  Dow's  analysis  thus 
fits  within  the  framework  of  examining  the  importance  of 
having  a  federal  forum  for  the  issue,  and  the  consistency 
of  such  a  forum  with  Congress's  intended  division  of  labor 
between state and federal courts. 

As already indicated, however, a  comparable analysis 
yields  a  different  jurisdictional  conclusion  in  this  case.  Al-
though  Congress  also  indicated  ambivalence  in  this  case  by 
providing  no  private  right  of  action  to  Grable,  it  is  the  rare 
state  quiet  title  action  that  involves  contested  issues  of  fed-
eral law, see n. 3, supra.  Consequently, jurisdiction over ac-
tions like Grable's would not materially affect, or threaten to 
affect, the  normal currents  of litigation.  Given  the  absence 
of threatening structural consequences and the clear interest 
the  Government,  its  buyers,  and  its  delinquents  have  in  the 
availability  of  a  federal  forum,  there  is  no  good  reason  to

tioners misplace their reliance on the Second Circuit's Santini decision, 
which held that parties who are forced to litigate their state-law takings 
claims  in  state  court  pursuant  to  Williamson  County  cannot  be  pre-
cluded from having those very claims resolved by a federal court.  The 
Santini  court's  reasoning  is  unpersuasive  for  several  reasons.  First, 
both  petitioners  and  Santini ultimately  depend  on  an  assumption  that 
plaintiffs  have  a  right  to  vindicate  their  federal  claims  in  a  federal 
forum.  This  Court  has  repeatedly  held  to  the  contrary.  See,  e. g., 
Allen v. McCurry, 449 U. S. 90, 103-104.  Second, petitioners' argument 
assumes  that  courts  may  simply  create  exceptions  to  $ 1738  wherever 
they  deem  them  appropriate.  However,  this  Court  has  held  that  no 
such exception will be recognized unless a later statute contains an ex-
press  or  implied  partial  repeal.  E. g.,  Kremer  v.  Chemical  Constr. 
Corp.,  456  U. S.  461,  468.  Congress  has  not  expressed  any  intent  to 
exempt  federal  takings  claims  from  $ 1738.  Third,  petitioners  have 
overstated Williamson County's reach  throughout this  litigation.  Be-
cause they were never required to ripen in state court their claim that 
the  city  ordinance  was  facially  invalid  for  failure  to  substantially  ad-
vance  a  legitimate  state  interest,  see  Yee  v.  Escondido,  503  U. S.  519, 
534,  they  could  have  raised  the  heart  of  their  facial  takings  challenges 
directly in federal court.  With respect to those federal claims that did 
require ripening, petitioners are incorrect that Williamson County pre-
cludes state courts from hearing simultaneously a plaintiff's request for 
compensation under state law together with a claim that, in the alterna-
tive, the denial of compensation would violate the Fifth Amendment of 
the Federal Constitution.  Pp. 341-348. 

364 F. 3d 1088, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court 
court  action.  In  order  to  avoid  the  bar  of  issue  preclusion, petitioners asked the District Court to exempt from $ 1738's 

reach  claims  brought  under  the  Takings  Clause  of  the  Fifth Amendment. 

Petitioners'  argument  is  predicated  on  Wi ll i amson County  Regional  Planning  Comm'n  v.  Hamilton  Bank  of 
Johnson  City,  473  U. S.  172  (1985),  which  held  that  takings 
claims  are  not  ripe  until  a  State  fails  "to  provide  adequate compensation  for  the  taking." 

Id.,  at  195.  Unless  courts 
disregard $ 1738 in takings cases, petitioners argue, plaintiffs will  be  forced  to  litigate  their  claims  in  state  court  without 

any realistic possibility of ever obtaining review in a federal forum.  The  Ninth  Circuit's  rejection of  this  argument  con-
flicted  with  the  Second  Circuit's  decision  in  Santini  v.  Con-
necticut Hazardous Waste Management Serv., 342 F. 3d 118 
(2003).  We  granted  certiorari  to  resolve  the  conflict,  543 U. S.  1032  (2004),

1  and  now  affirm  the  judgment  of  the 

Ninth Circuit. 

I 

The  San  Remo  Hotel  is  a  three-story,  62-unit  hotel  in  the Fisherman's  Wharf  neighborhood  in  San  Francisco.  In  De-

cember 1906, shortly after the great earthquake and fire de-stroyed  most  of  the  City,  the  hotel--then  called  the  "New 
California  Hotel"--opened  its  doors  to  house  dislocated  in-
dividuals,  immigrants,  artists,  and  laborers.  The  City  offi-cially  licensed  the  facility  to  operate  as  a  hotel  and  restau-

rant  in  1916,  and  in  1922  the  hotel  was  given  its  current 

1 Although  petitioners  asked  this  Court  to  review  two  separate  ques-
tions,  our  grant  of  certiorari  was  limited  exclusively  to  the  question 
whether "a Fifth Amendment Takings claim [is] barred by issue preclusion 
based on a judgment denying compensation solely under state law, which 
was  rendered  in  a  state  court  proceeding  that  was  required  to  ripen  the 
federal  Takings  claim?"  Pet.  for  Cert.  i.  Thus,  we  have  no  occasion  to 
reach  petitioners'  claim  that,  under  California  law,  the  substantive  state 
takings law decision of the California Supreme Court was not entitled  to 
preclusive effect in federal court.  See Brief for Petitioners 19-21.

Opinion of the Court 
that  all  of  the  rooms  in  the  hotel  were  "residential"  units.2 The  consequence  of  that  initial  classification  was  that  the 

City  zoned  the  San  Remo  Hotel  as  "residential  hotel"--in other  words,  a  hotel  that  consisted  entirely  of  residential 
units.  And  that  zoning  determination  ultimately  meant that, despite the fact that the San Remo Hotel had operated 
in  practice  as  a  tourist  hotel  for  many  years,  145  F.  3d,  at 1100, petitioners were required to apply for a conditional use 
permit  to  do  business  officially  as  a  "tourist  hotel,"  San 
Remo  Hotel,  L.  P.  v.  City  and  County  of  San  Francisco,  27 Cal. 4th 643, 654, 41 P. 3d 87, 94 (2002). 

After the HCO was revised in 1990, petitioners applied to convert  all  of  the  rooms  in  the  San  Remo  Hotel  into  tourist 
use rooms under the relevant HCO provisions and requested a  conditional  use  permit  under  the  applicable  zoning  laws. 
In  1993,  the  City  Planning  Commission  granted  petitioners' requested  conversion  and  conditional  use  permit,  but  only 
after  imposing several  conditions,  one of  which  included  the requirement  that  petitioners  pay  a  $567,000  "in  lieu"  fee.

3 

Petitioners  appealed,  arguing  that  the  HCO  requirement was  unconstitutional  and  otherwise  improperly  applied  to 

their hotel.  See id., at 656, 41 P. 3d, at 95.  The City Board of Supervisors rejected petitioners' appeal on April 19, 1993. 

2 It seems that despite this initial classification, the San Remo Hotel has 
operated as a  mixed hotel for tourists and  long-term residents since long 
before  the  HCO  was  enacted.  According  to  the  California  Supreme 
Court, in "a 1992 declaration by [petitioners], Iribarren filed the `incorrect' 
initial  unit  usage  report  without  their  knowledge.  They  first  discovered 
the report in 1983 when they resumed operation of the hotel.  They pro-
tested the residential use classification in 1987, but were told it could not 
be  changed  because  the  appeal  period  had  passed."  San  Remo  Hotel, 
L.  P. v.  City and County of  San Francisco, 27 Cal. 4th 643, 654, 41 P. 3d 
87, 94 (2002). 

3 The  application  specifically  required  petitioners  (1)  to  pay  for  40  per-

cent  of  the  cost  of  replacement  housing  for  the  62  lost  residential  units; 
(2) to offer lifetime leases to any then-current residential users; and (3) to 
"obtain  variances  from  floor-area  ratio  and  parking  requirements."  Id., 
at 656, 41 P. 3d, at 95.

Opinion of the Court 
soned, was "ripe the instant the 1990 HCO was enacted," id., 
at 1102, and appropriate for  Pullman abstention principally 
because  petitioners'  "entire  case"  hinged  on  the  propriety 
of the planning commission's zoning designation--the precise 
subject  of  the  pending  state  mandamus  action,  145  F.  3d,  at 
1105.5  The court, however, affirmed the District Court's de-
termination  that  petitioners'  as-applied  takings  claim--the 
claim that the application of the HCO to the San Remo Hotel 
violated the Takings Clause--was unripe.  Because petition-
ers  had  failed  to  pursue  an  inverse  condemnation  action  in 
state court,  they had not  yet been denied just compensation 
as contemplated by Williamson County.  145 F. 3d, at 1105. 

At  the conclusion  of the  Ninth Circuit's  opinion,  the  court 
appended  a  footnote  stating  that  petitioners  would  be  free 
to raise their federal takings claims in the California courts. 
If,  however,  they  wanted  to  "retain  [their]  right  to  return 
to  federal  court  for  adjudication  of  [their]  federal  claim, 
[they] must make an appropriate reservation in state court." 
Id.,  at  1106,  n.  7.6  That  is  precisely  what  petitioners  at-
tempted  to  do  when  they  reactivated  the  dormant  Califor-
nia  case.  Yet  petitioners  advanced  more  than  just  the 
claims on which the federal court had abstained, and phrased 
their  state claims  in language  that sounded  in  the  rules and 
standards established and refined by this Court's takings ju-
risprudence.  Petitioners claimed, for instance, that "imposi-
tion  of  the  fee  `fails  to  substantially  advance  a  legitimate 
government  interest'  and  that  `[t]he  amount  of  the  fee  im-
posed  is  not  roughly  proportional  to  the  impact'  of  the  pro-
posed  tourist  use  of  the  San  Remo  Hotel."  27  Cal.  4th,  at 
656,  41  P.  3d,  at  95  (quoting  petitioners'  second  amended 

5 The Court  of Appeals did not  answer the question whether this claim 
was  barred  by  the  statute  of  limitations,  as  the  District  Court  had  held. 

6 The reservation discussed in the Ninth Circuit's opinion was the com-

mon reservation of federal claims made in state litigation under England 
v.  Louisiana Bd. of Medical Examiners, 375 U. S. 411, 420-421 (1964).

Opinion of the Court 
relevant  decisions  of  both  this  court  and  the  United  States 
Supreme Court."  Ibid., 41 P. 3d, at 101.10 

The  principal  constitutional  issue  debated  by  the  parties 
was  whether  a  heightened  level  of  scrutiny  applied  to  the 
claim  that  the  housing  replacement  fee  " `does  not  substan-
tially  advance  legitimate  state  interests.' "  Ibid.  (quoting 
Lucas  v.  South  Carolina  Coastal  Council,  505  U. S.  1003, 
1016  (1992)).  In  resolving  that  debate  the  court  focused  on 
our  opinions  in  Nollan  v.  California  Coastal  Comm'n,  483 
U. S.  825  (1987),  and  Dolan  v.  City  of  Tigard,  512  U. S.  374 
(1994).  Rejecting  petitioners'  argument  that  heightened 
scrutiny  should  apply,  the  court  emphasized  the  distinction 
between  discretionary  exactions  imposed  by  executive  offi-
cials  on  an  ad  hoc  basis  and  " `generally  applicable  zoning 
regulations' "  involving  " `legislative  determinations.' "  27 
Cal.  4th,  at  666-668,  41  P.  3d,  at  102-104  (quoting,  e. g., 
Dolan,  512  U. S.,  at  385,  391,  n.  8).  The  court  situated  the 
HCO within the latter category, reasoning that the ordinance 
relied upon fixed fees computed under a formula that is gen-
erally applicable to broad classes of property owners.11  The 
court  concluded  that  the  less  demanding  "reasonable  rela-
tionship"  test  should  apply  to  the  HCO's  monetary  assess-
ments, 27 Cal. 4th, at 671, 41 P. 3d, at 105. 

10 See also id., at 665, 41 P. 3d, at 101 ("[I]t is the last mentioned prong of 
the high court's takings analysis that is at issue here" (emphasis added)). 

11 See  id.,  at  669,  41  P.  3d,  at  104  (noting  that  the  "HCO  is  generally 

applicable  legislation  in  that  it  applies,  without  discretion  or  discrimina-
tion,  to  every  residential  hotel  in  the  city"  and  that  "no  meaningful  gov-
ernment  discretion  enters  into  either  the  imposition  or  the  calculation  of 
the in lieu fee").  The court noted that the general class of property own-
ers  included  more  than  500  properties  containing  over  18,000  rooms,  id., 
at 669, n. 12, 41 P. 3d, at 104, n. 12, and concluded that the HCO "applies 
to all property in the class logically subject to its strictures, that is, to all 
residential  hotel  units;  no  more  can  rationally  be  demanded  of  local  land 
use  legislation  in  order  to  qualify  for  deferential  review,"  id.,  at  669,  41 
P. 3d, at 104.

Opinion of the Court 
86a.13  The  District  Court  reasoned  that  28  U. S. C.  $ 1738 requires federal courts to give preclusive effect to any state-

court  judgment  that  would  have  preclusive  effect  under the  laws  of  the  State  in  which  the  judgment  was  rendered. 
Because  California  courts  had  interpreted  the  relevant  sub-stantive  state  takings  law  coextensively  with  federal  law, 
petitioners'  federal  claims  constituted  the  same  claims  that had already been resolved in state court. 

The  Court  of  Appeals  affirmed.  The  court  rejected  peti-tioners'  contention  that  general  preclusion  principles  should 
be cast aside whenever plaintiffs "must litigate in state court pursuant  to 

Pullman  and/or  Williamson  County."  364 F.  3d  1088,  1096  (CA9  2004).  Relying  on  unambiguous  Cir-

cuit  precedent  and  the  absence  of  any  clearly  contradictory decisions  from  this  Court,  the  Court  of  Appeals  found  itself 
bound  to  apply  general  issue  preclusion  doctrine.  Given that  general  issue  preclusion  principles  governed,  the  only 
remaining question was whether the District Court properly applied  that  doctrine;  the  court  concluded  that  it  did.  The 
court  expressly  rejected  petitioners'  contention  "that  Cali-
fornia  takings  law  is  not  coextensive  with  federal  takings law," 

ibid.,  and  held  that  the  state  court's  application  of  the 
"reasonable  relationship"  test  was  an  " `equivalent  determi-nation'  of  such  claims  under  the  federal  takings  clause," 

id., 
at 1098.14  We granted certiorari and now affirm. 

13 The  District  Court  found  that  most  of  petitioners'  as-applied  claims 
amounted to nothing more than improperly labeled facial challenges.  See 
App. to  Pet.  for Cert.  82a-85a.  The remainder  of  petitioners' as-applied 
claims,  the  court  held,  was  barred  by  the  statute  of  limitations.  Id.,  at 
84a-85a. 

14 California courts apply issue preclusion to a final judgment in earlier 

litigation  between  the  same  parties  if  "(1)  the  issue  decided  in  the  prior 
case is identical with the one now presented; (2) there was a final judgment 
on  the  merits  in  the  prior  case,  and  (3)  the  party  to  be  estopped  was  a 
party to the prior adjudication."  364 F. 3d, at 1096.  The court reasoned 
that  the  California  Supreme  Court's  decision  satisfied  those  criteria  be-
cause petitioners' takings challenges "raised in state court are identical to

every system of jurisprudence, not only from its obvious fit-ness  and  propriety,  but  because  without  it,  an  end  could 

never  be  put  to  litigation."  Hopkins  v.  Lee,  6  Wheat.  109, 114 (1821).  This Court has explained that the rule 

"is  demanded  by  the  very  object  for  which  civil  courts have been  established, which is to secure the peace and 
repose  of  society  by  the  settlement  of  matters  capable of  judicial  determination.  Its  enforcement  is  essential 
to the maintenance of social order; for, the aid of judicial tribunals  would  not  be  invoked  for  the  vindication  of 
rights of person and property, if, as between parties and their  privies,  conclusiveness  did  not  attend  the  judg-
ments  of  such  tribunals  in  respect  of  all  matters  prop-erly  put  in  issue  and  actually  determined  by  them." 
Southern  Pacific  R.  Co.  v.  United  States,  168  U. S.  1, 49 (1897). 

As this case is presented to us, under our limited grant of certiorari,  we  have  only  one  narrow  question  to  decide: 
whether  we  should  create  an  exception  to  the  full  faith  and credit  statute,  and  the  ancient  rule  on  which  it  is  based,  in 
order  to  provide  a  federal  forum  for  litigants  who  seek  to advance  federal  takings  claims  that  are  not  ripe  until  the 
entry  of  a  final  state  judgment  denying  just  compensation. See 

Williamson County, 473 U. S. 172.18 

How. 333, 341  (1861); see also id., at 343 (noting that the rule  also has its 
pedigree "[i]n  the courts upon  the continent of  Europe,  and in the courts 
of chancery and admiralty in the United States and Great Britain, where 
the function of adjudication is performed entire by a tribunal composed of 
one or more judges . . . ").  

18 We  did  not  grant  certiorari  on  many  of  the  issues  discussed  by  the 

parties and amici.  We therefore assume for purposes of our decision that 
all other issues in this protracted controversy have been correctly decided. 
We assume, for instance, that the Ninth Circuit properly interpreted Cali-
fornia  preclusion  law;  that  the  California  Supreme  Court  was  correct  in 
its  determination  that  California  takings  law  is  coextensive  with  federal 
law; that,  as a matter of California law,  the HCO was lawfully  applied to

Opinion of the Court 
decide  a  preliminary  and  essential  question  of  state  law-- namely, whether the state statute applied at all to chiroprac-

tors.  375 U. S., at 413.19  The state court, however, reached beyond  the  state-law  question  and  held  not  only  that  the 
statute  applied  to  the  plaintiffs  but  also  that  its  application 
was consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Fed-
eral  Constitution.  The  Federal  District  Court  then  dis-
missed  the  federal  action  without  addressing  the  merits  of 
the federal claim. 

On appeal, we held that when a federal court abstains from 
deciding  a  federal  constitutional  issue  to  enable  the  state 
courts to address an antecedent state-law issue, the plaintiff 
may reserve his right to return to federal court for the dispo-
sition  of  his  federal  claims.  Id.,  at  419.  In  that  case,  the 
antecedent  state  issue  requiring  abstention  was  distinct 
from  the  reserved  federal  issue.  See  id.,  at  418-419.  Our 
discussion of the "typical case" in which reservations of fed-
eral issues are appropriate makes clear that our holding was 
limited  to  cases  that  are  fundamentally  distinct  from  peti-
tioners'.  "Typical" England cases generally involve federal 
constitutional  challenges  to  a  state  statute  that  can  be 
avoided if a state court construes the statute in a particular 
manner.20  In such cases, the purpose of abstention is not to 
afford state courts an opportunity to adjudicate an issue that 
is functionally identical to the federal question.  To the con-
trary, the purpose of Pullman abstention in such cases is to 
avoid resolving the federal question by encouraging a state-
law  determination  that  may  moot  the  federal  controversy. 

19 We stressed in England that abstention was essential to  prevent the 
district court from deciding " `questions of constitutionality on the basis of 
preliminary guesses regarding local law.' "  375 U. S., at 416, n. 7 (quoting 
Spector Motor Service, Inc. v.  McLaughlin, 323 U. S. 101, 105 (1944)).

Petitioners, however, chose to advance broader issues than the  limited  issues  contained  within  their  state  petition  for 
writ of administrative mandamus on which the Ninth Circuit relied  when  it  invoked  Pullman  abstention.  In  their  state 
action, petitioners advanced not only their request for a writ of administrative mandate, 27 Cal. 4th, at 653, 41 P. 3d, at 93, 
but  also  their  various  claims  that  the  HCO  was  unconstitu-tional on its face and as applied for (1) its failure to substan-
tially  advance  a  legitimate  interest,  (2)  its  lack  of  a  nexus between the required fees and the ultimate objectives sought 
to be achieved via the ordinance, and (3) its imposition of an undue economic burden on individual property owners. 

Id., at 672-676, 41 P. 3d, at 106-109.  By broadening their  state 

action  beyond  the  mandamus  petition  to  include  their  "sub-stantially advances" claims, petitioners effectively asked the 
state  court  to  resolve  the  same  federal  issues  they  asked  it to  reserve. 

England  does  not  support  the  exercise  of  any such right. 

Petitioners'  as-applied  takings  claims  fare  no  better.  As an  initial  matter,  the  Court  of  Appeals  did  not  abstain  with 
respect  to  those  claims.  Instead,  the  court  found  that  they were  unripe  under  Williamson  County.  The  court  there-
fore  affirmed  the  District  Court's  dismissal  of  those  claims. 145  F.  3d,  at  1106.  Unlike  their  "substantially  advances" 
claims, petitioners' as-applied claims were never properly be-fore  the  District  Court,  and  there  was  no  reason  to  expect 
that they could be relitigated in full if advanced in the state proceedings.  See  Allen,  449  U.  S.,  at  101,  n.  17.  In  short, 
our opinion in England does not support petitioners' attempt to circumvent $ 1738. 

IV 
Petitioners'  ultimate  submission,  however,  does  not  rely on 

England  alone.  Rather,  they  argue  that  federal  courts simply  should  not  apply  ordinary  preclusion  rules  to  state-

Opinion of the Court 
lation by bringing a suit for damages under 42 U. S. C. $ 1983 against  the  officers  who  had  entered  his  home.  Relying  on 

" `the special role of federal courts in protecting civil rights' " and the fact that $ 1983 provided the "only route to a federal 
forum," the Court of Appeals held that McCurry was entitled to  a  federal  trial  unencumbered  by  collateral  estoppel.  449 
U. S., at 93.  We rejected that argument emphatically. 

"The  actual  basis  of  the  Court  of  Appeals'  holding  ap-pears to be a generally framed principle that every per-

son asserting a federal right is entitled to one unencum-bered  opportunity  to  litigate  that  right  in  a  federal 
district  court,  regardless  of  the  legal  posture  in  which the  federal  claim  arises.  But  the  authority  for  this 
principle is difficult to discern.  It cannot lie in the Con-stitution, which makes no such guarantee, but leaves the 
scope of the  jurisdiction of the federal district courts to the  wisdom  of  Congress.  And  no  such  authority  is  to 
be  found  in  $ 1983  itself  .  .  .  .  There  is,  in  short,  no reason  to  believe  that  Congress  intended  to  provide  a 
person claiming a federal right an unrestricted opportu-nity to relitigate an issue already decided in state court 
simply  because  the  issue  arose  in  a  state  proceeding  in which  he  would  rather  not  have  been  engaged  at  all." 
Id., at 103-104 (footnote omitted).24 
As  in  Allen,  we  are  presently  concerned  only  with  issues 
actually  decided  by  the  state  court  that  are  dispositive  of federal claims raised under $ 1983.  And, also as in 

Allen, it 

24 We expressed similar views in Migra v.  Warren City School Dist. Bd. 
of Ed., 465 U. S. 75, 84 (1984): 

"Although such a division may seem attractive from a plaintiff's perspec-
tive,  it  is  not  the  system  established  by  $ 1738.  That  statute  embodies 
the  view  that  it  is  more  important  to  give  full  faith  and  credit  to  state-
court  judgments  than  to  ensure  separate  forums  for  federal  and  state 
claims.  This  reflects  a  variety  of  concerns,  including  notions  of  comity, 
the need to prevent vexatious litigation, and a desire to conserve judicial 
resources."

Opinion of the Court 
at 468 (citing Allen, 449 U. S., at 99).  Even when the plain-
tiff 's  resort  to  state  court  is  involuntary  and  the  federal 
interest  in  denying  finality  is  robust,  we  have  held  that 
Congress  "must  `clearly  manifest'  its  intent  to  depart  from 

$ 1738."  456 U. S., at 477. 

The  same  concerns  animate  our  decision  here.  Congress 
has  not  expressed  any  intent  to  exempt  from  the  full  faith 
and credit statute federal takings claims.  Consequently, we 
apply  our  normal  assumption  that  the  weighty  interests  in 
finality  and  comity  trump  the  interest  in  giving  losing  liti-
gants  access  to  an  additional  appellate  tribunal.  As  we  ex-
plained  in  Federated  Department  Stores,  Inc.  v.  Moitie, 452 
U. S. 394 (1981): 

"[W]e  do  not  see  the  grave  injustice  which  would  be 
done by the application of accepted principles of res judi-
cata.  `Simple justice' is achieved when a complex body 
of law developed over a period of years is evenhandedly 
applied.  The doctrine of res judicata serves vital public 
interests  beyond  any  individual  judge's  ad  hoc  determi-
nation of the equities in a particular case.  There is sim-
ply  `no  principle  of  law  or  equity  which  sanctions  the 
rejection  by  a  federal  court  of  the  salutary  principle  of 
res judicata.' "   Id., at 401 (quoting Heiser v.  Woodruff, 
327 U. S. 726, 733 (1946)). 

Third,  petitioners  have  overstated  the  reach  of  William-
son  County  throughout  this  litigation.  Petitioners  were 
never  required  to  ripen  the  heart  of  their  complaint--the 
claim  that  the  HCO  was  facially  invalid  because  it  failed  to 
substantially  advance  a  legitimate  state  interest--in  state 
court.  See  Yee  v.  Escondido,  503  U. S.  519,  534  (1992). 
Petitioners  therefore  could  have  raised  most  of  their  facial 
takings  challenges,  which  by  their  nature  requested  relief 
distinct  from  the  provision  of  "just  compensation,"  directly

final decision regarding the  application  of the  regulations  to the  property  at  issue."  473  U. S.,  at  186.  As  a  conse-

quence,  there  is  scant  precedent  for  the  litigation  in  federal district  court  of  claims  that  a  state  agency  has  taken  prop-
erty  in  violation  of  the  Fifth  Amendment's  Takings  Clause. To  the  contrary,  most  of  the  cases  in  our  takings  jurispru-
dence,  including  nearly  all  of  the  cases  on  which  petitioners 
rely,  came  to  us  on  writs  of  certiorari  from  state  courts  of last resort.

26 

Moreover, this is not the only area of law in which we have recognized  limits  to  plaintiffs'  ability  to  press  their  federal 

claims in federal courts.  See, e. g., Fair Assessment in Real 
Estate Assn., Inc. v.  McNary, 454 U. S. 100, 116 (1981) (hold-
ing  that  taxpayers  are  "barred  by  the  principle  of  comity from asserting $ 1983 actions against the validity of state tax 

systems  in  federal  courts").  State  courts  are  fully  compe-tent  to  adjudicate  constitutional  challenges  to  local  land-use 
decisions.  Indeed,  state  courts  undoubtedly  have  more  ex-
perience than federal courts do in resolving the complex fac-
tual,  technical,  and  legal  questions  related  to  zoning  and 
land-use regulations. 

At base, petitioners' claim amounts to little more than the 
concern  that  it  is  unfair  to  give  preclusive  effect  to  state-
court  proceedings  that  are  not  chosen,  but  are  instead  re-
quired  in  order  to  ripen  federal  takings  claims.  Whatever 
the  merits  of that  concern may  be,  we are  not  free  to disre-
gard  the  full  faith  and  credit  statute  solely  to  preserve  the 
availability  of  a  federal  forum.  The  Court  of  Appeals  was 
correct  to  decline  petitioners'  invitation  to  ignore  the  re-

26 See,  e. g.,  Dolan,  512  U. S.,  at  383;  Yee,  503  U. S.,  at  526;  Nollan,  483

U. S.,  at  120-122.  Indeed,  Justice  Holmes'  famous  "too far"  formulation, 
which spawned our regulatory takings jurisprudence, was announced in a 
case  that  came  to  this  Court  via  a  writ  of  certiorari  to  Pennsylvania's 
highest court.  Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U. S. 393, 415 (1922).

seeking  to  assert  that  right  will  have  one  year  from  this Court's  decision  within  which  to  file  his  $ 2255  motion.  He 

may  take  advantage  of  the  date  in  the  first  clause  of  || 6(3) only if the conditions in the second clause are met. 

We recognize that the statute of limitations in || 6(3) makes it  difficult  for  applicants  filing  second  or  successive  $ 2255 
motions  to  obtain  relief.  The  limitation  period  in  || 6(3)  ap-
plies  to  "all  motions"  under  $ 2255,  initial  motions  as  well as second or successive ones.  Section 2255, || 8(2), narrowly 

restricts  an  applicant's  ability  to  file  a  second  or  successive motion.  An applicant may file a second or successive motion 
only in limited circumstances, such as where he seeks to take advantage of "a new rule of constitutional law, made retroac-
tive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was  previously  unavailable."  $ 2255,  || 8(2).  Dodd  points 
out that this Court rarely decides that a new rule is retroac-tively applicable within one year of initially recognizing that 
right.  Thus,  because  of  the  interplay  between  |||| 8(2)  and 6(3),  an  applicant  who  files  a  second  or  successive  motion 
seeking to take advantage of a new rule of constitutional law 
will  be  time  barred  except  in  the  rare  case  in  which  this Court announces a new rule of constitutional law and makes 

it retroactive within one year. 

Although  we  recognize  the  potential  for  harsh  results  in 
some cases, we are not free to rewrite the statute that Con-
gress  has  enacted.  "[W]hen  the  statute's  language  is  plain, 
the sole function of the courts--at least where the disposition 
required by the text is not absurd--is to enforce it according 
to  its  terms."  Hartford

Opinion of the Court 
The  notion  that  defense  counsel  must  obtain  information that  the  State  has  and  will  use  against  the  defendant  is  not 

simply  a  matter  of  common  sense.  As  the  District  Court points  out,  the  American  Bar  Association  Standards  for 
Criminal Justice in circulation at the time of Rompilla's trial describes the obligation in terms no one could misunderstand 
in the circumstances of a case like this one: 

"It is the duty of the lawyer to conduct a prompt investi-gation  of  the  circumstances  of  the  case  and  to  explore 

all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case  and  the  penalty  in  the  event  of  conviction.  The 
investigation should always include efforts to secure in-formation  in  the  possession  of  the  prosecution  and  law 
enforcement authorities.  The duty to investigate exists regardless  of  the  accused's  admissions  or  statements  to 
the  lawyer  of  facts  constituting  guilt  or  the  accused's stated  desire  to  plead  guilty."  1  ABA  Standards  for 
Criminal Justice 4-4.1 (2d ed. 1982 Supp.).6 
"[W]e  long  have  referred  [to  these  ABA  Standards]  as `guides  to  determining  what  is  reasonable.' "

cause  that  date  will  precede  the  retaliatory  conduct,  their reading  starts  the  time  limit  running  before  the  retaliation 
action accrues.  Even more oddly, their reading allows a re-taliation action to be time barred before it ever accrues--for 
example, if the employer discovers more than six years after the  suspected  violation  of  $ 3729  that  an  employee  aided  in 
investigating  that  fraud,  then  retaliates.  As  we  have  dis-cussed, $ 3731(b)(1)'s text permits a  construction that  avoids

2d,  at  803-804.  The  record  does  show,  for  example,  that some  interstate  trucks  "top  off "  some  interstate  hauls  with 

intrastate pickups and deliveries.  See Brief for Intervening Plaintiffs-Appellants in Nos. 226052, 226122 (Ct. App. Mich.),

questions  as:  How  often  does  "topping  off "  occur  across  the industry?  Does  the  $100  charge  make  a  difference  by  sig-

nificantly  discouraging  interstate  carriers  from  engaging  in "topping  off "?  Does  the  possibility  of  obtaining  a  72-hour 
intrastate permit for $10 alleviate the alleged problem?  See

Opinion of the Court 
That  is,  we  can  find  no  indication  that  Congress  sought  to 
use this narrowly focused statute to forbid state fee or regis-
tration  obligations  that have  nothing  to  do with  basic SSRS 
(or earlier "bingo card") objectives--say, for example, a State 
Registration requirement related to compliance by interstate 
carriers  with  rules  governing  the  introduction  of  foreign 
pests  into  the  jurisdiction,  or  with  a  State's  version  of  the 
Amber Alert system, or with size, weight, and safety stand-
ards.  The  Constitution's  Commerce  Clause  may  (or  may 
not) forbid some such rules.  But this statute--which identi-
fies  and  regulates  very  specific  items--says  nothing  about 
them, and there is no reason to believe that Congress wished 
to resolve that

Opinion of the Court 
owner will have violated any other provision of Michigan law. See $ 478.7(4).  And they have not demonstrated that Michi-

gan law in practice holds hostage a truck owner's SSRS com-pliance until the owner pays $ 478.2(2)'s $100 fee. 

On the other hand, we recognize that Michigan form RS-2, the  form  that  lists  all  SSRS-participating  States  together 
with  their  SSRS-related  fees,  places  an  asterisk  next  to Michigan and  states that  "[v]ehicles  base-plated in Michigan 
need  not"  pay  any  SSRS  fee  but  "are  required  to  have  a $100.00"  Michigan  decal.  App.  67.  Michigan  thereby  for-
gives  Michigan-plated  interstate  trucks  (which  must  pay Michigan  $100)  payment  of  the  $10  Michigan  SSRS  fee  that 
would otherwise be due.  And to that extent, there is a con-nection between the $100 fee and the SSRS. 

Michigan  appears  to  forgive  its  $10  SSRS  fee,  however, only  for  the  Michigan-plated  interstate  trucks  of  a  carrier 
that  has  chosen  Michigan  as  its  SSRS  "base"  State.  See Reply  Brief  for  Petitioners  14-15,  n.  8.  Michigan-plated 
trucks  operating  out  of  a  different  SSRS  base  State,  say, Ohio,  must  pay  the  fee,  which  is  remitted  back  to  Michigan. 
Thus,  the  $10  reduction  can  be  seen  simply  as  an  effort  to provide modest, administratively efficient (because Michigan 
itself is handling both fees) recompense to those motor carri-ers that operate Michigan-plated trucks and choose Michigan 
as  their  SSRS  base  State.  That  subsidiary  connection  can-not transform Michigan's $100 fee, which exclusively involves 
non-SSRS  subject  matter  (and  was  created  for  non-SSRS-related  reasons),  into  a  requirement  that  concerns  the  sub-
ject matter of the SSRS statute. 

* * * 
For  these  reasons,  we  conclude  that  49  U. S. C.  $ 14504(b) 
does not pre-empt Michigan's $100 fee.  The judgment of the Michigan Court of Appeals is affirmed.

but not limited to, new jobs and increased tax revenue.  As with other 
exercises in urban planning and development, the city is trying to coor-
dinate  a  variety  of  commercial,  residential,  and  recreational  land  uses, 
with  the  hope  that  they  will  form  a  whole  greater  than  the  sum  of  its 
parts.  To effectuate this plan, the city has invoked a state statute that 
specifically  authorizes  the  use  of  eminent  domain  to  promote  economic 
development.  Given the plan's  comprehensive character, the  thorough 
deliberation  that  preceded  its  adoption,  and  the  limited  scope  of  this 
Court's review in such cases, it is appropriate here, as it was in Berman, 
to  resolve  the  challenges  of  the  individual  owners,  not  on  a  piecemeal 
basis, but rather in light of the entire plan.  Because that plan unques-
tionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here satisfy the 
Fifth Amendment.  Pp. 483-484. 

(c)  Petitioners'  proposal  that  the  Court  adopt  a  new  bright-line  rule 
that economic development does not qualify as a public use is supported 
by  neither precedent  nor  logic.  Promoting  economic  development  is  a 
traditional  and  long-accepted  governmental  function,  and  there  is  no 
principled  way  of  distinguishing  it  from  the  other  public  purposes  the 
Court  has  recognized.  See,  e. g.,  Berman,  348  U. S.,  at  33.  Also  re-
jected  is  petitioners'  argument  that  for  takings  of  this  kind  the  Court 
should require a "reasonable certainty" that the expected public benefits 
will actually accrue.  Such a rule would represent an even greater de-
parture  from  the  Court's  precedent.  E. g.,  Midkiff,  467  U. S.,  at  242. 
The  disadvantages  of  a  heightened  form  of  review  are  especially  pro-
nounced in this type of case, where orderly implementation of a compre-
hensive  plan  requires  all  interested  parties'  legal  rights  to  be  estab-
lished  before  new  construction  can  commence.  The  Court  declines  to 
second-guess the wisdom of the means the city has selected to effectuate 
its plan.  Berman, 348 U. S., at 35-36.  Pp. 484-490.

Opinion of the Court 

I 
The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the junc-tion  of  the  Thames  River  and  the  Long  Island  Sound  in 

southeastern  Connecticut.  Decades  of  economic  decline  led a  state  agency  in  1990  to  designate  the  City  a  "distressed 
municipality."  In  1996,  the  Federal  Government  closed  the Naval  Undersea  Warfare  Center,  which  had  been  located  in 
the  Fort  Trumbull  area  of  the  City  and  had  employed  over 1,500  people.  In  1998,  the  City's  unemployment  rate  was 
nearly  double  that  of  the  State,  and  its  population  of  just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest since 1920. 

These  conditions  prompted  state  and  local  officials  to  tar-get  New  London,  and  particularly  its  Fort  Trumbull  area, 
for  economic  revitalization.  To  this  end,  respondent  New London  Development  Corporation  (NLDC),  a  private  non-
profit entity established some years earlier to assist the City in planning economic development, was reactivated.  In Jan-
uary 1998, the State authorized a $5.35 million bond issue to support  the  NLDC's  planning  activities  and  a  $10  million 
bond  issue  toward  the  creation  of  a  Fort  Trumbull  State Park.  In February, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. 
announced that it would build a $300 million research facility on  a site  immediately  adjacent  to  Fort  Trumbull;  local  plan-
ners hoped that Pfizer would draw new business to the area, thereby  serving  as  a  catalyst  to  the  area's  rejuvenation. 
After  receiving  initial  approval  from  the  city  council,  the NLDC  continued  its  planning  activities  and  held  a  series  of 
neighborhood meetings to educate the public about the proc-ess.  In  May,  the  city  council  authorized  the  NLDC  to  for-
mally  submit  its  plans  to  the  relevant  state  agencies  for review.

2  Upon  obtaining  state-level  approval,  the  NLDC 

2 Various  state  agencies  studied  the  project's  economic,  environmental, 
and  social  ramifications.  As  part  of  this  process,  a  team  of  consultants 
evaluated six alternative development proposals for the area, which varied 
in  extensiveness  and  emphasis.  The  Office  of  Policy  and  Management, 
one of the primary state  agencies undertaking  the review, made  findings

Opinion of the Court 
finalized an integrated development plan focused on 90 acres of the Fort Trumbull area. 

The Fort Trumbull area is situated on a peninsula that juts into  the  Thames  River.  The  area  comprises  approximately 
115  privately  owned  properties,  as  well  as  the  32  acres  of land formerly occupied by the naval facility (Trumbull State 
Park  now  occupies  18  of  those  32  acres).  The  development plan  encompasses  seven  parcels.  Parcel  1  is  designated  for 
a waterfront conference hotel at the center of a "small urban village"  that  will  include  restaurants  and  shopping.  This 
parcel will also have marinas for both recreational and com-mercial  uses.  A  pedestrian  "riverwalk"  will  originate  here 
and  continue  down  the  coast,  connecting  the  waterfront areas  of  the  development.  Parcel  2  will  be  the  site  of  ap-
proximately  80  new  residences  organized  into  an  urban neighborhood and linked by public walkway to the remainder 
of  the  development,  including  the  state  park.  This  parcel also  includes  space  reserved  for  a  new  U.  S.  Coast  Guard 
Museum.  Parcel  3,  which  is  located  immediately  north  of the  Pfizer  facility,  will  contain  at  least  90,000  square  feet  of 
research  and  development  office  space.  Parcel  4A  is  a  2.4-acre  site  that  will  be  used  either  to  support  the  adjacent 
state  park,  by  providing  parking  or  retail  services  for  visi-tors,  or  to  support  the  nearby  marina.  Parcel  4B  will  in-
clude  a  renovated  marina,  as  well  as  the  final  stretch  of  the riverwalk.  Parcels  5,  6,  and  7  will  provide  land  for  office 
and  retail  space,  parking,  and  water-dependent  commercial uses.  App. 109-113. 

The NLDC intended the development plan to capitalize on the arrival of the Pfizer facility and the new commerce it was 
expected to attract.  In addition to creating jobs, generating tax revenue, and helping to "build momentum for the revital-
ization  of  downtown  New  London,"  id.,  at  92,  the  plan  was also designed to make the City more attractive and to create 

that the project was consistent with relevant state and municipal develop-
ment policies.  See App. 89-95.

leisure and recreational opportunities on the waterfront and in the park. 

The  city  council  approved  the  plan  in  January  2000,  and designated the NLDC as its development agent in charge of 
implementation.  See  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  $ 8-188  (2005).  The city council also authorized the NLDC to purchase property 
or  to  acquire  property  by  exercising  eminent  domain  in  the City's  name.  $ 8-193.  The  NLDC  successfully  negotiated 
the  purchase  of  most  of  the  real  estate  in  the  90-acre  area, but  its  negotiations  with  petitioners  failed.  As  a  conse-
quence, in November 2000, the  NLDC initiated  the condem-nation proceedings that gave rise to this case.

Petitioner  Susette  Kelo  has  lived  in  the  Fort  Trumbull area  since  1997.  She  has  made  extensive  improvements  to 

her  house,  which  she  prizes  for  its  water  view.  Petitioner Wilhelmina  Dery  was  born  in  her  Fort  Trumbull  house  in 
1918  and  has  lived  there  her  entire  life.  Her  husband Charles  (also  a  petitioner)  has  lived  in  the  house  since  they 
married some 60 years ago.  In all, the nine petitioners own 15 properties in Fort Trumbull--4 in parcel 3 of the develop-
ment plan and 11 in parcel 4A.  Ten of the parcels are occu-pied  by  the  owner  or  a  family  member;  the  other  five  are 
held  as  investment  properties.  There  is  no  allegation  that any of these properties is blighted or otherwise in poor con-
dition;  rather, they  were condemned  only  because  they  hap-pen to be located in the development area. 

In  December  2000,  petitioners  brought  this  action  in  the New  London  Superior  Court.  They  claimed,  among  other 
things,  that  the  taking  of  their  properties  would  violate  the "public  use"  restriction  in  the  Fifth  Amendment.  After  a 
7-day  bench  trial,  the  Superior  Court  granted  a  permanent restraining order prohibiting the taking of the properties lo-

and the NLDC only where necessary.

cated  in  parcel  4A  (park  or  marina  support).  It,  however, 
denied petitioners relief as to the properties located in parcel 
3 (office space).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 343-350.4 

After the Superior Court ruled, both sides took appeals to 
the Supreme Court of Connecticut.  That court held, over a 
dissent,  that  all  of  the  City's  proposed  takings  were  valid. 
It  began  by  upholding  the  lower  court's  determination  that 
the takings were authorized by chapter 132, the State's mu-
nicipal  development  statute.  See  Conn.  Gen.  Stat.  $ 8-186 
et seq. (2005).  That statute expresses a legislative determi-
nation  that  the  taking  of  land,  even  developed  land,  as  part 
of  an  economic  development  project  is  a  "public  use"  and  in 
the "public interest."  268 Conn., at 18-28, 843 A. 2d, at 515- 
521.  Next,  relying  on  cases  such  as  Hawaii  Housing  Au-
thority  v.  Midkiff, 467 U. S.  229  (1984),  and Berman  v.  Par-
ker,  348  U. S.  26  (1954),  the  court  held  that  such  economic 
development  qualified  as  a  valid  public  use  under  both  the 
Federal  and  State  Constitutions.  268  Conn.,  at  40,  843 
A. 2d, at 527. 

Finally,  adhering  to  its  precedents,  the  court  went  on  to 
determine, first,  whether the takings of the  particular prop-
erties at issue were "reasonably necessary" to achieving the 
City's  intended  public  use,  id.,  at  82-84,  843  A.  2d,  at  552- 
553,  and,  second,  whether  the  takings  were  for  "reasonably 
foreseeable needs," id., at 93-94, 843 A. 2d, at 558-559.  The 
court  upheld  the  trial  court's  factual  findings  as  to  parcel  3, 
but  reversed  the  trial  court  as  to  parcel  4A,  agreeing  with 
the  City  that  the  intended  use  of  this  land  was  sufficiently 

4 While  this  litigation  was  pending  before  the  Superior  Court,  the 
NLDC announced that it would lease some of the parcels to private devel-
opers in exchange for their agreement to develop the land according to the 
terms of the development plan.  Specifically, the NLDC was negotiating a 
99-year ground lease with Corcoran Jennison, a developer selected from a 
group of applicants.  The negotiations contemplated a nominal rent of $1 
per year, but no agreement had yet been signed.  See 268 Conn. 1, 9, 61, 
843 A. 2d 500, 509-510, 540 (2004).

Opinion of the Court 
definite  and  had  been  given  "reasonable  attention"  during the planning process.  Id., at 120-121, 843 A. 2d, at 574. 

The  three  dissenting  justices  would  have  imposed  a "heightened" standard of judicial review for takings justified 
by  economic  development.  Although  they  agreed  that  the plan  was  intended  to  serve  a  valid  public  use,  they  would 
have found all the takings unconstitutional because the City had failed to adduce "clear and convincing evidence" that the 
economic  benefits  of  the  plan  would  in  fact  come  to  pass. 
Id.,  at  144,  146,  843  A.  2d,  at  587,  588  (Zarella,  J.,  joined  by Sullivan, C. J., and Katz, J., concurring in part and dissenting 

in part). We  granted  certiorari  to  determine  whether  a  city's  deci-
sion  to  take  property  for  the  purpose  of  economic  develop-ment  satisfies  the  "public  use"  requirement  of  the  Fifth 
Amendment.  542 U. S. 965 (2004). 

III 
Two  polar  propositions  are  perfectly  clear.  On  the  one hand,  it  has  long  been  accepted  that  the  sovereign  may  not 

take  the  property  of  A  for  the  sole  purpose  of  transferring it  to  another  private  party 

B,  even  though  A  is  paid  just compensation.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  equally  clear  that  a 

State  may  transfer  property  from  one  private  party  to  an-other if future "use by the public" is the purpose of the tak-
ing;  the  condemnation  of  land  for  a  railroad  with  common-carrier  duties  is  a  familiar  example.  Neither  of  these 
propositions,  however,  determines  the  disposition  of  this case. 

As  for  the  first  proposition,  the  City  would  no  doubt  be forbidden  from  taking  petitioners'  land  for  the  purpose  of 
conferring  a  private  benefit  on  a  particular  private  party. See 

Midkiff, 467 U. S., at 245 ("A purely private taking could not  withstand  the  scrutiny  of  the  public  use  requirement; 

it  would  serve  no  legitimate  purpose  of  government  and would  thus  be  void"); 

Missouri  Pacific  R.  Co.  v.  Nebraska,

Opinion of the Court 
164 U. S. 403 (1896).5  Nor would the City be allowed to take property  under  the  mere  pretext  of  a  public  purpose,  when 

its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit.  The tak-ings  before  us,  however,  would  be  executed  pursuant  to  a 
"carefully  considered"  development  plan.  268  Conn.,  at  54, 843  A.  2d,  at  536.  The  trial  judge  and  all  the  members  of 
the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that there was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case.

6  Therefore, 

as  was  true  of  the  statute  challenged  in  Midkiff,  467  U. S., at 245, the City's development plan was not adopted "to ben-

efit a particular class of identifiable individuals." On  the  other  hand,  this  is  not  a  case  in  which  the  City 
is  planning  to  open  the  condemned  land--at  least  not  in  its entirety--to use by the general public.  Nor will the private 
lessees  of  the  land  in  any  sense  be  required  to  operate  like common carriers, making their services available to all com-

Opinion of the Court 
ers.  But  although  such  a  projected  use  would  be  sufficient to  satisfy  the  public  use  requirement,  this  "Court  long  ago 

rejected  any  literal  requirement  that  condemned  property be put into use for the general public."  Id., at 244.  Indeed, 
while  many  state  courts  in  the  mid-19th  century  endorsed "use  by  the  public"  as  the  proper  definition  of  public  use, 
that  narrow  view  steadily  eroded  over  time.  Not  only  was the "use by the public" test difficult to administer (

e. g., what proportion  of  the  public  need  have  access  to  the  property? 

at  what  price?),7  but  it  proved  to  be  impractical  given  the diverse and always evolving needs of society.

8  Accordingly, 

7 See,  e. g.,  Dayton  Gold  &  Silver  Mining  Co.  v.  Seawell,  11  Nev.  394, 
410, 1876 WL 4573, *11 (1876) ("If public occupation and enjoyment of the 
object for which land is to be condemned furnishes the only and true test 
for the right of eminent domain, then the legislature would certainly have 
the  constitutional  authority  to  condemn  the  lands  of  any  private  citizen 
for  the  purpose  of  building  hotels  and  theaters.  Why  not?  A  hotel  is 
used by the public as much as a railroad.  The public have the same right, 
upon payment of a fixed compensation, to seek rest and refreshment at a 
public inn as they have to travel upon a railroad"). 

8 From  upholding  the  Mill  Acts  (which  authorized  manufacturers  de-

pendent  on  power-producing  dams  to  flood  upstream  lands  in  exchange 
for  just  compensation),  to  approving  takings  necessary  for  the  economic 
development of the West through mining and irrigation, many state courts 
either circumvented the "use by the public" test when necessary or aban-
doned it completely.  See Nichols, The Meaning of Public Use in the Law 
of Eminent Domain, 20 B. U. L. Rev. 615, 619-624 (1940) (tracing this de-
velopment  and  collecting  cases).  For  example,  in  rejecting  the  "use  by 
the public" test as overly restrictive, the Nevada Supreme Court stressed 
that "[m]ining is the greatest of the industrial pursuits in this state.  All 
other  interests  are  subservient  to  it.  Our  mountains  are  almost  barren 
of timber, and our valleys could never be made profitable for agricultural 
purposes except for the fact of a home market having been created by the 
mining  developments  in  different  sections  of  the  state.  The  mining  and 
milling interests give employment to many men, and the benefits derived 
from  this  business  are  distributed  as  much,  and  sometimes  more,  among 
the laboring classes than with the owners of the mines and mills. . . . The 
present prosperity of the state is entirely due to the mining developments 
already made, and the entire people of the state are directly interested in 
having  the  future  developments  unobstructed  by  the  obstinate  action  of

Opinion of the Court 
when  this  Court  began  applying  the  Fifth  Amendment  to the  States  at  the  close  of  the  19th  century,  it  embraced  the 

broader  and  more  natural  interpretation  of  public  use  as "public  purpose."  See,  e. g.,  Fallbrook  Irrigation  Dist.  v. 
Bradley,  164  U. S.  112,  158-164  (1896).  Thus,  in  a  case  up-holding  a  mining  company's  use  of  an  aerial  bucket  line  to 
transport  ore  over  property  it  did  not  own,  Justice  Holmes' opinion for the Court stressed "the inadequacy of use by the 
general  public  as  a  universal  test."  Strickley  v.  Highland 
Boy  Gold  Mining  Co.,  200  U. S.  527,  531  (1906).9  We  have repeatedly  and  consistently  rejected  that  narrow  test  ever 

since.10 The disposition of this case therefore turns on the question 
whether  the  City's  development  plan  serves  a  "public  pur-pose."  Without  exception,  our  cases have  defined  that  con-
cept  broadly,  reflecting  our  longstanding  policy  of  deference to legislative judgments in this field. 

In Berman v. Parker, 348 U. S. 26 (1954), this Court upheld a  redevelopment  plan  targeting  a  blighted  area  of  Washing-
ton,  D.  C.,  in  which  most  of  the  housing  for  the  area's  5,000 inhabitants  was  beyond  repair.  Under  the  plan,  the  area 
would be condemned and part of it utilized for the construc-tion  of  streets,  schools,  and  other  public  facilities.  The  re-
mainder of the land would be leased or sold to private parties for the purpose of redevelopment, including the construction 
of low-cost housing.

Opinion of the Court 
The owner of a department store located in the area chal-lenged the condemnation, pointing out that his store was not 

itself blighted and arguing that the creation of a "better bal-anced,  more  attractive  community"  was  not  a  valid  public 
use.  Id.,  at  31.  Writing  for  a  unanimous  Court,  Justice Douglas refused to evaluate this claim in isolation, deferring 
instead to the legislative and agency judgment that the area 
"must  be  planned  as  a  whole"  for  the  plan  to  be  successful. 
Id., at 34.  The Court explained that "community redevelop-
ment programs need not, by force of the Constitution, be on a piecemeal basis--lot by lot, building by building." 

Id., at 35. 
The  public  use  underlying  the  taking  was  unequivocally affirmed: 

"We  do  not  sit  to  determine  whether  a  particular  hous-ing  project  is  or  is  not  desirable.  The  concept  of  the 
public  welfare  is  broad  and  inclusive.  .  .  .  The  values  it represents are spiritual as well  as physical, aesthetic as 
well as monetary.  It is within the power of the legisla-ture to determine that the community should be beauti-
ful  as  well  as  healthy,  spacious  as  well  as  clean,  well-balanced  as  well  as  carefully  patrolled.  In  the  present 
case,  the  Congress  and  its  authorized  agencies  have made determinations that take into account a wide vari-
ety  of  values.  It  is  not  for  us  to  reappraise  them.  If 
those  who  govern  the  District  of  Columbia  decide  that the Nation's Capital should be beautiful as well as sani-

tary,  there  is  nothing  in  the  Fifth  Amendment  that stands in the way." 

Id., at 33. 

In  Hawaii  Housing  Authority  v.  Midkiff,  467  U. S.  229 
(1984),  the  Court  considered  a  Hawaii  statute  whereby  fee 
title  was  taken  from  lessors  and  transferred  to  lessees  (for 
just  compensation)  in  order  to  reduce  the  concentration  of 
land ownership.  We unanimously upheld the statute and re-
jected the Ninth Circuit's view that it was "a naked attempt 
on the  part of the  state  of Hawaii  to  take the property  of A

Opinion of the Court 
and  transfer  it  to  B  solely  for  B's  private  use  and  benefit." 
Id., at 235 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Reaffirming 
Berman's  deferential  approach  to  legislative  judgments  in this field, we concluded that the State's  purpose of eliminat-

ing  the "social  and  economic  evils  of  a  land  oligopoly"  quali-fied as a  valid public  use.  467  U. S.,  at 241-242.  Our opin-
ion  also  rejected  the  contention  that  the  mere  fact  that  the 
State immediately transferred the properties to private indi-viduals  upon  condemnation  somehow  diminished  the  public 

character  of  the  taking.  "[I]t  is  only  the  taking's  purpose, and not  its mechanics," we explained, that matters in  deter-
mining public use.  Id., at 244. 

In that same Term we decided another public use case that 
arose  in  a  purely  economic  context.  In  Ruckelshaus  v. 
Monsanto Co., 467 U. S. 986 (1984), the Court dealt with pro-
visions  of  the  Federal  Insecticide,  Fungicide,  and  Rodenti-
cide Act under  which the  Environmental Protection Agency 
could  consider  the  data  (including  trade  secrets)  submitted 
by a prior pesticide applicant in evaluating a subsequent ap-
plication, so long as the second applicant paid just compensa-
tion  for  the  data.  We  acknowledged  that  the  "most  direct 
beneficiaries" of these provisions were the subsequent appli-
cants,  id.,  at  1014,  but  we  nevertheless  upheld  the  statute 
under  Berman  and  Midkiff.  We  found  sufficient  Congress' 
belief that sparing applicants the cost of time-consuming re-
search  eliminated  a  significant  barrier  to  entry  in  the  pesti-
cide  market  and  thereby  enhanced  competition.  467  U. S., 
at 1015. 

Viewed  as a whole, our  jurisprudence has  recognized  that 
the  needs  of  society  have  varied  between  different  parts  of 
the  Nation,  just as they  have  evolved over  time  in response 
to  changed  circumstances.  Our  earliest  cases  in  particular 
embodied  a  strong  theme  of  federalism,  emphasizing  the 
"great  respect"  that  we  owe  to  state  legislatures  and  state 
courts  in  discerning  local  public  needs.  See  Hairston  v. 
Danville  &  Western  R.  Co.,  208  U. S.  598,  606-607  (1908)

Opinion of the Court 
(noting  that  these  needs  were likely  to  vary  depending on  a State's  "resources,  the  capacity  of  the  soil,  the  relative  im-

portance of industries to the general public welfare, and the long-established  methods  and  habits  of  the  people").

11  For 

more than a century, our public use jurisprudence has wisely eschewed  rigid  formulas  and  intrusive  scrutiny  in  favor  of 

affording  legislatures  broad  latitude  in  determining  what public needs justify the use of the takings power. 

IV 
Those  who  govern  the  City  were  not  confronted  with  the need  to  remove  blight  in  the  Fort  Trumbull  area,  but  their 

determination  that  the  area  was  sufficiently  distressed  to justify a program of economic rejuvenation is entitled to our 
deference.  The  City  has  carefully  formulated  an  economic development  plan  that  it  believes  will  provide  appreciable 
benefits  to  the  community,  including--but  by  no  means  lim-ited to--new jobs and increased tax revenue.  As with other 
exercises  in  urban  planning  and  development,12  the  City  is endeavoring  to  coordinate  a  variety  of  commercial,  residen-
tial,  and  recreational  uses  of  land,  with  the  hope  that  they will  form a  whole  greater  than  the  sum of  its  parts.  To  ef-

Mining Co., 200 U. S. 527, 531 (1906) ("In the opinion of the legislature and 
the Supreme Court of Utah the public welfare of that State demands that 
aerial lines between the mines upon its mountain sides and railways in the 
valleys  below  should  not  be  made  impossible  by  the  refusal  of  a  private 
owner to sell the right to cross his land.  The Constitution of the United 
States does not require us to say that they are wrong"); O'Neill v. Leamer, 
239 U. S. 244, 253 (1915) ("States may take account of their special exigen-
cies, and when the extent of their arid or wet lands is such that a plan for 
irrigation  or reclamation according to districts  may fairly be regarded as 
one  which  promotes  the  public  interest,  there  is  nothing  in  the  Federal 
Constitution which denies to them the right to formulate this policy or to 
exercise the power of eminent domain in carrying it into effect.  With the 
local  situation  the  state  court  is  peculiarly  familiar  and  its  judgment  is 
entitled to the highest respect").

Opinion of the Court 
fectuate  this  plan,  the  City  has  invoked  a  state  statute  that specifically authorizes the use of eminent domain to promote 

economic development.  Given the comprehensive character of the plan, the thorough deliberation that preceded its adop-
tion, and the limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us,  as  it  was  in  Berman,  to  resolve  the  challenges  of  the 
individual  owners,  not  on  a  piecemeal  basis,  but  rather  in light  of  the  entire  plan.  Because  that  plan  unquestionably 
serves  a  public  purpose,  the  takings  challenged  here  satisfy the public use requirement of the Fifth Amendment. 

To  avoid  this  result,  petitioners  urge  us  to  adopt  a  new bright-line  rule  that  economic  development  does  not  qualify 
as  a  public  use.  Putting  aside  the  unpersuasive  suggestion that  the  City's plan  will  provide  only purely  economic  bene-
fits,  neither  precedent  nor  logic  supports  petitioners'  pro-posal.  Promoting economic development is a traditional and 
long-accepted  function  of  government.  There  is,  moreover, no  principled  way  of  distinguishing  economic  development 
from the other public purposes that we have recognized.  In our  cases  upholding  takings  that  facilitated  agriculture  and 
mining, for example, we emphasized the importance of those industries  to  the  welfare  of the  States  in  question,  see, e. g., 
Strickley, 200 U. S. 527; in Berman, we endorsed the purpose of  transforming  a  blighted  area  into  a  "well-balanced"  com-
munity through redevelopment, 348 U. S., at 33; 13  in Midkiff, 

13 It is  a misreading  of Berman to  suggest that the  only public  use up-
held  in  that  case  was  the  initial  removal  of  blight.  See  Reply  Brief  for 
Petitioners 8.  The public use described in Berman extended beyond that 
to encompass the purpose of developing that area to create conditions that 
would prevent a reversion to blight in the future.  See 348 U. S., at 34-35 
("It  was  not  enough,  [the  experts]  believed,  to  remove  existing  buildings 
that were insanitary or unsightly.  It was important to redesign the whole 
area so as to eliminate the conditions that cause slums. . . . The entire area 
needed redesigning so that a balanced, integrated plan could be developed 
for  the  region,  including  not  only  new  homes,  but  also  schools,  churches, 
parks,  streets,  and  shopping  centers.  In  this  way  it  was  hoped  that  the

Opinion of the Court 
we  upheld  the  interest  in  breaking  up  a  land  oligopoly  that "created artificial deterrents to the normal functioning of the 

State's  residential  land  market,"  467  U. S.,  at  242;  and  in Monsanto,  we  accepted  Congress'  purpose  of  eliminating  a 
"significant  barrier  to  entry  in  the  pesticide  market,"  467 U. S.,  at  1014-1015.  It  would  be  incongruous  to  hold  that 
the  City's  interest  in  the  economic  benefits  to  be  derived from  the  development  of  the  Fort  Trumbull  area  has  less 
of  a  public  character  than  any  of  those  other  interests. Clearly,  there  is  no  basis  for  exempting  economic  develop-
ment  from  our  traditionally  broad  understanding  of  public purpose. 

Petitioners  contend  that  using  eminent  domain  for  eco-nomic  development  impermissibly  blurs  the  boundary  be-
tween  public  and  private  takings.  Again,  our  cases  fore-close this objection.  Quite simply, the government's pursuit 
of  a  public  purpose  will  often  benefit  individual  private parties.  For  example,  in 

Midkiff,  the  forced  transfer  of property  conferred  a  direct  and  significant  benefit  on  those 

lessees who were previously unable to purchase their homes. In 

Monsanto,  we  recognized  that  the  "most  direct  benefici-aries"  of  the  data-sharing  provisions  were  the  subsequent 

pesticide applicants, but benefiting them in this way was nec-essary  to  promoting  competition  in  the  pesticide  market. 
467  U. S.,  at  1014.14  The  owner  of  the  department  store  in 
cycle of decay of the area could be controlled and the birth of future slums 
prevented").  Had the public use in Berman been defined more narrowly, 
it  would  have  been  difficult  to  justify  the  taking  of  the  plaintiff's  non-
blighted department store. 

14 Any number of cases illustrate that the achievement of a public good 

often  coincides  with  the  immediate  benefiting  of  private  parties.  See, 
e. g., National Railroad Passenger Corporation v.  Boston & Maine Corp., 
503 U. S. 407, 422 (1992) (public purpose of "facilitating Amtrak's rail serv-
ice" served by taking rail track from one private company and transferring 
it to another private company); Brown v.  Legal Foundation of Wash., 538 
U. S.  216  (2003)  (provision  of  legal  services  to  the  poor  is  a  valid  public

Opinion of the Court 
Berman  objected  to  "taking  from  one  businessman  for  the 
benefit  of  another  businessman,"  348  U. S.,  at  33,  referring 
to the fact that under the redevelopment plan land would be 
leased  or  sold  to  private  developers  for  redevelopment.15 
Our  rejection  of  that  contention  has  particular  relevance  to 
the  instant  case:  "The  public  end  may  be  as  well  or  better 
served through an agency of private enterprise than through 
a department of government--or so the Congress might con-
clude.  We  cannot  say  that  public  ownership  is  the  sole 
method of promoting the public purposes of community rede-
velopment projects."  Id., at 33-34.16 

It is further argued that without a bright-line rule nothing 
would  stop  a  city  from  transferring  citizen  A's  property  to 

purpose).  It is  worth noting  that  in Hawaii  Housing Authority  v.  Mid-
kiff, 467 U. S. 229 (1984), Monsanto, and Boston & Maine Corp., the prop-
erty in question retained the same use even after the change of ownership. 

15 Notably, as in the instant case, the private developers in Berman were 

required by  contract  to  use the  property  to  carry  out  the redevelopment 
plan.  See 348 U. S., at 30.

Opinion of the Court 
citizen B for the sole reason that citizen B will put the prop-erty  to  a  more  productive  use  and  thus  pay  more  taxes. 

Such a one-to-one transfer of property, executed outside the confines of an integrated development plan, is not presented 
in this case.  While such an unusual exercise of government power  would  certainly  raise  a  suspicion  that  a  private  pur-
pose  was  afoot,17  the  hypothetical  cases  posited  by  petition-
ers can be confronted if and when they arise.18  They do not warrant the crafting of an artificial restriction on the concept 

of public use.19 Alternatively, petitioners maintain that for takings of this 
kind we should require a "reasonable certainty" that the ex-pected  public  benefits  will  actually  accrue.  Such  a  rule, 
however,  would  represent  an  even  greater  departure  from 

17 Courts have viewed such aberrations with a skeptical eye.  See, e. g., 
99  Cents Only  Stores v.  Lancaster  Redevelopment  Agency,  237  F.  Supp. 
2d  1123  (CD  Cal.  2001);  cf.  Cincinnati v.  Vester,  281  U. S.  439,  448  (1930) 
(taking invalid under state eminent domain statute for lack of a reasoned 
explanation).  These  types  of  takings  may  also  implicate  other  constitu-
tional  guarantees.  See  Village  of  Willowbrook  v.  Olech,  528  U. S.  562 
(2000) (per curiam). 

18 Cf.  Panhandle  Oil  Co.  v.  Mississippi  ex  rel.  Knox,  277  U. S.  218,  223 

(1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting) ("The power to tax is not the power to de-
stroy while this Court sits"). 

19 A parade of horribles is especially unpersuasive in this context, since 

the  Takings  Clause  largely  "operates  as  a  conditional  limitation,  permit-
ting  the  government  to  do  what  it  wants  so  long  as  it  pays  the  charge."

Opinion of the Court 
our  precedent.  "When  the  legislature's  purpose  is  legiti-mate  and  its  means  are  not  irrational,  our  cases  make  clear 

that  empirical  debates  over  the  wisdom  of  takings--no  less than  debates  over  the  wisdom  of  other  kinds  of  socioeco-
nomic  legislation--are  not  to  be  carried  out  in  the  federal courts."  Midkiff,  467  U.  S.,  at  242-243.

20  Indeed,  earlier 

this  Term  we  explained  why  similar  practical  concerns (among others) undermined the use of the "substantially ad-

vances"  formula  in  our  regulatory  takings  doctrine.  See 
Lingle v.  Chevron U. S. A. Inc., 544 U. S. 528, 544 (2005) (not-ing  that this  formula "would empower--and  might often  re-

quire--courts  to  substitute  their  predictive  judgments  for those of elected legislatures and expert agencies").  The dis-
advantages  of  a  heightened  form  of  review  are  especially pronounced in this type of case.  Orderly implementation of 
a comprehensive redevelopment plan obviously requires that the legal rights of all interested parties be established before 
new  construction  can  be  commenced.  A  constitutional  rule that required postponement of the judicial approval of every 
condemnation  until  the  likelihood  of  success  of  the  plan  had been  assured  would  unquestionably  impose  a  significant 
impediment  to  the  successful  consummation  of  many  such plans. 

Just  as  we  decline  to  second-guess  the  City's  considered judgments about the efficacy of its development plan, we also 
decline to second-guess the City's determinations as to what 

20 See  also  Boston  &  Maine  Corp.,  503  U. S.,  at  422-423  ("[W]e  need

argues that EPA and, by implication, Congress, misapprehended the true 
`barriers to entry' in the pesticide industry and that the challenged provi-
sions  of  the  law  create,  rather  than  reduce,  barriers  to  entry.  .  .  .  Such 
economic arguments are better directed to Congress.  The proper inquiry 
before  this  Court  is  not  whether  the  provisions  in  fact  will  accomplish 
their  stated  objectives.  Our  review  is  limited  to  determining  that  the 
purpose  is  legitimate  and  that  Congress  rationally  could  have  believed 
that the provisions would promote that objective").

lands  it  needs  to  acquire  in  order  to  effectuate  the  project. "It is not for the courts to oversee the choice of the boundary 

line  nor  to  sit  in  review  on  the  size  of  a  particular  project area.  Once the  question of the public  purpose has been  de-
cided,  the  amount  and  character  of  land  to  be  taken  for  the project  and  the  need  for  a  particular  tract  to  complete  the 
integrated  plan  rests  in  the  discretion  of  the  legislative branch." 

Berman, 348 U. S., at 35-36. In affirming the City's authority to take petitioners' prop-

erties, we  do not  minimize  the  hardship that  condemnations may  entail,  notwithstanding  the  payment  of  just  compensa-
tion.21  We  emphasize that nothing in our opinion  precludes any  State  from  placing  further  restrictions  on  its  exercise 
of  the  takings  power.  Indeed,  many  States  already  impose "public  use"  requirements  that  are  stricter  than  the  federal 
baseline.  Some  of  these  requirements  have  been  estab-lished  as  a  matter  of  state  constitutional  law,

22  while  others 

are  expressed  in  state  eminent  domain  statutes  that  care-fully  limit  the  grounds  upon  which  takings  may  be  exer-

cised.23  As  the  submissions  of  the  parties  and  their  amici make  clear,  the  necessity  and  wisdom  of  using  eminent  do-
main  to  promote  economic  development  are  certainly  mat-ters  of  legitimate  public  debate.

24  This  Court's  authority, 

21 The  amici  raise  questions  about  the  fairness  of  the  measure  of  just 
compensation.  See,  e. g.,  Brief  for  American  Planning  Association  et  al. 
as Amici Curiae 26-30.  While important, these questions are not before 
us in this litigation. 

22 See,  e. g.,  County  of  Wayne  v.  Hathcock,  471  Mich.  445,  684  N.  W.  2d 

765 (2004). 

23 Under  California law,  for instance, a  city may only take land for eco-

nomic  development  purposes  in  blighted  areas.  Cal.  Health  &  Safety 
Code Ann. $$ 33030-33037 (West 1999).  See, e. g., Redevelopment Agency 
of  Chula  Vista  v.  Rados  Bros.,  95  Cal.  App.  4th  309,  115  Cal.  Rptr.  2d 
234 (2002). 

24 For example, some argue that the need for eminent domain has been 

greatly  exaggerated  because  private  developers  can  use  numerous  tech-
niques,  including  secret  negotiations  or  precommitment  strategies,  to 
overcome  holdout  problems  and  assemble  lands  for  genuinely  profitable

on  the  merits,  though  not  if  it  merely  attacks  a  defect  in  the  federal 
habeas proceedings' integrity.  Pp. 528-532. 

(b)  When no  "claim"  is presented,  there  is  no basis  for contending 
that  a  Rule  60(b)  motion  should  be  treated  like  a  habeas  petition.  If 
neither  the motion  itself  nor  the federal  judgment  from which  it  seeks 
relief substantively addresses federal grounds for setting aside the mov-
ant's state conviction, allowing the motion to proceed on its own terms 
creates no inconsistency with the habeas statute or rules.  Petitioner's 
motion, which alleges that the federal courts misapplied $ 2244(d)'s stat-
ute of limitations, fits this description.  Nothing in Calderon v.  Thomp-
son, 523 U. S. 538, suggests that entertaining a filing confined to a non-
merits  aspect  of  the  first  federal  habeas  proceeding  is  "inconsistent 
with" AEDPA.  Pp. 533-536. 

2.  Under  the  proper  Rule  60(b)  standards,  the  District  Court  was 
correct  to  deny  relief.  The  change  in  the  law  worked  by  Artuz  is  not 
an  "extraordinary  circumstance"  justifying  relief  under  Rule  60(b)(6), 
and  it  is  made  all  the  less  extraordinary  by  the  lack  of  diligence  that 
petitioner  showed  in  seeking  direct  appellate  review  of  the  statute-of-
limitations issue.  Pp. 536-538. 

366 F. 3d 1253, affirmed.

Opinion of the Court 
alleging that his guilty plea had not been entered knowingly and voluntarily. 

Upon the State's motion, the District Court dismissed peti-tioner's  habeas  petition  as  barred  by  AEDPA's  statute  of 
limitations,  28  U. S. C.  $ 2244(d).  Under  Eleventh  Circuit precedent,  petitioner's  filing  deadline,  absent  tolling,  was 
April 23, 1997, one year after AEDPA's statute of limitations took  effect. 

Wilcox  v.  Florida  Dept.  of  Corrections,  158 F.  3d  1209,  1211  (CA11  1998)  (per  curiam).  Adopting  a 

Magistrate Judge's recommendation, the District Court con-cluded  that  the  limitations  period  was  not  tolled  during  the 
163-day  period  while  petitioner's  second  motion  for  state postconviction  relief  was  pending.  Section  2244(d)(2)  tolls 
the  statute  of  limitations  during  the  pendency  of  "properly filed"  applications  only, and the  District Court  thought peti-
tioner's  motion was not  "properly filed" because  it  was both untimely  and  successive.  Without  tolling,  petitioner's  fed-
eral  habeas  petition  was  two  months  late,  so  the  District Court  dismissed  it  as  time  barred.  A  judge  of  the  Elev-
enth  Circuit  denied  a  certificate  of  appealability  (COA)  on April 6,  2000, and petitioner  did not  file  for rehearing or re-
view of that decision. On  November  7,  2000,  we  held  in 

Artuz  v.  Bennett,  531 U. S. 4, that an application for state postconviction relief can 

be "properly filed" even if the state courts dismiss it as pro-cedurally  barred.  See  id.,  at  8-9.  Almost  nine  months 
later,  petitioner  filed  in  the  District  Court  a  pro  se  "Motion to  Amend  or  Alter  Judgment,"  contending  that  the  District 
Court's  time-bar  ruling  was  incorrect  under  Artuz's  con-struction of $ 2244(d), and invoking Federal Rule of Civil Pro-
cedure 60(b)(6), which permits a court to relieve a party from the  effect  of  a  final  judgment.

1  The  District  Court  denied 

the motion, and petitioner appealed. 

1 Although the title "Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment" suggests that 
petitioner was relying  on Federal  Rule of  Civil  Procedure 59(e),  the sub-
stance  of  the  motion  made  clear  that  petitioner  sought  relief  under  Rule 
60(b)(6).

528  GONZALEZ  v.  CROSBY 

Opinion of the Court 
A  judge  of  the  Court  of  Appeals  for  the  Eleventh  Circuit granted petitioner a COA, but a panel quashed the certificate 

as improvidently granted.  317 F. 3d 1308, 1310, 1314 (2003). The  full  court  vacated  that  order  and  reheard  the  case  en 
banc.  It  granted  petitioner  a  COA  but  held,  by  a  vote  of  7 to  4,  that  the  District  Court  was  correct  to  deny  his  Rule 
60(b)  motion.  The  en  banc  majority  determined  that  peti-tioner's  motion--indeed,  any  postjudgment  motion  under 
Rule  60(b)  save  one  alleging  fraud  on  the  court  under  Rule 60(b)(3)--was in substance a second or successive habeas cor-
pus  petition.  366  F.  3d  1253,  1278,  1281-1282  (2004).  A state  prisoner  may  not  file  such  a  petition  without  precerti-
fication  by  the  court  of  appeals  that  the  petition  meets  cer-tain stringent criteria.  $ 2244(b).  Because petitioner's mo-
tion did not satisfy these requirements, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed its denial. 

Id., at 1282. We granted certiorari.  543 U. S. 1086 (2005). 

II 
Rule  60(b)  allows  a  party  to  seek  relief  from  a  final  judg-ment, and request  reopening of his  case, under a  limited set 

of  circumstances  including  fraud,  mistake,  and  newly  dis-covered  evidence.

2  Rule  60(b)(6),  the  particular  provision 

2 Rule 60(b) provides in relevant part: 
"On  motion  and  upon  such  terms  as  are  just,  the  court  may  relieve  a 
party  .  .  .  from  a  final  judgment,  order,  or  proceeding  for  the  follow-
ing  reasons:  (1)  mistake,  inadvertence,  surprise,  or  excusable  neglect; 
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been 
discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud . . . ,  
misrepresentation, or misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is 
void;  (5)  the  judgment  has  been  satisfied,  released,  or  discharged,  or  a 
prior  judgment  upon  which  it  is  based  has  been  reversed  or  otherwise 
vacated,  or  it  is  no  longer  equitable  that  the  judgment  should  have  pro-
spective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the oper-
ation  of  the  judgment.  The  motion  shall  be  made  within  a  reasonable 
time,  and  for  reasons  (1),  (2),  and  (3)  not  more  than  one  year  after  the 
judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken."

Opinion of the Court 
under  which  petitioner  brought  his  motion,  permits  reopen-
ing when the movant shows "any . . . reason justifying relief 
from  the  operation  of  the  judgment"  other  than  the  more 
specific circumstances set out in Rules 60(b)(1)-(5).  See Lil-
jeberg  v.  Health  Services  Acquisition  Corp.,  486  U. S.  847, 
863,  n.  11  (1988);  Klapprott  v.  United  States,  335  U. S.  601, 
613  (1949)  (opinion  of  Black,  J.).  The  mere  recitation  of 
these provisions shows why we give little weight to respond-
ent's appeal  to the  virtues  of finality.  That  policy consider-
ation,  standing  alone,  is  unpersuasive  in  the  interpretation 
of a provision  whose  whole purpose is  to make an  exception 
to finality.  The issue here is whether the text of Rule 60(b) 
itself, or of some other provision of law, limits its application 
in a manner relevant to the case before us. 

AEDPA  did  not  expressly  circumscribe  the  operation  of 
Rule  60(b).  (By  contrast,  AEDPA  directly  amended  other 
provisions  of  the  Federal  Rules.  See,  e. g.,  AEDPA,  $ 103, 
110  Stat.  1218  (amending  Fed.  Rule  App.  Proc.  22).)  The 
new habeas restrictions introduced by AEDPA are made in-
directly  relevant,  however,  by  the  fact  that  Rule  60(b),  like 
the  rest  of  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  applies  in  habeas 
corpus  proceedings  under  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254 3  only  "to  the 
extent  that  [it  is]  not  inconsistent  with"  applicable  federal 
statutory  provisions  and  rules.  28  U. S. C.  $ 2254  Rule  11; 
see  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  81(a)(2).  The  relevant  provisions 
of  the  AEDPA-amended  habeas  statutes,  28  U. S. C. 

$$ 2244(b)(1)-(3),  impose  three  requirements  on  second  or 
successive habeas petitions: First, any claim that has already 

3 In this case we consider only the extent to which Rule 60(b) applies to 
habeas proceedings under 28 U. S. C. $ 2254, which governs federal habeas 
relief for prisoners convicted in state court.  Federal prisoners generally 
seek  postconviction  relief  under  $ 2255,  which  contains  its  own  provision 
governing  second  or  successive  applications.  Although  that  portion  of 

$ 2255  is  similar  to,  and  refers  to,  the  statutory  subsection  applicable  to 
second or successive  $ 2254  petitions, it is not identical.  Accordingly, we 
limit our consideration to $ 2254 cases.

Opinion of the Court 
been  adjudicated  in  a  previous  petition  must  be  dismissed. $ 2244(b)(1).  Second,  any  claim  that  has  not  already  been 

adjudicated  must  be  dismissed  unless  it  relies  on  either  a new  and  retroactive  rule  of  constitutional  law  or  new  facts 
showing a high probability of actual innocence.  $ 2244(b)(2). Third, before the district court may accept a successive peti-
tion  for  filing,  the  court  of  appeals  must  determine  that  it presents  a  claim  not  previously  raised  that  is  sufficient  to 
meet  $ 2244(b)(2)'s  new-rule  or  actual-innocence  provisions. $ 2244(b)(3).  We  proceed  to  consider  whether  these  provi-
sions  limit  the  application  of  Rule  60(b)  to  the  present  case. 

A 
"As  a  textual  matter,  $ 2244(b)  applies  only  where  the court  acts  pursuant  to  a  prisoner's  `application' "  for  a  writ 

of habeas corpus.  Calderon v.  Thompson, 523 U. S. 538, 554 (1998).  We therefore must decide whether a Rule 60(b) mo-
tion filed by a habeas petitioner is a "habeas corpus applica-tion" as the statute uses that term. 

Under  $ 2244(b),  the  first  step  of  analysis  is  to  determine whether a "claim presented in a second or successive habeas 
corpus  application"  was  also  "presented  in  a  prior  applica-tion."  If so, the claim must be dismissed; if not, the analysis 
proceeds  to  whether  the  claim  satisfies  one  of  two  narrow exceptions.  In  either  event,  it  is  clear  that  for  purposes  of 

$ 2244(b) an "application" for habeas relief is a filing that con-tains  one  or  more  "claims."  That  definition  is  consistent 
with  the  use  of  the  term  "application"  in  the  other  habeas statutes  in  chapter  153  of  title  28.  See, 

e. g.,  Woodford  v. Garceau,  538  U. S.  202,  207  (2003)  (for  purposes  of  $ 2254(d), 

an  application  for  habeas  corpus  relief  is  a  filing  that  seeks "an  adjudication  on  the  merits  of  the  petitioner's  claims"). 
These  statutes,  and  our  own  decisions,  make  clear  that  a "claim"  as  used  in  $ 2244(b)  is  an  asserted  federal  basis  for 
relief from a state court's judgment of conviction. In  some  instances,  a  Rule  60(b)  motion  will  contain  one 
or  more  "claims."  For  example,  it  might  straightforwardly

Opinion of the Court 
assert  that  owing  to  "excusable  neglect,"  Fed.  Rule  Civ. Proc.  60(b)(1),  the  movant's  habeas  petition  had  omitted  a 

claim  of  constitutional  error,  and  seek  leave  to  present  that claim.  Cf. 

Harris v.  United States, 367 F. 3d 74, 80-81 (CA2 
2004) (petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion sought relief from judg-ment  because  habeas  counsel  had  failed  to  raise  a  Sixth 

Amendment claim).  Similarly, a motion might seek leave to 
present  "newly  discovered  evidence,"  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc. 60(b)(2), in support of a claim previously denied. 

E. g., Rod-
well v.  Pepe, 324 F. 3d 66, 69 (CA1 2003).  Or a motion might contend  that  a  subsequent  change  in  substantive  law  is  a 

"reason justifying relief," Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60(b)(6), from the previous denial of a claim. 

E. g., Dunlap v.  Litscher, 301 
F. 3d 873, 876 (CA7 2002).  Virtually every Court of Appeals to  consider  the  question  has  held  that  such  a  pleading,  al-

though  labeled  a  Rule  60(b)  motion,  is  in  substance  a  suc-cessive  habeas  petition  and  should  be  treated  accordingly. 
E. g., Rodwell, supra, at 71-72; Dunlap, supra, at 876. We  think  those  holdings  are  correct.  A  habeas  petition-
er's  filing  that  seeks  vindication  of  such  a  claim  is,  if  not  in 
substance  a  "habeas  corpus  application,"  at  least  similar enough  that  failing  to  subject  it  to  the  same  requirements 

would be  "inconsistent with" the  statute.  28  U. S. C. $ 2254 
Rule  11.  Using  Rule  60(b)  to  present  new  claims  for  relief 
from  a  state  court's  judgment  of  conviction--even  claims 
couched in the language of a true Rule 60(b) motion--circum-
vents  AEDPA's  requirement  that  a  new  claim  be  dismissed 
unless  it  relies  on  either  a  new  rule  of  constitutional  law  or 
newly  discovered  facts.  $ 2244(b)(2).  The  same  is  true  of 
a  Rule  60(b)(2)  motion  presenting  new  evidence  in  support 
of  a  claim  already  litigated:  Even  assuming  that  reliance 
on  a  new  factual  predicate  causes  that  motion  to  escape 

$ 2244(b)(1)'s  prohibition  of  claims  "presented  in  a  prior  ap-
plication,"  $ 2244(b)(2)(B) requires a more convincing factual 
showing  than  does  Rule  60(b).  Likewise,  a  Rule  60(b)  mo-
tion based on a purported change in the substantive law gov-
erning the claim could be used to circumvent $ 2244(b)(2)(A)'s

Opinion of the Court 
dictate that the only new law on which a successive petition may  rely  is  "a  new  rule  of  constitutional  law,  made  retroac-

tive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable."  In addition to the substantive 
conflict with AEDPA standards, in each of these three exam-ples  use  of  Rule  60(b)  would  impermissibly  circumvent  the 
requirement that a successive habeas petition be precertified by the  court of appeals as falling within an exception to the 
successive-petition bar.  $ 2244(b)(3). In  most  cases,  determining  whether  a  Rule  60(b)  motion 
advances  one  or  more  "claims"  will  be  relatively  simple.  A motion  that  seeks  to  add  a  new  ground  for  relief,  as  in 
Harris,  supra,  will  of  course  qualify.  A  motion  can  also  be said to bring a "claim" if it attacks the federal court's previ-
ous  resolution  of  a  claim  on  the  merits,4  since  alleging  that the  court  erred in  denying  habeas  relief on  the  merits is  ef-
fectively  indistinguishable  from  alleging  that  the  movant  is, under  the  substantive  provisions  of  the  statutes,  entitled  to 
habeas  relief.  That  is  not  the  case,  however,  when  a  Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance of the federal court's 
resolution  of  a  claim  on  the  merits,  but  some  defect  in  the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings.

4 The term "on the merits" has multiple usages.  See, e. g., Semtek Int'l 
Inc.  v.  Lockheed  Martin  Corp.,  531  U. S.  497,  501-503  (2001).  We  refer 
here to a determination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitling 
a  petitioner  to  habeas  corpus  relief  under  28  U. S. C.  $$ 2254(a)  and  (d). 
When  a  movant  asserts  one  of  those  grounds  (or  asserts  that  a  previous 
ruling regarding one of those grounds was in error) he is making a habeas 
corpus claim.  He is not doing so when he merely asserts that a previous 
ruling which precluded a merits determination was in error--for example, 
a  denial  for  such  reasons  as  failure  to  exhaust,  procedural  default,  or 
statute-of-limitations bar. 

5 Fraud  on  the  federal  habeas  court  is  one  example  of  such  a  defect. 

See  generally  Rodriguez  v.  Mitchell,  252  F.  3d  191,  199  (CA2  2001)  (a 
witness's  allegedly  fraudulent  basis  for  refusing  to  appear  at  a  federal 
habeas hearing "relate[d] to the integrity of the federal habeas proceeding, 
not to the integrity  of the state criminal trial").  We  note that an attack 
based on the movant's own conduct, or his habeas counsel's omissions, see,

B 
When  no  "claim"  is  presented,  there  is  no  basis  for  con-tending  that  the  Rule  60(b)  motion  should  be  treated  like  a 

habeas  corpus  application.  If  neither  the  motion  itself  nor the federal judgment from which it seeks relief substantively 
addresses  federal  grounds  for  setting  aside  the  movant's state  conviction,  allowing  the  motion  to  proceed  as  denomi-
nated  creates  no  inconsistency  with  the  habeas  statute  or rules.  Petitioner's motion in the present case, which alleges 
that the federal courts misapplied the federal statute of limi-tations set out in $ 2244(d), fits this description.

6 

Like  the  Court  of  Appeals,  respondent  relies  heavily  on our  decision  in  Calderon  v.  Thompson,  523  U. S.  538  (1998). 

In that case we reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision to recall its  mandate  and  reconsider  the  denial  of  Thompson's  first 
federal  habeas  petition;  the  recall  was,  we  held,  an  abuse of  discretion  because  of  its  inconsistency  with  the  policies 
embodied  in  AEDPA.  Id.,  at  554-559.  Analogizing  an  ap-pellate court's recall of its mandate to a district court's grant 
of  relief  from  judgment,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  thought  that Calderon's  disposition  applied  to  Rule  60(b).  366  F.  3d,  at 
1272-1277.  We  think  otherwise.  To  begin  with,  as  the opinion  said,  compliance  with  the  actual  text  of  AEDPA's 

e. g., supra, at 530-531, ordinarily does not go to the integrity of the pro-
ceedings, but in effect asks for a second chance to have the merits deter-
mined favorably. 

6 Petitioner  notes  that  we  held  in  Slack  v.  McDaniel,  529  U. S.  473 

(2000), that when a petition is dismissed without prejudice as unexhausted, 
the refiled petition is not "successive."  He argues that, by parity of rea-
soning,  his  Rule  60(b)  motion  challenging  the  District  Court  dismissal  of 
his  petition  on  statute-of-limitations  grounds  is  not "successive."  If  this 
argument is correct, petitioner would be able to file not just a Rule 60(b) 
motion, but a full-blown habeas petition, without running afoul of $ 2244(b). 
But  see,  e. g.,  Murray  v.  Greiner, 394 F.  3d  78,  81  (CA2 2005).  We  need 
not consider this  contention, however,  because we conclude that petition-
er's  Rule  60(b)  motion  is  not  subject  to  the  limitations  applicable  to  ha-
beas petitions.

534  GONZALEZ  v.  CROSBY 

Opinion of the Court 
successive-petition provision was not  at issue in Calderon-- because the Court of Appeals considered only the claims and 

evidence  presented  in  Thompson's  first  federal  habeas  peti-tion.  523  U. S.,  at  554. 

Calderon  did  state,  however,  that 
"a prisoner's motion to recall the mandate on the basis of the 
merits  of  the  underlying  decision  can  be  regarded  as  a  sec-
ond or successive application."  Id., at 553 (emphasis added). 
But  that  is  entirely  consonant  with  the  proposition  that  a Rule  60(b)  motion  that  seeks  to  revisit  the  federal  court's 

denial on the merits of a claim for relief should be treated as a successive habeas petition.  The problem for respondent is 
that  this  case  does  not  present  a  revisitation  of  the  merits. 
The motion here, like some other Rule 60(b) motions in $ 2254 
cases, confines itself not only to the first federal habeas peti-
tion,  but  to  a  nonmerits  aspect  of  the  first  federal  habeas 
proceeding.  Nothing  in  Calderon  suggests  that  entertain-
ing such a filing is "inconsistent with" AEDPA. 

Rule  60(b)  has  an  unquestionably  valid  role  to  play  in  ha-
beas  cases.  The  Rule  is  often  used  to  relieve  parties  from 
the  effect  of  a  default  judgment  mistakenly  entered  against 
them,  e. g., Klapprott,  335  U. S.,  at 615  (opinion of  Black,  J.), 
a function as legitimate in habeas cases as in run-of-the-mine 
civil cases.  The Rule also preserves parties' opportunity to 
obtain vacatur of a judgment that is void for lack of subject-
matter  jurisdiction--a  consideration  just  as  valid  in  habeas 
cases as in any other, since absence of jurisdiction altogether 
deprives a federal court of the power to adjudicate the rights 
of the parties.  Steel Co. v.  Citizens for Better Environment, 
523 U. S. 83, 94, 101 (1998).  In some instances, we may note, 
it  is  the  State,  not  the  habeas  petitioner,  that  seeks  to  use 
Rule  60(b),  to  reopen  a  habeas  judgment  granting  the  writ. 
See,  e. g.,  Ritter  v.  Smith,  811  F.  2d  1398,  1400  (CA11  1987). 

Moreover,  several  characteristics  of  a  Rule  60(b)  motion 
limit  the  friction  between  the  Rule  and  the  successive-
petition prohibitions of AEDPA, ensuring that our harmoni-
zation  of  the  two  will  not  expose  federal  courts  to  an  ava-

lanche of frivolous postjudgment motions.  First, Rule 60(b) 
contains  its  own  limitations,  such  as  the  requirement  that 
the motion "be made within a reasonable time" and the more 
specific 1-year deadline for asserting three of the most open-
ended grounds of relief (excusable neglect, newly discovered 
evidence,  and  fraud).  Second,  our  cases  have  required  a 
movant seeking  relief under Rule  60(b)(6)  to show "extraor-
dinary  circumstances"  justifying  the  reopening  of  a  final 
judgment.  Ackermann  v.  United  States,  340  U. S.  193,  199

petition.  The  Eleventh  Circuit  therefore  erred  in  holding that petitioner did not qualify even to seek Rule 60(b) relief. 

III 
Although  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  reasoning  is  inconsistent with  our  holding  today,  we  nonetheless  affirm  its  denial  of 

petitioner's Rule 60(b) motion. Petitioner's only ground for reopening the judgment deny-
ing  his  first  federal  habeas  petition  is  that  our  decision  in 
Artuz  showed  the  error  of  the  District  Court's  statute-of-limitations ruling.  We assume for present purposes that the 

District  Court's  ruling  was  incorrect.8  As  we  noted  above, however,  relief  under  Rule  60(b)(6)--the  only  subsection 
petitioner  invokes--requires  a  showing  of  "extraordinary circumstances."  Petitioner  contends  that Artuz's  change in 
the  interpretation  of  the  AEDPA  statute  of  limitations meets  this  description.  We  do  not  agree.  The  District 
Court's  interpretation was  by  all appearances  correct under the  Eleventh  Circuit's  then-prevailing  interpretation  of  28 
U. S. C.  $ 2244(d)(2).  It  is  hardly  extraordinary  that  subse-quently,  after  petitioner's  case  was  no  longer  pending,  this 
Court  arrived  at  a  different  interpretation.  Although  our constructions  of  federal  statutes  customarily  apply  to  all 
cases then pending on direct review, see, e. g., Harper v.  Vir-
ginia  Dept.  of  Taxation,  509  U. S.  86,  97  (1993),  not  every interpretation  of  the  federal  statutes  setting  forth  the  re-

quirements  for  habeas  provides  cause  for  reopening  cases long  since  final.

9  If  Artuz  justified  reopening  long-ago  dis-

8 Although respondent  contends that  petitioner's  motion  for state  post-
conviction relief was untimely, and that the District Court's denial of statu-
tory  tolling  was  therefore  correct  under  Pace  v.  DiGuglielmo,  544  U. S. 
408  (2005),  the  Florida  courts  made  no  reference  to  untimeliness  in  dis-
missing petitioner's motion. 

9 A change in the interpretation of a substantive statute may have con-

sequences for cases that have already reached final judgment, particularly 
in the criminal context.  See Bousley v.  United States, 523 U. S. 614, 619- 
621 (1998);  cf. Fiore v.  White, 531 U. S. 225, 228-229 (2001) (per  curiam).

missals  based  on  a  lower  court's  unduly  parsimonious  inter-pretation of $ 2244(d)(2), then 

Pace v.  DiGuglielmo, 544 U. S. 
408 (2005), would justify reopening long-ago grants of habeas relief  based  on  a  lower  court's  unduly 

generous  interpreta-
tion of the same tolling provision. The change  in  the  law worked by 

Artuz is  all  the  less ex-
traordinary  in  petitioner's  case,  because  of  his  lack  of  dili-
gence  in  pursuing  review  of  the  statute-of-limitations  issue. At  the  time 

Artuz  was  decided,  petitioner  had  abandoned 
any  attempt  to  seek  review  of  the  District  Court's  decision on  this  statute-of-limitations  issue.  Although  the  District 

Court  relied  on  Eleventh  Circuit  precedent  holding  that  a state postconviction application is not "properly filed" if it is 
procedurally  defaulted,  and  although  that  precedent  was  at odds  with  the  rule  in  several  other  Circuits,  petitioner  nei-
ther  raised  that  issue  in  his  application  for  a  COA,  nor  filed a  petition for  rehearing  of  the  Eleventh  Circuit's  denial of  a 
COA,  nor  sought  certiorari  review  of  that  denial.10  This 
lack of diligence confirms that Artuz is not an extraordinary 
circumstance justifying relief from the judgment in petition-
er's case.  Indeed, in one of the cases in which we explained 
Rule 60(b)(6)'s extraordinary-circumstances requirement, the 
movant had failed to appeal an adverse ruling by the District 
Court,  whereas  another  party  to  the  same  judgment  had 

10 We  granted  review  to  resolve  the  conflict  over  the  interpretation  of 
"properly filed" on April 17, 2000, only eight days after the Eleventh Cir-

petitioner could have sought certiorari.  Artuz v.  Bennett, 529 U. S. 1065.

Opinion of the Court 
We  now  conclude  the  answer  must  be  yes.  When  the well-pleaded complaint contains at least one claim that satis-

fies  the  amount-in-controversy  requirement,  and  there  are no  other  relevant  jurisdictional  defects,  the  district  court, 
beyond all question, has original jurisdiction over that claim. The  presence  of  other  claims  in  the  complaint,  over  which 
the district court may lack original jurisdiction, is of no mo-
ment.  If  the  court  has  original  jurisdiction  over  a  single claim  in  the  complaint,  it  has  original  jurisdiction  over  a 

"civil action" within the meaning of $ 1367(a), even if the civil action  over  which  it  has  jurisdiction  comprises fewer  claims 
than were included in the complaint.  Once the court deter-
mines it  has original  jurisdiction over the  civil action,  it can 
turn to the question whether it has a constitutional and stat-
utory basis for exercising supplemental jurisdiction over the 
other claims in the action. 

Section  1367(a)  commences  with  the  directi on  that 

$$ 1367(b)  and  (c),  or  other  relevant  statutes,  may  provide 
specific  exceptions,  but  otherwise  $ 1367(a)  is  a  broad  juris-
dictional grant, with no distinction drawn between pendent-
claim and pendent-party cases.  In fact, the last sentence of 

$ 1367(a) makes clear that the provision grants supplemental 
jurisdiction  over  claims  involving  joinder  or  intervention  of 
additional parties.  The terms of $ 1367 do not acknowledge 
any  distinction  between  pendent  jurisdiction  and  the  doc-
trine  of  so-called  ancillary  jurisdiction.  Though  the  doc-
trines  of  pendent  and  ancillary  jurisdiction  developed  sepa-
rately  as  a  historical  matter,  the  Court  has  recognized  that 
the doctrines are "two species of the same generic problem,"

both criticisms are right on the mark. First of all,  the  legislative history  of $ 1367  is far  murkier 
than  selective  quotation  from  the  House  Report  would  sug-gest.  The  text  of  $ 1367  is  based  substantially  on  a  draft

working  paper,  which  was  drafted  by  a  Subcommittee chaired  by  Judge  Posner.  Report  of  the  Subcommittee  on

In  sum,  even  if  we  believed  resort  to  legislative  history were  appropriate  in  these  cases--a  point  we  do  not  con-

cede--we would not give significant weight to the House Re-port.  The distinguished jurists who drafted the Subcommit-
tee  Working  Paper,  along  with  three  of  the  participants  in the  drafting  of  $ 1367,  agree  that  this  provision,  on  its  face, 
overrules  Zahn.

Felix's state-court trial and conviction.  Defining transaction with 
greater specificity, the court reasoned, would unduly strain the meaning 
of "conduct, transaction, or occurrence" by dividing the trial and convic-
tion into a series of individual occurrences. 

Held:  An amended habeas petition does not relate back (and thereby avoid 

AEDPA's  one-year  time  limit)  when  it  asserts  a  new  ground  for  relief 
supported by facts that differ in both time and type from those set forth 
in the original pleading.  Pp. 654-664. 

(a)  Under $ 2244(d)(1), a one-year limitation period applies to a  state 
prisoner's federal habeas application.  Habeas Corpus Rule 11 permits 
application of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in habeas cases "to 
the extent [the civil rules] are not inconsistent with any statutory provi-
sions or [the habeas] rules."  Section 2242 provides that habeas applica-
tions "may be amended . . . as  provided in the rules of procedure applica-
ble  to  civil  actions."  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  15(a)  allows 
pleading amendments with "leave of court" any time during a proceed-
ing.  Before a responsive pleading is served, pleadings may be amended 
once  as  a  "matter  of  course,"  i. e.,  without  seeking  court  leave.  Ibid. 
Amendments  made  after  the  statute  of  limitations  has  run  relate  back 
to  the  date  of  the  original  pleading  if  the  original  and  amended  plead-
ings  "ar[i]se  out  of  the  conduct,  transaction,  or  occurrence."  Rule 
15(c)(2).  The "original pleading" in a habeas proceeding is the petition 
as  initially  filed.  That  pleading  must  "specify  all  the  grounds  for  re-
lief  available  to  the  petitioner"  and  "state  the  facts  supporting  each 
ground."  Habeas  Corpus  Rule  2(c).  A  prime  purpose  of  Rule  2(c)'s 
demand that petitioners plead with particularity is to assist the district 
court  in  determining  whether  the  State  should  be  ordered  to  "show 
cause  why  the  writ  should  not  be  granted,"  $ 2243,  or  the  petition  in-
stead  should  be  summarily  dismissed  without  ordering  a  responsive 
pleading.  Habeas Corpus Rule 4.  Pp. 654-656. 

(b)  Under  the  Ninth  Circuit's  comprehensive  definition  of  "conduct, 
transaction,  or  occurrence,"  virtually  any  new  claim  introduced  in  an 
amended habeas  petition will relate  back, for federal  habeas claims, by 
their very nature, challenge the constitutionality of a conviction or sen-
tence,  and commonly  attack  proceedings  anterior thereto.  The  major-
ity  of  Circuits  define  "conduct,  transaction,  or  occurrence"  in  federal 
habeas  cases  far  less  broadly,  allowing  relation  back  only  when  the 
claims added by amendment arise from the same core facts as the timely 
filed claims, and not when the new claims depend upon events separate 
in both time and type from the originally raised episodes.  Under that 
view, Felix's own pretrial statements, newly raised in his amended peti-
tion,  would  not  relate  back  because  they  were  separated  in  time  and

Syllabus 
type from the videotaped witness testimony.  This Court is not aware, 
in the run-of-the-mine civil proceedings Rule 15 governs, of any reading 
of  "conduct,  transaction,  or  occurrence"  as  capacious  as  the  Ninth  Cir-
cuit's  construction  for  habeas  cases.  Decisions  applying  Rule  15(c)(2) 
in  the  civil  context  illustrate  that  Rule  15(c)(2)  relaxes,  but  does  not 
obliterate, the statute of limitations; hence relation back depends on the 
existence  of  a  common  core  of  operative  facts  uniting  the  original  and 
newly asserted claims.  The Court disagrees with Felix's assertion that 
he seeks, and the Ninth Circuit accorded, no wider range for Rule 15(c)'s 
relation-back provision than was given the words "conduct, transaction, 
or  occurrence"  in  Tiller  v.  Atlantic  Coast  Line  R.  Co.,  323  U. S.  574, 
580-581.  There, the amended complaint invoked a legal theory not sug-
gested  in  the  original  complaint  and  relied  on  facts  not  originally  as-
serted.  Relation  back  was  nevertheless  permitted.  In  Tiller,  how-
ever,  there  was  but  one  "occurrence,"  the  death  of  the  petitioner's 
husband, which she attributed throughout to the respondent's failure to 
provide a safe workplace.  In contrast, Felix targeted discrete episodes, 
the  videotaped  witness  testimony  in  his  original  petition  and  his  own 
interrogation  at  a  different  time  and  place  in  his  amended  petition. 
Pp. 656-660. 

(c)  Felix's contention that the trial itself is  the appropriate "transac-
tion" or "occurrence" artificially truncates his claims by homing in only 
on  what  makes  those  claims  actionable  in  a  habeas  proceeding.  Al-
though  his  self-incrimination  claim  did  not  ripen  until  the  prosecutor 
introduced  his  pretrial  statements  at  trial,  the  essential  predicate  for 
his  Fifth  Amendment  claim  was  an  extrajudicial  event,  i. e.,  an  out-of-
court  police interrogation.  The dispositive  question  in an  adjudication 
of that claim would be the character of the police interrogation, specifi-
cally, did Felix answer voluntarily or were his statements coerced.  See 
Haynes v.  Washington, 373 U. S.  503, 513-514.  Under Habeas Corpus 
Rule  2(c)'s  particularity-in-pleading  requirement,  Felix's  Confrontation 
Clause claim would be pleaded discretely, as would his self-incrimination 
claim.  Each separate congeries of facts supporting the grounds for re-
lief,  the  Rule  suggests,  would  delineate  an  "occurrence."  Felix's  and 
the Ninth Circuit's approach is boundless by comparison, allowing a mis-
cellany  of  claims  for  relief  to  be  raised  later  rather  than  sooner  and  to 
relate  back.  If  claims  asserted  after  the  one-year  period  could  be  re-
vived  simply  because  they  relate  to  the  same  trial,  conviction,  or  sen-
tence as a timely filed claim, AEDPA's limitation period would have slim 
significance.  Pp. 660-663. 

(d)  Felix's  argument  that  a  firm  check  against  petition  amendments 
presenting new, discrete claims after AEDPA's limitation period has run 
is provided by Rule 15(a)--which gives district courts discretion to deny

petition  amendments  once  a  responsive  pleading  has  been  filed--over-
looks a pleader's right to amend without leave of court "any time before 
a responsive pleading is served."  That time can be long under Habeas 
Corpus Rule 4, pursuant to which a petition is not served until the judge 
first  examines it  to determine whether "it  plainly  appears . . . that the 
petitioner  is  not  entitled  to  relief."  This  Court's  reading  that  relation 
back will be in order so long as the original and amended petitions state 
claims  that  are  tied  to  a  common  core  of  operative  facts  is  consist-
ent  with  Rule  15(c)(2)'s  general  application  in  civil  cases,  with  Habeas 
Corpus  Rule  2(c),  and  with  AEDPA's  tight  time  line  for  petitions.

Opinion of the Court 
an amended petition in which he added a new claim for relief: He  asserted  that,  in  the  course  of  pretrial  interrogation, 

the  police  used  coercive  tactics  to  obtain  damaging  state-ments  from  him,  and  that  admission  of  those  statements 
at  trial  violated  his  Fifth  Amendment  right  against  self-incrimination.  The  question  presented  concerns the  timeli-
ness of Felix's Fifth Amendment claim. In  ordinary  civil  proceedings,  the  governing  Rule,  Rule  8 
of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  requires  only "a  short  and  plain  statement  of  the  claim  showing  that  the 
pleader  is  entitled  to  relief."  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  8(a)(2). Rule  2(c)  of  the  Rules  Governing  Habeas  Corpus  Cases  re-
quires  a  more  detailed  statement.  The  habeas  rule  in-structs  the  petitioner  to  "specify  all  the  grounds  for  relief 
available  to  [him]"  and  to  "state  the  facts  supporting  each ground." 

1  By statute, Congress provided that a habeas pe-

tition "may be amended . . . as provided in the rules of proce-dure  applicable  to  civil  actions."  28  U. S. C.  $ 2242.  The 

Civil  Rule  on  amended  pleadings,  Rule  15  of  the  Federal Rules  of  Civil  Procedure,  instructs:  "An  amendment  of  a 
pleading  relates  back  to  the  date  of  the  original  pleading when  .  .  .  the  claim  .  .  .  asserted  in  the  amended  pleading 
arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading."  Fed. 
Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2). The  issue  before  us  is  one  on  which  federal  appellate 
courts  have  divided:  Whether,  under  Federal  Rule  of  Civil Procedure  15(c)(2),  Felix's  amended  petition,  filed  after 
AEDPA's  one-year  limitation  and  targeting  his  pretrial statements,  relates  back  to  the  date  of  his  original  timely 
filed  petition,  which  targeted  the  videotaped  witness  testi-mony.  Felix urges,  and the Court  of Appeals held, that the 

1 The Habeas Corpus Rules were recently amended, effective December 
1,  2004.  Because  the  amended  Rules  are  not  materially  different  from 
those in  effect when  Felix  filed his habeas petition, this  opinion refers to 
the current version of the Rules.

Opinion of the Court 
amended petition qualifies for relation back because both the original  petition  and  the  amended  pleading  arose  from  the 

same trial and conviction.  We reverse the Court of Appeals' judgment  in  this  regard.  An  amended  habeas  petition,  we 
hold,  does  not  relate  back  (and  thereby  escape  AEDPA's one-year  time  limit)  when  it  asserts  a  new  ground  for  relief 
supported  by  facts  that  differ  in  both  time  and  type  from those the original pleading set forth. 

I 
In  1995,  after  a  jury  trial  in  Sacramento,  California,  re-spondent  Jacoby  Lee  Felix  was  found  guilty  of  murder  and 

robbery  stemming  from  his  participation  in  a  carjacking  in which  the  driver  of  the  car  was  shot  and  killed.  App.  E  to 
Pet.  for  Cert.  2-7.  He  was  sentenced  to  life  imprisonment without  the  possibility  of  parole.  App.  C  to  Pet.  for  Cert. 
1-2.  The current controversy centers on two alleged errors at  Felix's  trial.  Both  involve  the  admission  of  out-of-court 
statements during the prosecutor's case in chief, but the two are  otherwise  unrelated.  One  prompted  a  Fifth  Amend-
ment  self-incrimination  objection  originally  raised  in  the trial  court,  the  other,  a  Sixth  Amendment  Confrontation 
Clause challenge, also raised in the trial proceedings. Felix's Fifth Amendment claim rested on the prosecution's 
introduction of statements Felix made during pretrial police interrogation.  These  statements  were  adduced  at  trial  on 
direct  examination  of  the  investigating  officer.  Felix  urged that the police  used coercive tactics to elicit the statements. 
Id.,  at  8-9.  His  Sixth  Amendment  claim  related  to  the  ad-mission  of  the  videotaped  statements  prosecution  witness 
Kenneth Williams made at a jailhouse interview.  The video-tape  records  Williams,  a  friend  of  Felix,  telling  the  police 
that  he  had  overheard  a  conversation  in  which  Felix  de-scribed  the  planned  robbery  just  before  it  occurred.  When 
Williams  testified  at  trial  that  he  did  not  recall  the  police interview,  the  trial  court  determined  that  Williams'  loss  of

Opinion of the Court 
memory was feigned, and that the videotape was admissible because it contained prior inconsistent statements.  App. E 

to Pet. for Cert. 10-13. On  direct  appeal,  Felix  urged, 

inter  alia,  that  the  admis-
sion of Williams' videotaped statements violated Felix's con-stitutional  right  to  confront  the  witnesses  against  him.  He 

did  not,  however,  argue  that  admission  of  his  own  pretrial 
statements  violated  his  right  to  protection  against  self-incrimination.  The  intermediate  appellate  court  affirmed 

Felix's conviction and sentence, id., at 10-13, 17, and the Cal-ifornia Supreme Court denied his petition for review, App. F 
to  Pet.  for  Cert.  2.  Felix's  conviction  became  final  on  Au-
gust 12, 1997.  App. C to Pet. for Cert. 10. 

Under AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations, Felix had 
until  August  12,  1998,  to  file  a  petition  for  a  writ  of  ha-
beas  corpus  in  federal  district  court.  See  $ 2244(d)(1)(A). 
Within the one-year period, on May 8, 1998, he filed a pro se 
petition for federal habeas relief.  Felix's federal petition re-
peated  his  Sixth  Amendment  objection  to  the  admission  of 
the  Williams  videotape,  but  he  again  failed  to  reassert  the 
objection  he  made  in  the  trial  court  to  the  admission  of  his 
own pretrial statements.  App. G to Pet. for Cert. 1-7.  On 
May 29, 1998, a Magistrate Judge appointed counsel to repre-
sent  Felix.  App.  C  to  Pet.  for  Cert.  6;  App.  H  to  Pet.  for 
Cert. 2.  Thereafter, on September 15, 1998, the Magistrate 
Judge  ordered  Felix  to  file  an  amended  petition  within  30 
days.  Id., at 3.  On Felix's unopposed requests, that period 
was  successively  extended.  Id.,  at  4-5.  Pending  the  filing 
of an amended petition, the State  was not required to inter-
pose an answer. 

On January 28, 1999, over five months after the August 12, 
1998  expiration  of  AEDPA's  time  limit,  and  eight  months 
after the appointment of counsel to represent him, Felix filed 
an  amended  petition.  Id.,  at  5.  In  this  pleading,  he  reas-
serted his Confrontation Clause claim, and also asserted, for 
the  first  time  post-trial,  that  his  own  pretrial  statements  to

Opinion of the Court 
the  police  were  coerced  and  therefore  inadmissible  at  trial. App. I to Pet. for Cert. 4.  Further, he alleged that his coun-

sel  on  appeal  to  the  California  intermediate  appellate  court was ineffective in failing to raise the coerced confession claim 
on  direct  appeal.  Id.,  at  18-19.2  In  its  answer  to  the amended petition, the State asserted that the Fifth Amend-
ment  claim  was  time  barred  because  it  was  initially  raised after  the  expiration  of  AEDPA's  one-year  limitation  period. 
Felix  argued  in  response  that  the  new  claim  related  back to  the  date  of  his  original  petition.  Because  both  Fifth 
Amendment  and  Confrontation  Clause  claims  challenged the  constitutionality  of  the  same  criminal  conviction,  Felix 
urged,  the  Fifth  Amendment  claim  arose  out  of  the  "con-duct,  transaction,  or  occurrence  set forth  . .  .  in  the  original 
pleading,"  Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  15(c)(2).  App.  C  to  Pet.  for Cert. 16. 

The  Magistrate  Judge  recommended  dismissal  of  Felix's Fifth Amendment coerced statements claim.  Relation back 
was not in order, the Magistrate said, because Felix's "alleg-edly  involuntary  statements  to  police  d[id]  not  arise  out  of 
the  same  conduct,  transaction  or  occurrence  as  the  video-taped  interrogation  of  [prosecution  witness]  Kenneth  Wil-
liams."  Ibid.  It  did  not  suffice,  the  Magistrate  observed, that  Felix's  Fifth  and  Sixth  Amendment  claims  attack  the 
same  criminal  conviction.  Ibid.  Adopting  the  Magistrate Judge's  report  and  recommendation  in  full,  the  District 

2 Because Felix had not presented his coerced statements Fifth Amend-
ment claim on appeal to the California courts, the State moved to dismiss 
the amended petition on the ground that it contained both exhausted and 
unexhausted claims.  See 28 U. S. C. $ 2254(b)(1)(A); Brief for Respondent 
6-7.  Before  the  Magistrate  Judge  acted  on  the  motion,  Felix  presented 
the  coerced  statements/ineffective-assistance  claim  to  the  California  Su-
preme Court in a habeas petition.  Opposition to Respondents' Motion to

Opinion of the Court 
Court dismissed the Fifth Amendment claim as time barred, and  rejected  the  Confrontation  Clause  claim  on  its  merits. 

App. B to Pet. for Cert. 1-3. A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-
cuit  affirmed  the  District  Court's  dismissal  of  Felix's  Con-frontation  Clause  claim,  but  reversed  the  dismissal  of  his 
coerced  statements  claim  and  remanded  that  claim  for  fur-
ther  proceedings.  379  F.  3d  612  (2004).  In  the  majority's view, the relevant "transaction" for purposes of Rule 15(c)(2) 

was Felix's "trial and conviction in state court."  Id., at 615. Defining  the  transaction  at  any  greater  level  of  specificity, 
the  majority  reasoned,  would  "unduly  strai[n]  the  usual 
meaning of `conduct, transaction, or occurrence' " by dividing 
the  "trial  and  conviction  [into]  a  series  of  perhaps  hundreds 
of individual occurrences."  Ibid.  Judge Tallman concurred 
in part and dissented in part.  In his view, defining "conduct, 
transaction,  or  occurrence"  under  Rule  15(c)(2)  "so  broadly 
that any claim stemming from pre-trial motions, the trial, or 
sentencing  relates  back  to  a  timely-filed  habeas  petition" 
would "obliterat[e] AEDPA's one year statute of limitation." 
Id.,  at  618.  "While  an  amendment offered  to  clarify  or  am-
plify  the  facts  already  alleged  in  support  of  a  timely  claim 
may  relate  back,"  he  reasoned,  "an  amendment  that  intro-
duces a new legal theory based on facts different from those 
underlying the timely claim may not."  Id., at 621. 

We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. 1042 (2005), to resolve the 
conflict among Courts of Appeals  on relation back  of habeas 
petition amendments.  Compare 379 F. 3d, at 614 (if original 
petition  is  timely  filed,  amendments  referring  to  the  same 
trial and conviction may relate back); Ellzey v. United States,

action must be defined more narrowly than the trial and con-
viction); United States v.  Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F. 3d 501, 503-

II 

A 

In  enacting  AEDPA  in  1996,  Congress  imposed  for  the first  time  a  fixed  time  limit  for  collateral  attacks  in  federal 

court  on  a  judgment  of  conviction.  Section  2244(d)(1)  pro-vides: "A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to an applica-
tion for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursu-ant  to  the  judgment  of  a  State  court."  See  also  $ 2255,  || 6 
(providing  one-year  limitation  period  in  which  to  file  a  mo-
tion to vacate a federal conviction).3 A discrete set of Rules governs federal habeas proceedings 

launched  by  state  prisoners.  See  Rules  Governing  Section 2254  Cases  in  the  United  States  District  Courts.

4  The  last 

of  those  Rules,  Habeas  Corpus  Rule  11,  permits  application of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure  in  habeas  cases  "to 

the extent that [the civil rules] are not inconsistent with any statutory  provisions  or  [the  habeas]  rules."  See  also  Fed. 
Rule  Civ.  Proc.  81(a)(2)  (The  civil  rules  "are  applicable  to proceedings for . . . habeas corpus.").  Rule 11, the Advisory 
Committee's  Notes  caution,  "permits  application  of  the  civil 
rules only when it would be appropriate to do so," and would not  be "inconsistent or inequitable in the  overall framework 

of  habeas  corpus."  Advisory  Committee's  Note  on  Habeas Corpus  Rule  11,  28  U. S. C.,  p.  480.  In  addition  to  the  gen-
eral  prescriptions  on  application  of  the  civil  rules  in  federal 

3 Section  2255  establishes  a  separate  avenue  for  postconviction  chal-
lenges to federal, as opposed to state, convictions. 

4 Habeas  corpus  proceedings  are characterized  as  civil  in  nature.  See, 

e. g., Fisher v.  Baker, 203 U. S. 174, 181 (1906).

Opinion of the Court 
habeas cases, $ 2242 specifically provides that habeas applica-
tions "may be amended . . . as provided in the rules of proce-
dure applicable to civil actions." 

The  Civil  Rule  governing  pleading  amendments,  Federal 
Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  15,  made  applicable  to  habeas  pro-
ceedings by $ 2242, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 81(a)(2), 
and  Habeas  Corpus  Rule  11,  allows  pleading  amendments 
with  "leave  of  court"  any  time  during  a  proceeding.  See 
Fed.  Rule  Civ.  Proc.  15(a).  Before  a  responsive  pleading  is 
served,  pleadings  may  be  amended  once  as  a  "matter  of 
course,"  i. e.,  without  seeking  court  leave.  Ibid.  Amend-
ments  made  after  the  statute  of  limitations  has  run  relate 
back  to  the  date  of  the  original  pleading  if  the  original  and 
amended  pleadings  "ar[i]se  out  of  the  conduct,  transaction, 
or occurrence."  Rule 15(c)(2). 

The "original pleading" to which Rule 15 refers is the com-
plaint  in  an  ordinary  civil  case,  and  the  petition  in  a  habeas 
proceeding.  Under  Rule  8(a),  applicable  to  ordinary  civil 
proceedings,  a  complaint  need  only  provide  "fair  notice  of 
what  the  plaintiff 's  claim  is  and  the  grounds  upon  which  it 
rests."  Conley  v.  Gibson,  355  U. S.  41,  47  (1957).  Habeas 
Corpus  Rule  2(c)  is  more  demanding.  It  provides  that  the 
petition  must  "specify  all  the  grounds  for  relief  available  to 
the petitioner" and "state the facts supporting each ground." 
See  also  Advisory  Committee's  Note  on  subd.  (c)  of  Habeas 
Corpus Rule 2, 28 U. S. C., p. 469 ("In the past, petitions have 
frequently  contained  mere  conclusions  of  law,  unsupported 
by  any  facts.  [But]  it  is  the  relationship  of  the  facts  to  the 
claim  asserted  that  is  important . . . .");  Advisory  Commit-
tee's  Note  on  Habeas  Corpus  Rule  4,  28  U. S. C.,  p.  471 
(" `[N]otice'  pleading  is  not  sufficient,  for  the  petition  is  ex-
pected to state facts that point to a real possibility of consti-
tutional  error."  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted)).  Ac-
cordingly, the  model form available  to aid  prisoners  in filing 
their habeas petitions instructs in boldface:

virtually  any  new  claim  introduced  in  an  amended  petition will relate back, for  federal habeas claims, by their  very  na-

ture,  challenge  the  constitutionality  of  a  conviction  or  sen-tence,  and  commonly  attack  proceedings  anterior  thereto. 
See Espinoza-Saenz, 235 F. 3d, at 505 (A "majority of amend-ments"  to  habeas  petitions  raise  issues  falling  under  the 
"broad  umbrella"  of  "a  defendant's  trial  and  sentencing."); 
Hicks, 283 F. 3d, at 388. The majority of Circuits, mindful of "Congress' decision to 

expedite collateral attacks by placing stringent time restric-tions on [them]," 

ibid., define "conduct, transaction, or occur-
rence" in federal habeas cases less broadly.  See id., at 388- 
389;  Espinoza-Saenz,  235  F.  3d,  at  503-505;  Davenport,  217 
F.  3d,  at  1344-1346;  Pittman,  209  F.  3d,  at  317-318;  Duffus, 
174  F.  3d,  at  337;  Craycraft,  167  F.  3d,  at  457.  They  allow 
relation  back  only  when  the  claims  added  by  amendment 
arise from the same core facts as the timely filed claims, and 
not  when  the  new  claims  depend  upon  events  separate  in 
"both  time  and  type"  from  the  originally  raised  episodes. 
Ibid.  Because Felix's own pretrial statements, newly raised 
in  his  amended  petition,  were  separated  in  time  and  type 
from witness  Williams' videotaped  statements, raised  in Fe-
lix's original petition, the former would not relate back under 
the  definition  of  "conduct,  transaction,  or  occurrence"  to 
which most Circuits adhere. 

We are not aware, in the run-of-the-mine civil proceedings 
Rule  15  governs,  of  any  reading  of  "conduct,  transaction,  or 
occurrence"  as  capacious  as  the  construction  the  Ninth  and 
Seventh  Circuits  have  adopted  for  habeas  cases.  Compare 
Maegdlin  v.  International  Assn.  of  Machinists  and  Aero-
space  Workers,  309  F.  3d  1051,  1052  (CA8  2002)  (allowing 
relation  back  where  original  complaint  alleged  that  defend-
ant  union  had  breached  its  duty  of  fair  representation  by

Clipper Exxpress involved a series of allegedly sham protests, commonly

resemblance  to  the  argument  made  by  Felix  and  embraced  by  the  dis-
sent--that all manner of factually and temporally unrelated conduct may 
be raised after the statute of limitations has run and relate back, so long

ing to sell Coastal Plains to a third party did not relate back to  claim  based  on  creditor's  failure  to  return  inventory  to 

Coastal Plains, even though both claims were linked to credi-tor's  alleged  "broader  plan  to destroy  Coastal  [Plains]"); 

Si-
erra  Club  v.  Penfold,  857  F.  2d  1307,  1315-1316  (CA9  1988) (where original complaint challenged the manner in which an 

agency  applied  a  regulation,  an  amendment  challenging  the 
agency's "conduct in adopting the regulatio[n]" did not relate back).  See  also 

Jackson  v.  Suffolk  County  Homicide  Bu-
reau, 135 F. 3d 254, 256 (CA2 1998) (although all of plaintiff 's 42  U. S. C.  $ 1983  claims  arose  out  of  a  single  state-court 

criminal  proceeding,  plaintiff 's  First  Amendment  claims  did 
not  arise  out  of  the  same  conduct  as  the  originally  asserted 
excessive  force  claims,  and  therefore  did  not  relate  back). 
As  these  decisions  illustrate,  Rule  15(c)(2)  relaxes,  but  does 
not obliterate, the statute of limitations; hence relation back 
depends  on  the  existence  of  a  common  "core  of  operative 
facts"  uniting  the  original  and  newly  asserted  claims.  See 
Clipper  Exxpress,  690  F.  2d,  at  1259,  n.  29;  6A  C.  Wright, 
A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure $ 1497, 
p. 85 (2d ed. 1990). 

Felix  asserts  that  he  seeks,  and  the  Ninth  Circuit  ac-
corded,  no  wider  range  for  Rule  15(c)'s  relation-back  provi-
sion than  this Court gave  to the  Rule's key words  "conduct, 
transaction,  or  occurrence"  in  Tiller  v.  Atlantic  Coast  Line 
R. Co., 323 U. S. 574, 580-581 (1945).  We disagree.  In Til-
ler, a railroad worker was struck and killed by a railroad car. 
His widow sued under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, 
45  U. S. C.  $ 51  et  seq.,  to  recover  for  his  wrongful  death. 
She initially alleged various negligent acts.  In an amended 
complaint,  she  added  a  claim  under  the  Federal  Boiler  In-
spection Act for failure to provide the train's locomotive with 
a rear light.  We held that the amendment related back, and 
therefore  avoided  a  statute  of  limitations  bar,  even  though 
the amendment invoked a legal theory not suggested by the 
original complaint and relied on facts not originally asserted.

660  MAYLE  v.  FELIX 

Opinion of the Court 
There  was  but  one  episode-in-suit  in  Tiller,  a  worker's death  attributed  from  the  start  to  the  railroad's  failure  to 

provide  its  employee  with  a  reasonably  safe  place  to  work. The  federal  rulemakers  recognized  that  personal  injury 
plaintiffs often cannot pinpoint the precise cause of an injury prior  to  discovery.  See  5  C.  Wright  &  A.  Miller,  Federal 
Practice  and  Procedure  $ 1215,  pp.  138-143  (2d  ed.  1990). 
They  therefore  included  in  the  Appendix  to  the  Federal Rules  an  illustrative  form  indicating  that  a  personal  injury 

plaintiff  could  adequately  state  a  claim  for  relief  simply  by alleging  that  the  defendant  negligently  operated  a  certain 
instrumentality at a particular time and place.  See Form 9, 
Complaint for Negligence, Forms App., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc., 
28 U. S. C. App., p. 829.  The widow in Tiller met that meas-
ure.  She  based  her  complaint  on  a  single  "occurrence,"  an 
accident resulting in her husband's death.  In contrast, Felix 
targeted  separate  episodes,  the  pretrial  police  interrogation 
of  witness  Williams  in  his  original  petition  and  his  own  in-
terrogation  at  a  different  time  and  place  in  his  amended 
petition. 

Felix  contends,  however,  that  his  amended  petition  quali-
fies  for  relation  back  because  the  trial  itself  is  the  "transac-
tion" or "occurrence" that counts.  See Brief for Respondent 
21-23.  Citing Chavez  v.  Martinez, 538 U. S. 760 (2003) (plu-
rality opinion), Felix urges that neither the videotaped inter-
view with witness Williams nor the pretrial police interroga-
tion  to  which  Felix  himself  was  exposed  transgressed  any 
constitutional  limitation.  Until  the  statements  elicited  by 
the  police  were  introduced  at  trial,  Felix  argues,  he  had  no 
actionable  claim  at  all.  Both  the  confrontation  right  he 
timely presented and the privilege against self-incrimination 
he asserted in his amended petition are "trial right[s]," Felix 
underscores.  Brief  for  Respondent  21  (emphasis  deleted). 
His claims based on those rights, he maintains, are not "sepa-
rate,"  id.,  at  22;  rather,  they  are  related  in  time  and  type, 
for "they arose  on successive days during  the trial and both

Opinion of the Court 
challenged  [on  constitutional  grounds]  admission  of  pretrial statements," id., at 22-23. 

Felix artificially truncates his claims by homing in only on what makes them actionable in a habeas proceeding.  We do 
not  here  question  his  assertion  that  his  Fifth  Amendment right  did  not  ripen  until  his  statements  were  admitted 
against  him  at  trial.  See  Chavez,  538  U. S.,  at  766-767. Even  so,  the  essential  predicate  for  his  self-incrimination 
claim  was  an  extrajudicial  event,  i. e.,  an  out-of-court  police interrogation.  The  dispositive  question  in  an  adjudication 
of  that  claim  would  be  the  character  of  Felix's  conduct,  not in  court,  but  at  the  police  interrogation,  specifically,  did  he 
answer  voluntarily  or  were  his  statements  coerced.  See 
Haynes  v.  Washington,  373  U. S.  503,  513-514  (1963)  (vol-untariness  is  evaluated  by  examining  the  "totality  of  cir-

cumstances"  surrounding  the  "making  and  signing  of  the challenged confession"). 

Habeas  Corpus  Rule  2(c),  we  earlier  noted,  see  supra,  at 655-656,  instructs  petitioners  to  "specify  all  [available] 
grounds  for  relief "  and  to  "state  the  facts  supporting  each ground."  Under  that  Rule,  Felix's  Confrontation  Clause 
claim  would  be  pleaded  discretely,  as  would  his  self-incrimination  claim.  Each  separate  congeries  of  facts  sup-
porting  the  grounds  for  relief,  the  Rule  suggests,  would  de-lineate an "occurrence."  Felix's approach, the approach that 
prevailed  in  the  Ninth  Circuit,  is  boundless  by  comparison. A  miscellany  of  claims  for relief could be  raised later  rather 
than sooner and relate back, for "conduct, transaction, or oc-currence" would  be  defined to encompass  any pretrial,  trial, 
or post-trial error that could provide a basis for  challenging the conviction.  An  approach of that  breadth, as the Fourth 
Circuit  observed,  "views  `occurrence'  at  too  high  a  level  of generality."  Pittman, 209 F. 3d, at 318.

6 The  dissent  builds  a  complex  discussion  on  an  apparent  assumption 
that claim preclusion operates in  habeas cases  largely as it  does  in mine-
run  civil  cases.  See  post,  at  673-674.  Ironically,  few  habeas  petitions

662  MAYLE  v.  FELIX 

Opinion of the Court 
Congress enacted AEDPA to advance the finality of crimi-nal  convictions.  See  Rhines  v.  Weber,  544  U. S.  269,  276 

(2005).  To that end, it adopted a tight time line, a one-year limitation period ordinarily running from "the date on which 
the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or  the  expiration  of  the  time  for  seeking  such  review,"  28 
U. S. C.  $ 2244(d)(1)(A).  If  claims  asserted  after  the  one-year  period  could  be  revived  simply  because  they  relate  to 
the same trial, conviction, or sentence as a timely filed claim, AEDPA's  limitation  period  would  have  slim  significance. 
See  379  F.  3d,  at  619  (Tallman,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and dissenting  in  part)  (Ninth  Circuit's  rule  would  permit  "the 
`relation back' doctrine  to swallow AEDPA's statute of limi-tation"); 

Pittman, 209 F. 3d, at 318 ("If we were to craft such a  rule,  it  would  mean  that  amendments . . .  would  almost 

invariably  be  allowed  even  after  the  statute  of  limitations had expired, because most [habeas] claims arise from a crimi-
nal  defendant's  underlying  conviction  and  sentence.");  Duf-
fus, 174 F. 3d, at 338 ("A prisoner should not be able to assert a claim otherwise barred by the statute of limitations merely 

because  he  asserted  a  separate  claim  within  the  limitations period.").  The very  purpose of Rule 15(c)(2), as the dissent 
notes,  is  to  "qualify  a  statute  of  limitations."  Post,  at  666. 
would  survive  swift  dismissal  were  that  so,  for  the  very  objective  of  the 
petition  is  to  undo  a  final  judgment  after  direct  appeals  have  been  ex-
hausted  or  are  time  barred.  On  judicial  and  legislative  development  of 
standards  governing  successive  habeas  petitions,  standards  that  do  not 
track  the  Restatement  of  Judgments,  see  Schlup  v.  Delo,  513  U. S.  298, 
317-320 (1995); 2 R. Hertz & J. Liebman, Federal Habeas Corpus Practice 
and  Procedure  $ 28.2b,  pp.  1270-1275  (4th  ed.  2001);  Note,  Developments 
in  the  Law--Federal  Habeas  Corpus,  83  Harv.  L.  Rev.  1038,  1113,  1148- 
1154  (1970).  The  dissent  would  read  Rule  15(c)(2)'s  words,  "conduct, 
transaction, or occurrence," into AEDPA's provisions governing second or 
successive  petitions  and  motions  (28  U. S. C.  $$ 2244(b)  and  2255,  || 8),  al-
though  Congress  did not  put  those  words  there.  Nor  is  there  any  other 
reason to believe that Congress designed AEDPA's confinement of succes-
sive  petitions  and  motions  with  a  view  to  the  relation-back  concept  em-
ployed in Rule 15(c)(2).

Opinion of the Court 
But  "qualify"  does  not  mean  repeal.  See  Fuller  v.  Marx, 
724  F.  2d  717,  720  (CA8  1984).  Given  AEDPA's  "finality" 
and "federalism" concerns, see Williams v.  Taylor, 529 U. S. 
420,  436  (2000);  Hicks,  283  F.  3d,  at  389,  it  would  be  anoma-
lous  to  allow  relation  back  under  Rule  15(c)(2)  based  on  a 
broader reading of the words "conduct, transaction, or occur-
rence"  in  federal  habeas  proceedings  than  in  ordinary  civil 
litigation, see supra, at 657-659. 

Felix urges that an unconstrained reading of Rule 15(c)(2) 
is  not  problematic  because  Rule  15(a)  arms  district  courts 
with  "ample  power"  to  deny  leave  to  amend  when  justice 
so  requires.  See  Brief  for  Respondent  31-33.  Under  that 
Rule,  once  a  responsive  pleading  has  been  filed,  a  prisoner 
may amend the petition "only by leave of court or by written 
consent  of  the  adverse  party."  Rule  15(a);  see  Ellzey  v. 
United  States,  324  F.  3d,  at  526  (AEDPA's  aim  to  "expedite 
resolution of collateral attacks . . . should influence the exer-
cise of discretion under Rule  15(a)--which gives the district 
judge  the  right  to  disapprove  proposed  amendments  that 
would unduly prolong  or complicate  the case.").  This argu-
ment  overlooks  a  pleader's  right  to  amend  without  leave  of 
court  "any  time  before  a  responsive  pleading  is  served." 
Rule 15(a).  In federal habeas cases that time can be rather 
long, as indeed it was in the instant case.  See supra, at 651. 
Under  Habeas  Corpus  Rule  4,  a  petition  is  not  immediately 
served  on  the  respondent.  The  judge  first  examines  the 
pleading  to  determine  whether  "it  plainly  appears  .  .  .  that 
the  petitioner  is  not  entitled  to  relief."  Only  if  the  petition 
survives  that  preliminary  inspection  will  the  judge  "order 
the respondent to file an answer."  In the interim, the  peti-
tioner  may  amend  his  pleading  "as  a  matter  of  course,"  as 
Felix did in this very case.  Rule 15(a).  Accordingly, we do 
not regard Rule 15(a) as a firm check against petition amend-
ments that present new claims dependent upon discrete facts 
after AEDPA's limitation period has run.

664  MAYLE  v.  FELIX 

Opinion of the Court 
Our  rejection  of  Felix's  translation  of  same  "conduct, transaction,  or  occurrence"  to  mean  same  "trial,  conviction, 

or  sentence"  scarcely  leaves  Rule  15(c)(2)  "meaningless  in the habeas context," 379 F. 3d, at 615.  So long as the origi-
nal  and  amended  petitions  state  claims  that  are  tied  to  a common  core  of  operative  facts,  relation  back  will  be  in 
order.7  Our  reading  is  consistent  with  the  general  applica-tion of Rule 15(c)(2) in civil cases, see 

supra, at 657-659, with Habeas  Corpus  Rule  2(c),  see  supra,  at  655-656,  and  with 

AEDPA's installation of a tight time line for $ 2254 petitions, see supra, at 662-663.

8 

7 For example, in Mandacina v.  United States, 328 F. 3d 995, 1000-1001 
(CA8 2003), the original petition alleged violations of Brady v.  Maryland, 
373 U. S.  83 (1963),  while the amended petition alleged the Government's 
failure to disclose a particular report.  Both pleadings related to evidence 
obtained at the same time by the same police department.  The Court of 
Appeals approved relation back.  And in Woodward v. Williams, 263 F. 3d 
1135, 1142 (CA10 2001), the appeals court upheld relation back where the 
original  petition  challenged  the  trial  court's  admission  of  recanted  state-
ments, while the amended petition challenged the court's refusal to allow 
the  defendant  to  show  that  the  statements  had  been  recanted.  See  also 
3 J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice $ 15.19[2], p. 15-82 (3d ed. 2004) 
(relation  back  ordinarily  allowed  "when  the  new  claim  is  based  on  the 
same facts as the original pleading and only changes the legal theory"). 

8 The dissent is concerned that our decision "creates an unfair disparity 

between  indigent  habeas  petitioners  and  those  able  to  afford  their  own 
counsel."  Post,  at  665;  see  post,  at  675  ("[T]oday's  decision  .  .  .  will  fall 
most  heavily  on  the  shoulders  of  indigent  habeas  petitioners  who  can  af-
ford  no  counsel  without  the  assistance  of  the  court.").  The  concern  is 
understandable,  although  we  note  that  in  Felix's  case,  counsel  was  ap-
pointed, and had some two and a half months to amend the petition before 
AEDPA's limitation period expired.  See supra, at 651.  That was ample 
time  to add a  claim based  on the  alleged  pretrial  extraction of damaging 
statements  from  Felix.  Ordinarily,  as  we  observed  in  Halbert  v.  Michi-
gan, ante, at 624, n. 8, the government (federal or state) " `need not equal-
ize economic conditions' between criminal defendants of lesser and greater 
wealth"  (quoting  Griffin  v.  Illinois,  351  U. S.  12,  23  (1956)  (Frankfurter, 
J.,  concurring  in  judgment));  see  Pennsylvania  v.  Finley,  481  U. S.  551, 
557 (1987) (holding that States need not provide appointed counsel in post-
conviction  proceedings).  This  case,  it  is  inescapably  true,  does  not  fit

Syllabus 
Despite the Commandments' religious message, an inquiry into the con-
text in which the text of the Commandments is used demonstrates that 
the Commandments  also convey a  secular moral  message about proper 
standards  of  social  conduct  and  a  message  about  the  historic  relation 
between those standards and the law.  The circumstances surrounding 
the  monument's  placement  on  the  capitol  grounds  and  its  physical  set-
ting provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Command-
ments' text as used on this monument conveys a predominantly secular 
message.  The  determinative  factor  here,  however,  is  that  40  years 
passed  in  which  the  monument's  presence,  legally  speaking,  went  un-
challenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner).  Those 
40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that 
few individuals, whatever their belief systems, are likely to have under-
stood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, 
to a government effort to establish religion.  See ibid.
