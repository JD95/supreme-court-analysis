In 1912, in one month, its en-tire African-American population, over 1,000 citizens, wasdriven systematically from the county in the wake of therape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of heraccused assailant.1 Seventy-five years later, in 1987, thecounty population remained 99% white.2Spurred by this history, Hosea Williams, an Atlanta citycouncilman and civil rights personality, proposed a ForsythCounty "March Against Fear and Intimidation" for Janu-ary 17, 1987. Approximately 90 civil rights demonstratorsattempted to parade in Cumming, the county seat. Themarchers were met by members of the Forsyth CountyDefense League (an independent affiliate of respondent,The Nationalist Movement), of the Ku Klux Klan, and otherCumming residents. In all, some 400 counterdemonstratorslined the parade route, shouting racial slurs. Eventually,the counterdemonstrators, dramatically outnumbering policeofficers, forced the parade to a premature halt by throwingrocks and beer bottles.Williams planned a return march the following weekend.It developed into the largest civil rights demonstration inthe South since the 1960's. On January 24, approximately20,000 marchers joined civil rights leaders, United StatesSenators, Presidential candidates, and an Assistant UnitedStates Attorney General in a parade and rally.3 The 1,000counterdemonstrators on the parade route were contained1 The 1910 census counted 1,098 African-Americans in Forsyth County.U.

Although there was sporadic rock throwingand 60 counterdemonstrators were arrested, the parade wasnot interrupted.

The ordi-nance recites that it is "to provide for the issuance of permitsfor parades, assemblies, demonstrations, road closings, andother uses of public property and roads by private organizations and groups of private persons for private purposes."See App. to Pet. for Cert. 98. The board of commissionersjustified the ordinance by explaining that "the cost of necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating inor observing said parades, assemblies, demonstrations, roadclosings and other related activities exceeds the usual andnormal cost of law enforcement for which those participatingshould be held accountable and responsible." Id., at 100.The ordinance required the permit applicant to defray thesecosts by paying a fee, the amount of which was to be fixed"from time to time" by the Board.

Nationalist Movement v. City of Cumming, 913 F. 2d 885, 887 (CA11 1990).6The county imposed a $100 fee. The fee did not include anycalculation for expenses incurred by law enforcement authorities, but was based on 10 hours of the county administrator'stime in issuing the permit. The county administrator testified that the cost of his time was deliberately undervaluedand that he did not charge for the clerical support involvedin processing the application. Tr. 135-139.The Movement did not pay the fee and did not hold therally. Instead, it instituted this action on January 19, 1989,in the United States District Court for the Northern Districtof Georgia, requesting a temporary restraining order andpermanent injunction prohibiting Forsyth County from interfering with the Movement's plans.The District Court denied the temporary restraining orderand injunction.

Id., at 14.The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed this aspect of the District Court's judgment.Nationalist Movement v. City of Cumming, 913 F. 2d 885(1990). Relying on its prior opinion in Central Florida Nuclear Freeze Campaign v. Walsh, 774 F. 2d 1515, 1521 (CA111985), cert. denied, 475 U.

The court determined that a permit feeof up to $1,000 a day exceeded this constitutional threshold.Ibid. One judge concurred specially, calling for CentralFlorida to be overruled. 913 F. 2d, at 896.The Court of Appeals then voted to vacate the panel'sopinion and to rehear the case en banc. 921 F. 2d 1125(1990). After further briefing, the court issued a per curiam opinion reinstating the panel opinion in its entirety.934 F. 2d 1482, 1483 (1991). Two judges, concurring in partand dissenting in part, agreed that any fee imposed on theexercise of First Amendment rights in a traditional publicforum must be nominal if it is to survive constitutional scru-tiny. Those judges, however, did not believe that the countyordinance swept so broadly that it was facially invalid, andwould have remanded the case for the District Court to determine whether the fee was nominal.7 Ibid.

S. 1023(1991).IIRespondent mounts a facial challenge to the ForsythCounty ordinance. It is well established that in the area offreedom of expression an overbroad regulation may be subject to facial review and invalidation, even though its application in the case under consideration may be constitutionallyunobjectionable. See, e. g., City Council of Los Angeles v.Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U. S. 789, 798-799, and n. 15(1984); Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews forJesus, Inc., 482 U. S. 569, 574 (1987). This exception fromgeneral standing rules is based on an appreciation that thevery existence of some broadly written laws has the potential to chill the expressive activity of others not before thecourt. See, e. g., New York v. Ferber, 458 U. S. 747, 772(1982); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U. S. 491, 503(1985). Thus, the Court has permitted a party to challengean ordinance under the overbreadth doctrine in cases whereevery application creates an impermissible risk of suppression of ideas, such as an ordinance that delegates overlybroad discretion to the decisionmaker, see Thornhill v. Ala8 Compare the Eleventh Circuit's opinions in this litigation, 913 F. 2d885, 891 (1990), and 934 F. 2d 1482, 1483 (1991), with Stonewall Union v.Columbus, 931 F. 2d 1130, 1136 (CA6) (permitting greater than nominalfees that are reasonably related to expenses incident to the preservation ofpublic safety and order), cert. denied, 502 U.

S., at 798,n. 15, and in cases where the ordinance sweeps too broadly,penalizing a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected, see Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U. S. 601(1973);Jews for Jesus, 482 U. S., at 574-575.The Forsyth County ordinance requiring a permit and afee before authorizing public speaking, parades, or assem-blies in "the archetype of a traditional public forum," Frisbyv. Schultz, 487 U. S. 474, 480 (1988), is a prior restraint onspeech, see Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U. S. 147,150-151 (1969); Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 271(1951). Although there is a "heavy presumption" againstthe validity of a prior restraint, Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U. S. 58, 70 (1963), the Court has recognized thatgovernment, in order to regulate competing uses of publicforums, may impose a permit requirement on those wishingto hold a march, parade, or rally, see Cox v. New Hampshire,312 U. S. 569, 574-576 (1941). Such a scheme, however,must meet certain constitutional requirements. It may notdelegate overly broad licensing discretion to a governmentofficial. SeeFreedman v. Maryland, supra. Further, anypermit scheme controlling the time, place, and manner ofspeech must not be based on the content of the message,must be narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest, and must leave open ample alternatives for com-munication. SeeUnited States v. Grace, 461 U. S. 171, 177(1983).ARespondent contends that the county ordinance is faciallyinvalid because it does not prescribe adequate standards forthe administrator to apply when he sets a permit fee. Agovernment regulation that allows arbitrary application is"inherently inconsistent with a valid time, place, and mannerregulation because such discretion has the potential for becoming a means of suppressing a particular point of view."505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT131Cite as: 505 U.

To curtail that risk, "alaw subjecting the exercise of First Amendment freedoms tothe prior restraint of a license" must contain "narrow, objective, and definite standards to guide the licensing authority."Shuttlesworth, 394 U. S., at 150-151; see also Niemotko, 340U. S., at 271. The reasoning is simple: If the permit scheme"involves appraisal of facts, the exercise of judgment, andthe formation of an opinion," Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310U. S. 296, 305 (1940), by the licensing authority, "the dangerof censorship and of abridgment of our precious FirstAmendment freedoms is too great" to be permitted, Southeastern Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U. S. 546, 553 (1975).In evaluating respondent's facial challenge, we must consider the county's authoritative constructions of the ordi-nance, including its own implementation and interpretationof it. See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U. S. 781, 795-796 (1989); Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486U. S. 750, 770, n. 11 (1988); Gooding v. Wilson, 405 U. S. 518,524-528 (1972). In the present litigation, the county hasmade clear how it interprets and implements the ordinance.The ordinance can apply to any activity on public property--from parades, to street corner speeches, to bike races--andthe fee assessed may reflect the county's police and administrative costs. Whether or not, in any given instance, the feewould include any or all of the county's administrative andsecurity expenses is decided by the county administrator.99 In pertinent part, the ordinance, as amended, states that the administrator "shall adjust the amount to be paid in order to meet the expenseincident to the administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenance ofpublic order." $ 3(6) (emphasis added), App. to Pet. for Cert. 119. Thiscould suggest that the administrator has no authority to reduce or waivethese expenses. It has not been so understood, however, by the county.See 934 F. 2d, at 1488, n. 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting inpart). In its February 23, 1987, amendments to the ordinance, the boardof commissioners changed the permit form from "Have you paid the application fee?" to "Have you paid any application fee?," see App. to505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:07 PAGES OPINPGT132 FORSYTH COUNTY v. NATIONALIST MOVEMENTOpinion of the CourtIn this case, according to testimony at the District Courthearing, the administrator based the fee on his own judgment of what would be reasonable. Although the countypaid for clerical support and staff as an "expense incident tothe administration" of the permit, the administrator testifiedthat he chose in this instance not to include that expense inthe fee. The administrator also attested that he had delib-erately kept the fee low by undervaluing the cost of the timehe spent processing the application. Even if he had spentmore time on the project, he claimed, he would not havecharged more. He further testified that, in this instance, hechose not to include any charge for expected security expense. Tr. 135-139.The administrator also explained that the county had imposed a fee pursuant to a permit on two prior occasions.The year before, the administrator had assessed a fee of $100for a permit for the Movement. The administrator testifiedthat he charged the same fee the following year (the year inquestion here), although he did not state that the Movementwas seeking the same use of county property or that it required the same amount of administrative time to process.Id., at 138. The administrator also once charged bike-raceorganizers $25 to hold a race on county roads, but he didnot explain why processing a bike-race permit demanded lessadministrative time than processing a parade permit or whyhe had chosen to assess $25 in that instance. Id., at 143-144.At oral argument in this Court, counsel for Forsyth Countystated that the administrator had levied a $5 fee on the GirlScouts for an activity on county property. Tr. of Oral Arg.26. Finally, the administrator testified that in other casesthe county required neither a permit nor a fee for activitiesin other county facilities or on county land. Tr. 146.Based on the county's implementation and construction ofthe ordinance, it simply cannot be said that there are anyPet. for Cert. 115 (emphasis added), thus acknowledging the administrator's authority to charge no fee.505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT133Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992)Opinion of the Court"narrowly drawn, reasonable and definite standards," Nie-motko, 340 U. S., at 271, guiding the hand of the ForsythCounty administrator. The decision how much to charge forpolice protection or administrative time--or even whetherto charge at all--is left to the whim of the administrator.There are no articulated standards either in the ordinanceor in the county's established practice. The administrator isnot required to rely on any objective factors. He need notprovide any explanation for his decision, and that decision isunreviewable. Nothing in the law or its application prevents the official from encouraging some views and discour-aging others through the arbitrary application of fees.10The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbri-dled discretion in a government official.11BThe Forsyth County ordinance contains more than the pos-sibility of censorship through uncontrolled discretion. As10 The District Court's finding that in this instance the Forsyth Countyadministrator applied legitimate, content-neutral criteria, even if correct,is irrelevant to this facial challenge. Facial attacks on the discretiongranted a decisionmaker are not dependent on the facts surrounding anyparticular permit decision. See Lakewood v. Plain Dealer PublishingCo., 486 U. S. 750, 770 (1988). "It is not merely the sporadic abuse ofpower by the censor but the pervasive threat inherent in its very existencethat constitutes the danger to freedom of discussion." Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 97 (1940). Accordingly, the success of a facial challenge on the grounds that an ordinance delegates overly broad discretionto the decisionmaker rests not on whether the administrator has exercisedhis discretion in a content-based manner, but whether there is anythingin the ordinance preventing him from doing so.11 Petitioner also claims that Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941),excuses the administrator's discretion in setting the fee. Reliance on Coxis misplaced. Although the discretion granted to the administrator underthe language in this ordinance is the same as in the statute at issue inCox, the interpretation and application of that language are different. Unlike this case, there was in Cox no testimony or evidence that the statutegranted unfettered discretion to the licensing authority. Id., at 576-577.505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT134 FORSYTH COUNTY v. NATIONALIST MOVEMENTOpinion of the Courtconstrued by the county, the ordinance often requires thatthe fee be based on the content of the speech.The county envisions that the administrator, in appro-priate instances, will assess a fee to cover "the cost of necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating in orobserving said . . . activit[y]." See App. to Pet. for Cert.100. In order to assess accurately the cost of security forparade participants, the administrator " `must necessarily ex-amine the content of the message that is conveyed,' "Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U. S. 221, 230(1987), quotingFCC v. League of Women Voters of Cal., 468U. S. 364, 383 (1984), estimate the response of others to thatcontent, and judge the number of police necessary to meetthat response. The fee assessed will depend on the administrator's measure of the amount of hostility likely to be created by the speech based on its content. Those wishing toexpress views unpopular with bottle throwers, for example,may have to pay more for their permit.Although petitioner agrees that the cost of policing relatesto content, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 15 and 24, it contends thatthe ordinance is content neutral because it is aimed only ata secondary effect--the cost of maintaining public order. Itis clear, however, that, in this case, it cannot be said thatthe fee's justification " `ha[s] nothing to do with content.' "Ward, 491 U. S., at 792, quoting Boos v. Barry, 485 U. S. 312,320 (1988) (opinion of O'Connor, J.).The costs to which petitioner refers are those associatedwith the public's reaction to the speech.

The county offers only one12 The dissent prefers a remand because there are no lower court findings on the question whether the county plans to base parade fees onhostile crowds. See post, at 142. We disagree. A remand is unnecessary because there is no question that petitioner intends the ordinance torecoup costs that are related to listeners' reaction to the speech. Petitioner readily admits it did not charge for police protection for the 4th ofJuly parades, although they were substantial parades, which required theclosing of streets and drew large crowds. Petitioner imposed a fee onlywhen it became necessary to provide security for parade participants fromangry crowds opposing their message. Brief for Petitioner 6. The ordinance itself makes plain that the costs at issue are those needed for "necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating in or observing"the speech. See App. to Pet. for Cert. 100. Repayment for police protection is the "[m]ost importan[t]" purpose underlying the ordinance. Brieffor Petitioner 6-7.In this Court, petitioner specifically urges reversal because the lowercourt has "taken away the right of local government to obtain reimbursement for administration and policing costs which are incurred in protecting those using government property for expression." Id., at 17 (emphasis added). When directly faced with the Court of Appeals' concern about"the enhanced cost associated with policing expressive activity whichwould generate potentially violent reactions," id., at 36, petitioner responded not by arguing that it did not intend to charge for police protection, but that such a charge was permissible because the ordinance provided a cap. See id., at 36-37; Tr. of Oral Arg. 24. At no point, in anylevel of proceedings, has petitioner intimated that it did not construe theordinance consistent with its language permitting fees to be charged forthe cost of police protection from hostile crowds.

NATIONALIST MOVEMENTOpinion of the Courtjustification for this ordinance: raising revenue for policeservices. While this undoubtedly is an important government responsibility, it does not justify a content-based permitfee. See id., at 229-231.Petitioner insists that its ordinance cannot be unconstitu-tionally content based because it contains much of the samelanguage as did the state statute upheld in Cox v. NewHampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941). Although the SupremeCourt of New Hampshire had interpreted the statute atissue in Cox to authorize the municipality to charge a permitfee for the "maintenance of public order," no fee was actuallyassessed. See id., at 577. Nothing in this Court's opinionsuggests that the statute, as interpreted by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, called for charging a premium in thecase of a controversial political message delivered before ahostile audience. In light of the Court's subsequent FirstAmendment jurisprudence, we do not readCox to permitsuch a premium.CPetitioner, as well as the Court of Appeals and the DistrictCourt, all rely on the maximum allowable fee as the touchstone of constitutionality. Petitioner contends that the$1,000 cap on the fee ensures that the ordinance will notresult in content-based discrimination. The ordinance wasfound unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals because the$1,000 cap was not sufficiently low to be "nominal." Neitherthe $1,000 cap on the fee charged, nor even some lower nominal cap, could save the ordinance because in this context, thelevel of the fee is irrelevant. A tax based on the content ofspeech does not become more constitutional because it is asmall tax.The lower courts derived their requirement that the per-mit fee be "nominal" from a sentence in the opinion inMur-dock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105 (1943). In Murdock, theCourt invalidated a flat license fee levied on distributors ofreligious literature. In distinguishing the case from Cox,505US1$98F 07-12-96 11:08:08 PAGES OPINPGT137Cite as: 505 U. S. 123 (1992)Rehnquist, C. J., dissentingwhere the Court upheld a permit fee, the Court stated: "Andthe fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatory measureand calculated to defray the expense of protecting those onthe streets and at home against the abuses of solicitors."319 U. S., at 116. This sentence does not mean that an in-valid fee can be saved if it is nominal, or that only nominalcharges are constitutionally permissible. It reflects merelyone distinction between the facts inMurdock and those inCox.The tax at issue in Murdock was invalid because it wasunrelated to any legitimate state interest, not because it wasof a particular size. Similarly, the provision of the ForsythCounty ordinance relating to fees is invalid because it unconstitutionally ties the amount of the fee to the content of thespeech and lacks adequate procedural safeguards; no limit onsuch a fee can remedy these constitutional violations.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
