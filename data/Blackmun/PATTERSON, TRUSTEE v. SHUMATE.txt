The Bankruptcy Code excludes from the bankruptcy es-tate property of the debtor that is subject to a restriction ontransfer enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy law."11 U. S. C. $ 541(c)(2). We must decide in this case whetheran antialienation provision contained in an ERISA-qualifiedpension plan constitutes a restriction on transfer enforceableunder "applicable nonbankruptcy law," and whether, accord-ingly, a debtor may exclude his interest in such a plan fromthe property of the bankruptcy estate.IRespondent Joseph B. Shumate, Jr., was employed for over30 years by Coleman Furniture Corporation, where he ultimately attained the position of president and chairman of theboard of directors. Shumate and approximately 400 otheremployees were participants in the Coleman Furniture Cor-poration Pension Plan (Plan). The Plan satisfied all applicable requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Secu-rity Act of 1974 (ERISA) and qualified for favorable taxtreatment under the Internal Revenue Code. In particular,Article 16.1 of the Plan contained the antialienation provisionrequired for qualification under $ 206(d)(1) of ERISA, 29U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1) ("Each pension plan shall provide thatbenefits provided under the plan may not be assigned oralienated"). App. 342. Shumate's interest in the Plan wasvalued at $250,000. Id., at 93-94.In 1982, Coleman Furniture filed a petition for bankruptcyunder Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The case wasconverted to a Chapter 7 proceeding, and a trustee, Roy V.Creasy, was appointed. Shumate himself encountered fi-nancial difficulties and filed a petition for bankruptcy in 1984.His case, too, was converted to a Chapter 7 proceeding, andpetitioner John R. Patterson was appointed trustee.Creasy terminated and liquidated the Plan, providing fulldistributions to all participants except Shumate. Patterson504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT756 PATTERSON v. SHUMATEOpinion of the Courtthen filed an adversary proceeding against Creasy in theBankruptcy Court for the Western District of Virginia torecover Shumate's interest in the Plan for the benefit ofShumate's bankruptcy estate. Shumate in turn asked theUnited States District Court for the Western District of Virginia, which already had jurisdiction over a related proceed-ing, to compel Creasy to pay Shumate's interest in the Plandirectly to him. The bankruptcy proceeding subsequentlywas consolidated with the District Court action. App. toPet. for Cert. 53a-54a.The District Court rejected Shumate's contention that hisinterest in the Plan should be excluded from his bankruptcyestate. The court held that $ 541(c)(2)'s reference to "nonbankruptcy law" embraced only state law, not federal lawsuch as ERISA. Creasy v. Coleman Furniture Corp., 83B. R. 404, 406 (1988). Applying Virginia law, the court heldthat Shumate's interest in the Plan did not qualify for protection as a spendthrift trust. Id., at 406-409. The DistrictCourt also rejected Shumate's alternative argument thateven if his interest in the Plan could not be excluded fromthe bankruptcy estate under $ 541(c)(2), he was entitled to anexemption under 11 U. S. C. $ 522(b)(2)(A), which allows adebtor to exempt from property of the estate "any propertythat is exempt under Federal law." 83 B. R., at 409-410.The District Court ordered Creasy to pay Shumate's interestin the Plan over to his bankruptcy estate. App. to Pet. forCert. 54a-55a.The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed.943 F. 2d 362 (1991). The court relied on its earlier decisionin In re Moore, 907 F. 2d 1476 (1990), in which anotherFourth Circuit panel was described as holding, subsequentto the District Court's decision in the instant case, that"ERISA-qualified plans, which by definition have a nonalienation provision, constitute `applicable nonbankruptcylaw' and contain enforceable restrictions on the transfer ofpension interests." 943 F. 2d, at 365. Thus, the Court of504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT757Cite as: 504 U.

Ibid.The court then declined to consider Shumate's alternativeargument that his interest in the Plan qualified for exemption under $ 522(b). Id., at 365-366.We granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 1057 (1992), to resolvethe conflict among the Courts of Appeals as to whether anantialienation provision in an ERISA-qualified pension planconstitutes a restriction on transfer enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy law" for purposes of the $ 541(c)(2)exclusion of property from the debtor's bankruptcy estate.1IIAIn our view, the plain language of the Bankruptcy Codeand ERISA is our determinant. See Toibb v. Radloff, 501U. S. 157, 160 (1991). Section 541(c)(2) provides the following exclusion from the otherwise broad definition of "property of the estate" contained in $ 541(a)(1) of the Code:"A restriction on the transfer of a beneficial interest ofthe debtor in a trust that is enforceable under applicablenonbankruptcy law is enforceable in a case under thistitle."

SHUMATEOpinion of the CourtThe natural reading of the provision entitles a debtor to ex-clude from property of the estate any interest in a plan ortrust that contains a transfer restriction enforceable underany relevant nonbankruptcy law. Nothing in $ 541 suggeststhat the phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" refers, aspetitioner contends, exclusively tostate law. The text con-tains no limitation on "applicable nonbankruptcy law" relating to the source of the law.Reading the term "applicable nonbankruptcy law" in$ 541(c)(2) to include federal as well as state law comportswith other references in the Bankruptcy Code to sources oflaw. The Code reveals, significantly, that Congress, when itdesired to do so, knew how to restrict the scope of applicablelaw to "state law" and did so with some frequency. See, e. g.,11 U. S. C. $ 109(c)(2) (entity may be a debtor under chapter 9if authorized "by State law"); $ 522(b)(1) (election of exemp-tions controlled by "the State law that is applicable to thedebtor"); $ 523(a)(5) (a debt for alimony, maintenance, orsupport determined "in accordance with State or territoriallaw" is not dischargeable); $ 903(1) ("[A] State law prescrib-ing a method of composition of indebtedness" of municipalities is not binding on nonconsenting creditors); see also$$ 362(b)(12) and 1145(a). Congress' decision to use thebroader phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" in $ 541(c)(2)strongly suggests that it did not intend to restrict the provision in the manner that petitioner contends.22 The phrase "applicable nonbankruptcy law" appears elsewhere in theCode, and courts have construed those references to include federal law.See, e. g., 11 U. S. C. $ 1125(d) (adequacy of disclosure statement not governed by any "otherwise applicable nonbankruptcy law"); In re StanleyHotel, Inc., 13 B. R. 926, 931 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Colo. 1981) ($ 1125(d) includesfederal securities law); 11 U. S. C. $ 108(a) (referring to statute of limitations fixed by "applicable nonbankruptcy law"); In re Ahead By a Length,Inc., 100 B. R. 157, 162-163 (Bkrtcy. Ct. SDNY 1989) ($ 108(a) includesRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act); Motor CarrierAudit & Collection Co. v. Lighting Products, Inc., 113 B. R. 424, 425-426(ND Ill. 1989) ($ 108(a) includes Interstate Commerce Act); 11 U. S. C.504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT759Cite as: 504 U. S. 753 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe text of $ 541(c)(2) does not support petitioner's conten-tion that "applicable nonbankruptcy law" is limited to statelaw. Plainly read, the provision encompasses any relevantnonbankruptcy law, including federal law such as ERISA.We must enforce the statute according to its terms. SeeUnited States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S. 235,241 (1989).BHaving concluded that "applicable nonbankruptcy law" isnot limited to state law, we next determine whether the antialienation provision contained in the ERISA-qualified Planat issue here satisfies the literal terms of $ 541(c)(2).Section 206(d)(1) of ERISA, which states that "[e]ach pen-sion plan shall provide that benefits provided under the planmay not be assigned or alienated," 29 U. S. C. $ 1056(d)(1),clearly imposes a "restriction on the transfer" of a debtor's"beneficial interest" in the trust. The coordinate section ofthe Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C. $ 401(a)(13), states asa general rule that "[a] trust shall not constitute a qualifiedtrust under this section unless the plan of which such trustis a part provides that benefits provided under the plan maynot be assigned or alienated," and thus contains similar restrictions. See also 26 CFR $ 1.401(a)-13(b)(1) (1991).Coleman Furniture's pension plan complied with these requirements. Article 16.1 of the Plan specifically stated: "Nobenefit, right or interest" of any participant "shall be subject$ 108(b) (referring to time for filing pleadings, notices, etc., fixed by "applicable nonbankruptcy law"); Eagle-Picher Industries, Inc. v. United States,290 U. S. App. D. C. 307, 321-322, 937 F. 2d 625, 639-640 (1991) ($ 108(b)includes Federal Tort Claims Act). Although we express no view on thecorrectness of these decisions, we note that our construction of $ 541(c)(2)'sreference to "applicable nonbankruptcy law" as including federal law accords with prevailing interpretations of that phrase as it appears elsewhere in the Code. See Morrison-Knudsen Constr. Co. v. Director, Officeof Workers' Compensation Programs, 461 U. S. 624, 633 (1983) (recognizing principle "that a word is presumed to have the same meaning in allsubsections of the same statute").504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT760 PATTERSON v. SHUMATEOpinion of the Courtto anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge,encumbrance or charge, seizure, attachment or other legal,equitable or other process." App. 342.Moreover, these transfer restrictions are "enforceable," asrequired by $ 541(c)(2). Plan trustees or fiduciaries are required under ERISA to discharge their duties "in accordancewith the documents and instruments governing the plan."29 U. S. C. $ 1104(a)(1)(D). A plan participant, beneficiary, orfiduciary, or the Secretary of Labor may file a civil action to"enjoin any act or practice" which violates ERISA or theterms of the plan. $$ 1132(a)(3) and (5). Indeed, this Courtitself vigorously has enforced ERISA's prohibition on the assignment or alienation of pension benefits, declining to recognize any implied exceptions to the broad statutory bar. SeeGuidry v. Sheet Metal Workers Nat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S.365 (1990).3The antialienation provision required for ERISA qualification and contained in the Plan at issue in this case thusconstitutes an enforceable transfer restriction for purposesof $ 541(c)(2)'s exclusion of property from the bankruptcyestate.IIIPetitioner raises several challenges to this conclusion.Given the clarity of the statutory text, however, he bears an"exceptionally heavy" burden of persuading us that Congressintended to limit the $ 541(c)(2) exclusion to restrictions ontransfer that are enforceable only under state spendthrifttrust law. Union Bank v. Wolas, 502 U. S. 151, 155-156(1991).3 The Internal Revenue Service at least on occasion has espoused theview that the transfer of a beneficiary's interest in a pension plan to abankruptcy trustee would disqualify the plan from taking advantage ofthe preferential tax treatment available under ERISA. See McLean v.Central States, Southeast & Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 762 F. 2d1204, 1206 (CA4 1985); see also In re Moore, 907 F. 2d, at 1481.504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT761Cite as: 504 U. S. 753 (1992)Opinion of the CourtAPetitioner first contends that contemporaneous legislativematerials demonstrate that $ 541(c)(2)'s exclusion of propertyfrom the bankruptcy estate should not extend to a debtor'sinterest in an ERISA-qualified pension plan. Althoughcourts "appropriately may refer to a statute's legislative his-tory to resolve statutory ambiguity,"Toibb v. Radloff, 501U. S., at 162, the clarity of the statutory language at issue inthis case obviates the need for any such inquiry. See ibid.;United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc., 489 U. S., at241; Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U. S. 803, 809,n. 3 (1989).4Even were we to consider the legislative materials towhich petitioner refers, however, we could discern no"clearly expressed legislative intention" contrary to the result reached above. See Consumer Product Safety Comm'nv. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 108 (1980). In hisbrief, petitioner quotes from House and Senate Reports ac-companying the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 that purportedly reflect "unmistakable" congressional intent to limit$ 541(c)(2)'s exclusion to pension plans that qualify understate law as spendthrift trusts. Brief for Petitioner 38.Those reports contain only the briefest of discussions addressing $ 541(c)(2). The House Report states: "Paragraph(2) of subsection (c) . . . preserves restrictions on transferof a spendthrift trust to the extent that the restriction isenforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law." H. R.Rep. No. 95-595, p. 369 (1977); see also S. Rep. No. 95-989,p. 83 (1978) ($ 541(c)(2) "preserves restrictions on a transferof a spendthrift trust"). A general introductory section to4 Those Courts of Appeals that have limited "applicable nonbankruptcylaw" to state spendthrift trust law by ignoring the plain language of$ 541(c)(2) and relying on isolated excerpts from the legislative historythus have misconceived the appropriate analytical task. See, e. g., In reDaniel, 771 F. 2d, at 1359-1360; In re Lichstrahl, 750 F. 2d, at 1490; In reGraham, 726 F. 2d, at 1271-1272; In re Goff, 706 F. 2d, at 581-582.504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT762 PATTERSON v. SHUMATEOpinion of the Courtthe House Report contains the additional statement that thenew law "continues over the exclusion from property of theestate of the debtor's interest in a spendthrift trust to theextent the trust is protected from creditors under applicableState law." H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 176. These meagerexcerpts reflect at best congressional intent toinclude statespendthrift trust law within the meaning of "applicable nonbankruptcy law." By no means do they provide a sufficientbasis for concluding, in derogation of the statute's clear language, that Congress intended to exclude other state andfederal law from the provision's scope.BPetitioner next contends that our construction of$ 541(c)(2), pursuant to which a debtor may exclude his interest in an ERISA-qualified pension plan from the bankruptcyestate, renders $ 522(d)(10)(E) of the Bankruptcy Code superfluous. Brief for Petitioner 24-33. Under $ 522(d)(10)(E), adebtor who elects the federal exemptions set forth in $ 522(d)may exempt from the bankruptcy estate his right to receive"a payment under a stock bonus, pension, profitsharing, annuity, or similar plan or contract . . . , to the extent reason-ably necessary for the support of the debtor and any dependent of the debtor." If a debtor's interest in a pension plancould be excluded in full from the bankruptcy estate, theargument goes, then there would have been no reason forCongress to create a limited exemption for such interestselsewhere in the statute.Petitioner's surplusage argument fails, however, for thereason that $ 522(d)(10)(E) exempts from the bankruptcyestate a much broader category of interests than $ 541(c)(2)excludes. For example, pension plans established bygovernmental entities and churches need not comply withSubchapter I of ERISA, including the antialienation re-quirement of $ 206(d)(1). See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1003(b)(1) and (2);26 CFR $ 1.401(a)-13(a) (1991). So, too, pension plans that504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT763Cite as: 504 U. S. 753 (1992)Opinion of the Courtqualify for preferential tax treatment under 26 U. S. C. $ 408(individual retirement accounts) are specifically exceptedfrom ERISA's antialienation requirement. See 29 U. S. C.$ 1051(6). Although a debtor's interest in these plans couldnot be excluded under $ 541(c)(2) because the plans lacktransfer restrictions enforceable under "applicable nonbankruptcy law," that interest 5 nevertheless could be exemptedunder $ 522(d)(10)(E).6 Once petitioner concedes that$ 522(d)(10)(E)'s exemption applies to more than ERISA-qualified plans containing antialienation provisions, see Tr.of Oral Arg. 10-11; Brief for Petitioner 31, his argument thatour reading of $ 541(c)(2) renders the exemption provisionsuperfluous must collapse. CFinally, petitioner contends that our holding frustrates theBankruptcy Code's policy of ensuring a broad inclusion ofassets in the bankruptcy estate. See id., at 37; 11 U. S. C.$ 541(a)(1) (estate composed of "all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property as of the commencement ofthe case"). As an initial matter, we think that petitioner5 We express no opinion on the separate question whether $ 522(d)(10)(E)applies only to distributions from a pension plan that a debtor has animmediate and present right to receive, or to the entire undistributed corpus of a pension trust. See, e. g., In re Harline, 950 F. 2d, at 675; Velis v.Kardanis, 949 F. 2d, at 81-82. See also Arnopol, Including RetirementBenefits in a Debtor's Bankruptcy Estate: A Proposal for HarmonizingERISA and the Bankruptcy Code, 56 Mo. L. Rev. 491, 535-536 (1991).6 Even those courts that would have limited $ 541(c)(2) to state law acknowledge the breadth of the $ 522(d)(10)(E) exemption. See In re Goff,706 F. 2d, at 587 (noting that $ 522(d)(10)(E) "reaches a broad array ofemployment benefits, and exempts both qualified and unqualified pensionplans") (footnote omitted); In re Graham, 726 F. 2d, at 1272 (observingthat "the $ 522(d)(10)(E) exemption would apply to non-ERISA plans aswell as to qualified ERISA plans"). See also Arnopol, 56 Mo. L. Rev., at525-526, 552-553; Seiden, Chapter 7 Cases: Do ERISA and the Bankruptcy Code Conflict as to Whether a Debtor's Interest in or Rights Undera Qualified Plan Can be Used to Pay Claims?, 61 Am. Bankr. L. J. 301,318 (1987).504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT764 PATTERSON v. SHUMATEOpinion of the Courtmistakes an admittedly broad definition of includable property for a "policy" underlying the Code as a whole. In anyevent, to the extent that policy considerations are even relevant where the language of the statute is so clear, we believethat our construction of $ 541(c)(2) is preferable to the onepetitioner urges upon us.First, our decision today ensures that the treatment ofpension benefits will not vary based on the beneficiary'sbankruptcy status. See Butner v. United States, 440 U. S.48, 55 (1979) (observing that "[u]niform treatment of property interests" prevents "a party from receiving `a windfallmerely by reason of the happenstance of bankruptcy,' " quoting Lewis v. Manufacturers National Bank, 364 U. S. 603,609 (1961)). We previously have declined to recognize anyexceptions to ERISA's antialienation provision outside thebankruptcy context. See Guidry v. Sheet Metal WorkersNat. Pension Fund, 493 U. S. 365 (1990) (labor union maynot impose constructive trust on pension benefits of unionofficial who breached fiduciary duties and embezzled funds).Declining to recognize any exceptions to that provisionwithin the bankruptcy context minimizes the possibility thatcreditors will engage in strategic manipulation of the bankruptcy laws in order to gain access to otherwise inaccessiblefunds. See Seiden, Chapter 7 Cases: Do ERISA and theBankruptcy Code Conflict as to Whether a Debtor's Interestin or Rights Under a Qualified Plan Can be Used to PayClaims?, 61 Am. Bankr. L. J. 301, 317 (1987) (noting inconsistency if "a creditor could not reach a debtor-participant'splan right or interest in a garnishment or other collectionaction outside of a bankruptcy case but indirectly could reachthe plan right or interest by filing a petition . . . to place thedebtor in bankruptcy involuntarily").Our holding also gives full and appropriate effect toERISA's goal of protecting pension benefits. See 29 U. S. C.$$ 1001(b) and (c). This Court has described that goal as one504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT765Cite as: 504 U. S. 753 (1992)Opinion of the Courtof ensuring that "if a worker has been promised a definedpension benefit upon retirement--and if he has fulfilledwhatever conditions are required to obtain a vested benefit--he actually will receive it." Nachman Corp. v. PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporation, 446 U. S. 359, 375 (1980).In furtherance of these principles, we recently declined inGuidry, notwithstanding strong equitable considerations tothe contrary, to recognize an implied exception to ERISA'santialienation provision that would have allowed a laborunion to impose a constructive trust on the pension benefitsof a corrupt union official. We explained:"Section 206(d) reflects a considered congressional policychoice, a decision to safeguard a stream of income forpensioners (and their dependents, who may be, andperhaps usually are, blameless), even if that decisionprevents others from securing relief for the wrongsdone them. If exceptions to this policy are to be made,it is for Congress to undertake that task." 493 U. S.,at 376.These considerations apply with equal, if not greater, forcein the present context.Finally, our holding furthers another important policyunderlying ERISA: uniform national treatment of pensionbenefits. See Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S.1, 9 (1987). Construing "applicable nonbankruptcy law" toinclude federal law ensures that the security of a debtor'spension benefits will be governed by ERISA, not left to thevagaries of state spendthrift trust law.IVIn light of our conclusion that a debtor's interest in anERISA-qualified pension plan may be excluded from theproperty of the bankruptcy estate pursuant to $ 541(c)(2),we need not reach respondent's alternative argument that504us2$92F 04-06-96 16:07:42 PAGES OPINPGT766 PATTERSON v.
