S. C.$$ 1 and 2 (1988 ed., Supp. II). After truncated discovery,the District Court granted summary judgment for Kodak.The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Theappellate court found that respondents had presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue concerning Kodak'smarket power in the service and parts markets. It rejectedKodak's contention that lack of market power in service andparts must be assumed when such power is absent in theequipment market. Because of the importance of the issue,we granted certiorari. 501 U.

It produces some of the parts itself; the rest aremade to order for Kodak by independent original-equipmentmanufacturers (OEM's). See id., at 429, 465, 490, 496.Kodak does not sell a complete system of original equipment,lifetime service, and lifetime parts for a single price.

ISO's keep an inventory of parts, purchased fromKodak or other sources, primarily the OEM's.2 See App. 99,415-416, 490.In 1985 and 1986, Kodak implemented a policy of sellingreplacement parts for micrographic and copying machinesonly to buyers of Kodak equipment who use Kodak serviceor repair their own machines. See Brief for Petitioner 6;App. 91-92, 98-100, 140-141, 171-172, 190, 442-447, 455-456, 483-484.As part of the same policy, Kodak sought to limit ISO ac-cess to other sources of Kodak parts. Kodak and the OEM'sagreed that the OEM's would not sell parts that fit Kodakequipment to anyone other than Kodak. See id., at 417,428-429, 447, 468, 474, 496. Kodak also pressured Kodakequipment owners and independent parts distributors not tosell Kodak parts to ISO's. See id., at 419-420, 428-429, 483-484, 517-518, 589-590. In addition, Kodak took steps to restrict the availability of used machines.

S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the CourtBIn 1987, the ISO's filed the present action in the DistrictCourt, alleging, inter alia, that Kodak had unlawfully tiedthe sale of service for Kodak machines to the sale of parts,in violation of $ 1 of the Sherman Act, and had unlawfullymonopolized and attempted to monopolize the sale of servicefor Kodak machines, in violation of $ 2 of that Act.3Kodak filed a motion for summary judgment before respondents had initiated discovery. The District Court permitted respondents to file one set of interrogatories and oneset of requests for production of documents and to take sixdepositions. Without a hearing, the District Court grantedsummary judgment in favor of Kodak. App. to Pet. forCert. 29B.As to the $ 1 claim, the court found that respondents hadprovided no evidence of a tying arrangement between Kodakequipment and service or parts. See id., at 32B-33B. Thecourt, however, did not address respondents' $ 1 claim thatis at issue here. Respondents allege a tying arrangementnot between Kodak equipment and service, but betweenKodak parts and service. As to the $ 2 claim, the DistrictCourt concluded that although Kodak had a "natural monopoly over the market for parts it sells under its name," a unilateral refusal to sell those parts to ISO's did not violate $ 2.3 Section 1 of the Sherman Act states in relevant part: "Every contract,combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraintof trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations,is declared to be illegal." 15 U.

IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the CourtThe Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a dividedvote, reversed. 903 F. 2d 612 (1990). With respect to the$ 1 claim, the court first found that whether service and partswere distinct markets and whether a tying arrangement existed between them were disputed issues of fact. Id., at615-616. Having found that a tying arrangement mightexist, the Court of Appeals considered a question not decidedby the District Court: Was there "an issue of material factas to whether Kodak has sufficient economic power in thetying product market [parts] to restrain competition appreciably in the tied product market [service]." Id., at 616. Thecourt agreed with Kodak that competition in the equipmentmarket might prevent Kodak from possessing power in theparts market, but refused to uphold the District Court'sgrant of summary judgment "on this theoretical basis" because "market imperfections can keep economic theoriesabout how consumers will act from mirroring reality." Id.,at 617. Noting that the District Court had not consideredthe market power issue, and that the record was not fullydeveloped through discovery, the court declined to requirerespondents to conduct market analysis or to pinpoint specific imperfections in order to withstand summary judgment.4 "It is enough that [respondents] have presented evidence of actual events from which a reasonable trier of factcould conclude that . . . competition in the [equipment] market does not, in reality, curb Kodak's power in the parts market." Ibid.4 Specifically, the Court of Appeals explained that the District Court haddenied the request for further discovery made by respondents in theiropposition to Kodak's summary judgment motion: "For example, [respondents] requested to depose two ISO customers who allegedly would not signaccurate statements concerning Kodak's market power in the parts market. Not finding it necessary to reach the market power issue in its decision, the district court, of course, had no reason to grant this request."903 F. 2d, at 617, n. 4.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT461Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe court then considered the three business justificationsKodak proffered for its restrictive parts policy: (1) to guardagainst inadequate service, (2) to lower inventory costs, and(3) to prevent ISO's from free-riding on Kodak's investmentin the copier and micrographic industry. The court con-cluded that the trier of fact might find the product qualityand inventory reasons to be pretextual and that there wasa less restrictive alternative for achieving Kodak's qualityrelated goals. Id., at 618-619. The court also found Ko-dak's third justification, preventing ISO's from profiting onKodak's investments in the equipment markets, legally insuf-ficient.Id., at 619.As to the $ 2 claim, the Court of Appeals concluded thatsufficient evidence existed to support a finding that Kodak'simplementation of its parts policy was "anticompetitive" and"exclusionary" and "involved a specific intent to monopolize."Id., at 620. It held that the ISO's had come forward withsufficient evidence, for summary judgment purposes, to disprove Kodak's business justifications. Ibid.The dissent in the Court of Appeals, with respect to the$ 1 claim, accepted Kodak's argument that evidence of com-petition in the equipment market "necessarily precludespower in the derivative market." Id., at 622 (emphasis inoriginal). With respect to the $ 2 monopolization claim, thedissent concluded that, entirely apart from market powerconsiderations, Kodak was entitled to summary judgment onthe basis of its first business justification because it had "submitted extensive and undisputed evidence of a marketingstrategy based on high-quality service."Id., at 623.IIA tying arrangement is "an agreement by a party to sellone product but only on the condition that the buyer alsopurchases a different (or tied) product, or at least agrees thathe will not purchase that product from any other supplier."Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1, 5-6504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT462 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Court(1958). Such an arrangement violates $ 1 of the ShermanAct if the seller has "appreciable economic power" in thetying product market and if the arrangement affects asubstantial volume of commerce in the tied market. FortnerEnterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 394 U. S. 495,503 (1969).Kodak did not dispute that its arrangement affects a sub-stantial volume of interstate commerce. It, however, didchallenge whether its activities constituted a "tying arrange-ment" and whether Kodak exercised "appreciable economicpower" in the tying market. We consider these issues inturn.AFor respondents to defeat a motion for summary judgmenton their claim of a tying arrangement, a reasonable trier offact must be able to find, first, that service and parts are twodistinct products, and, second, that Kodak has tied the saleof the two products.For service and parts to be considered two distinct products, there must be sufficient consumer demand so that it isefficient for a firm to provide service separately from parts.Jefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 2,21-22 (1984). Evidence in the record indicates that serviceand parts have been sold separately in the past and still aresold separately to self-service equipment owners.5 Indeed,the development of the entire high-technology service indus-try is evidence of the efficiency of a separate market forservice.65 The Court of Appeals found: "Kodak's policy of allowing customers topurchase parts on condition that they agree to service their own machinessuggests that the demand for parts can be separated from the demand forservice." Id., at 616.6 Amicus briefs filed by various service organizations attest to the magnitude of the service business. See, e. g., Brief for Computer Service Network International as Amicus Curiae; Brief for National ElectronicsSales and Service Dealers Association as Amicus Curiae; Brief for Cali504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT463Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the CourtKodak insists that because there is no demand for partsseparate from service, there cannot be separate markets forservice and parts. Brief for Petitioner 15, n. 3. By thatlogic, we would be forced to conclude that there can neverbe separate markets, for example, for cameras and film, computers and software, or automobiles and tires. That is anassumption we are unwilling to make. "We have oftenfound arrangements involving functionally linked productsat least one of which is useless without the other to be prohibited tying devices." Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 19,n. 30.Kodak's assertion also appears to be incorrect as a factualmatter. At least some consumers would purchase servicewithout parts, because some service does not require parts,and some consumers, those who self-service for example,would purchase parts without service.7 Enough doubt iscast on Kodak's claim of a unified market that it should beresolved by the trier of fact.Finally, respondents have presented sufficient evidence ofa tie between service and parts. The record indicates thatKodak would sell parts to third parties only if they agreednot to buy service from ISO's.8fornia State Electronics Association et al. as Amici Curiae; Brief for National Office Machine Dealers et al. as Amici Curiae.7 The dissent suggests that parts and service are not separate productsfor tying purposes because all service may involve installation of parts.Post, at 494-495, n. 2. Because the record does not support this factualassertion, under the approach of both the Court and the concurrence inJefferson Parish Hospital Dist. No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U. S. 2 (1984), Kodakis not entitled to summary judgment on whether parts and service aredistinct markets.8 In a footnote, Kodak contends that this practice is only a unilateralrefusal to deal, which does not violate the antitrust laws. See Brief forPetitioner 15, n. 4. Assuming, arguendo, that Kodak's refusal to sell partsto any company providing service can be characterized as a unilateralrefusal to deal, its alleged sale of parts to third parties on condition thatthey buy service from Kodak is not. See 903 F. 2d, at 619.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT464 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the CourtBHaving found sufficient evidence of a tying arrangement,we consider the other necessary feature of an illegal tyingarrangement: appreciable economic power in the tying market. Market power is the power "to force a purchaser to dosomething that he would not do in a competitive market."Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 14.9 It has been defined as"the ability of a single seller to raise price and restrict output." Fortner, 394 U. S., at 503; United States v. E. I. duPont de Nemours & Co., 351 U. S. 377, 391 (1956). The existence of such power ordinarily is inferred from the seller'spossession of a predominant share of the market. JeffersonParish, 466 U. S., at 17; United States v. Grinnell Corp., 384U. S. 563, 571 (1966); Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v.United States, 345 U. S. 594, 611-613 (1953).1Respondents contend that Kodak has more than sufficientpower in the parts market to force unwanted purchases ofthe tied market, service. Respondents provide evidencethat certain parts are available exclusively through Kodak.Respondents also assert that Kodak has control over theavailability of parts it does not manufacture. According torespondents' evidence, Kodak has prohibited independentmanufacturers from selling Kodak parts to ISO's, pressuredKodak equipment owners and independent parts distributorsto deny ISO's the purchase of Kodak parts, and taken stepsto restrict the availability of used machines.9 "[T]he essential characteristic of an invalid tying arrangement lies inthe seller's exploitation of its control over the tying product to force thebuyer into the purchase of a tied product that the buyer either did notwant at all, or might have preferred to purchase elsewhere on differentterms. When such `forcing' is present, competition on the merits in themarket for the tied item is restrained and the Sherman Act is violated."Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 12.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT465Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the CourtRespondents also allege that Kodak's control over theparts market has excluded service competition, boostedservice prices, and forced unwilling consumption of Kodakservice. Respondents offer evidence that consumers haveswitched to Kodak service even though they preferred ISOservice, that Kodak service was of higher price and lowerquality than the preferred ISO service, and that ISO's weredriven out of business by Kodak's policies. Under our priorprecedents, this evidence would be sufficient to entitle re-spondents to a trial on their claim of market power.2Kodak counters that even if it concedes monopoly shareof the relevant parts market, it cannot actually exercise thenecessary market power for a Sherman Act violation. Thisis so, according to Kodak, because competition exists in theequipment market.10 Kodak argues that it could not have10 In their brief and at oral argument, respondents argued that Kodak'smarket share figures for high-volume copy machines, CAR systems, andmicrographic-capture equipment demonstrate Kodak's market power inthe equipment market. Brief for Respondents 16-18, 32-33; Tr. of OralArg. 28-31.In the Court of Appeals, however, respondents did not contest Kodak'sassertion that its market shares indicated a competitive equipment market. The Court of Appeals believed that respondents "do not dispute Kodak's assertion that it lacks market power in the [equipment] markets."903 F. 2d, at 616, n. 3. Nor did respondents question Kodak's assertedlack of market power in their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari, although they acknowledged that Kodak's entire case rested on itsunderstanding that respondents were not disputing the existence of competition in the equipment market. Brief in Opposition 8.Recognizing that on summary judgment we may examine the record denovo without relying on the lower courts' understanding, United States v.Diebold, Inc., 369 U. S. 654, 655 (1962), respondents now ask us to declineto reach the merits of the questions presented in the petition, and insteadto affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment based on the factual dispute overmarket power in the equipment market. We decline respondents' invitation. We stated in Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, 471 U. S. 808, 816 (1985):"Our decision to grant certiorari represents a commitment of scarce judi504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT466 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtthe ability to raise prices of service and parts above the levelthat would be charged in a competitive market because anyincrease in profits from a higher price in the aftermarkets atleast would be offset by a corresponding loss in profits fromlower equipment sales as consumers began purchasing equip-ment with more attractive service costs.Kodak does not present any actual data on the equipment,service, or parts markets. Instead, it urges the adoption ofa substantive legal rule that "equipment competition pre-cludes any finding of monopoly power in derivative aftermarkets." Brief for Petitioner 33. Kodak argues that such arule would satisfy its burden as the moving party of showing"that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact" onthe market power issue.11 See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(c).Legal presumptions that rest on formalistic distinctionsrather than actual market realities are generally disfavoredcial resources with a view to deciding the merits of one or more of thequestions presented in the petition." Because respondents failed to bringtheir objections to the premise underlying the questions presented to ourattention in their opposition to the petition for certiorari, we decide thosequestions based on the same premise as the Court of Appeals, namely,that competition exists in the equipment market.11 Kodak argues that such a rule would be per se, with no opportunityfor respondents to rebut the conclusion that market power is lacking inthe parts market. See Brief for Petitioner 30-31 ("There is nothing thatrespondents could prove that would overcome Kodak's conceded lack ofmarket power"); id., at 30 (discovery is "pointless" once the "dispositivefact" of lack of market power in the equipment market is conceded); id.,at 22 (Kodak's lack of market power in the equipment market "dooms anyattempt to extract monopoly profits" even in an allegedly imperfect market); id., at 25 (it is "impossible" for Kodak to make more total profit byovercharging its existing customers for service).As an apparent second-best alternative, Kodak suggests elsewhere inits brief that the rule would permit a defendant to meet its summaryjudgment burden under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c); the burdenwould then shift to the plaintiffs to "prove . . . that there is specific reasonto believe that normal economic reasoning does not apply."

Maple Flooring Manu-facturers Assn. v. United States, 268 U. S. 563, 579 (1925);Du Pont, 351 U. S., at 395, n. 22; Continental T. V., Inc. v.GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.

S., at 400; see also id., at 394-395, and 400-401, thisCourt has examined closely the economic reality of themarket at issue.13Kodak contends that there is no need to examine the factswhen the issue is market power in the aftermarkets. Alegal presumption against a finding of market power is warranted in this situation, according to Kodak, because the existence of market power in the service and parts marketsabsent power in the equipment market "simply makesno economic sense," and the absence of a legal presump-tion would deter procompetitive behavior.Matsushita, 475U. S., at 587; id., at 594-595.Kodak analogizes this case toMatsushita, where a groupof American corporations that manufactured or sold con-sumer electronic products alleged that their 21 Japanesecounterparts were engaging in a 20-year conspiracy to price12 See generally Business Electronics Corp. v.

After severalyears of detailed discovery, the defendants moved for sum-mary judgment. Id., at 577-582. Because the defendantshad every incentive not to engage in the alleged conductwhich required them to sustain losses for decades with noforeseeable profits, the Court found an "absence of any ra-tional motive to conspire."Id., at 597. In that context, theCourt determined that the plaintiffs' theory of predatorypricing made no practical sense, was "speculative," and wasnot "reasonable." Id., at 588, 590, 593, 595, 597. Accordingly, the Court held that a reasonable jury could not returna verdict for the plaintiffs and that summary judgmentwould be appropriate against them unless they came forwardwith more persuasive evidence to support their theory.Id.,at 587-588, 595-598.The Court's requirement in Matsushita that the plaintiffs'claims make economic sense did not introduce a special burden on plaintiffs facing summary judgment in antitrust cases.The Court did not hold that if the moving party enunciatesany economic theory supporting its behavior, regardless ofits accuracy in reflecting the actual market, it is entitled tosummary judgment. Matsushita demands only that thenonmoving party's inferences be reasonable in order to reachthe jury, a requirement that was not invented, but merelyarticulated, in that decision.14 If the plaintiff 's theory is eco14 See, e. g., Anderson v.

It must show that despiteevidence of increased prices and excluded competition, aninference of market power is unreasonable. To determinewhether Kodak has met that burden, we must unravel thefactual assumptions underlying its proposed rule that lack ofpower in the equipment market necessarily precludes powerin the aftermarkets.The extent to which one market prevents exploitation ofanother market depends on the extent to which consumerswill change their consumption of one product in responseto a price change in another, i. e., the "cross-elasticity ofdemand." See Du Pont, 351 U. S., at 400; P. Areeda &L. Kaplow, Antitrust Analysis || 342(c) (4th ed. 1988).15 KoCo. of New York, Inc. v.

Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 817 F. 2d 639, 646 (CA10 1987) (summary judgmentnot appropriate under Matsushita when defendants "could reasonablyhave been economically motivated").15 What constrains the defendant's ability to raise prices in the servicemarket is "the elasticity of demand faced by the defendant--the degreeto which its sales fall . . . as its price rises." Areeda & Kaplow || 342(c),p. 576.Courts usually have considered the relationship between price in onemarket and demand in another in defining the relevant market. Becausemarket power is often inferred from market share, market definition generally determines the result of the case. Pitofsky, New Definitions of Relevant Market and the Assault on Antitrust, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1805, 1806-1813 (1990). Kodak chose to focus on market power directly rather thanarguing that the relationship between equipment and service and partsis such that the three should be included in the same market definition.Whether considered in the conceptual category of "market definition" or"market power," the ultimate inquiry is the same--whether competition504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT470 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtdak's proposed rule rests on a factual assumption about thecross-elasticity of demand in the equipment and aftermarkets: "If Kodak raised its parts or service prices above com-petitive levels, potential customers would simply stop buyingKodak equipment. Perhaps Kodak would be able to in-crease short term profits through such a strategy, but at adevastating cost to its long term interests." 16 Brief forPetitioner 12. Kodak argues that the Court should accept,as a matter of law, this "basic economic realit[y]," id., at 24,that competition in the equipment market necessarily prevents market power in the aftermarkets.17Even if Kodak could not raise the price of service andparts one cent without losing equipment sales, that factwould not disprove market power in the aftermarkets. Thesales of even a monopolist are reduced when it sells goods ata monopoly price, but the higher price more than compensates for the loss in sales. Areeda & Kaplow |||| 112 and340(a). Kodak's claim that charging more for service andparts would be "a short-run game," Brief for Petitioner 26,is based on the false dichotomy that there are only two pricesin the equipment market will significantly restrain power in the serviceand parts markets.16 The United States as amicus curiae in support of Kodak echoes thisargument: "The ISOs' claims are implausible because Kodak lacks marketpower in the markets for its copier and micrographic equipment. Buyersof such equipment regard an increase in the price of parts or service asan increase in the price of the equipment, and sellers recognize that therevenues from sales of parts and service are attributable to sales of theequipment. In such circumstances, it is not apparent how an equipmentmanufacturer such as Kodak could exercise power in the aftermarkets forparts and service." Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 8.17 It is clearly true, as the United States claims, that Kodak "cannot setservice or parts prices without regard to the impact on the market forequipment." Id., at 20. The fact that the cross-elasticity of demand isnot zero proves nothing; the disputed issue is how much of an impactan increase in parts and service prices has on equipment sales and onKodak's profits.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT471Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthat can be charged--a competitive price or a ruinous one.But there could easily be a middle, optimum price at whichthe increased revenues from the higher priced sales of serv-ice and parts would more than compensate for the lowerrevenues from lost equipment sales. The fact that theequipment market imposes a restraint on prices in the aftermarkets by no means disproves the existence of power inthose markets. See Areeda & Kaplow || 340(b) ("[T]he existence of significant substitution in the event of furtherprice increases or even at thecurrent price does not tell uswhether the defendant already exercises significant marketpower") (emphasis in original). Thus, contrary to Kodak'sassertion, there is no immutable physical law--no "basiceconomic reality"--insisting that competition in the equip-ment market cannot coexist with market power in theaftermarkets.We next consider the more narrowly drawn question: DoesKodak's theory describe actual market behavior so accu-rately that respondents' assertion of Kodak market power inthe aftermarkets, if not impossible, is at least unreason-able?18 Cf. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. ZenithRadio Corp., 475 U. S. 574 (1986).18 Although Kodak repeatedly relies on Continental T. V. as support forits factual assertion that the equipment market will prevent exploitationof the service and parts markets, the case is inapposite. In ContinentalT. V., the Court found that a manufacturer's policy restricting the numberof retailers that were permitted to sell its product could have a procompetitive effect. See 433 U. S., at 55. The Court also noted that any negativeeffect of exploitation of the intrabrand market (the competition betweenretailers of the same product) would be checked by competition in theinterbrand market (competition over the same generic product) becauseconsumers would substitute a different brand of the same product. Unlike Continental T. V., this case does not concern vertical relationshipsbetween parties on different levels of the same distribution chain. In therelevant market, service, Kodak and the ISO's are direct competitors; theirrelationship is horizontal. The interbrand competition at issue here iscompetition over the provision of service. Despite petitioner's best effort,504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT472 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the CourtTo review Kodak's theory, it contends that higher serviceprices will lead to a disastrous drop in equipment sales. Presumably, the theory's corollary is to the effect that low serv-ice prices lead to a dramatic increase in equipment sales.According to the theory, one would have expected Kodak totake advantage of lower priced ISO service as an opportunity to expand equipment sales. Instead, Kodak adopted arestrictive sales policy consciously designed to eliminate thelower priced ISO service, an act that would be expected todevastate either Kodak's equipment sales or Kodak's faith inits theory. Yet, according to the record, it has done neither.Service prices have risen for Kodak customers, but there isno evidence or assertion that Kodak equipment sales havedropped.Kodak and the United States attempt to reconcile Kodak'stheory with the contrary actual results by describing a "marketing strategy of spreading over time the total cost to thebuyer of Kodak equipment." Brief for United States asAmicus Curiae 18; see also Brief for Petitioner 18. In otherwords, Kodak could charge subcompetitive prices for equipment and make up the difference with supracompetitiveprices for service, resulting in an overall competitive price.This pricing strategy would provide an explanation for thetheory's descriptive failings--if Kodak in fact had adopted it.But Kodak never has asserted that it prices its equipment orparts subcompetitively and recoups its profits through service. Instead, it claims that it prices its equipment compara-bly to its competitors and intends that both its equipmentsales and service divisions be profitable. See App. 159-161,170, 178, 188. Moreover, this hypothetical pricing strategyis inconsistent with Kodak's policy toward its self-servicecustomers. If Kodak were underpricing its equipment, hoping to lock in customers and recover its losses in the servicerepeating the mantra "interbrand competition" does not transform thiscase into one over an agreement the manufacturer has with its dealersthat would fall under the rubric of Continental T. V.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT473Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the Courtmarket, it could not afford to sell customers parts withoutservice. In sum, Kodak's theory does not explain the actualmarket behavior revealed in the record.Respondents offer a forceful reason why Kodak's theory,although perhaps intuitively appealing, may not accuratelyexplain the behavior of the primary and derivative marketsfor complex durable goods: the existence of significant infor-mation and switching costs. These costs could create a lessresponsive connection between service and parts prices andequipment sales.For the service-market price to affect equipment demand,consumers must inform themselves of the total cost of the"package"--equipment, service, and parts--at the time ofpurchase; that is, consumers must engage in accurate lifecycle pricing.19 Life-cycle pricing of complex, durable equip-ment is difficult and costly. In order to arrive at an accurateprice, a consumer must acquire a substantial amount of rawdata and undertake sophisticated analysis. The necessaryinformation would include data on price, quality, and avail-ability of products needed to operate, upgrade, or enhancethe initial equipment, as well as service and repair costs, in-cluding estimates of breakdown frequency, nature of repairs,price of service and parts, length of "downtime," and lossesincurred from downtime.20Much of this information is difficult--some of it impossi-ble--to acquire at the time of purchase. During the life ofa product, companies may change the service and partsprices, and develop products with more advanced features, a19 See Craswell, Tying Requirements in Competitive Markets: The Consumer Protection Issues, 62 B. U. L. Rev. 661, 676 (1982); Beales, Craswell, & Salop, The Efficient Regulation of Consumer Information, 24 J.Law & Econ. 491, 509-511 (1981); Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 15.20 In addition, of course, in order to price accurately the equipment, aconsumer would need initial purchase information such as prices, features,quality, and available warranties for different machinery with differentcapabilities, and residual value information such as the longevity of product use and its potential resale or trade-in value.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT474 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtdecreased need for repair, or new warranties. In addition,the information is likely to be customer specific; lifecyclecosts will vary from customer to customer with the type ofequipment, degrees of equipment use, and costs of downtime.Kodak acknowledges the cost of information, but suggests,again without evidentiary support, that customer information needs will be satisfied by competitors in the equipmentmarkets. Brief for Petitioner 26, n. 11. It is a question offact, however, whether competitors would provide the neces-sary information. A competitor in the equipment marketmay not have reliable information about the lifecycle costsof complex equipment it does not service or the needs ofcustomers it does not serve. Even if competitors had therelevant information, it is not clear that their interests wouldbe advanced by providing such information to consumers.See 2 P. Areeda & D. Turner, Antitrust Law || 404b1 (1978).21Moreover, even if consumers were capable of acquiring andprocessing the complex body of information, they may choosenot to do so. Acquiring the information is expensive. Ifthe costs of service are small relative to the equipment price,or if consumers are more concerned about equipment capabil-ities than service costs, they may not find it cost efficient to21 To inform consumers about Kodak, the competitor must be willing toforgo the opportunity to reap supracompetitive prices in its own serviceand parts markets. The competitor may anticipate that charging lowerservice and parts prices and informing consumers about Kodak in thehopes of gaining future equipment sales will cause Kodak to lower theprice on its service and parts, canceling any gains in equipment sales tothe competitor and leaving both worse off. Thus, in an equipment marketwith relatively few sellers, competitors may find it more profitable toadopt Kodak's service and parts policy than to inform the consumers. See2 Areeda & Turner, Antitrust Law || 404b1; App. 177 (Kodak, Xerox, andIBM together have nearly 100% of relevant market).Even in a market with many sellers, any one competitor may not havesufficient incentive to inform consumers because the increased patronageattributable to the corrected consumer beliefs will be shared among othercompetitors. Beales, Craswell, & Salop, 24 J. Law & Econ., at 503-504,506.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT475Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcompile the information. Similarly, some consumers, suchas the Federal Government, have purchasing systems thatmake it difficult to consider the complete cost of the "pack-age" at the time of purchase. State and local governmentsoften treat service as an operating expense and equipment asa capital expense, delegating each to a different department.These governmental entities do not lifecycle price, but ratherchoose the lowest price in each market. See Brief for Na-tional Association of State Purchasing Officials et al. asAmici Curiae; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae;App. 429-430.As Kodak notes, there likely will be some large-volume,sophisticated purchasers who will undertake the comparative studies and insist, in return for their patronage, thatKodak charge them competitive lifecycle prices. Kodak contends that these knowledgeable customers will hold downthe package price for all other customers. Brief for Petitioner 23, n. 9. There are reasons, however, to doubt thatsophisticated purchasers will ensure that competitive pricesare charged to unsophisticated purchasers, too. As an initialmatter, if the number of sophisticated customers is relativelysmall, the amount of profits to be gained by supracompetitivepricing in the service market could make it profitable to letthe knowledgeable consumers take their business elsewhere.More importantly, if a company is able to price discriminatebetween sophisticated and unsophisticated consumers, thesophisticated will be unable to prevent the exploitation ofthe uninformed. A seller could easily price discriminateby varying the equipment/parts/service package, developingdifferent warranties, or offering price discounts on differentcomponents.Given the potentially high cost of information and thepossibility that a seller may be able to price discriminatebetween knowledgeable and unsophisticated consumers, itmakes little sense to assume, in the absence of any evidentiary support, that equipment-purchasing decisions are based504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT476 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courton an accurate assessment of the total cost of equipment,service, and parts over the lifetime of the machine.22Indeed, respondents have presented evidence that Kodakpractices price discrimination by selling parts to customerswho service their own equipment, but refusing to sell partsto customers who hire third-party service companies. Companies that have their own service staff are likely to be highvolume users, the same companies for whom it is most likelyto be economically worthwhile to acquire the complex information needed for comparative lifecycle pricing.A second factor undermining Kodak's claim that supracompetitive prices in the service market lead to ruinous lossesin equipment sales is the cost to current owners of switchingto a different product. See Areeda & Turner || 519a.23 Ifthe cost of switching is high, consumers who already havepurchased the equipment, and are thus "locked in," will tolerate some level of service-price increases before changingequipment brands. Under this scenario, a seller profitablycould maintain supracompetitive prices in the aftermarketif the switching costs were high relative to the increase inservice prices, and the number of locked-in customers werehigh relative to the number of new purchasers.Moreover, if the seller can price discriminate between itslocked-in customers and potential new customers, this strategy is even more likely to prove profitable. The seller couldsimply charge new customers below-marginal cost on theequipment and recoup the charges in service, or offer pack22 See Salop & Stiglitz, Bargains and Ripoffs: A Model of Monopolistically Competitive Price Dispersion, 44 Rev.

S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the Courtages with lifetime warranties or long-term service agree-ments that are not available to locked-in customers.Respondents have offered evidence that the heavy initialoutlay for Kodak equipment, combined with the requiredsupport material that works only with Kodak equipment,makes switching costs very high for existing Kodak cus-tomers. And Kodak's own evidence confirms that it variesthe package price of equipment/parts/service for differentcustomers.In sum, there is a question of fact whether informationcosts and switching costs foil the simple assumption that theequipment and service markets act as pure complements toone another.24We conclude, then, that Kodak has failed to demonstratethat respondents' inference of market power in the serviceand parts markets is unreasonable, and that, consequently,Kodak is entitled to summary judgment. It is clearly reasonable to infer that Kodak has market power to raise pricesand drive out competition in the aftermarkets, since respondents offer direct evidence that Kodak did so.25 It isalso plausible, as discussed above, to infer that Kodak choseto gain immediate profits by exerting that market powerwhere locked-in customers, high information costs, and discriminatory pricing limited and perhaps eliminated any long24 The dissent disagrees based on its hypothetical case of a tie betweenequipment and service. "The only thing lacking" to bring this case withinthe hypothetical case, states the dissent, "is concrete evidence that therestrictive parts policy was . . . generally known." Post, at 492. Butthe dissent's "only thing lacking" is the crucial thing lacking--evidence.Whether a tie between parts and service should be treated identically toa tie between equipment and service, as the dissent and Kodak argue,depends on whether the equipment market prevents the exertion of market power in the parts market. Far from being "anomalous," post, at492-493, requiring Kodak to provide evidence on this factual question iscompletely consistent with our prior precedent. See, e. g., n. 13, supra.25 Cf. Instructional Systems, 817 F. 2d, at 646 (finding the conspiracyreasonable under Matsushita because its goals were in fact achieved).504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT478 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtterm loss. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorableto respondents, their allegations of market power "mak[e] . . .economic sense." Cf. Matsushita, 475 U. S., at 587.Nor are we persuaded by Kodak's contention that it is entitled to a legal presumption on the lack of market powerbecause, as in Matsushita, there is a significant risk of deterring procompetitive conduct. Plaintiffs in Matsushitaattempted to prove the antitrust conspiracy "through evidence of rebates and other price-cutting activities." Id., at594. Because cutting prices to increase business is "thevery essence of competition," the Court was concerned thatmistaken inferences would be "especially costly" and would"chill the very conduct the antitrust laws are designed toprotect." Ibid. See also Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 763 (1984) (permitting inference ofconcerted action would "deter or penalize perfectly legitimate conduct"). But the facts in this case are just the opposite. The alleged conduct--higher service prices and market foreclosure--is facially anticompetitive and exactly theharm that antitrust laws aim to prevent. In this situation,Matsushita does not create any presumption in favor of summary judgment for the defendant.Kodak contends that, despite the appearance of anticompetitiveness, its behavior actually favors competition because its ability to pursue innovative marketing plans willallow it to compete more effectively in the equipment market. Brief for Petitioner 40-41. A pricing strategy basedon lower equipment prices and higher aftermarket pricescould enhance equipment sales by making it easier for thebuyer to finance the initial purchase.26 It is undisputed thatcompetition is enhanced when a firm is able to offer variousmarketing options, including bundling of support and maintenance service with the sale of equipment. Nor do such ac26 It bears repeating that in this case Kodak has never claimed that it isin fact pursuing such a pricing strategy.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT479Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the Courttions run afoul of the antitrust laws.27 But the procompetitive effect of the specific conduct challenged here,eliminating all consumer parts and service options, is farless clear.28We need not decide whether Kodak's behavior has any procompetitive effects and, if so, whether they outweigh theanticompetitive effects. We note only that Kodak's serviceand parts policy is simply not one that appears always oralmost always to enhance competition, and therefore to warrant a legal presumption without any evidence of its actualeconomic impact. In this case, when we weigh the risk ofdeterring procompetitive behavior by proceeding to trialagainst the risk that illegal behavior will go unpunished, thebalance tips against summary judgment. Cf. Matsushita,475 U. S., at 594-595.For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Kodak has not metthe requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c).We therefore affirm the denial of summary judgment on respondents' $ 1 claim.2927 See Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 12 ("Buyers often find package salesattractive; a seller's decision to offer such packages can merely be an attempt to compete effectively--conduct that is entirely consistent with theSherman Act"). See also Yates & DiResta, Software Support and Hardware Maintenance Practices: Tying Considerations, The Computer Lawyer, Vol. 8, No. 6, p. 17 (1991) (describing various service and parts policiesthat enhance quality and sales but do not violate the antitrust laws).28 Two of the largest consumers of service and parts contend that theyare worse off when the equipment manufacturer also controls service andparts. See Brief for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. et al.as Amici Curiae; Brief for State of Ohio et al. as Amici Curiae.29 The dissent urges a radical departure in this Court's antitrust law. Itargues that because Kodak has only an "inherent" monopoly in parts forits equipment, post, at 489-490, the antitrust laws do not apply to its efforts to expand that power into other markets. The dissent's proposal togrant per se immunity to manufacturers competing in the service marketwould exempt a vast and growing sector of the economy from antitrustlaws. Leaving aside the question whether the Court has the authority to504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT480 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the CourtIIIRespondents also claim that they have presented genuineissues for trial as to whether Kodak has monopolized, or atmake such a policy decision, there is no support for it in our jurisprudenceor the evidence in this case.Even assuming, despite the absence of any proof from the dissent, thatall manufacturers possess some inherent market power in the parts market, it is not clear why that should immunize them from the antitrust lawsin another market. The Court has held many times that power gainedthrough some natural and legal advantage such as a patent, copyright, orbusiness acumen can give rise to liability if "a seller exploits his dominantposition in one market to expand his empire into the next." TimesPicayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U. S. 594, 611 (1953); see,e. g., Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1 (1958); UnitedStates v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 U. S. 131 (1948); Leitch Mfg. Co.v. Barber Co., 302 U. S. 458, 463 (1938). Moreover, on the occasions whenthe Court has considered tying in derivative aftermarkets by manufacturers, it has not adopted any exception to the usual antitrust analysis, treating derivative aftermarkets as it has every other separate market. SeeInternational Salt Co. v. United States, 332 U. S. 392 (1947); International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U. S. 131 (1936);United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States, 258 U. S. 451 (1922). Ourpast decisions are reason enough to reject the dissent's proposal. SeePatterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989) ("Considerations of stare decisis have special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation,the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alterwhat we have done").Nor does the record in this case support the dissent's proposed exemption for aftermarkets. The dissent urges its exemption because the tiehere "does not permit the manufacturer to project power over a class ofconsumers distinct from that which it is already able to exploit (and fully)without the inconvenience of the tie." Post, at 498. Beyond the dissent'sobvious difficulty in explaining why Kodak would adopt this expensivetying policy if it could achieve the same profits more conveniently throughsome other means, respondents offer an alternative theory, supported bythe record, that suggests Kodak is able to exploit some customers who inthe absence of the tie would be protected from increases in parts pricesby knowledgeable customers. See supra, at 475-476.At bottom, whatever the ultimate merits of the dissent's theory, at thispoint it is mere conjecture. Neither Kodak nor the dissent have provided504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT481Cite as: 504 U.

Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S., at 570-571.AThe existence of the first element, possession of monopolypower, is easily resolved.

DuPont, 351 U. S., at 391. Monopoly power under $ 2 requires,of course, something greater than market power under $ 1.See Fortner, 394 U. S., at 502. Respondents' evidence thatKodak controls nearly 100% of the parts market and 80% to95% of the service market, with no readily available substi-tutes, is, however, sufficient to survive summary judgmentunder the more stringent monopoly standard of $ 2. SeeNational Collegiate Athletic Assn. v. Board of Regents ofUniv. of Okla., 468 U. S. 85, 112 (1984). Cf. United Statesv. Grinnell Corp., 384 U. S., at 571 (87% of the market is amonopoly); American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S.781, 797 (1946) (over two-thirds of the market is a monopoly).Kodak also contends that, as a matter of law, a singlebrand of a product or service can never be a relevant marketunder the Sherman Act. We disagree. The relevant marany evidence refuting respondents' theory of forced unwanted purchasesat higher prices and price discrimination. While it may be, as the dissentpredicts, that the equipment market will prevent any harms to consumersin the aftermarkets, the dissent never makes plain why the Court shouldaccept that theory on faith rather than requiring the usual evidenceneeded to win a summary judgment motion.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT482 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtket for antitrust purposes is determined by the choices avail-able to Kodak equipment owners. See Jefferson Parish, 466U. S., at 19. Because service and parts for Kodak equipmentare not interchangeable with other manufacturers' serviceand parts, the relevant market from the Kodak equipmentowner's perspective is composed of only those companiesthat service Kodak machines. See Du Pont, 351 U. S., at404 ("The market is composed of products that have reasonable interchangeability").30 This Court's prior cases supportthe proposition that in some instances one brand of a productcan constitute a separate market.

S. 585,600-605 (1985).32As recounted at length above, respondents have presentedevidence that Kodak took exclusionary action to maintain itsparts monopoly and used its control over parts to strengthenits monopoly share of the Kodak service market. Liabilityturns, then, on whether "valid business reasons" can explainKodak's actions. Id., at 605; United States v. Aluminum Co.of America, 148 F. 2d, at 432. Kodak contends that it hasthree valid business justifications for its actions: "(1) to promote interbrand equipment competition by allowing Kodakto stress the quality of its service; (2) to improve asset management by reducing Kodak's inventory costs; and (3) to pre-vent ISOs from free-riding on Kodak's capital investment inequipment, parts and service." Brief for Petitioner 6. Fac-tual questions exist, however, about the validity and sufficiency of each claimed justification, making summary judg-ment inappropriate.Kodak first asserts that by preventing customers fromusing ISO's, "it [can] best maintain high quality service forits sophisticated equipment" and avoid being "blamed for anequipment malfunction, even if the problem is the result ofimproper diagnosis, maintenance or repair by an ISO." Id.,at 6-7. Respondents have offered evidence that ISO's provide quality service and are preferred by some Kodak equip-ment owners. This is sufficient to raise a genuine issue of32 It is true that as a general matter a firm can refuse to deal with itscompetitors. But such a right is not absolute; it exists only if there arelegitimate competitive reasons for the refusal. See Aspen Skiing Co., 472U. S., at 602-605.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT484 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v. IMAGE TECHNICALSERVICES, INC.Opinion of the Courtfact. See International Business Machines Corp. v. UnitedStates, 298 U. S., at 139-140 (rejecting IBM's claim that ithad to control the cards used in its machines to avoid "injuryto the reputation of the machines and the good will of " IBMin the absence of proof that other companies could not makequality cards); International Salt Co. v. United States, 332U. S. 392, 397-398 (1947) (rejecting International Salt's claimthat it had to control the supply of salt to protect its leasedmachines in the absence of proof that competitors could notsupply salt of equal quality).Moreover, there are other reasons to question Kodak'sproffered motive of commitment to quality service; its quality justification appears inconsistent with its thesis that consumers are knowledgeable enough to lifecycle price, and itsself-service policy. Kodak claims the exclusive-service contract is warranted because customers would otherwise blameKodak equipment for breakdowns resulting from inferiorISO service. Thus, Kodak simultaneously claims that itscustomers are sophisticated enough to make complex andsubtle lifecycle-pricing decisions, and yet too obtuse to distinguish which breakdowns are due to bad equipment andwhich are due to bad service. Kodak has failed to offer anyreason why informational sophistication should be present inone circumstance and absent in the other. In addition, because self-service customers are just as likely as others toblame Kodak equipment for breakdowns resulting from(their own) inferior service, Kodak's willingness to allowself-service casts doubt on its quality claim. In sum, weagree with the Court of Appeals that respondents "have presented evidence from which a reasonable trier of fact couldconclude that Kodak's first reason is pretextual." 903 F. 2d,at 618.There is also a triable issue of fact on Kodak's secondjustification--controlling inventory costs. As respondentsargue, Kodak's actions appear inconsistent with any need tocontrol inventory costs. Presumably, the inventory of parts504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT485Cite as: 504 U. S. 451 (1992)Opinion of the Courtneeded to repair Kodak machines turns only on breakdownrates, and those rates should be the same whether Kodak orISO's perform the repair. More importantly, the justifica-tion fails to explain respondents' evidence that Kodak forcedOEM's, equipment owners, and parts brokers not to sellparts to ISO's, actions that would have no effect on Kodak'sinventory costs.Nor does Kodak's final justification entitle it to summaryjudgment on respondents' $ 2 claim. Kodak claims that itspolicies prevent ISO's from "exploit[ing] the investmentKodak has made in product development, manufacturing andequipment sales in order to take away Kodak's service revenues." Brief for Petitioner 7-8. Kodak does not disputethat respondents invest substantially in the service market,with training of repair workers and investment in parts in-ventory. Instead, according to Kodak, the ISO's are freeriding because they have failed to enter the equipment andparts markets. This understanding of free-riding has nosupport in our case law.33 To the contrary, as the Court ofAppeals noted, one of the evils proscribed by the antitrustlaws is the creation of entry barriers to potential competitorsby requiring them to enter two markets simultaneously.Jefferson Parish, 466 U. S., at 14; Fortner, 394 U. S., at 509.None of Kodak's asserted business justifications, then, aresufficient to prove that Kodak is "entitled to a judgment as33 Kodak claims that both Continental T. V. and Monsanto support itsfree-rider argument. Neither is applicable. In both Continental T. V.,433 U. S., at 55, and Monsanto, 465 U. S., at 762-763, the Court acceptedfree-riding as a justification because without restrictions a manufacturerwould not be able to induce competent and aggressive retailers to makethe kind of investment of capital and labor necessary to distribute theproduct. In Continental T. V. the relevant market level was retail saleof televisions and in Monsanto retail sales of herbicides. Some retailerswere investing in those markets; others were not, relying, instead, on theinvestment of the other retailers. To be applicable to this case, the ISO'swould have to be relying on Kodak's investment in the service market;that, however, is not Kodak's argument.504US2$82F 02-20-99 18:26:25 PAGES OPINPGT486 EASTMAN KODAK CO. v.

It may be that its parts, service, and equipmentare components of one unified market, or that the equipmentmarket does discipline the aftermarkets so that all three arepriced competitively overall, or that any anticompetitive ef-fects of Kodak's behavior are outweighed by its competitiveeffects. But we cannot reach these conclusions as a matterof law on a record this sparse. Accordingly, the judgmentof the Court of Appeals denying summary judgment isaffirmed.
