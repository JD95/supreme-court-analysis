In 1987, Congress amended a provision of the federalestate tax statute by limiting the availability of a recentlyadded deduction for the proceeds of sales of stock to em-ployee stock-ownership plans (ESOP's). Congress providedthat the amendment would apply retroactively, as if incor-porated in the original deduction provision, which had beenadopted in October 1986. The question presented by thiscase is whether the retroactive application of the amendmentviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.*Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the WashingtonLegal Foundation et al. by Joseph E. Schmitz, Charles A. Shanor, DanielJ. Popeo, and Paul D. Kamenar; and for Anthony C. Morici, Jr., Executorand Trustee of the estate of McNamee, by Charles C. Marson.512us1$67F 12-24-97 08:02:06 PAGES OPINPGT28 UNITED STATES v. CARLTONOpinion of the CourtICongress effected major revisions of the Internal RevenueCode in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 2085. One ofthose revisions was the addition of a new estate tax provi-sion applicable to any estate that filed a timely return afterthe date of the Act, October 22, 1986. The new provision,codified as 26 U. S. C. $ 2057 (1982 ed., Supp. IV),1 granted adeduction for half the proceeds of "any sale of employer secu-rities by the executor of an estate" to "an employee stockownership plan." $ 2057(b).2 In order to qualify for the de-duction, the sale of securities had to be made "before thedate on which the [estate tax] return . . . [was] required tobe filed (including any extensions)." $ 2057(c)(1).Respondent Jerry W. Carlton, the executor of the will ofWillametta K. Day, deceased, sought to utilize the $ 2057 deduction. Day died on September 29, 1985. Her estate taxreturn was due December 29, 1986 (after Carlton had obtained a 6-month filing extension). On December 10, 1986,Carlton used estate funds to purchase 1.5 million shares ofMCI Communications Corporation for $11,206,000, at an av-erage price of $7.47 per share. Two days later, Carlton soldthe MCI stock to the MCI ESOP for $10,575,000, at an aver-age price of $7.05 per share. The total sale price thus was$631,000 less than the purchase price. When Carlton filedthe estate tax return on December 29, 1986, he claimed adeduction under $ 2057 of $5,287,000, for half the proceeds ofthe sale of the stock to the MCI ESOP. The deduction reduced the estate tax by $2,501,161. The parties have stipu1 Section 2057 was repealed for estates of decedents who died afterDecember 19, 1989. See Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989,$ 7304(a), 103 Stat. 2352.2 Section 2057(e) defined "employer securities" by reference to $ 409(l)of the Code, which in turn defined the term generally as "common stockissued by the employer (or by a corporation which is a member of thesame controlled group) which is readily tradable on an established securities market." 26 U.

S. 26 (1994)Opinion of the Courtlated that Carlton engaged in the MCI stock transactionsspecifically to take advantage of the $ 2057 deduction.On January 5, 1987, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)announced that, "[p]ending the enactment of clarifying legislation," it would treat the $ 2057 deduction as available onlyto estates of decedents who owned the securities in questionimmediately before death. See IRS Notice 87-13, 1987-1Cum. Bull. 432, 442. A bill to enact such an amendment to$ 2057 was introduced in each Chamber of Congress on Feb-ruary 26, 1987. See 133 Cong. Rec. 4145 and 4293 (1987).On December 22, 1987, the amendment to $ 2057 wasenacted. As amended, the statute provided that, to qualifyfor the estate tax deduction, the securities sold to an ESOPmust have been "directly owned" by the decedent "immediately before death." Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of1987, $ 10411(a), 101 Stat. 1330-432.3 The 1987 amendmentwas made effective as if it had been contained in the statuteas originally enacted in October 1986. $ 10411(b).The IRS disallowed the deduction claimed by Carltonunder $ 2057 on the ground that the MCI stock had not beenowned by his decedent "immediately before death." Carl-ton paid the asserted estate tax deficiency, plus interest, fileda claim for refund, and instituted a refund action in theUnited States District Court for the Central District of California. He conceded that the estate did not qualify for thededuction under the 1987 amendment to $ 2057. He argued,however, that retroactive application of the 1987 amendmentto the estate's 1986 transactions violated the Due ProcessClause of the Fifth Amendment. The District Court re-jected his argument and entered summary judgment in favorof the United States.A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. 972 F. 2d 1051 (1992). The majority consid3 The amendment also required that employer securities qualifying forthe deduction must, after the sale, be allocated to participants or held forfuture allocation in accordance with certain rules.512us1$67F 12-24-97 08:02:06 PAGES OPINPGT30 UNITED STATES v. CARLTONOpinion of the Courtered two factors paramount in determining whether retroac-tive application of a tax violates due process: whether thetaxpayer had actual or constructive notice that the tax stat-ute would be retroactively amended, and whether the taxpayer reasonably relied to his detriment on preamendmentlaw. The court concluded that both factors rendered retroactive application of the amendment in this case undulyharsh and oppressive and therefore unconstitutional. JudgeNorris dissented. In his view, the 1987 amendment waswithin the wide latitude of congressional authority to legislate retroactively in regulating economic activity. Wegranted certiorari, 510 U. S. 810 (1993).IIThis Court repeatedly has upheld retroactive tax legis-lation against a due process challenge. See, e. g., UnitedStates v. Hemme, 476 U. S. 558 (1986); United States v. Da-rusmont, 449 U. S. 292 (1981); Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S. 134(1938); United States v. Hudson, 299 U. S. 498 (1937); Milli-ken v. United States, 283 U. S. 15 (1931); Cooper v. UnitedStates, 280 U. S. 409 (1930). Some of its decisions havestated that the validity of a retroactive tax provision underthe Due Process Clause depends upon whether "retroactiveapplication is so harsh and oppressive as to transgress theconstitutional limitation." Welch v. Henry, 305 U. S., at 147,quoted inUnited States v. Hemme, 476 U. S., at 568-569.The "harsh and oppressive" formulation, however, "does notdiffer from the prohibition against arbitrary and irrationallegislation" that applies generally to enactments in thesphere of economic policy. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. R. A. Gray & Co., 467 U. S. 717, 733 (1984). Thedue process standard to be applied to tax statutes with retroactive effect, therefore, is the same as that generally applica-ble to retroactive economic legislation:"Provided that the retroactive application of a statute issupported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered512us1$67F 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT31Cite as: 512 U. S. 26 (1994)Opinion of the Courtby rational means, judgments about the wisdom of suchlegislation remain within the exclusive province of thelegislative and executive branches . . . ."To be sure, . . . retroactive legislation does have tomeet a burden not faced by legislation that has only fu-ture effects. . . . `The retroactive aspects of legislation,as well as the prospective aspects, must meet the testof due process, and the justifications for the latter maynot suffice for the former' . . . . But that burden is metsimply by showing that the retroactive application ofthe legislation is itself justified by a rational legislativepurpose."Id., at 729-730, quoting Usery v. TurnerElkhorn Mining Co., 428 U. S. 1, 16-17 (1976).There is little doubt that the 1987 amendment to $ 2057was adopted as a curative measure. As enacted in October1986, $ 2057 contained no requirement that the decedent haveowned the stock in question to qualify for the ESOP proceeds deduction. As a result, any estate could claim the de-duction simply by buying stock in the market and immediately reselling it to an ESOP, thereby obtaining a potentiallydramatic reduction in (or even elimination of) the estatetax obligation.It seems clear that Congress did not contemplate suchbroad applicability of the deduction when it originallyadopted $ 2057. That provision was intended to create an"incentive for stockholders to sell their companies to theiremployees who helped them build the company rather thanliquidate, sell to outsiders or have the corporation redeemtheir shares on behalf of existing shareholders." Joint Committee on Taxation, Tax Reform Proposals: Tax Treatmentof Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), 99th Cong., 2dSess., 37 (Joint Comm. Print 1985); see also 132 Cong. Rec.14507 (1986) (statement of Sen. Long) ($ 2057 "allow[s] . . . anexecutor to reduce taxes on an estate by one-half by sellingthe decedent's company to an ESOP"). When Congress initially enacted $ 2057, it estimated a revenue loss from the512us1$67F 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT32 UNITED STATES v. CARLTONOpinion of the Courtdeduction of approximately $300 million over a 5-year period.See 133 Cong. Rec. 4145 (1987) (statement of Rep. Rostenkowski); id., at 4293 (statement of Sen. Bentsen). It becameevident shortly after passage of the 1986 Act, however, thatthe expected revenue loss under $ 2057 could be as much as$7 billion--over 20 times greater than anticipated--becausethe deduction was not limited to situations in which the decedent owned the securities immediately before death. Ibid.In introducing the amendment in February 1987, SenatorBentsen observed: "Congress did not intend for estates to beable to claim the deduction by virtue of purchasing stock inthe market and simply reselling the stock to an ESOP . . .and Congress certainly did not anticipate a $7 billion revenueloss." Id., at 4294. Without the amendment, Senator Bentsen stated, "taxpayers could qualify for the deductions byengaging in essentially sham transactions." Ibid.We conclude that the 1987 amendment's retroactive application meets the requirements of due process. First, Congress' purpose in enacting the amendment was neither illegitimate nor arbitrary. Congress acted to correct what itreasonably viewed as a mistake in the original 1986 provisionthat would have created a significant and unanticipated revenue loss. There is no plausible contention that Congressacted with an improper motive, as by targeting estate representatives such as Carlton after deliberately inducing themto engage in ESOP transactions. Congress, of course, mighthave chosen to make up the unanticipated revenue lossthrough general prospective taxation, but that choice wouldhave burdened equally "innocent" taxpayers. Instead, it decided to prevent the loss by denying the deduction to thosewho had made purely tax-motivated stock transfers. Wecannot say that its decision was unreasonable.Second, Congress acted promptly and established only amodest period of retroactivity. This Court noted in UnitedStates v. Darusmont, 449 U. S., at 296, that Congress "almostwithout exception" has given general revenue statutes effec512US1 Unit: $U67 [01-06-00 06:32:04] PAGES PGT: OPIN33Cite as: 512 U. S. 26 (1994)Opinion of the Courttive dates prior to the dates of actual enactment. This "cus-tomary congressional practice" generally has been "confinedto short and limited periods required by the practicalities ofproducing national legislation."Id., at 296-297. In Welchv. Henry, 305 U. S. 134 (1938), the Court upheld a Wisconsinincome tax adopted in 1935 on dividends received in 1933.The Court stated that the " `recent transactions' " to which atax law may be retroactively applied "must be taken to in-clude the receipt of income during the year of the legislativesession preceding that of its enactment." Id., at 150. Here,the actual retroactive effect of the 1987 amendment extended for a period only slightly greater than one year. More-over, the amendment was proposed by the IRS in January1987 and by Congress in February 1987, within a few monthsof $ 2057's original enactment.Respondent Carlton argues that the 1987 amendment violates due process because he specifically and detrimentallyrelied on the preamendment version of $ 2057 in engagingin the MCI stock transactions in December 1986. AlthoughCarlton's reliance is uncontested--and the reading of theoriginal statute on which he relied appears to have been cor-rect--his reliance alone is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. Tax legislation is not a promise, and ataxpayer has no vested right in the Internal Revenue Code.Justice Stone explained inWelch v. Henry, 305 U. S., at146-147:"Taxation is neither a penalty imposed on the taxpayernor a liability which he assumes by contract. It is buta way of apportioning the cost of government amongthose who in some measure are privileged to enjoy itsbenefits and must bear its burdens. Since no citizen enjoys immunity from that burden, its retroactive imposition does not necessarily infringe due process . . . ."Moreover, the detrimental reliance principle is not limited toretroactive legislation. An entirely prospective change in512us1$67F 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT34 UNITED STATES v. CARLTONOpinion of the Courtthe law may disturb the relied-upon expectations of individu-als, but such a change would not be deemed therefore to beviolative of due process.Similarly, we do not consider respondent Carlton's lack ofnotice regarding the 1987 amendment to be dispositive. InWelch v. Henry, the Court upheld the retroactive impositionof a tax despite the absence of advance notice of the legislation. And in Milliken v. United States, the Court rejecteda similar notice argument, declaring that a taxpayer "shouldbe regarded as taking his chances of any increase in the taxburden which might result from carrying out the establishedpolicy of taxation." 283 U. S., at 23.In holding the 1987 amendment unconstitutional, theCourt of Appeals relied on this Court's decisions in Nicholsv. Coolidge, 274 U. S. 531 (1927), Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U. S.142 (1927), and Untermyer v. Anderson, 276 U. S. 440 (1928).Those cases were decided during an era characterized byexacting review of economic legislation under an approachthat "has long since been discarded." Ferguson v. Skrupa,372 U. S. 726, 730 (1963). To the extent that their authoritysurvives, they do not control here. Blodgett and Untermyer, which involved the Nation's first gift tax, essentiallyhave been limited to situations involving "the creation of awholly new tax," and their "authority is of limited value inassessing the constitutionality of subsequent amendmentsthat bring about certain changes in operation of the taxlaws." United States v. Hemme, 476 U. S., at 568. Nicholsinvolved a novel development in the estate tax which embraced a transfer that occurred 12 years earlier. Theamendment at issue here certainly is not properly characterized as a "wholly new tax," and its period of retroactive effect is limited. Nor do the above cases stand for the proposition that retroactivity is permitted with respect to incometaxes, but prohibited with respect to gift and estate taxes.In Hemme and Milliken, this Court upheld retroactive features of gift and estate taxes.512us1$67F 12-24-97 08:02:07 PAGES OPINPGT35Cite as: 512 U. S. 26 (1994)O'Connor, J., concurring in judgmentIIIIn focusing exclusively on the taxpayer's notice and reliance, the Court of Appeals held the congressional enactmentto an unduly strict standard. Because we conclude thatretroactive application of the 1987 amendment to $ 2057 isrationally related to a legitimate legislative purpose, weconclude that the amendment as applied to Carlton's 1986transactions is consistent with the Due Process Clause.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
