KEYSTONE CONSOL.INDUSTRIES, INC.Opinion of the Courtquestion whether such a contribution, when applied to theemployer's funding obligation, is a prohibited "sale or exchange" under 26 U. S. C. $ 4975 so that the employerthereby incurs the substantial excise taxes imposed by thestatute. IA "defined benefit pension plan," as its name implies, isone where the employee, upon retirement, is entitled to afixed periodic payment. The size of that payment usuallydepends upon prior salary and years of service. The morecommon "defined contribution pension plan," in contrast, istypically one where the employer contributes a percentageof payroll or profits to individual employee accounts. Uponretirement, the employee is entitled to the funds in his account. See 29 U. S. C. $$ 1002(34) and (35).If either type of plan qualifies for favorable tax treatment,the employer, for income tax purposes, may deduct its cur-rent contributions to the plan; the retiree, however, is nottaxed until he receives payment from the plan. See 26U. S. C. $$ 402(a)(1) and 404(a)(1).IIThe facts that are pertinent for resolving the present liti-gation are not in dispute. During its taxable years endedJune 30, 1983, through June 30, 1988, inclusive, respondentKeystone Consolidated Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation with principal place of business in Dallas, Tex., main-tained several tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans.These were subject to the minimum funding requirementsprescribed by $ 302 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), Pub. L. 93-406, $ 302, 88 Stat.869, as amended, 29 U. S. C. $ 1082. See also 26 U. S. C.$ 412. Respondent funded the plans by contributions to theKeystone Consolidated Master Pension Trust.On March 8, 1983, respondent contributed to the PensionTrust five truck terminals having a stated fair market value508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT155Cite as: 508 U. S. 152 (1993)Opinion of the Courtof $9,655,454 at that time. Respondent credited that valueagainst its minimum funding obligation to its defined benefitpension plans for its fiscal years 1982 and 1983. On March13, 1984, respondent contributed to the Pension Trust certainKey West, Fla., real property having a stated fair marketvalue of $5,336,751 at that time. Respondent credited thatvalue against its minimum funding obligation for its fiscalyear 1984. The truck terminals were not encumbered at thetimes of their transfers. Neither was the Key West property. Their respective stated fair market values are notchallenged here.Respondent claimed deductions on its federal income taxreturns for the fair market values of the five truck terminalsand the Key West property. It also reported as taxable capital gain the difference between its income tax basis in eachproperty and that property's stated fair market value.Thus, for income tax purposes, respondent treated the disposal of each property as a "sale or exchange" of a capitalasset. See 26 U. S. C. $ 1222.Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U. S. C.$ 4975, was added by $ 2003(a) of ERISA. See 88 Stat. 971.It imposes a two-tier excise tax 1 on specified "prohibitedtransactions" between a pension plan and a "disqualified person." Among the "disqualified persons" listed in the statuteis the employer of employees covered by the pension plan.See $ 4975(e)(2)(C). Among the transactions prohibited is"any direct or indirect . . . sale or exchange . . . of any1 The first-tier tax is "5 percent of the amount involved." 26 U. S. C.$ 4975(a). The second-tier tax is "100 percent of the amount involved."$ 4975(b). The "amount involved" is the greater of the amount of moneyand the fair market value of the other property given or the amount ofmoney and the fair market value of the other property received.$ 4975(f)(4). The second-tier tax usually may be avoided by timely correction of the prohibited transaction upon completion of the litigation concerning the taxpayer's liability for the tax. See $$ 4961(a), 4963(b) and(e), 6213(a), and 7481(a).508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT156 COMMISSIONER v. KEYSTONE CONSOL.INDUSTRIES, INC.Opinion of the Courtproperty between a plan and a disqualified person." See$ 4975(c)(1)(A).The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who is the peti-tioner here, ruled that respondent's transfers to the PensionTrust of the five truck terminals and the Key West propertywere sales or exchanges prohibited under $ 4975(c)(1)(A).This ruling resulted in determined deficiencies in respondent's first-tier excise tax liability of $749,610 for its fiscal year1984 and of $482,773 for each of its fiscal years 1983 and1985-1988, inclusive. The Commissioner also determinedthat respondent incurred second-tier excise tax liability inthe amount of $9,655,454 for its fiscal year 1988.Respondent timely filed a petition for redeterminationwith the United States Tax Court. That court, with an unreviewed opinion on cross-motions for summary judgment,ruled in respondent's favor. 60 TCM 1423 (1990), || 90,628P-H Memo TC.The Tax Court acknowledged that "there is a potential forabuse by allowing unencumbered property transfers to plansin satisfaction of minimum funding requirements." Id., at1424, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3071. Nonetheless, itdid not agree that the transfers in this case constituted salesor exchanges under $ 4975. It rejected the Commissioner'sattempt to analogize the property transfers to the recognition of income for income tax purposes, for it considered theissue whether a transfer is a prohibited transaction under$ 4975 to be "separate and distinct from income tax recognition." Id., at 1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3071.In drawing this distinction, the Tax Court cited 26 U. S. C.$ 4975(f)(3). That section specifically states that a transferof property "by a disqualified person to a plan shall betreated as a sale or exchange if the property is subject to amortgage or similar lien." The court observed: "Since section 4975(f )(3) specifically describes certain transfers of realor personal property to a plan by a disqualified person as asale or exchange for purposes of section 4975, the definitional508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT157Cite as: 508 U.

The Tax Courtthus seemed to say that $ 4975(f )(3) limits the reach of$ 4975(c)(1)(A), so that only transfers of encumbered propertyare prohibited.The Tax Court also rejected the Commissioner's argumentthat by contributing noncash property to its plan, the employer was in a position to exert unwarranted influence overthe Pension Trust's investment policy. The court's answerwas that the trustee "can dispose of " the property. Id., at1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC, p. 90-3072. The court notedthat it earlier had rejected the Commissioner's distinctionbetween transfers of property that satisfy a funding obligation and transfers of encumbered property, whether or notthe latter transfers fulfill a funding obligation, in Wood v.Commissioner, 95 T. C. 364 (1990) (unreviewed), rev'd, 955F. 2d 908 (CA4), cert. granted, 504 U. S. 972, dism'd, 505 U. S.1231 (1992). See 60 TCM, at 1425, || 90,628 P-H Memo TC,p. 90-3072.The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuitaffirmed. 951 F. 2d 76 (1992). It read $ 4975(f )(3) as "implying that unless it is encumbered by a mortgage or lien, atransfer of property is not to be treated as if it were a saleor exchange." Id., at 78. It rejected the Commissioner'sargument that $ 4975(f )(3) was intended to expand the definition of "sale or exchange" to include transfers of encumbered property that do not fulfill funding obligations; in thecourt's view, "there is no basis for this distinction betweeninvoluntary and voluntary transfers anywhere in the Code."Ibid. The court reasoned: "If all transfers of property toa plan were to be treated as a sale or exchange" under$ 4975(c)(1)(A), then $ 4975(f)(3) "would be superfluous."Ibid.

KEYSTONE CONSOL.INDUSTRIES, INC.Opinion of the Courtincome tax purposes is "irrelevant," because "[s]ection 4975was not enacted to measure economic income." Id., at 79.The Court of Appeals ruled that the Commissioner's viewswere not entitled to deference, despite the fact that both theInternal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor ad-minister ERISA's prohibited-transaction provisions. Thiswas because the Commissioner's views had not been set outin a formal regulation, and because the Department of Labor's views were set out in an advisory opinion that wasbinding only "on the parties thereto, and has no precedentialeffect." Ibid.In view of the acknowledged conflict between the FourthCircuit's decision in Wood, see 955 F. 2d, at 913, and the FifthCircuit's decision in the present litigation, cases decidedwithin two weeks of each other, we granted certiorari. 506U. S. 813 (1992).IIIThe statute with which we are concerned is a complicatedone. But when much of its language, not applicable to thepresent case, is set to one side, the issue before us comesinto better focus. Respondent acknowledges that it is a"disqualified person" with respect to the Pension Trust. Italso acknowledges that the trust qualifies as a plan under$ 4975. Our task, then, is only to determine whether thetransfers of the terminals and of the Key West propertywere sales or exchanges within the reach of $ 4975(c)(1)(A)and therefore were prohibited transactions.AIt is well established for income tax purposes that thetransfer of property in satisfaction of a monetary obligationis usually a "sale or exchange" of the property. See, e. g.,Helvering v. Hammel, 311 U. S. 504 (1941). See also 2B. Bittker & L. Lokken, Federal Taxation of Income, Estatesand Gifts || 40.4, p. 40-11 (2d ed. 1990). It seems clear,therefore, that respondent's contribution of the truck termi508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT159Cite as: 508 U. S. 152 (1993)Opinion of the Courtnals and the Key West property constituted, under the income tax laws, sales of those properties to the Pension Trust.The Fourth Circuit, in Wood, supra, observed: "[W]e areaware of no instance when the term `sale or exchange' hasbeen used or interpreted not to include transfers of propertyin satisfaction of indebtedness." 955 F. 2d, at 913.This logic applied in income tax cases is equally applicableunder $ 4975(c)(1)(A). The phrase "sale or exchange" hadacquired a settled judicial and administrative interpretationover the course of a half century before Congress enacted in$ 4975 the even broader statutory language of "any direct orindirect . . . sale or exchange." Congress presumptively wasaware when it enacted $ 4975 that the phrase "sale or exchange" consistently had been construed to include the transfer of property in satisfaction of a monetary obligation. SeeAlbernaz v. United States, 450 U. S. 333, 340-343 (1981). Itis a "normal rule of statutory construction," Sorenson v. Secretary of Treasury, 475 U. S. 851, 860 (1986), that "identicalwords used in different parts of the same act are intendedto have the same meaning," Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc.v. United States, 286 U. S. 427, 433 (1932). Further, "theCode must be given `as great an internal symmetry and consistency as its words permit.' " Commissioner v. Lester, 366U. S. 299, 304 (1961). Accordingly, when we construe$ 4975(c)(1)(A), it is proper to accept the already settledmeaning of the phrase "sale or exchange."Even if this phrase had not possessed a settled meaning,it still would be clear that $ 4975(c)(1)(A) prohibits the transfer of property in satisfaction of a debt. Congress barrednot merely a "sale or exchange." It prohibited somethingmore, namely, "any direct or indirect . . . sale or exchange."The contribution of property in satisfaction of a funding obligation is at least both an indirect type of sale and a form ofexchange, since the property is exchanged for diminution ofthe employer's funding obligation.508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT160 COMMISSIONER v. KEYSTONE CONSOL.INDUSTRIES, INC.Opinion of the CourtBWe note, too, that this construction of the statute's broadlanguage is necessary to accomplish Congress' goal. BeforeERISA's enactment in 1974, the measure that governed atransaction between a pension plan and its sponsor was thecustomary arm's-length standard of conduct. This providedan open door for abuses such as the sponsor's sale of property to the plan at an inflated price or the sponsor's satisfac-tion of a funding obligation by contribution of property thatwas overvalued or nonliquid. Congress' response to theseabuses included the enactment of ERISA's $ 406(a)(1)(A), 29U. S. C. $ 1106(a)(1)(A), and the addition of $ 4975 to the In-ternal Revenue Code.Congress' goal was to bar categorically a transaction thatwas likely to injure the pension plan. S. Rep. No. 93-383,pp. 95-96 (1973). The transfer of encumbered property mayjeopardize the ability of the plan to pay promised benefits.See Wood v. Commissioner, supra. Such a transfer imposesupon the trust the primary obligation to pay the encumbrance, and thus frees cash for the employer by restrictingthe use of cash by the trust. Overvaluation, the burden ofdisposing of the property, and the employer's substitution ofits own judgment as to investment policy, are other obviousconsiderations. Although the burden of an encumbrance isunique to the contribution of encumbered property, concernsabout overvaluation, disposal of property, and the need tomaintain an independent investment policy animate any contribution of property that satisfies a funding obligation, re-gardless of whether or not the property is encumbered.This is because as long as a pension fund is giving up anaccount receivable in exchange for property, the fund runsthe risk of giving up more than it is getting in return if theproperty is either less valuable or more burdensome than acash contribution would have been.These potential harmful effects are illustrated by the factsof the present case, even though the properties at issue508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT161Cite as: 508 U. S. 152 (1993)Opinion of the Courtwere unencumbered and not overvalued at the times of theirrespective transfers. There were exclusive sales-listingagreements respondent had made with respect to two of thetruck terminals; these agreements called for sales commissions. The presence of this requirement demonstrates thatit is neither easy nor costless to dispose of such properties.The Chicago truck terminal, for example, was not sold for31/2 years after it was listed for sale by the Pension Trust.These problems are not solved, as the Court of Appealssuggested, by the mere imposition of excise taxes by $ 4971.It is $ 4975 that prevents the abuses.CWe do not agree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion that$ 4975(f )(3) limits the meaning of "sale or exchange," as thatphrase appears in $ 4975(c)(1)(A). Section 4975(f )(3) statesthat a transfer of property "by a disqualified person to a planshall be treated as a sale or exchange if the property is sub-ject to a mortgage or similar lien." The Court of Appealsread this language as implying that unless property "is en-cumbered by a mortgage or lien, a transfer of property isnot to be treated as if it were a sale or exchange." 951 F. 2d,at 78. We feel that by this language Congress intended$ 4975(f )(3) to expand, not limit, the scope of the prohibited-transaction provision. It extends the reach of "sale or exchange" in $ 4975(c)(1)(A) to include contributions of encum-bered property that do not satisfy funding obligations. SeeH. R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1280, p. 307 (1974). Congress in-tended by $ 4975(f )(3) to provide additional protection, not tolimit the protection already provided by $ 4975(c)(1)(A).22 Such expanded coverage is illustrated by the following example. Anemployer with no outstanding funding obligations wishes to contributeproperty to a pension fund to reward its employees for an especially productive year of service. Under our analysis, the property contribution ispermissible if the property is unencumbered, because it will not be "exchanged" for a diminution in funding obligations and therefore does not508us1$74Z 01-23-96 19:09:44 PAGES OPINPGT162 COMMISSIONER v. KEYSTONE CONSOL.INDUSTRIES, INC.Stevens, J., dissentingWe feel that the Commissioner's construction of $ 4975 isa sensible one. A transfer of encumbered property, like thetransfer of unencumbered property to satisfy an obligation,has the potential to burden a plan, while a transfer of property that is neither encumbered nor satisfies a debt presentsfar less potential for causing loss to the plan.3IVThe judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
