This action involves the scope of federal pre-emptionunder the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U. S. C. $ 151et seq.The RLA, which was extended in 1936 to cover the airlineindustry, see Act of Apr. 10, 1936, ch. 166, 49 Stat. 1189;45 U. S.

The question in this case is whether an aircraftmechanic who claims that he was discharged for refusing tocertify the safety of a plane that he considered unsafe andfor reporting his safety concerns to the Federal Aviation Ad-ministration may pursue available state-law remedies forwrongful discharge, or whether he may seek redress onlythrough the RLA's arbitral mechanism.

See Certification: Airmen Other Than Flight Crewmembers, 14 CFR$$ 65.85 and 65.87 (1987). If he were to approve any aircrafton which the repairs did not conform to FAA safety reg-ulations, the FAA could suspend or revoke his license.See Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Rebuilding andAlteration, 14 CFR $ 43.12 (1992).On February 2, 1987, respondent was hired by petitionerHawaiian Airlines, Inc. (HAL). Many of the terms of hisemployment were governed by a collective-bargaining agree-ment (CBA) negotiated between the carrier and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.Under the CBA, respondent's duties included inspecting andrepairing all parts of a plane and its engine. On July 15,1987, during a routine preflight inspection of a DC-9 plane,he noticed that one of the tires was worn. When he re-moved the wheel, respondent discovered that the axle sleeve,which should have been mirror smooth, was scarred andgrooved. This damaged sleeve could cause the landing gearto fail. Respondent recommended that the sleeve be re-placed, but his supervisor ordered that it be sanded and returned to the plane. This was done, and the plane flew asscheduled. At the end of the shift, respondent refused tosign the maintenance record to certify that the repair hadbeen performed satisfactorily and that the airplane was fitto fly. See 14 CFR $ 43.9(a) (1992). The supervisor im-mediately suspended him pending a termination hearing.Respondent immediately went home and called the FAAto report the problem with the sleeve.1Respondent then invoked the grievance procedure out-lined in the CBA, and a "Step 1" grievance hearing was held1 In response, the FAA initiated a comprehensive investigation, proposed a civil penalty of $964,000 against HAL, proposed the revocation ofthe license of the supervisor who terminated respondent, and ultimatelysettled all charges for a substantial fine.512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT250 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRISOpinion of the Courton July 31, 1987. Petitioner HAL accused respondent ofinsubordination, claiming that his refusal to sign the recordviolated the CBA's provision that an aircraft mechanic "maybe required to sign work records in connection with the workhe performs." Respondent relied on the CBA's guaranteesthat an employee may not be discharged without just causeand may not be disciplined for refusing to perform work thatis in violation of health or safety laws. The hearing officerterminated respondent for insubordination.Still conforming to the CBA procedures, respondent appealed his termination, seeking a "Step 3" grievance hearing. Before this hearing took place, HAL offered to reducerespondent's punishment to suspension without pay, butwarned him that "any further instance of failure to perform[his] duties in a responsible manner" could result in discharge. Respondent did not respond to this offer, nor, apparently, did he take further steps to pursue his grievancethrough the CBA procedures.On December 18, 1987, respondent filed suit against HALin Hawaii Circuit Court. His complaint included twowrongful-discharge torts--discharge in violation of thepublic policy expressed in the Federal Aviation Act of 1958and implementing regulations, and discharge in violation ofHawaii's Whistleblower Protection Act, Haw. Rev. Stat.$$ 378-61 to 378-69 (1988).2 He also alleged that HAL hadbreached the CBA. HAL removed the action to the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Hawaii, which dismissed the breach-of-contract claim as pre-empted by the2 The Hawaii Whistleblower Protection Act forbids an employer to"discharge, threaten, or otherwise discriminate against an employee . . .because . . .

The state court certified its order as final to per-mit respondent to take an immediate appeal.In the meantime, respondent had filed a second lawsuit instate court, naming as defendants three of HAL's officerswho allegedly directed, confirmed, or ratified the claimedretaliatory discharge.3 He again sought relief for, amongother things, discharge in violation of public policy and ofthe Hawaii Whistleblower Protection Act. The Hawaii trialcourt dismissed these two counts as pre-empted by the RLAand certified the case for immediate appeal.The Supreme Court of Hawaii reversed in both cases, con-cluding that the RLA did not pre-empt respondent's statetort actions. Norris v. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc., 74 Haw.235, 842 P. 2d 634 (1992); 74 Haw. 648, 847 P. 2d 263 (1993).That court concluded that the plain language of $ 153 First(i) does not support pre-emption of disputes independent ofa labor agreement, 74 Haw., at 251, 842 P. 2d, at 642, andinterpreted the opinion in Consolidated Rail Corporation v.Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 491 U. S. 299 (1989) (Conrail), to limit RLA pre-emption to "disputes involving con-tractually defined rights." 74 Haw., at 250, 842 P. 2d, at 642.The court rejected petitioners' argument that the retaliatorydischarge claims were pre-empted because determiningwhether HAL discharged respondent for insubordination,and thus for just cause, required construing the CBA. Thecourt pointed to Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc.,486 U. S. 399 (1988), a case involving $ 301 of the LaborManagement Relations Act, 1947 (LMRA), 29 U. S.

NORRISOpinion of the Courtdid not require interpretation of a CBA, but depended uponpurely factual questions concerning the employee's conductand the employer's motive. Because the same was true inthis action, said the Supreme Court of Hawaii, respondent'sstate tort claims were not pre-empted.We granted certiorari in these consolidated cases, 510U. S. 1083 (1994).IIAWhether federal law pre-empts a state law establishing acause of action is a question of congressional intent. SeeAllis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202, 208 (1985).Pre-emption of employment standards "within the traditional police power of the State" "should not be lightlyinferred." Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S.1, 21 (1987); see also Hillsborough County v. AutomatedMedical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U. S. 707, 715 (1985) (afederal statute will be read to supersede a State's historicpowers only if this is " `the clear and manifest purposeof Congress' ").Congress' purpose in passing the RLA was to promotestability in labor-management relations by providing a comprehensive framework for resolving labor disputes. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 562 (1987); seealso 45 U. S. C. $ 151a. To realize this goal, the RLA establishes a mandatory arbitral mechanism for "the prompt andorderly settlement" of two classes of disputes. 45 U. S. C.$ 151a. The first class, those concerning "rates of pay, rulesor working conditions," ibid., are deemed "major" disputes.Major disputes relate to " `the formation of collective [bargaining] agreements or efforts to secure them.' " Conrail,491 U. S., at 302, quoting Elgin, J. & E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325U. S. 711, 723 (1945). The second class of disputes, knownas "minor" disputes, "gro[w] out of grievances or out of theinterpretation or application of agreements covering rates512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT253Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)Opinion of the Courtof pay, rules, or working conditions." 45 U. S. C. $ 151a.Minor disputes involve "controversies over the meaning ofan existing collective bargaining agreement in a particularfact situation." Trainmen v. Chicago R. & I. R. Co., 353U. S. 30, 33 (1957). Thus, "major disputes seek to createcontractual rights, minor disputes to enforce them."Con-rail, 491 U. S., at 302, citing Burley, 325 U. S., at 723.Petitioners contend that the conflict over respondent'sfiring is a minor dispute. If so, it must be resolved onlythrough the RLA mechanisms, including the carrier's inter-nal dispute-resolution processes and an adjustment board established by the employer and the unions. See 45 U. S. C.$ 184;Buell, 480 U. S., at 563; Conrail, 491 U. S., at 302.Thus, a determination that respondent's complaints constitute a minor dispute would pre-empt his state-law actions.BThe Court's inquiry into the scope of minor disputes be-gins, of course, with the text of the statute. Petitionerspoint out that the statute defines minor disputes to include"disputes . . . growing out of grievances,or out of the in-terpretation or application of [CBA's]." Petitioners arguethat this disjunctive language must indicate that "griev-ances" means something other than labor-contract disputes,else the term "grievances" would be superfluous. Accord-ingly, petitioners suggest that "grievances" should be readto mean all employment-related disputes, including thosebased on statutory or common law. Even if we were persuaded that the word "or" carried this weight, but cf. UnitedStates v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 732 (1993) (reading "error ordefect" to create one category of "error"), citingUnitedStates v. Young, 470 U. S. 1, 15, n. 12 (1985); McNally v.United States, 483 U. S. 350, 358-359 (1987) (second phrasein disjunctive added simply to make the meaning of the firstphrase "unmistakable"), petitioners' interpretation producesan overlap not unlike the one it purports to avoid. Their512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT254 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRISOpinion of the Courtexpansive definition of "grievances" necessarily encompassesdisputes growing out of "the interpretation or application"of CBA's. Thus, in attempting to save the term "grievances" from superfluity, petitioners would make the phraseafter the "or" mere surplusage.We think it more likely that "grievances," like disputesover "the interpretation or application" of CBA's, refers todisagreements over how to give effect to the bargained-foragreement. The use of "grievance" to refer to a claim arising out of a CBA is common in the labor-law context in general, see, e. g., Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29, 36(1987), and it has been understood in this way in the RLAcontext. See H. R. Rep. No. 1944, 73d Cong., 2d Sess.,2-3 (1934) (referring to RLA settlement of "minor disputesknown as `grievances,' which develop from the interpretationand/or application of the contracts between the labor unionsand the carriers"). Significantly, the adjustment boardscharged with administration of the minor-dispute provisionshave understood these provisions as pertaining only to disputes invoking contract-based rights. See, e. g., NRABFourth Div. Award No. 4548 (1987) (function of the NationalRail Adjustment Board (Board) is to decide disputes inaccordance with the controlling CBA); NRAB Third Div.Award No. 24348 (1983) (issues not related to the interpretation or application of contracts are outside the Board'sauthority); NRAB Third Div. Award No. 19790 (1973)("[T]his Board lacks jurisdiction to enforce rights createdby State or Federal Statutes and is limited to questions arising out of interpretations and application of Railway LaborAgreements"); Northwest Airlines/Airline Pilots Assn.,Int'l System Bd. of Adjustment, Decision of June 28, 1972,p. 13 ("[B]oth the traditional role of the arbitrator and admonitions of the courts require the Board to refrain from attempting to construe any of the provisions of the [RLA]");United Airlines, Inc., 48 LA 727, 733 (BNA) (1967) ("The512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT255Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)Opinion of the Courtjurisdiction of this System Board does not extend to inter-preting and applying the Civil Rights Act").Accordingly, we believe that the most natural reading ofthe term "grievances" in this context is as a synonym for disputes involving the application or interpretation of a CBA.See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1585(1986) (the word "or" may be used to indicate "the synonymous, equivalent, or substitutive character of two words orphrases"). Nothing in the legislative history of the RLA 4 orother sections of the statute 5 undermines this conclusion.But even accepting that $ 151a is susceptible of more than oneinterpretation, no proposed interpretation demonstrates aclear and manifest congressional purpose to create a regime4 During the debates surrounding the RLA's enactment in 1926, floorstatements that, in isolation, could support a broader interpretation of"grievances" were counterbalanced by other statements--some even bythe same legislators--that equated grievances with contract interpretation. Compare 67 Cong. Rec. 4517, 8807 (1926), with id., at 4510, 8808.This inconclusive debate hardly calls for fashioning a broad rule of preemption. Moreover, in 1934 when Congress amended the RLA to makearbitration mandatory for minor disputes, the accompanying House Report stated that the bill was intended "to provide sufficient and effectivemeans for the settlement of minor disputes known as `grievances,' whichdevelop from the interpretation and/or application of the contracts between the labor unions and the carriers, fixing wages and working conditions." H. R. Rep. No. 1944, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 2-3 (1934).5 Petitioners cite the statute's reference to the parties' general duties asincluding "settl[ing] all disputes, whether arising out of the application of[collective bargaining] agreements or otherwise." 45 U. S. C. $ 152 First.This provision, which is phrased more broadly than the operative languageof $ 153 First (i), does not clearly refer only to minor disputes. But evenif this provision is read to require parties to try to settle certain issuesarising out of the employment relationship but not specifically addressedby the CBA, this does not compel the conclusion that all issues touchingon the employment relationship must be resolved through arbitrationor that all claims involving rights and duties that exist independent ofthe CBA are thereby pre-empted. Our precedents squarely reject thispervasive pre-emption.512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT256 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRISOpinion of the Courtthat broadly pre-empts substantive protections extended bythe States, independent of any negotiated labor agreement.COur case law confirms that the category of minor disputescontemplated by $ 151a are those that are grounded in theCBA. We have defined minor disputes as those involvingthe interpretation or application of existing labor agreements. See, e. g., Conrail, 491 U. S., at 305 ("The distin-guishing feature of [a minor dispute] is that the disputemay be conclusively resolved by interpreting the existing[CBA]");Pittsburgh & Lake Erie R. Co. v. Railway LaborExecutives' Assn., 491 U. S. 490, 496, n. 4 (1989) ("Minor disputes are those involving the interpretation or applicationof existing contracts"); Trainmen, 353 U. S., at 33 (minor disputes are "controversies over the meaning of an existing col-lective bargaining agreement");Slocum v. Delaware, L. & W.R. Co., 339 U. S. 239, 243 (1950) (RLA arbitral mechanismis meant to provide remedies for "adjustment of railroad-employee disputes growing out of the interpretation of existing agreements").Moreover, we have held that the RLA's mechanism forresolving minor disputes does not pre-empt causes of actionto enforce rights that are independent of the CBA. Morethan 60 years ago, the Court rejected a railroad's argumentthat the existence of the RLA arbitration scheme preempted a state statute regulating the number of workersrequired to operate certain equipment.Missouri Pacific R.Co. v. Norwood, 283 U. S. 249, 258 (1931) ("No analysis ordiscussion of the provisions of the Railway Labor Act of 1926is necessary to show that it does not conflict with the Arkansas statutes under consideration"). Not long thereafter, theCourt rejected a claim that the RLA pre-empted an order bythe Illinois Commerce Commission requiring cabooses on alltrains; the operative CBA required cabooses only on some ofthe trains. Terminal Railroad Assn. of St. Louis v. Train512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT257Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)Opinion of the Courtmen, 318 U. S. 1 (1943). Although the Court assumed thata railroad adjustment board would have jurisdiction underthe RLA over this dispute, id., at 6, it concluded that thestate law was enforceable nonetheless:"State laws have long regulated a great variety of conditions in transportation and industry, such as sanitaryfacilities and conditions, safety devices and protections,purity of water supply, fire protection, and innumerableothers. Any of these matters might, we suppose, be thesubject of a demand by work[ers] for better protectionand upon refusal might be the subject of a labor disputewhich would have such effect on interstate commercethat federal agencies might be invoked to deal with somephase of it. . . . But it cannot be said that the minimumrequirements laid down by state authority are all setaside. We hold that the enactment by Congress of the[RLA] was not a preemption of the field of regulatingworking conditions themselves . . . ." Id., at 6-7.Thus, under Norwood, substantive protections provided bystate law, independent of whatever labor agreement mightgovern, are not pre-empted under the RLA.Although Norwood and Terminal Railroad involved stateworkplace safety laws, the Court has taken a consistent approach in the context of state actions for wrongful discharge.In Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320(1972), the Court held that a state-law claim of wrongfultermination was pre-empted, not because the RLA broadlypre-empts state-law claims based on discharge or discipline,but because the employee's claim was firmly rooted in abreach of the CBA itself. He asserted no right independentof that agreement:"Here it is conceded by all that the only source of [Andrews'] right not to be discharged, and therefore to treatan alleged discharge as a `wrongful' one that entitles him512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT258 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRISOpinion of the Courtto damages, is the [CBA]. . . . [T]he disagreement turnson the extent of [the railroad's] obligation to restore [Andrews] to his regular duties following injury in an auto-mobile accident. The existence and extent of such anobligation in a case such as this will depend on the interpretation of the [CBA]. Thus [Andrews'] claim, and[the railroad's] disallowance of it, stem from differinginterpretations of the [CBA]. . . . His claim is there-fore subject to the Act's requirement that it be submitted to the Board for adjustment." Id., at 324 (empha-sis added).Here, in contrast, the CBA is not the "only source" of re-spondent's right not to be discharged wrongfully. In fact,the "only source" of the right respondent asserts in this ac-tion is state tort law. Wholly apart from any provision ofthe CBA, petitioners had a state-law obligation not to firerespondent in violation of public policy or in retaliation forwhistle-blowing. The parties' obligation under the RLA toarbitrate disputes arising out of the application or interpretation of the CBA did not relieve petitioners of this duty.Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557 (1987),confirms that "minor disputes" subject to RLA arbitrationare those that involve duties and rights created or definedby the CBA. InBuell, a railroad employee sought damagesfor workplace injuries under the Federal Employers' Liabil-ity Act (FELA), 45 U. S. C. $ 51et seq., which provides aremedy for a railroad worker injured through an employer'sor co-worker's negligence. The railroad argued that, because the alleged injury resulted from conduct that was subject to the CBA, the employee's sole remedy was throughRLA arbitration. The Court unanimously rejected this argument, emphasizing that the rights derived from the FELAwere independent of the CBA:"The fact that an injury otherwise compensable underthe FELA was caused by conduct that may have been512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT259Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)Opinion of the Courtsubject to arbitration under the RLA does not deprivean employee of his opportunity to bring an FELA actionfor damages. . . . The FELA not only provides railroadworkers with substantive protection against negligentconduct that is independent of the employer's obligations under its collective-bargaining agreement, but alsoaffords injured workers a remedy suited to their needs,unlike the limited relief that seems to be availablethrough the Adjustment Board. It is inconceivable thatCongress intended that a worker who suffered a disabling injury would be denied recovery under the FELAsimply because he might also be able to process a narrowlabor grievance under the RLA to a successful conclusion." 480 U. S., at 564-565.It likened Buell to other cases in which the Court hadconcluded that "notwithstanding the strong policies encouraging arbitration, `different considerations apply where theemployee's claim is based on rights arising out of a statute designed to provide minimum substantive guaranteesto individual workers,' " id., at 565, quoting Barrentine v.Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728, 737(1981), and distinguished it from Andrews, which involved astate wrongful-discharge claim "based squarely" on an alleged breach of a CBA, 480 U. S., at 566.66 Buell, of course, involved possible RLA preclusion of a cause of actionarising out of a federal statute, while this case involves RLA pre-emptionof a cause of action arising out of state law and existing entirely independent of the CBA. That distinction does not rob Buell of its force inthis context. See Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S. 399,412 (1988) (Buell principles applicable to determine whether federal laborlaw pre-empts a state statute). Principles of federalism demand no lesscaution in finding that a federal statute pre-empts state law. See FortHalifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 21 (1987) (pre-emption of statestatute "should not be lightly inferred in this [labor] area, since the establishment of labor standards falls within the traditional police power ofthe State").512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT260 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRISOpinion of the CourtDThe pre-emption standard that emerges from the line ofcases leading toBuell--that a state-law cause of action isnot pre-empted by the RLA if it involves rights and obligations that exist independent of the CBA--is virtually identi-cal to the pre-emption standard the Court employs in casesinvolving $ 301 of the LMRA, 29 U. S. C. $ 185.7 In Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202 (1985), the Court applied $ 301 pre-emption to a state-law claim for bad-faith han-dling of a worker's compensation claim because the dutiesthe employer owed the employee, including the duty of goodfaith, were rooted firmly in the CBA. Its pre-emption finding was based on the fact that "the right asserted not onlyderives from the contract, but is defined by the contractualobligation of good faith, [so that] any attempt to assess lia-bility here inevitably will involve contract interpretation."Id., at 218.It cautioned, however, that other state-law rights, thosethat existed independent of the contract, would not be simi-larly pre-empted:"Of course, not every dispute concerning employment,or tangentially involving a provision of a collectivebargaining agreement, is pre-empted by $ 301 or otherprovisions of the federal labor law. . . . Nor is there anysuggestion that Congress, in adopting $ 301, wished togive the substantive provisions of private agreementsthe force of federal law, ousting any inconsistent stateregulation. . . . Clearly, $ 301 does not grant the partiesto a collective-bargaining agreement the ability to con-tract for what is illegal under state law. In extendingthe pre-emptive effect of $ 301 beyond suits for breach7 Section 301(a) provides federal-court jurisdiction over controversiesinvolving CBA's and "authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of these collective bargaining agreements."Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala., 353 U. S. 448, 451 (1957).512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT261Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)Opinion of the Courtof contract, it would be inconsistent with congressionalintent under that section to pre-empt state rules thatproscribe conduct, or establish rights and obligations,independent of a labor contract." Id., at 211-212.8In a case remarkably similar to the case before us now,this Court made clear that the existence of a potential CBAbased remedy did not deprive an employee of independentremedies available under state law. In Lingle v. Norge Div.of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S. 399 (1988), an employee cov-ered by a labor agreement was fired for filing an allegedlyfalse worker's compensation claim. After filing a grievancepursuant to her CBA, which protected employees againstdischarge except for "proper" or "just" cause, she filed a com-plaint in state court, alleging that she had been dischargedfor exercising her rights under Illinois worker's compensa-tion laws. The state court had held her state-law claim preempted because "the same analysis of the facts" was re-quired in both the grievance proceeding and the state-courtaction. This Court reversed.It recognized that where the resolution of a state-law claimdepends on an interpretation of the CBA, the claim is pre-empted. Id., at 405-406, citing Lueck, supra; Teamsters v.Lucas Flour Co., 369 U. S. 95 (1962). It observed, however,that "purely factual questions" about an employee's conduct oran employer's conduct and motives do not "requir[e] a courtto interpret any term of a collective-bargaining agreement."8 The Court applies these principles in Livadas v. Bradshaw, in whichwe reject the claim that an employee's state-law right to receive a penaltypayment from her employer was pre-empted under $ 301 because the penalty was pegged to her wages, which were determined by the governingCBA. The Court states that "when the meaning of contract terms is notthe subject of dispute, the bare fact that a collective-bargaining agreementwill be consulted in the course of state-law litigation plainly does not require the claim to be extinguished." Ante, at 124, citing Lingle v. NorgeDiv. of Magic Chef, Inc., 486 U. S., at 413, n. 12. In addition, it reaffirmsthat "$ 301 cannot be read broadly to pre-empt nonnegotiable rights conferred on individual employees as a matter of state law."

The state-law retaliatory discharge claimturned on just this sort of purely factual question: whetherthe employee was discharged or threatened with discharge,and, if so, whether the employer's motive in discharging herwas to deter or interfere with her exercise of rights underIllinois worker's compensation law.While recognizing that "the state-law analysis might wellinvolve attention to the same factual considerations as thecontractual determination of whether Lingle was fired forjust cause," id., at 408, the Court disagreed that"such parallelism render[ed] the state-law analysis dependent upon the contractual analysis. For while theremay be instances in which the National Labor RelationsAct pre-empts state law on the basis of the subjectmatter of the law in question, $ 301 pre-emption merelyensures that federal law will be the basis for interpret-ing collective-bargaining agreements, and says nothingabout the substantive rights a State may provide toworkers when adjudication of those rights does not de-pend upon the interpretation of such agreements. Inother words, even if dispute resolution pursuant to acollective-bargaining agreement, on the one hand, andstate law, on the other, would require addressing pre-cisely the same set of facts, as long as the state-law claimcan be resolved without interpreting the agreementitself, the claim is `independent' of the agreement for$ 301 pre-emption purposes." Id., at 408-410.The Court's ruling in Lingle that the LMRA pre-emptsstate law only if a state-law claim is dependent on the interpretation of a CBA is fully consistent with the holding inBuell, 480 U. S., at 564-565, that the RLA does not pre-empt"substantive protection . . . independent of the [CBA]," withthe holding in Terminal Railroad, 318 U. S., at 7, that theRLA does not pre-empt basic "protection . . . laid down bystate authority," with the conclusion in Andrews, 406 U. S.,512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT263Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)Opinion of the Courtat 324, that a state-law claim is pre-empted where it "de-pend[s] on the interpretation" of the CBA, and with the description in Conrail, 491 U. S., at 305, of a minor dispute asone that can be "conclusively resolved" by reference to anexisting CBA. Lingle, in fact, expressly relied on Buell, see486 U. S., at 411-412, just as earlier RLA cases have drawnanalogies to LMRA principles, see,e. g., Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc., 372 U. S. 682, 692 (1963). Given this con-vergence in the pre-emption standards under the two statutes, we conclude that Lingle provides an appropriateframework for addressing pre-emption under the RLA, andwe adopt the Lingle standard to resolve claims of RLApre-emption.9EIn reaching this conclusion, we reject petitioners' suggestion that this contract-dependent standard for minor dis9 It is true, as petitioners observe, that the RLA and the LMRA are notidentical in language, history, and purpose. The LMRA, unlike the RLA,does not mandate arbitration, nor does it prescribe the types of disputesto be submitted to arbitration under bargaining agreements. Nonetheless, the common purposes of the two statutes, the parallel developmentof RLA and LMRA pre-emption law, see, e. g., Machinists v. Central Airlines, Inc., 372 U. S. 682, 691-692 (1963); Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck,471 U. S. 202, 210 (1985), and the desirability of having a uniform commonlaw of labor law pre-emption, cf. Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.,394 U. S. 369, 383-384 (1969), support the application of the Lingle standard in RLA cases as well.Lower courts, too, have recognized the appropriateness of the Linglestandard to RLA pre-emption analysis. See, e. g., Anderson v. AmericanAirlines, Inc., 2 F. 3d 590, 595 (CA5 1993) (applying Lingle to analyzeRLA pre-emption); Davies v. American Airlines, Inc., 971 F. 2d 463, 466-467 (CA10 1992) (same), cert. denied, 508 U. S. 950 (1993); O'Brien v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 972 F. 2d 1, 4 (CA1 1992) (same), cert. denied, 506U. S. 1054 (1993); Maher v. New Jersey Transit Rail Operations, Inc., 125N. J. 455, 472-473, 593 A. 2d 750, 758 (1991) (same). But see, e. g., Hubbard v. United Airlines, Inc., 927 F. 2d 1094, 1097 (CA9 1991) (Lingle doesnot govern in RLA cases); Lorenz v. CSX Transp., Inc., 980 F. 2d 263, 268(CA4 1992) (same).512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT264 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRISOpinion of the Courtputes is inconsistent with two of our prior cases, Elgin, J. &E. R. Co. v. Burley, 325 U. S. 711 (1945), and Conrail, 491U. S., at 302. Burley was not a pre-emption case. Rather,it concerned the authority of union officials to settle railroadworkers' individual claims for damages for alleged violationsof the CBA. The railroad urged that the union representative, who had the authority to negotiate CBA's in major dis-putes, enjoyed similar authority to settle individual claims inminor disputes. In the course of rejecting this claim, theCourt described minor disputes as including the "omittedcase," that is, one "founded upon some incident of the em-ployment relation, or asserted one, independent of those covered by the collective agreement, e. g., claims on account ofpersonal injuries." 325 U. S., at 723.This language is sweeping, but its effect is limited. Theconflict in Burley, which the parties agreed was a minor dispute, concerned the terms of a CBA, and not some other"incident of the employment relationship," or any "omittedcase." These references, therefore, are dicta. Moreover,even the "omitted case" dictum logically can refer to a normthat the parties have created but have omitted from theCBA'sexplicit language, rather than to a norm establishedby a legislature or a court.10 Finally, Burley's one specificexample of an "omitted case"--claims for personal injurythat do not depend on the contract--was found inBuell tobe outside the RLA's exclusive jurisdiction. Nonetheless, toavoid any confusion, we expressly disavow any language in10 See Detroit & Toledo Shore Line R. Co. v. Transportation Union, 396U. S. 142, 154-155 (1969) ("Where a condition is satisfactorily tolerable toboth sides, it is often omitted from the agreement, and it has been suggested that this practice is more frequent in the railroad industry thanin most others") (emphasis added); Consolidated Rail Corporation v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 491 U. S. 299, 311-312 (1989) (recognizingthat CBA's include implied terms arising from " `practice, usage and custom' "); see also Steelworkers v. Warrior & Gulf Nav. Co., 363 U. S. 574,578-579 (1960) (a CBA is "more than a contract; it is a generalized code togovern a myriad of cases which the draft[ers] cannot wholly anticipate").512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 512 U. S. 246 (1994)Opinion of the CourtBurley suggesting that minor disputes encompass state-lawclaims that exist independent of the CBA.Conrail, like Burley, involved no pre-emption analysis.The parties agreed that the dispute--a workers' challengeto the railroad's drug-testing policies--was governed by theRLA, because Conrail's policy of conducting physical exami-nations was an implied term of the CBA. 491 U. S., at 301.The only question before the Court was whether the employ-er's drug-testing policy constituted an attempt to add a newterm to the existing agreement, making it a major disputesubject to a "protracted process" of bargaining and mediation, id., at 303, or whether the testing reflected the employer's interpretation and application of an implied term of theexisting contract, producing a minor dispute subject to a lessonerous process of arbitration. We concluded that the dispute was minor, stating that "[t]he distinguishing featureof [a minor dispute] is that the dispute may be conclusivelyresolved by interpreting the existing [CBA]." Id., at 305,citing Garrison, The National Railroad Adjustment Board:A Unique Administrative Agency, 46 Yale L. J. 567, 568, 576(1937). Obviously, to say that a minor dispute can be "conclusively resolved" by interpreting the CBA is another wayof saying that the dispute does not involve rights that existindependent of the CBA.Petitioners, however, pin their hopes on the observationthat "[w]here an employer asserts a contractual right to takethe contested action, the ensuing dispute is minor if theaction is arguably justified by the terms of the parties'collective-bargaining agreement." 491 U. S., at 307 (emphasis added). They argue that this action involves a minordispute because the termination of respondent was "arguablyjustified" by the CBA's provision permitting termination for"just cause." This "arguably justified" standard, however,was employed only for policing the line between major andminor disputes. Recognizing that accepting a party's characterization of a dispute as "minor" ran the risk of under512us2$77F 01-08-98 12:21:28 PAGES OPINPGT266 HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. v. NORRISOpinion of the Courtcutting the RLA's prohibition "against unilateral impositionof new contractual terms," id., at 306, the Court held that adispute would be deemed minor only if there was a sincere,nonfrivolous argument that it turned on the application ofthe existing agreement, that is, if it was "arguably justified"by that agreement. Obviously, this test said nothing aboutthe threshold question whether the dispute was subject tothe RLA in the first place.IIIReturning to the action before us, the question underLingle is whether respondent's state-law wrongful-dischargeclaims are independent of the CBA. Petitioners argue thatresort to the CBA is necessary to determine whether re-spondent, in fact, was discharged. This argument is foreclosed by Lingle itself. Lingle teaches that the issue to bedecided in this action--whether the employer's actions makeout the element of discharge under Hawaii law--is a "purelyfactual questio[n]." 486 U. S., at 407.Nor are we persuaded by petitioners' contention that thestate tort claims require a determination whether the discharge, if any, was justified by respondent's failure to signthe maintenance record, as the CBA required him to do. Although such a determination would be required with regardto respondent's separate allegation of discharge in violationof the CBA, the District Court dismissed that count as pre-empted by the RLA, and respondent does not challenge thatdismissal. The state tort claims, by contrast, require onlythe purely factual inquiry into any retaliatory motive of theemployer.Accordingly, we agree with the Supreme Court of Hawaiithat respondent's claims for discharge in violation of publicpolicy and in violation of the Hawaii Whistleblower Protection Act are not pre-empted by the RLA, and we affirm thatcourt's judgment.
