In establishing a federal death penalty for certain drugoffenses under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, 21 U. S. C.$ 848(e), Congress created a statutory right to qualified legalrepresentation for capital defendants in federal habeas corpus proceedings. $ 848(q)(4)(B). This case presents thequestion whether a capital defendant must file a formal habeas corpus petition in order to invoke this statutory rightand to establish a federal court's jurisdiction to enter a stayof execution. IPetitioner Frank Basil McFarland was convicted of capitalmurder on November 13, 1989, in the State of Texas andsentenced to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appealsaffirmed the conviction and sentence, McFarland v. State,845 S. W. 2d 824 (1992), and on June 7, 1993, this Courtdenied certiorari. 508 U. S. 963. Two months later, on August 16, 1993, the Texas trial court scheduled McFarland'sexecution for September 23, 1993. On September 19, McFarland filed a pro se motion requesting that the trial courtstay or withdraw his execution date to allow the Texas Resource Center an opportunity to recruit volunteer counsel forhis state habeas corpus proceeding. Texas opposed a stayof execution, arguing that McFarland had not filed an appli-cation for writ of habeas corpus and that the court thuslacked jurisdiction to enter a stay. The trial court declinedto appoint counsel, but modified McFarland's execution dateto October 27, 1993.D. Preate, Jr., of Pennsylvania, Jeffrey B. Pine of Rhode Island, T.

SCOTTOpinion of the CourtOn October 16, 1993, the Resource Center informed thetrial court that it had been unable to recruit volunteer counsel and asked the court to appoint counsel for McFarland.Concluding that Texas law did not authorize the appointmentof counsel for state habeas corpus proceedings, the trialcourt refused either to appoint counsel or to modify petitioner's execution date. McFarland then filed a pro se motionin the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals requesting a stayand a remand for appointment of counsel. The court deniedthe motion without comment.Having failed to obtain either the appointment of counselor a modification of his execution date in state court, McFarland, on October 22, 1993, commenced the present action inthe United States District Court for the Northern Districtof Texas by filing a pro se motion stating that he "wish[ed]to challenge [his] conviction and sentence under [the federal habeas corpus statute,] 28 U. S. C. Sec. 2254." App. 42.McFarland requested the appointment of counsel under 21U. S. C. $ 848(q)(4)(B) and a stay of execution to give thatcounsel time to prepare and file a habeas corpus petition.11 Traditionally in Texas, capital defendants had invoked their federalright to appointed counsel by filing a perfunctory habeas corpus petition,often reciting a single claim. Texas customarily did not oppose a stayfollowing the filing of such a pro forma petition, and federal district courtsregularly granted a stay of execution under these circumstances and appointed counsel to file a legally sufficient habeas application. Tr. of OralArg. 32-33.In the month prior to McFarland's scheduled execution, however, a capital defendant facing imminent execution filed such a pro forma habeaspetition in District Court. Texas did not oppose the filing, but the District Court denied the stay and dismissed the skeletal petition on the merits. Gosch v. Collins, No. SA-93-CA-731 (WD Tex., Sept. 15, 1993). TheCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, Gosch v. Collins, 8 F. 3d20 (1993), cert. dism'd sub nom. Gosch v. Scott, post, p. 1216. Gosch thenfiled a subsequent, substantive habeas petition, which the District Courtdismissed as successive and abusive. Gosch v.

S. 849 (1994)Opinion of the CourtThe District Court denied McFarland's motion on October25, 1993, concluding that because no "post conviction proceeding" had been initiated pursuant to 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 or$ 2255, petitioner was not entitled to appointment of counseland the court lacked jurisdiction to enter a stay of execution.App. 77. The court later denied a certificate of probablecause to appeal.On October 26, the eve of McFarland's scheduled execution, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied hisapplication for stay. 7 F. 3d 47. The court noted that federal law expressly authorizes federal courts to stay stateproceedings while a federal habeas corpus proceeding ispending, 28 U. S. C. $ 2251, but held that no such proceedingwas pending, because a "motion for stay and for appointmentof counsel [is not] the equivalent of an application for habeasrelief." 7 F. 3d, at 49. The court concluded that any otherfederal judicial interference in state-court proceedings wasbarred by the Anti-Injunction Act, 28 U. S. C. $ 2283.Shortly before the Court of Appeals ruled, a Federal Mag-istrate Judge located an attorney willing to accept appointment in McFarland's case and suggested that if the attorneywould file a skeletal document entitled "petition for writ ofhabeas corpus," the District Court might be willing to ap-point him and grant McFarland a stay of execution. Theattorney accordingly drafted and filed a pro forma habeaspetition, together with a motion for stay of execution andappointment of counsel. As in the Gosch case, see n. 1,supra, despite the fact that Texas did not oppose a stay, theDistrict Court found the petition to be insufficient and deniedthe motion for stay on the merits. McFarland v. Collins,No. 4:93-CV-723-A (WD Tex., Oct. 26, 1993).On October 27, 1993, this Court granted a stay of execution in McFarland's original suit pending consideration ofreluctant to invoke their federal right to counsel by filing pro forma habeas petitions, given the substantial possibility that the petition might bedismissed on the merits, and that any habeas petition later filed would bedismissed summarily as an abuse of the writ.

S. 989 (1993), to resolve an apparent conflict with Brown v. Vasquez, 952 F. 2d 1164 (CA91991).IIASection 848(q)(4)(B) of Title 21 provides:"In any post conviction proceeding under section 2254or 2255 of title 28 seeking to vacate or set aside a deathsentence, any defendant who is or becomes financiallyunable to obtain adequate representation or investigative, expert, or other reasonably necessary servicesshall be entitled to the appointment of one or moreattorneys and the furnishing of such other servicesin accordance with paragraphs (5), (6), (7), (8), and (9)"(emphasis added).On its face, this statute grants indigent capital defendantsa mandatory right to qualified legal counsel2 and relatedservices "[i]n any [federal] post conviction proceeding."The express language does not specify, however, how acapital defendant's right to counsel in such a proceedingshall be invoked.Neither the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C.$ 2241et seq., nor the rules governing habeas corpus proceed-ings define a "post conviction proceeding" under $ 2254 or$ 2255 or expressly state how such a proceeding shall be com-menced.

S. 849 (1994)Opinion of the Courtvisions, however, indicates that the right to appointed coun-sel adheres prior to the filing of a formal, legally sufficienthabeas corpus petition. Section 848(q)(4)(B) expressly in-corporates 21 U. S. C. $ 848(q)(9), which entitles capital defendants to a variety of expert and investigative servicesupon a showing of necessity:"Upon a finding in ex parte proceedings that investi-gative, expert or other services are reasonably necessary for the representation of the defendant, . . . thecourtshall authorize the defendant's attorneys to obtainsuch services on behalf of the defendant and shall orderthe payment of fees and expenses therefore" (emphasisadded).The services of investigators and other experts may be critical in the preapplication phase of a habeas corpus proceeding, when possible claims and their factual bases are re-searched and identified. Section 848(q)(9) clearly anticipatesthat capital defense counsel will have been appointed under$ 848(q)(4)(B) before the need for such technical assistancearises, since the statute requires "the defendant's attorneys to obtain such services" from the court. $ 848(q)(9).In adopting $ 848(q)(4)(B), Congress thus established a rightto preapplication legal assistance for capital defendants infederal habeas corpus proceedings.This interpretation is the only one that gives meaning tothe statute as a practical matter. Congress' provision of aright to counsel under $ 848(q)(4)(B) reflects a determinationthat quality legal representation is necessary in capital habeas corpus proceedings in light of "the seriousness of thepossible penalty and . . . the unique and complex nature ofthe litigation." $ 848(q)(7). An attorney's assistance priorto the filing of a capital defendant's habeas corpus petition iscrucial, because "[t]he complexity of our jurisprudence in thisarea . . . makes it unlikely that capital defendants will be512us3$93f 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT856 McFARLAND v. SCOTTOpinion of the Courtable to file successful petitions for collateral relief withoutthe assistance of persons learned in the law." Murray v.Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1, 14 (1989) (Kennedy, J., joined byO'Connor, J., concurring in judgment); see also id., at 28(Stevens, J., joined by Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun,JJ., dissenting) ("[T]his Court's death penalty jurisprudenceunquestionably is difficult even for a trained lawyer tomaster").Habeas corpus petitions must meet heightened pleadingrequirements, see 28 U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 2(c), and complywith this Court's doctrines of procedural default and waiver,see Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991). Federalcourts are authorized to dismiss summarily any habeas petition that appears legally insufficient on its face, see 28U. S. C. $ 2254 Rule 4, and to deny a stay of execution wherea habeas petition fails to raise a substantial federal claim,see Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 894 (1983). Moreover,should a defendant's pro se petition be summarily dismissed,any petition subsequently filed by counsel could be subjectto dismissal as an abuse of the writ. See McCleskey v. Zant,499 U. S. 467, 494 (1991). Requiring an indigent capital petitioner to proceed without counsel in order to obtain counselthus would expose him to the substantial risk that his habeasclaims never would be heard on the merits. Congress legislated against this legal backdrop in adopting $ 848(q)(4)(B),and we safely assume that it did not intend for the expressrequirement of counsel to be defeated in this manner.The language and purposes of $ 848(q)(4)(B) and its relatedprovisions establish that the right to appointed counsel includes a right to legal assistance in the preparation of a habeas corpus application. We therefore conclude that a "postconviction proceeding" within the meaning of $ 848(q)(4)(B)is commenced by the filing of a death row defendant's motionrequesting the appointment of counsel for his federal habeas512us3$93f 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT857Cite as: 512 U. S. 849 (1994)Opinion of the Courtcorpus proceeding.3 McFarland filed such a motion and wasentitled to the appointment of a lawyer.BEven if the District Court had granted McFarland's motionfor appointment of counsel and had found an attorney to represent him, this appointment would have been meaninglessunless McFarland's execution also was stayed. We therefore turn to the question whether the District Court hadjurisdiction to grant petitioner's motion for stay.Federal courts cannot enjoin state-court proceedingsunless the intervention is authorized expressly by federalstatute or falls under one of two other exceptions to theAnti-Injunction Act. SeeMitchum v. Foster, 407 U. S. 225,226 (1972). The federal habeas corpus statute grants anyfederal judge "before whom a habeas corpus proceeding ispending" power to stay a state-court action "for any matterinvolved in the habeas corpus proceeding." 28 U. S. C.$ 2251 (emphasis added). McFarland argues that his requestfor counsel in a "post conviction proceeding" under $ 848(q)(4)(B) initiated a "habeas corpus proceeding" within themeaning of $ 2251, and that the District Court thus had jurisdiction to enter a stay. Texas contends, in turn, that evenif a "post conviction proceeding" under $ 848(q)(4)(B) can be3 Justice Thomas argues in dissent that reading $ 848(q)(4)(B) to allowthe initiation of a habeas corpus proceeding through the filing of a motionfor appointment of counsel ignores the fact that such proceedings traditionally have been commenced by the filing of a habeas corpus petitionand creates a divergent practice for capital defendants. Post, at 872, n. 3.As Justice O'Connor agrees, post, at 860, however, $ 848(q)(4)(B) bestows upon capital defendants a mandatory right to counsel, including aright to preapplication legal assistance, that is unknown to other criminaldefendants. Because noncapital defendants have no equivalent right tothe appointment of counsel in federal habeas corpus proceedings, it is notsurprising that their habeas corpus proceedings typically will be initiatedby the filing of a habeas corpus petition.512us3$93f 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT858 McFARLAND v. SCOTTOpinion of the Courttriggered by a death row defendant's request for appoint-ment of counsel, no "habeas corpus proceeding" is "pending"under $ 2251, and thus no stay can be entered, until a legallysufficient habeas petition is filed.The language of these two statutes indicates that the sections refer to the same proceeding. Section 848(q)(4)(B)expressly applies to "any post conviction proceeding undersection 2254 or 2255"--the precise "habeas corpus proceed-ing[s]" that $ 2251 involves. The terms "post conviction"and "habeas corpus" also are used interchangeably in legalparlance to refer to proceedings under $$ 2254 and 2255. Wethus conclude that the two statutes must be read in parimateria to provide that once a capital defendant invokes hisright to appointed counsel, a federal court also has jurisdiction under $ 2251 to enter a stay of execution. Because$ 2251 expressly authorizes federal courts to stay state-courtproceedings "for any matter involved in the habeas corpusproceeding," the exercise of this authority is not barred bythe Anti-Injunction Act.This conclusion by no means grants capital defendants aright to an automatic stay of execution. Section 2251 doesnot mandate the entry of a stay, but dedicates the exerciseof stay jurisdiction to the sound discretion of a federal court.Under ordinary circumstances, a capital defendant presumably will have sufficient time to request the appointment ofcounsel and file a formal habeas petition prior to his scheduled execution. But the right to counsel necessarily includes a right for that counsel meaningfully to research andpresent a defendant's habeas claims. Where this opportunity is not afforded, "[a]pproving the execution of a defendant before his [petition] is decided on the merits wouldclearly be improper." Barefoot, 463 U. S., at 889. On theother hand, if a dilatory capital defendant inexcusably ignores this opportunity and flouts the available processes, afederal court presumably would not abuse its discretion indenying a stay of execution.512us3$93f 12-28-97 17:28:51 PAGES OPINPGT859Cite as: 512 U. S. 849 (1994)Opinion of O'Connor, J.IIIA criminal trial is the "main event" at which a defendant'srights are to be determined, and the Great Writ is an extraordinary remedy that should not be employed to "relitigate state trials." Id., at 887. At the same time, criminaldefendants are entitled by federal law to challenge their conviction and sentence in habeas corpus proceedings. By providing indigent capital defendants with a mandatory rightto qualified legal counsel in these proceedings, Congress hasrecognized that federal habeas corpus has a particularly important role to play in promoting fundamental fairness in theimposition of the death penalty.We conclude that a capital defendant may invoke this rightto a counseled federal habeas corpus proceeding by filing amotion requesting the appointment of habeas counsel, andthat a district court has jurisdiction to enter a stay of execution where necessary to give effect to that statutory right.McFarland filed a motion for appointment of counsel and forstay of execution in this case, and the District Court hadauthority to grant the relief he sought.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
