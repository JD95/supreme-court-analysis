For more than a century, this Court consistently and re-peatedly has reaffirmed that racial discrimination by theState in jury selection offends the Equal Protection Clause.See,e. g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 (1880).Last Term this Court held that racial discrimination in a civillitigant's exercise of peremptory challenges also violates theEqual Protection Clause. See Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U. S. 614 (1991). Today, we are asked to decidewhether the Constitution prohibits acriminal defendantfrom engaging in purposeful racial discrimination in theexercise of peremptory challenges.IOn August 10, 1990, a grand jury sitting in DoughertyCounty, Ga., returned a six-count indictment charging respondents with aggravated assault and simple battery. SeeApp. 2. The indictment alleged that respondents beat andassaulted Jerry and Myra Collins. Respondents are white;the alleged victims are African-Americans. Shortly afterthe events, a leaflet was widely distributed in the localAfrican-American community reporting the assault andurging community residents not to patronize respondents'business.Before jury selection began, the prosecution moved to pro-hibit respondents from exercising peremptory challenges in*Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation by Kent Scheidegger and Charles L.

According to the State, counsel for re-spondents had indicated a clear intention to use peremptorystrikes in a racially discriminatory manner, arguing that thecircumstances of their case gave them the right to excludeAfrican-American citizens from participating as jurors in thetrial. Observing that 43 percent of the county's populationis African-American, the State contended that, if a statis-tically representative panel is assembled for jury selection,18 of the potential 42 jurors would be African-American.1With 20 peremptory challenges, respondents therefore wouldbe able to remove all the African-American potential jurors.2Relying onBatson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the SixthAmendment, and the Georgia Constitution, the State soughtan order providing that, if it succeeded in making out a primafacie case of racial discrimination by respondents, the latterwould be required to articulate a racially neutral explanationfor peremptory challenges.The trial judge denied the State's motion, holding that"[n]either Georgia nor federal law prohibits criminal defendants from exercising peremptory strikes in a racially dis-criminatory manner."

S.937 (1991). IIOver the last century, in an almost unbroken chain of deci-sions, this Court gradually has abolished race as a consideration for jury service. In Strauder v. West Virginia, 100U. S. 303 (1880), the Court invalidated a state statute providing that only white men could serve as jurors. While stat-ing that a defendant has no right to a "petit jury composedin whole or in part of persons of his own race," id., at 305,the Court held that a defendant does have the right to betried by a jury whose members are selected by nondiscrimi-natory criteria.

De Gross, 960 F. 2d 1433 (1992) (en banc). Although the panel decisionnow has been vacated by the granting of rehearing en banc, a Fifth Circuitpanel has held that criminal defendants may not exercise peremptorystrikes in a racially discriminatory manner.

Alabama, 294 U. S. 587, 599 (1935)(State cannot exclude African-Americans from jury venireon false assumption that they, as a group, are not qualifiedto serve as jurors).In Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), the Court wasconfronted with the question whether an African-Americandefendant was denied equal protection by the State's exercise of peremptory challenges to exclude members of his racefrom the petit jury. Id., at 209-210. Although the Courtrejected the defendant's attempt to establish an equal protection claim premised solely on the pattern of jury strikesin his own case, it acknowledged that proof of systematicexclusion of African-Americans through the use of peremptories over a period of time might establish such a violation.Id., at 224-228.In Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986), the Court discarded Swain's evidentiary formulation. The Batson Courtheld that a defendant may establish a prima facie case ofpurposeful discrimination in selection of the petit jury basedsolely on the prosecutor's exercise of peremptory challengesat the defendant's trial. Id., at 87. "Once the defendantmakes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the Stateto come forward with a neutral explanation for challengingblack jurors." Id., at 97.4Last Term this Court applied the Batson framework intwo other contexts. In Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400 (1991),it held that in the trial of a white criminal defendant, a prosecutor is prohibited from excluding African-American jurors4 The Batson majority specifically reserved the issue before us today.476 U. S., at 89, n. 12. The two Batson dissenters, however, argued thatthe "clear and inescapable import" was that Batson would similarly limitdefendants. Id., at 125-126. Justice Marshall agreed, stating: "[O]urcriminal justice system `requires not only freedom from any bias againstthe accused, but also from any prejudice against his prosecution.

S. 614 (1991), the Court decided that in a civil case,private litigants cannot exercise their peremptory strikes ina racially discriminatory manner.5In deciding whether the Constitution prohibits criminaldefendants from exercising racially discriminatory peremptory challenges, we must answer four questions. First,whether a criminal defendant's exercise of peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner inflicts the harmsaddressed byBatson. Second, whether the exercise ofperemptory challenges by a criminal defendant constitutesstate action. Third, whether prosecutors have standing toraise this constitutional challenge. And fourth, whether theconstitutional rights of a criminal defendant nonetheless pre-clude the extension of our precedents to this case.IIIAThe majority in Powers recognized that "Batson `was de-signed "to serve multiple ends," ' only one of which was toprotect individual defendants from discrimination in the se-lection of jurors." 499 U. S., at 406. As in Powers and Edmonson, the extension of Batson in this context is designedto remedy the harm done to the "dignity of persons" and tothe "integrity of the courts." Powers, 499 U. S., at 402.As long ago asStrauder, this Court recognized that deny-ing a person participation in jury service on account of hisrace unconstitutionally discriminates against the excludedjuror. 100 U.

S., at 87.While "[a]n individual juror does not have a right to sit onany particular petit jury, . . . he or she does possess the rightnot to be excluded from one on account of race." Powers,5 In his dissent in Edmonson, Justice Scalia stated that the effect ofthat decision logically must apply to defendants in criminal prosecutions.500 U.

Regardless of who invokes the discrimina-tory challenge, there can be no doubt that the harm is thesame--in all cases, the juror is subjected to open and publicracial discrimination.But "[t]he harm from discriminatory jury selection extendsbeyond that inflicted on the defendant and the excluded jurorto touch the entire community."Batson, 476 U. S., at 87.One of the goals of our jury system is "to impress upon thecriminal defendant and the community as a whole that a verdict of conviction or acquittal is given in accordance withthe law by persons who are fair."Powers, 499 U. S., at 413.Selection procedures that purposefully exclude AfricanAmericans from juries undermine that public confidence--aswell they should. "The overt wrong, often apparent to theentire jury panel, casts doubt over the obligation of the parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the lawthroughout the trial of the cause." Id., at 412. See generally Underwood, Ending Race Discrimination in Jury Selection: Whose Right Is It, Anyway?, 92 Colum. L. Rev. 725,748-750 (1992).The need for public confidence is especially high in casesinvolving race-related crimes. In such cases, emotions inthe affected community will inevitably be heated and volatile. Public confidence in the integrity of the criminal justice system is essential for preserving community peace intrials involving race-related crimes. See Alschuler, The Supreme Court and the Jury: Voir Dire, Peremptory Challenges, and the Review of Jury Verdicts, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev.153, 195-196 (1989) (describing two trials in Miami, Fla., inwhich all African-American jurors were peremptorily struckby white defendants accused of racial beating, and the publicoutrage and riots that followed the defendants' acquittal)."[B]e it at the hands of the State or the defense," if a courtallows jurors to be excluded because of group bias, "[it] is [a]willing participant in a scheme that could only underminethe very foundation of our system of justice--our citizens'505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:54 PAGES OPINPGT50 GEORGIA v. McCOLLUMOpinion of the Courtconfidence in it." State v. Alvarado, 221 N. J. Super. 324,328, 534 A. 2d 440, 442 (1987). Just as public confidence incriminal justice is undermined by a conviction in a trialwhere racial discrimination has occurred in jury selection, sois public confidence undermined where a defendant, assistedby racially discriminatory peremptory strikes, obtains anacquittal.6BThe fact that a defendant's use of discriminatory peremptory challenges harms the jurors and the community doesnot end our equal protection inquiry. Racial discrimination,although repugnant in all contexts, violates the Constitutiononly when it is attributable to state action. See MooseLodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 172 (1972). Thus, thesecond question that must be answered is whether a criminaldefendant's exercise of a peremptory challenge constitutesstate action for purposes of the Equal Protection Clause.Until Edmonson, the cases decided by this Court that presented the problem of racially discriminatory peremptorychallenges involved assertions of discrimination by a prosecutor, a quintessential state actor. In Edmonson, by contrast, the contested peremptory challenges were exercisedby a private defendant in a civil action. In order to determine whether state action was present in that setting, the6 The experience of many state jurisdictions has led to the recognitionthat a race-based peremptory challenge, regardless of who exercises it,harms not only the challenged juror, but the entire community. Actingpursuant to their state constitutions, state courts have ruled that criminaldefendants have no greater license to violate the equal protection rightsof prospective jurors than have prosecutors. See, e. g., State v. Levinson,71 Haw. 492, 795 P. 2d 845 (1990); People v. Kern, 149 App. Div. 2d 187,545 N. Y. S. 2d 4 (1989), aff'd, 75 N. Y. 2d 638, 555 N. Y. S. 2d 647 (1990);State v.

S. 42 (1992)Opinion of the CourtCourt in Edmonson used the analytical framework summa-rized in Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922 (1982).7The first inquiry is "whether the claimed [constitutional]deprivation has resulted from the exercise of a right or privilege having its source in state authority." Id., at 939."There can be no question" that peremptory challenges satisfy this first requirement, as they "are permitted only whenthe government, by statute or decisional law, deems it appropriate to allow parties to exclude a given number of personswho otherwise would satisfy the requirements for service onthe petit jury." Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 620. As in Edmonson, a Georgia defendant's right to exercise peremptorychallenges and the scope of that right are established by aprovision of state law. Ga. Code Ann. $ 15-12-165 (1990).The second inquiry is whether the private party chargedwith the deprivation can be described as a state actor. SeeLugar, 457 U. S., at 941-942. In resolving that issue, theCourt in Edmonson found it useful to apply three principles:(1) "the extent to which the actor relies on governmentalassistance and benefits"; (2) "whether the actor is performinga traditional governmental function"; and (3) "whether theinjury caused is aggravated in a unique way by the incidentsof governmental authority." 500 U. S., at 621-622.As to the first principle, theEdmonson Court found thatthe peremptory challenge system, as well as the jury system as a whole, "simply could not exist" without the "overt,significant participation of the government."Id., at 622.Georgia provides for the compilation of jury lists by theboard of jury commissioners in each county and establishesthe general criteria for service and the sources for creatinga pool of qualified jurors representing a fair cross section ofthe community. Ga. Code Ann. $ 15-12-40. State law fur7 The Court in Lugar held that a private litigant is appropriately characterized as a state actor when he "jointly participates" with state officialsin securing the seizure of property in which the private party claims tohave rights. 457 U. S., at 932-933, 941-942.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:54 PAGES OPINPGT52 GEORGIA v. McCOLLUMOpinion of the Courtther provides that jurors are to be selected by a specifiedprocess, $ 15-12-42; they are to be summoned to court underthe authority of the State, $ 15-12-120; and they are to bepaid an expense allowance by the State whether or not theyserve on a jury, $ 15-12-9. At court, potential jurors areplaced in panels in order to facilitate examination by counsel,$ 15-12-131; they are administered an oath, $ 15-12-132; theyare questioned on voir dire to determine whether they areimpartial, $ 15-12-164; and they are subject to challenge forcause, $ 15-12-163.In light of these procedures, the defendant in a Georgiacriminal case relies on "governmental assistance and benefits" that are equivalent to those found in the civil contextin Edmonson. "By enforcing a discriminatory peremptorychallenge, the Court `has . . . elected to place its power,property and prestige behind the [alleged] discrimination.' "Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 624 (citation omitted).In regard to the second principle, the Court in Edmonsonfound that peremptory challenges perform a traditional function of the government: "Their sole purpose is to permitlitigants to assist the government in the selection of an impartial trier of fact." Id., at 620. And, as the EdmonsonCourt recognized, the jury system in turn "performs the critical governmental functions of guarding the rights of litigants and `ensur[ing] continued acceptance of the laws by allof the people' " Id., at 624 (citation omitted). These sameconclusions apply with even greater force in the criminal context because the selection of a jury in a criminal case fulfillsa unique and constitutionally compelled governmental function. Compare Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968)(making Sixth Amendment applicable to States throughFourteenth Amendment), with Minneapolis & St. Louis R.Co. v. Bombolis, 241 U. S. 211 (1916) (States do not have aconstitutional obligation to provide a jury trial in civil cases).Cf. West v. Atkins, 487 U. S. 42, 53, n. 10, 57 (1988) (private505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT53Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992)Opinion of the Courtphysician hired by State to provide medical care to prisonerswas state actor because doctor was hired to fulfill State'sconstitutional obligation to attend to necessary medical careof prison inmates). The State cannot avoid its constitutionalresponsibilities by delegating a public function to privateparties. Cf.Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461 (1953) (privatepolitical party's determination of qualifications for primaryvoters held to constitute state action).Finally, the Edmonson Court indicated that the courtroomsetting in which the peremptory challenge is exercised inten-sifies the harmful effects of the private litigant's discriminatory act and contributes to its characterization as state ac-tion. These concerns are equally present in the context ofa criminal trial. Regardless of who precipitated the jurors'removal, the perception and the reality in a criminal trialwill be that the court has excused jurors based on race, anoutcome that will be attributed to the State.8Respondents nonetheless contend that the adversarial re-lationship between the defendant and the prosecution negates the governmental character of the peremptory chal-lenge. Respondents rely onPolk County v. Dodson, 454U. S. 312 (1981), in which a defendant sued, under 42 U. S. C.$ 1983, the public defender who represented him. The de-fendant claimed that the public defender had violated hisconstitutional rights in failing to provide adequate represen-tation. This Court determined that a public defender doesnot qualify as a state actor when engaged in his general rep-resentation of a criminal defendant.98 Indeed, it is common practice not to reveal the identity of the challenging party to the jurors and potential jurors, thus enhancing the perceptionthat it is the court that has rejected them. See Underwood, Ending RaceDiscrimination in Jury Selection: Whose Right Is It, Anyway?, 92 Colum.L. Rev. 725, 751, n. 117 (1992).9 Although Polk County determined whether or not the public defender's actions were under color of state law, as opposed to whether or notthey constituted state action, this Court subsequently has held that the505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT54 GEORGIA v. McCOLLUMOpinion of the CourtPolk County did not hold that the adversarial relationshipof a public defender with the State precludes a findingof state action--it held that this adversarial relationshipprevented the attorney's public employment from alonebeing sufficient to support a finding of state action. In-stead, the determination whether a public defender is a stateactor for a particular purpose depends on the nature andcontext of the function he is performing. For example, inBranti v. Finkel, 445 U. S. 507 (1980), this Court held thata public defender, in making personnel decisions on behalfof the State, is a state actor who must comply with consti-tutional requirements. And thePolk County Court itselfnoted, without deciding, that a public defender may actunder color of state law while performing certain administra-tive, and possibly investigative, functions. See 454 U. S., at325.The exercise of a peremptory challenge differs significantly from other actions taken in support of a defendant'sdefense. In exercising a peremptory challenge, a criminaldefendant is wielding the power to choose a quintessentialgovernmental body--indeed, the institution of governmenton which our judicial system depends. Thus, as we held inEdmonson, when "a government confers on a private bodythe power to choose the government's employees or officials,the private body will be bound by the constitutional mandateof race neutrality." 500 U. S., at 625.Lastly, the fact that a defendant exercises a peremptorychallenge to further his interest in acquittal does not conflictwith a finding of state action. Whenever a private actor'sconduct is deemed "fairly attributable" to the government, itis likely that private motives will have animated the actor'sdecision. Indeed, in Edmonson, the Court recognized thatthe private party's exercise of peremptory challenges constitwo inquiries are the same, see, e. g., Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U. S. 830,838 (1982), and has specifically extended Polk County's reasoning to stateaction cases, see Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U. S. 991, 1009, n. 20 (1982).505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT55Cite as: 505 U.

See id., at 626.10CHaving held that a defendant's discriminatory exercise ofa peremptory challenge is a violation of equal protection, wemove to the question whether the State has standing to chal-lenge a defendant's discriminatory use of peremptory challenges. In Powers, 499 U. S., at 416, this Court held thata white criminal defendant has standing to raise the equalprotection rights of black jurors wrongfully excluded fromjury service. While third-party standing is a limited exception, the Powers Court recognized that a litigant may raisea claim on behalf of a third party if the litigant can demonstrate that he has suffered a concrete injury, that he has aclose relation to the third party, and that there exists somehindrance to the third party's ability to protect its own in-terests.Id., at 411. In Edmonson, the Court applied thesame analysis in deciding that civil litigants had standing toraise the equal protection rights of jurors excluded on thebasis of their race.In applying the first prong of its standing analysis, thePowers Court found that a criminal defendant suffered cog10 Numerous commentators similarly have concluded that a defendant'sexercise of peremptory challenges constitutes state action.

S., at 411 (citation omitted). In Edmonson, thisCourt found that these harms were not limited to the criminal sphere. 500 U. S., at 630. Surely, a State suffers a similar injury when the fairness and integrity of its own judicialprocess is undermined.In applying the second prong of its standing analysis, thePowers Court held that voir dire permits a defendant to"establish a relation, if not a bond of trust, with the jurors,"a relation that "continues throughout the entire trial." 499U. S., at 413. "Exclusion of a juror on the basis of racesevers that relation in an invidious way." Edmonson, 500U. S., at 629.The State's relation to potential jurors in this case is closerthan the relationships approved in Powers and Edmonson.As the representative of all its citizens, the State is the logical and proper party to assert the invasion of the constitutional rights of the excluded jurors in a criminal trial. Indeed, the Fourteenth Amendment forbids the State to denypersons within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws.In applying the final prong of its standing analysis, thePowers Court recognized that, although individuals excludedfrom jury service on the basis of race have a right to bringsuit on their own behalf, the "barriers to a suit by an excluded juror are daunting." 499 U. S., at 414. See alsoEdmonson, 500 U. S., at 629. The barriers are no less formidable in this context. See Note, Discrimination by the Defense: Peremptory Challenges after Batson v. Kentucky, 88Colum. L. Rev. 355, 367 (1988); Underwood, 92 Colum. L.Rev., at 757 (summarizing barriers to suit by excluded juror).Accordingly, we hold that the State has standing to assertthe excluded jurors' rights.505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT57Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992)Opinion of the CourtDThe final question is whether the interests served by Batson must give way to the rights of a criminal defendant. Asa preliminary matter, it is important to recall that peremptory challenges are not constitutionally protected fundamental rights; rather, they are but one state-created means tothe constitutional end of an impartial jury and a fair trial.This Court repeatedly has stated that the right to a peremptory challenge may be withheld altogether without impairingthe constitutional guarantee of an impartial jury and a fairtrial. See Frazier v. United States, 335 U. S. 497, 505, n. 11(1948); United States v. Wood, 299 U. S. 123, 145 (1936); Stilson v. United States, 250 U. S. 583, 586 (1919); see also Swain,380 U. S., at 219.Yet in Swain, the Court reviewed the "very old credentials," id., at 212, of the peremptory challenge and noted the"long and widely held belief that the peremptory challengeis a necessary part of trial by jury," id., at 219; see id., at212-219. This Court likewise has recognized that "the roleof litigants in determining the jury's composition providesone reason for wide acceptance of the jury system and of itsverdicts." Edmonson, 500 U. S., at 630.We do not believe that this decision will undermine thecontribution of the peremptory challenge to the administration of justice. Nonetheless, "if race stereotypes are theprice for acceptance of a jury panel as fair," we reaffirmtoday that such a "price is too high to meet the standard ofthe Constitution." Id., at 630. Defense counsel is limitedto "legitimate, lawful conduct." Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U. S.157, 166 (1986) (defense counsel does not render ineffectiveassistance when he informs his client that he would disclosethe client's perjury to the court and move to withdraw fromrepresentation).

McCOLLUMOpinion of the CourtNor does a prohibition of the exercise of discriminatoryperemptory challenges violate a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel. Counselcan ordinarily explain the reasons for peremptory challengeswithout revealing anything about trial strategy or any confidential client communications. In the rare case in whichthe explanation for a challenge would entail confidential communications or reveal trial strategy, an in camera discussioncan be arranged. SeeUnited States v. Zolin, 491 U. S. 554(1989); cf. Batson, 476 U. S., at 97 (expressing confidence thattrial judges can develop procedures to implement the Court'sholding). In any event, neither the Sixth Amendment rightnor the attorney-client privilege gives a criminal defendantthe right to carry out through counsel an unlawful course ofconduct. See Nix, 475 U. S., at 166; Zolin, 491 U. S., at 562-563. See Swift, Defendants, Racism and the PeremptoryChallenge, 22 Colum. Hum. Rights L. Rev. 177, 207-208(1991).Lastly, a prohibition of the discriminatory exercise ofperemptory challenges does not violate a defendant's SixthAmendment right to a trial by an impartial jury. The goalof the Sixth Amendment is "jury impartiality with respectto both contestants." Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 483(1990). See also Hayes v. Missouri, 120 U. S. 68 (1887).We recognize, of course, that a defendant has the right toan impartial jury that can view him without racial animus,which so long has distorted our system of criminal justice.We have, accordingly, held that there should be a mechanismfor removing those on the venire whom the defendant hasspecific reason to believe would be incapable of confrontingand suppressing their racism. See Ham v. South Carolina,409 U. S. 524, 526-527 (1973); Rosales-Lopez v. United States,451 U. S. 182, 189-190 (1981) (plurality opinion of White, J.).Cf. Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U. S. 719 (1992) (exclusion of jurorin capital trial is permissible upon showing that juror is incapable of considering sentences other than death).505us1$95H 07-15-96 22:54:55 PAGES OPINPGT59Cite as: 505 U. S. 42 (1992)Rehnquist, C. J., concurringBut there is a distinction between exercising a peremptorychallenge to discriminate invidiously against jurors on account of race and exercising a peremptory challenge to remove an individual juror who harbors racial prejudice. ThisCourt firmly has rejected the view that assumptions of partiality based on race provide a legitimate basis for disqualifying a person as an impartial juror. As this Court stated justlast Term in Powers, "[w]e may not accept as a defense toracial discrimination the very stereotype the law condemns."499 U. S., at 410. "In our heterogeneous society policy aswell as constitutional considerations militate against the divisive assumption--as a per se rule--that justice in a courtof law may turn upon the pigmentation of skin, the accidentof birth, or the choice of religion." Ristaino v. Ross, 424U. S. 589, 596, n. 8 (1976). We therefore reaffirm today thatthe exercise of a peremptory challenge must not be based oneither the race of the juror or the racial stereotypes held bythe party.IVWe hold that the Constitution prohibits a criminal defendant from engaging in purposeful discrimination on theground of race in the exercise of peremptory challenges.Accordingly, if the State demonstrates a prima facie case ofracial discrimination by the defendants, the defendants mustarticulate a racially neutral explanation for peremptory challenges. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia isreversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedingsnot inconsistent with this opinion.
