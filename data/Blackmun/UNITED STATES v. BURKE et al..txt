BURKEOpinion of the CourtRespondents filed claims for refund of the taxes withheldfrom the settlement payments. The Internal RevenueService (IRS) disallowed those claims. Respondents thenbrought a refund action in the United States District Courtfor the Eastern District of Tennessee, claiming that the set-tlement payments should be excluded from their respectivegross incomes under $ 104(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue Codeas "damages received (whether by suit or agreement andwhether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on accountof personal injuries or sickness." The District Court ruledthat, because respondents sought and obtained only backwages due them as a result of TVA's discriminatory underpayments rather than compensatory or other damages, thesettlement proceeds could not be excluded from gross incomeas "damages received . . . on account of personal injuries."90-1 USTC || 50,203 (1990).The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,by a divided vote, reversed. 929 F. 2d 1119 (1991). TheCourt of Appeals concluded that exclusion under $ 104(a)(2)turns on whether the injury and the claim are "personal andtort-like in nature." Id., at 1121. "If the answer is in theaffirmative," the court held, "then that is the beginning andend of the inquiry." Id., at 1123 (internal quotation marksomitted). The court concluded that TVA's unlawful sexdiscrimination constituted a personal, tort-like injury torespondents, and rejected the Government's attempt todistinguish Title VII, which authorizes no compensatory orpunitive damages,2 from other statutes thought to redresspersonal injuries. See id., at 1121-1123. Thus, the courtheld, the award of backpay pursuant to Title VII was excludable from gross income under $ 104(a)(2).ment"). Hence, we confine our analysis in this case to the federal incometax question.2 The Civil Rights Act of 1991 recently amended Title VII to authorizethe recovery of compensatory and punitive damages in certain circumstances.

S. 229 (1992)Opinion of the CourtThe dissent in the Court of Appeals, 929 F. 2d, at 1124,took the view that the settlement of respondents' claims forearned but unpaid wage differentials--wages that wouldhave been paid and would have been subjected to tax absentTVA's unlawful discrimination--did not constitute compensa-tion for "loss due to a tort," as required under $ 104(a)(2).See id., at 1126.We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among theCourts of Appeals concerning the exclusion of Title VIIbackpay awards from gross income under $ 104(a)(2).3 502U. S. 806 (1991). IIAThe definition of gross income under the Internal RevenueCode sweeps broadly. Section 61(a), 26 U. S. C. $ 61(a), provides that "gross income means all income from whateversource derived," subject only to the exclusions specificallyenumerated elsewhere in the Code. As this Court has rec-ognized, Congress intended through $ 61(a) and its statutoryprecursors to exert "the full measure of its taxing power,"Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 334 (1940), and to bringwithin the definition of income any "accessio[n] to wealth."Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U. S. 426, 431(1955). There is no dispute that the settlement awards inthis case would constitute gross income within the reach of$ 61(a). See Brief for Respondents 9-10.The question, however, is whether the awards qualify forspecial exclusion from gross income under $ 104(a), which3 Compare the Sixth Circuit's opinion in this case with Sparrow v. Commissioner, 292 U. S. App. D. C. 259, 949 F. 2d 434 (1991) (Title VII backpayawards not excludable), and Thompson v. Commissioner, 866 F. 2d 709(CA4 1989) (same). See also Johnston v. Harris County Flood ControlDist., 869 F. 2d 1565, 1579-1580 (CA5 1989) (noting, for purposes of districtcourt consideration of tax liability in computing damages, that Title VIIbackpay awards may not be excluded under $ 104(a)(2)), cert. denied, 493U.

SeeThrelkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C. 1294,1305 (1986) ("The essential element of an exclusion undersection 104(a)(2) is that the income involved must derivefrom some sort of tort claim against the payor. . . . As aresult, common law tort law concepts are helpful in decidingwhether a taxpayer is being compensated for a `personal injury' ") (internal quotation marks omitted), aff 'd, 848 F. 2d81 (CA6 1988).A "tort" has been defined broadly as a "civil wrong, otherthan breach of contract, for which the court will provide aremedy in the form of an action for damages." See W. Kee-ton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton onthe Law of Torts 2 (1984). Remedial principles thus figureprominently in the definition and conceptualization of torts.4 Section 104, entitled "Compensation for injuries or sickness," providessimilar exclusions from gross income for amounts received for personalinjuries or sickness under worker's compensation programs ($ 104(a)(1)),accident or health insurance ($ 104(a)(3)), and certain federal pension programs ($ 104(a)(4)).5 See, e. g., H.

Indeed,one of the hallmarks of traditional tort liability is the avail-ability of a broad range of damages to compensate the plaintiff "fairly for injuries caused by the violation of his legalrights."Carey v. Piphus, 435 U. S. 247, 257 (1978). Al-though these damages often are described in compensatoryterms, see Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura,477 U.

See Dobbs, at 540-551; Threlkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C., at 1300.

L.Rev. 13, 21 (1989).Congress' 1989 amendment to $ 104(a)(2) provides further support forthe notion that "personal injuries" includes physical as well as nonphysicalinjuries. Congress rejected a bill that would have limited the $ 104(a)(2)exclusion to cases involving "physical injury or physical sickness." SeeH. R. Rep. No. 101-247, pp. 1354-1355 (1989) (describing proposed $ 11641of H. R. 3299, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989)). At the same time, Congressamended $ 104(a) to allow the exclusion of punitive damages only incases involving "physical injury or physical sickness." Pub. L. 101-239,$ 7641(a), 103 Stat. 2379, 26 U. S. C. $ 104(a) (1988 ed., Supp. I). The enactment of this limited amendment addressing only punitive damages showsthat Congress assumed that other damages (i. e., compensatory) would beexcluded in cases of both physical and nonphysical injury.Notwithstanding Justice Scalia's contention in his separate opinionthat the term "personal injuries" must be read as limited to "health"-related injuries, see post, at 244, the foregoing authorities establish that$ 104(a)(2) in fact encompasses a broad range of physical and nonphysicalinjuries to personal interests. Justice Scalia implicitly acknowledgesthat the plain meaning of the statutory phrase can support this wellestablished view.

Furthermore, punitive or exemplary damages aregenerally available in those instances where the defendant'smisconduct was intentional or reckless. See id., at 204-208;Molzof v. United States, supra.We thus agree with the Court of Appeals' analysis insofaras it focused, for purposes of $ 104(a)(2), on the nature of theclaim underlying respondents' damages award. See 929 F.2d, at 1121; Threlkeld v. Commissioner, 87 T. C., at 1305.Respondents, for their part, agree that this is the appropriate inquiry, as does the dissent. See Brief for Respond-ents 9-12;post, at 250.7 In order to come within the$ 104(a)(2) income exclusion, respondents therefore mustshow that Title VII, the legal basis for their recovery ofbackpay, redresses a tort-like personal injury in accord withthe foregoing principles. We turn next to this inquiry.BTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 8 makes it an un-lawful employment practice for an employer "to discriminateagainst any individual with respect to his compensation,terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of7 The dissent nonetheless contends that we "misapprehen[d] the natureof the inquiry required by $ 104(a)(2) and the IRS regulation" by "[f]ocusing on [the] remedies" available under Title VII. See post, at 249-250.As discussed above, however, the concept of a "tort" is inextricably boundup with remedies--specifically damages actions. Thus, we believe thatconsideration of the remedies available under Title VII is critical in determining the "nature of the statute" and the "type of claim" brought byrespondents for purposes of $ 104(a)(2). See post, at 250.8 As discussed below, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub. L. 102-166, 105Stat. 1071, amended Title VII in significant respects. Respondents do notcontend that these amendments apply to this case. See Tr. of Oral Arg.35-36. We therefore examine the law as it existed prior to November 21,1991, the effective date of the 1991 Act. See Pub. L. 102-166, $ 402(a), 105Stat. 1099.

If administrative remedies areunsuccessful, an aggrieved employee may file suit in a dis-trict court, $ 2000e-5(f )(1), although the Courts of Appealshave held that Title VII plaintiffs, unlike ordinary tort plaintiffs, are not entitled to a jury trial. See, e. g., Johnson v.Georgia Highway Express, Inc., 417 F. 2d 1122, 1125 (CA51969). See also Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S. 189, 192-193(1974) (describing availability of jury trials for common-lawforms of action); id., at 196-197, n. 13 (citing Title VII cases).If the court finds that the employer has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, it may enjoin the practice and"order such affirmative action as may be appropriate, whichmay include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring ofemployees, with or without back pay . . . or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate." $ 2000e-5(g).It is beyond question that discrimination in employmenton the basis of sex, race, or any of the other classificationsprotected by Title VII is, as respondents argue and thisCourt consistently has held, an invidious practice that causesgrave harm to its victims. See Brief for Respondents35-39; Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U. S. 424 (1971). Thefact that employment discrimination causes harm to individuals does not automatically imply, however, that there existsa tort-like "personal injury" for purposes of federal incometax law.Indeed, in contrast to the tort remedies for physical andnonphysical injuries discussed above, Title VII does notallow awards for compensatory or punitive damages; instead,it limits available remedies to backpay, injunctions, and otherequitable relief. See $ 2000e-5(g); Patterson v. McLeanCredit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 182, n. 4 (1989) (noting thata plaintiff in a Title VII action is "limited to a recoveryof backpay"); Great American Fed.

An employee wrongfully dis-charged on the basis of sex thus may recover only an amountequal to the wages the employee would have earned fromthe date of discharge to the date of reinstatement, along withlost fringe benefits such as vacation pay and pension bene-fits;9 similarly, an employee wrongfully denied a promotionon the basis of sex, or, as in this case, wrongfully discrimi-nated against in salary on the basis of sex, may recover onlythe differential between the appropriate pay and actual payfor services performed, as well as lost benefits.The Court previously has observed that Title VII focuseson "legal injuries of an economic character," seeAlbemarlePaper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975), consisting specifically of the unlawful deprivation of full wages earned ordue for services performed, or the unlawful deprivation ofthe opportunity to earn wages through wrongful termina-tion. The remedy, correspondingly, consists of restoringvictims, through backpay awards and injunctive relief, to thewage and employment positions they would have occupiedabsent the unlawful discrimination. See id., at 421 (citing118 Cong. Rec. 7168 (1972)). Nothing in this remedialscheme purports to recompense a Title VII plaintiff for anyof the other traditional harms associated with personal injury, such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, harm toreputation, or other consequential damages (e. g., a ruinedcredit rating). See Walker v. Ford Motor Co., 684 F. 2d1355, 1364-1365, n. 16 (CA11 1982).No doubt discrimination could constitute a "personal in-jury" for purposes of $ 104(a)(2) if the relevant cause of actionevidenced a tort-like conception of injury and remedy. Cf.Curtis v. Loether, 415 U. S., at 195-196, n. 10 (noting that"under the logic of the common law development of a law of9 Some courts have allowed Title VII plaintiffs who were wrongfullydischarged and for whom reinstatement was not feasible to recover "frontpay" or future lost earnings.

BURKEOpinion of the Courtinsult and indignity, racial discrimination might be treatedas a dignitary tort" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, the circumscribed remedies available under Title VIIstand in marked contrast not only to those available undertraditional tort law, but under other federal antidiscrimination statutes, as well.10 For example, Rev. Stat. $ 1977, 42U. S. C. $ 1981, permits victims of race-based employmentdiscrimination to obtain a jury trial at which "both equitableand legal relief, including compensatory and, under certaincircumstances, punitive damages" may be awarded. Johnson v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 421 U. S. 454, 460(1975). The Court similarly has observed that Title VIII ofthe Civil Rights Act of 1968, whose fair housing provisionsallow for jury trials and for awards of compensatory and punitive damages, "sounds basically in tort" and "contrastssharply" with the relief available under Title VII. Curtis v.Loether, 415 U. S., at 195, 197; 42 U. S. C. $ 3613(c).1110 Title VII's remedial scheme was expressly modeled on the backpayprovision of the National Labor Relations Act. See Albemarle Paper Co.v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 419-420, and n. 11 (1975); 29 U. S. C. $ 160(c)(Board shall order persons to "cease and desist" from unfair labor practicesand to take "affirmative action including reinstatement of employees withor without back pay"). This Court previously has held that backpayawarded under the Labor Act to an unlawfully discharged employee constitutes "wages" for purposes of the Social Security Act. See Social Security Board v. Nierotko, 327 U. S. 358 (1946).11 Respondents' attempts to prove that Title VII redresses a personalinjury by relying on this Court's characterizations of other antidiscrimination statutes are thus unpersuasive in light of those statutes' differingremedial schemes. For example, respondents' reliance on Goodman v.Lukens Steel Co., 482 U. S. 656 (1987), is misplaced, as that case involvedthe interpretation of $ 1981. See Brief for Respondents 35-37. Respondents' attempt to apply the Court's statement in Curtis v. Loether, 415U. S., at 195, that Title VIII "sounds basically in tort" to the Title VIIcontext similarly fails. See Brief for Respondents 32. Indeed, Curtisitself distinguishes Title VII from Title VIII on a host of differentgrounds. See 415 U. S., at 196-197.

S. 229 (1992)Opinion of the CourtNotwithstanding a common-law tradition of broad tortdamages and the existence of other federal antidiscrimination statutes offering similarly broad remedies, Congress declined to recompense Title VII plaintiffs for anything beyondthe wages properly due them--wages that, if paid in the ordinary course, would have been fully taxable. See L. Frolik,Federal Tax Aspects of Injury, Damage, and Loss 70 (1987).Thus, we cannot say that a statute such as Title VII,12 whosesole remedial focus is the award of back wages, redresses atort-like personal injury within the meaning of $ 104(a)(2)and the applicable regulations.13those involving other federal antidiscrimination statutes for purposes of$ 104(a)(2). See post, at 250-252.12 Respondents contend that Congress' recent expansion of Title VII'sremedial scope supports their argument that Title VII claims are inherently tort-like in nature. See Brief for Respondents 34. Under the CivilRights Act of 1991, victims of intentional discrimination are entitled to ajury trial, at which they may recover compensatory damages for "futurepecuniary losses, emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, mental anguish,loss of enjoyment of life, and other nonpecuniary losses," as well as punitive damages. See Pub. L. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1073. Unlike respondents,however, we believe that Congress' decision to permit jury trials and compensatory and punitive damages under the amended Act signals a markedchange in its conception of the injury redressable by Title VII, and cannotbe imported back into analysis of the statute as it existed at the time ofthis lawsuit. See, e. g., H. R. Rep. No. 102-40, pt. 1, pp. 64-65 (1991) (Report of Committee on Education and Labor) ("Monetary damages also arenecessary to make discrimination victims whole for the terrible injury totheir careers, to their mental and emotional health, and to their selfrespect and dignity"); id., pt. 2, p. 25 (Report of Committee on the Judiciary) ("The limitation of relief under Title VII to equitable remedies oftenmeans that victims of intentional discrimination may not recover for thevery real effects of the discrimination").13 Our holding that damages received in settlement of a Title VII claimare not properly excludable under $ 104(a)(2) finds support in longstandingrulings of the IRS. See, e. g., Rev. Rule 72-341, 1972-2 Cum.
