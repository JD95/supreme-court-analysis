This case requires us to decide whether Federal Rule ofCriminal Procedure 43 permits the trialin absentia of adefendant who absconds prior to trial and is absent at itsbeginning. We hold that it does not.IIn April 1988, a federal grand jury in the District of Min-nesota indicted petitioner Michael Crosby and others on anumber of counts of mail fraud. The indictment alleged thatCrosby and his codefendants had devised a fraudulentscheme to sell military-veteran commemorative medallionssupposedly to fund construction of a theme park honoringveterans. Crosby appeared before a federal magistrate onJune 15, 1988, and, upon his plea of not guilty, was conditionally released from detention after agreeing to post a $100,000bond and remain in the State. Subsequently, he attendedpretrial conferences and hearings with his attorney and wasadvised that the trial was scheduled to begin on October 12.Crosby did not appear on October 12, however, nor couldhe be found. United States deputy marshals reported thathis house looked as though it had been "cleaned out," and aneighbor reported that petitioner's car had been backed halfway into his garage the previous evening, as if he were pack-ing its trunk. As the day wore on, the court remarked several times that the pool of 54 potential jurors was being keptwaiting, and that the delay in the proceedings would interfere with the court's calendar. The prosecutor noted thatCrosby's attorney and his three codefendants were present,and commented on the difficulty she would have in resched*Steven R. Shapiro and John A.

S. 255 (1993)Opinion of the Courtuling the case, should Crosby later appear, because some ofher many witnesses were elderly and had health problems.When the District Court raised the subject of conductingthe trial in Crosby's absence, Crosby's attorney objected.Nevertheless, after several days of delay and a fruitlesssearch for Crosby, the court, upon a formal request from theGovernment, decided that trial would commence on October17. The court ordered Crosby's $100,000 bond forfeited andstated for the record its findings that Crosby had been givenadequate notice of the trial date, that his absence was knowing and deliberate, and that requiring the Government totry Crosby separately from his codefendants would presentextreme difficulty for the Government, witnesses, counsel,and the court. It further concluded that Crosby voluntarilyhad waived his constitutional right to be present during thetrial, and that the public interest in proceeding with the trialin his absence outweighed his interest in being present dur-ing the proceedings. Trial began on October 17, with petitioner's counsel actively participating, and continued in Cros-by's absence until November 18, when the jury returnedverdicts of guilty on charges against Crosby and two of hiscodefendants. SeeUnited States v. Cheatham, 899 F. 2d 747(CA8 1990). One codefendant was acquitted.Approximately six months later, Crosby was arrested inFlorida and brought back to Minnesota, where he was sentenced to 20 years in prison followed by 5 years on probationwith specified conditions. Crosby's convictions were upheldby the Court of Appeals, which rejected his argument thatFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 43 forbids the trialinabsentia of a defendant who is not present at the beginningof trial. 917 F. 2d 362, 364-366 (CA8 1990). Noting thatthe other Courts of Appeals that considered the question hadfound trial in absentia permissible,* the court concluded that*The court cited, among other authorities, United States v.

IIRule 43 provides in relevant part:"(a) Presence Required. The defendant shall bepresent at the arraignment, at the time of the plea, atevery stage of the trial including the impaneling of thejury and the return of the verdict, and at the impositionof sentence, except as otherwise provided by this rule."(b) Continued Presence Not Required. The fur-ther progress of the trial to and including the return ofthe verdict shall not be prevented and the defendantshall be considered to have waived the right to be present whenever a defendant, initially present,"(1) is voluntarily absent after the trial hascommenced . . . ."The Government concedes that the Rule does not specificallyauthorize the trial in absentia of a defendant who was notpresent at the beginning of his trial. The Government ar-gues, nonetheless, that "Rule 43 does not purport to containa comprehensive listing of the circumstances under whichthe right to be present may be waived." Brief for UnitedStates 16. Accordingly, the Government contends, Crosby'sposition rests not on the express provisions of Rule 43, butsolely on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius.Ibid. We disagree. It is not necessary to invoke thatmaxim in order to conclude that Rule 43 does not allow fulltrials in absentia. The Rule declares explicitly: "The deStates v. Tortora, 464 F. 2d 1202, 1208 (CA2), cert. denied sub nom. Santoro v. United States, 409 U. S. 1063 (1972).

In that respect the language and structure ofthe Rule could not be more clear.The Government, however, urges us to look for guidanceat the existing law, which the Rule was meant to restate, atthe time of its adoption in 1944. See Advisory Committee'sNotes on Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 43, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 821.That inquiry does not assist the Government. "It is wellsettled that . . . at common law the personal presence of thedefendant is essential to a valid trial and conviction on acharge of felony. . . . If he is absent, . . . a conviction will beset aside." W. Mikell, Clark's Criminal Procedure 492 (2ded. 1918) (hereinafter Mikell).

The right generally was considered unwaivable in felony cases. Mikell492; 1 Bishop 175 and 178. This canon was premised on thenotion that a fair trial could take place only if the jurors metthe defendant face-to-face and only if those testifying againstthe defendant did so in his presence. See Wharton 392; 1Bishop 178. It was thought "contrary to the dictates of humanity to let a prisoner `waive that advantage which a viewof his sad plight might give him by inclining the hearts ofthe jurors to listen to his defence with indulgence.'

S. 442 (1912), a case thatconcerned a defendant who had absented himself voluntarilyon two occasions from his ongoing trial in the Philippines,this Court authorized a limited exception to the general rule,506us2$17Z 08-22-96 18:02:16 PAGES OPINPGT260 CROSBY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtan exception that was codified eventually in Rule 43(b). Because it did " `not seem to us to be consonant with the dictates of common sense that an accused person, being at largeupon bail, should be at liberty, whenever he pleased, to withdraw himself from the courts of his country and to break upa trial already commenced,' " id., at 457, quoting Falk v.United States, 15 App. D. C. 446, 454 (1899), cert. denied, 181U. S. 618 (1901), the Court held:"[W]here the offense is not capital and the accused isnot in custody, . . . if, after the trial has begun in hispresence, he voluntarily absents himself, this does notnullify what has been done or prevent the completion ofthe trial, but, on the contrary, operates as a waiver ofhis right to be present and leaves the court free to proceed with the trial in like manner and with like effect asif he were present." 223 U. S., at 455 (emphasis added).Diaz was cited by the Advisory Committee that draftedRule 43. The Committee explained: "The second sentenceof the rule is a restatement of existing law that, except incapital cases, the defendant may not defeat the proceedingsby voluntarily absenting himself after the trial has beencommenced in his presence." Advisory Committee's Noteson Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 43, 18 U. S. C. App., p. 821. Thereis no reason to believe that the drafters intended the Ruleto go further. Commenting on a preliminary version of theRule, Judge John B. Sanborn, a member of the Committee,stated:"I think it would be inadvisable to conduct criminaltrials in the absence of the defendant. That has neverbeen the practice, and, whether the defendant wants toattend the trial or not, I think he should be compelledto be present. If, during the trial, he disappears, thereis, of course, no reason why the trial should not proceedwithout him." 2 M. Wilken & N. Triffin, Drafting His506us2$17Z 08-22-96 18:02:16 PAGES OPINPGT261Cite as: 506 U. S. 255 (1993)Opinion of the Courttory of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 236(1991).The Court of Appeals in the present case recognized thatthis Court in Diaz had not addressed the situation of thedefendant who fails to appear for the commencement of trial.Nevertheless, the court concluded: "It would be anomalousto attach more significance to a defendant's absence at com-mencement than to absence during more important substantive portions of the trial." 917 F. 2d, at 365. While it maybe true that there are no "talismanic properties which differentiate the commencement of a trial from later stages," Government of the Virgin Islands v. Brown, 507 F. 2d 186, 189(CA3 1975), we do not find the distinction between pretrialand midtrial flight so farfetched as to convince us that Rule43 cannot mean what it says. As a general matter, the costsof suspending a proceeding already under way will begreater than the cost of postponing a trial not yet begun. Ifa clear line is to be drawn marking the point at which thecosts of delay are likely to outweigh the interests of the defendant and society in having the defendant present, thecommencement of trial is at least a plausible place at whichto draw that line. See Hopt v. Territory of Utah, 110 U. S.574, 579 (1884) (discussing the public's interest in strict enforcement of statutory requirement that defendant be pres-ent at trial).There are additional practical reasons for distinguishingbetween flight before and flight during a trial. As did Diaz,the Rule treats midtrial flight as a knowing and voluntarywaiver of the right to be present. Whether or not the rightconstitutionally may be waived in other circumstances--andwe express no opinion here on that subject--the defendant'sinitial presence serves to assure that any waiver is indeedknowing. "Since the notion that trial may be commenced inabsentia still seems to shock most lawyers, it would hardlyseem appropriate to impute knowledge that this will occurto their clients." Starkey, Trial in Absentia, 54 N. Y. St.506us2$17Z 08-22-96 18:02:16 PAGES OPINPGT262 CROSBY v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtB. J. 30, 34, n. 28 (1982). It is unlikely, on the other hand," `that a defendant who flees from a courtroom in the midstof a trial--where judge, jury, witnesses and lawyers arepresent and ready to continue--would not know that as aconsequence the trial could continue in his absence.' " Taylor v. United States, 414 U. S. 17, 20 (1973), quoting fromChief Judge Coffin's opinion, United States v. Taylor, 478F. 2d 689, 691 (CA1 1973), for the Court of Appeals in thatcase. Moreover, a rule that allows an ongoing trial to continue when a defendant disappears deprives the defendant ofthe option of gambling on an acquittal knowing that he canterminate the trial if it seems that the verdict will go againsthim--an option that might otherwise appear preferable tothe costly, perhaps unnecessary, path of becoming a fugitivefrom the outset.The language, history, and logic of Rule 43 support astraightforward interpretation that prohibits the trialin ab-sentia of a defendant who is not present at the beginning oftrial. Because we find Rule 43 dispositive, we do not reachCrosby's claim that his trialin absentia was also prohibitedby the Constitution.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, andthe case is remanded for further proceedings consistent withthis opinion. It is so ordered.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT263OCTOBER TERM, 1992SyllabusBRAY et al. v. ALEXANDRIA WOMEN'S HEALTHCLINIC et al.certiorari to the united states court of appeals forthe fourth circuitNo. 90-985. Argued October 16, 1991--Reargued October 6, 1992--Decided January 13, 1993Respondents, abortion clinics and supporting organizations, sued to enjoinpetitioners, an association and individuals who organize and coordinateantiabortion demonstrations, from conducting demonstrations at clinicsin the Washington, D. C., metropolitan area. The District Court heldthat, by conspiring to deprive women seeking abortions of their rightto interstate travel, petitioners had violated the first clause of 42 U. S. C.$ 1985(3), which prohibits conspiracies to deprive "any person or class ofpersons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges andimmunities under the laws"; ruled for respondents on their pendentstate-law claims of trespass and public nuisance; as relief on these threeclaims, enjoined petitioners from trespassing on, or obstructing accessto, specified clinics; and, pursuant to 42 U. S. C. $ 1988, ordered petitioners to pay respondents attorney's fees and costs on the $ 1985(3) claim.The Court of Appeals affirmed.Held:1. The first clause of $ 1985(3) does not provide a federal cause of action against persons obstructing access to abortion clinics. Pp. 267-278.(a) Respondents have not shown that opposition to abortion qualifies alongside race discrimination as an "otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus [underlying] the conspirators' action," asis required under Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U. S. 88, 102, in orderto prove a private conspiracy in violation of $ 1985(3)'s first clause. Respondents' claim that petitioners' opposition to abortion reflects an animus against women in general must be rejected. The "animus" requirement demands at least a purpose that focuses upon women by reason oftheir sex, whereas the record indicates that petitioners' demonstrationsare not directed specifically at women, but are intended to protect the victims of abortion, stop its practice, and reverse its legalization. Opposition to abortion cannot reasonably be presumed to reflect a sex-basedintent; there are common and respectable reasons for opposing abortionother than a derogatory view of women as a class. This Court's priordecisions indicate that the disfavoring of abortion, although only women506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT264 BRAY v. ALEXANDRIA WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINICSyllabusengage in the activity, is not ipso facto invidious discrimination againstwomen as a class. Pp. 268-274.(b) Respondents have also not shown that petitioners "aimed at interfering with rights" that are "protected against private, as well asofficial, encroachment," a second prerequisite to proving a private conspiracy in violation of $ 1985(3)'s first clause. Carpenters v. Scott, 463U. S. 825, 833. Although the right to interstate travel is constitutionally protected against private interference in at least some contexts,Carpenters makes clear that a $ 1985(3) private conspiracy must be"aimed at" that right. Ibid. That was not established here. Although respondents showed that substantial numbers of women travelinterstate to reach the clinics in question, it was irrelevant to petitioners' opposition whether or not such travel preceded the intended abortions. Moreover, as far as appears from the record, petitioners' proposed demonstrations would erect "actual barriers to . . . movement"only intrastate. Zobel v. Williams, 457 U. S. 55, 60, n. 6. Respondentshave conceded that this intrastate restriction is not applied discriminatorily against interstate travelers, and the right to interstate travel istherefore not implicated. Ibid. Nor can respondents' $ 1985(3) claimbe based on the right to abortion, which is a right protected only againststate interference and therefore cannot be the object of a purely privateconspiracy. See Carpenters, supra, at 833. Pp. 274-278.(c) The dissenters err in considering whether respondents have established a violation of $ 1985(3)'s second, "hindrance" clause, which covers conspiracies "for the purpose of preventing or hindering . . . anyState . . . from giving or securing to all persons . . . the equal protectionof the laws." A "hindrance"-clause claim was not stated in the complaint, was not considered by either of the lower courts, was not contained in the questions presented on certiorari, and was not suggestedby either party as a question for argument or decision here. Nor is itreadily determinable that respondents have established a "hindrance"-clause violation. The language in the first clause of $ 1985(3) that is thesource of the Griffin animus requirement also appears in the "hindrance" clause. Second, respondents' "hindrance" "claim" would failunless the "hindrance" clause applies to private conspiracies aimedat rights constitutionally protected only against official encroachment.Cf. Carpenters. Finally, the District Court did not find that petitioners'purpose was to prevent or hinder law enforcement. Pp. 279-285.2. The award of attorney's fees and costs under $ 1988 must be vacated because respondents were not entitled to relief under $ 1985(3).However, respondents' $ 1985(3) claims were not, prior to this decision,"wholly insubstantial and frivolous," Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682-683, so as to deprive the District Court of subject-matter jurisdiction506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT265Cite as: 506 U. S. 263 (1993)Syllabusover the action.

IOur precedents establish that in order to prove a privateconspiracy in violation of the first clause of $ 1985(3),1 a plain1 Section 1985(3) provides as follows:"If two or more persons in any State or Territory conspire or go indisguise on the highway or on the premises of another, for the purpose ofdepriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons ofthe equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunitiesunder the laws; or for the purpose of preventing or hindering the constituted authorities of any State or Territory from giving or securing to allpersons within such State or Territory the equal protection of the laws;or if two or more persons conspire to prevent by force, intimidation, orthreat, any citizen who is lawfully entitled to vote, from giving his supportor advocacy in a legal manner, toward or in favor of the election of anylawfully qualified person as an elector for President or Vice President, oras a Member of Congress of the United States; or to injure any citizen inperson or property on account of such support or advocacy; in any case ofconspiracy set forth in this section, if one or more persons engaged thereindo, or cause to be done, any act in furtherance of the object of such conspiracy, whereby another is injured in his person or property, or deprived ofhaving and exercising any right or privilege of a citizen of the United506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT268 BRAY v. ALEXANDRIA WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINICOpinion of the Courttiff must show, inter alia, (1) that "some racial, or perhapsotherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus[lay] behind the conspirators' action," Griffin v. Brecken-ridge, 403 U. S. 88, 102 (1971), and (2) that the conspiracy"aimed at interfering with rights" that are "protectedagainst private, as well as official, encroachment,"Carpen-ters v. Scott, 463 U. S. 825, 833 (1983). We think neithershowing has been made in the present case.AIn Griffin this Court held, reversing a 20-year-old prece-dent, seeCollins v. Hardyman, 341 U. S. 651 (1951), that$ 1985(3) reaches not only conspiracies under color of statelaw, but also purely private conspiracies. In finding that thetext required that expanded scope, however, we recognizedthe "constitutional shoals that would lie in the path of inter-preting $ 1985(3) as a general federal tort law."Griffin, 403U. S., at 102. That was to be avoided, we said, "by requiring, as an element of the cause of action, the kind of invidi-ously discriminatory motivation stressed by the sponsors ofthe limiting amendment," ibid.--citing specifically Repre-sentative Shellabarger's statement that the law was restricted " `to the prevention of deprivations which shall at-tack the equality of rights of American citizens; that anyviolation of the right, the animus and effect of which is tostrike down the citizen, to the end that he may not enjoyequality of rights as contrasted with his and other citizens'rights, shall be within the scope of the remedies . . . ,' "id.,at 100 (emphasis in original), quoting Cong. Globe, 42d Cong.,1st Sess., App. 478 (1871). We said that "[t]he language [of$ 1985(3)] requiring intent to deprive ofequal protection, orequal privileges and immunities, means that there must besome racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiouslyStates, the party so injured or deprived may have an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation, against any oneor more of the conspirators." 42 U. S. C. $ 1985(3).506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT269Cite as: 506 U. S. 263 (1993)Opinion of the Courtdiscriminatory animus behind the conspirators' action." 403U. S., at 102 (emphasis in original).We have not yet had occasion to resolve the "perhaps";only inGriffin itself have we addressed and upheld a claimunder $ 1985(3), and that case involved race discrimination.Respondents assert that there qualifies alongside race dis-crimination, as an "otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus" covered by the 1871 law, opposition toabortion. Neither common sense nor our precedents support this.To begin with, we reject the apparent conclusion of theDistrict Court (which respondents make no effort to defend)that opposition to abortion constitutes discrimination againstthe "class" of "women seeking abortion." Whatever may bethe precise meaning of a "class" for purposes of Griffin'sspeculative extension of $ 1985(3) beyond race, the term unquestionably connotes something more than a group of individuals who share a desire to engage in conduct that the$ 1985(3) defendant disfavors. Otherwise, innumerable tortplaintiffs would be able to assert causes of action under$ 1985(3) by simply defining the aggrieved class as thoseseeking to engage in the activity the defendant has interfered with. This definitional ploy would convert the statuteinto the "general federal tort law" it was the very purposeof the animus requirement to avoid. Ibid. As JusticeBlackmun has cogently put it, the class "cannot be definedsimply as the group of victims of the tortious action." Carpenters, supra, at 850 (dissenting opinion). "Women seekingabortion" is not a qualifying class.Respondents' contention, however, is that the allegedclass-based discrimination is directed not at "women seekingabortion" but at women in general. We find it unnecessaryto decide whether that is a qualifying class under $ 1985(3),since the claim that petitioners' opposition to abortion reflects an animus against women in general must be rejected.We do not think that the "animus" requirement can be met506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT270 BRAY v.

It does demand, however, at least a purpose thatfocuses upon womenby reason of their sex--for example (touse an illustration of assertedly benign discrimination), thepurpose of "saving" women because they are women from acombative, aggressive profession such as the practice of law.The record in this case does not indicate that petitioners'demonstrations are motivated by a purpose (malevolentorbenign) directed specifically at women as a class; to the con-trary, the District Court found that petitioners define their"rescues" not with reference to women, but as physical intervention " `between abortionists and the innocent victims,' "and that "all [petitioners] share a deep commitment to thegoals of stopping the practice of abortion and reversing itslegalization." 726 F. Supp., at 1488. Given this record, respondents' contention that a class-based animus has been established can be true only if one of two suggested propositions is true: (1) that opposition to abortion can reasonablybe presumed to reflect a sex-based intent, or (2) that intentis irrelevant, and a class-based animus can be determinedsolely by effect. Neither proposition is supportable.As to the first: Some activities may be such an irrationalobject of disfavor that, if they are targeted, and if they alsohappen to be engaged in exclusively or predominantly by aparticular class of people, an intent to disfavor that class canreadily be presumed. A tax on wearing yarmulkes is a taxon Jews. But opposition to voluntary abortion cannot possibly be considered such an irrational surrogate for oppositionto (or paternalism towards) women. Whatever one thinksof abortion, it cannot be denied that there are common andrespectable reasons for opposing it, other than hatred of, orcondescension toward (or indeed any view at all concerning),women as a class--as is evident from the fact that men andwomen are on both sides of the issue, just as men and womenare on both sides of petitioners' unlawful demonstrations.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT271Cite as: 506 U.

S. 833, 850 (1992).Respondents' case comes down, then, to the propositionthat intent is legally irrelevant; that since voluntary abortionis an activity engaged in only by women,2 to disfavor it isipso facto to discriminate invidiously against women as aclass. Our cases do not support that proposition. In Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484 (1974), we rejected the claimthat a state disability insurance system that denied coverageto certain disabilities resulting from pregnancy discriminated on the basis of sex in violation of the Equal ProtectionClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. "While it is true,"we said, "that only women can become pregnant, it does notfollow that every legislative classification concerning pregnancy is a sex-based classification." Id., at 496, n. 20. Wereached a similar conclusion in Personnel Administrator ofMass. v. Feeney, 442 U.

It2 Petitioners and their amici argue that the intentional destruction ofhuman fetuses, which is the target of their protests, is engaged in notmerely by the women who seek and receive abortions, but by the medicaland support personnel who provide abortions, and even by the friends andrelatives who escort the women to and from the clinics. Many of those inthe latter categories, petitioners point out, are men, and petitioners blocktheir entry to the clinics no less than the entry of pregnant women. Respondents reply that the essential object of petitioners' conspiracy is toprevent women from intentionally aborting their fetuses. The fact thatthe physical obstruction targets some men, they say, does not render itany less "class based" against women--just as a racial conspiracy againstblacks does not lose that character when it targets in addition white supporters of black rights, see Carpenters v. Scott, 463 U. S. 825, 836 (1983).We need not resolve this dispute, but assume for the sake of argumentthat respondents' characterization is correct.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT272 BRAY v.

Id., at 279 (citation omitted).3 The same principleapplies to the "class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus" requirement of $ 1985(3).4 Moreover, two of our cases3 Justice Stevens asserts that, irrespective of intent or motivation, aclassification is sex based if it has a sexually discriminatory effect. Post,at 326-332. The cases he puts forward to confirm this revisionist readingof Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484 (1974), in fact confirm the opposite.Nashville Gas Co. v. Satty, 434 U. S. 136 (1977), cited Geduldig only once,in endorsement of Geduldig's ruling that a facially neutral benefit plan isnot sex based unless it is shown that " `distinctions involving pregnancyare mere pretexts designed to effect an invidious discrimination againstthe members of one sex or the other.' " 434 U. S., at 145 (quoting Geduldig, supra, at 496-497, n. 20) (internal quotation marks omitted). Sattysaid that the Court "need not decide" whether "it is necessary to proveintent to establish a prima facie violation of $ 703(a)(1)," 434 U. S., at 144,because "[r]espondent failed to prove even a discriminatory effect," id., at145 (emphasis added). It is clear from this that sex-based discriminatoryintent is something beyond sexually discriminatory effect. The Courtfound liability in Satty "[n]otwithstanding Geduldig," post, at 328, not (asJustice Stevens suggests) because Geduldig is compatible with the belief that effects alone constitute the requisite intent, but rather because$ 703(a)(2) of Title VII has no intent requirement, 434 U. S., at 139-141.In his discussion of the (inapplicable) Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 92Stat. 2076, Justice Stevens acknowledges that Congress understoodGeduldig as we do, see post, at 330-331, and nn. 29-30. As for the casesJustice Stevens relegates to footnotes: Turner v. Utah Dept. of Employment Security, 423 U. S. 44 (1975), was not even a discrimination case;General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, 429 U. S. 125, 135 (1976), describes theholding of Geduldig precisely as we do; and Newport News Shipbuilding &Dry Dock Co. v. EEOC, 462 U. S. 669 (1983), casts no doubt on the continuing vitality of Geduldig.4 We think this principle applicable to $ 1985(3) not because we believethat Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence is automatically incorporatedinto $ 1985(3), but rather because it is inherent in the requirement of aclass-based animus, i. e., an animus based on class. We do not disputeJustice Stevens' observation, post, at 326, that Congress "may offer relieffrom discriminatory effects," without evidence of intent.

Post, at 322-332 (Stevens, J., dissenting);post, at 350-354 (O'Connor, J., dissenting). It is enough for these dissenters that members of a protected class are "targeted" for unlawfulaction "by virtue of their class characteristics," post, at 352 (O'Connor,J., dissenting), see also post, at 354, regardless of what the motivation oranimus underlying that unlawful action might be. Accord, post, at 322-323 (Stevens, J., dissenting). This approach completely eradicates thedistinction, apparent in the statute itself, between purpose and effect.Under Justice Stevens' approach, petitioners' admitted purpose of preserving fetal life (a "legitimate and nondiscriminatory goal," post, at323 (emphasis added)) becomes the "indirect consequence of petitioners'blockade," while the discriminatory effect on women seeking abortions isnow "the conspirators' immediate purpose," ibid. (emphasis added). Justice O'Connor acknowledges that petitioners' "target[ing]" is motivatedby "opposition to the practice of abortion." Post, at 351.In any event, the characteristic that formed the basis of the targetinghere was not womanhood, but the seeking of abortion--so that the classthe dissenters identify is the one we have rejected earlier: women seekingabortion. The approach of equating opposition to an activity (abortion)that can be engaged in only by a certain class (women) with opposition tothat class leads to absurd conclusions. On that analysis, men and womenwho regard rape with revulsion harbor an invidious antimale animus.Thus, if state law should provide that convicted rapists must be paroledso long as they attend weekly counseling sessions; and if persons opposedto such lenient treatment should demonstrate their opposition by impedingaccess to the counseling centers; those protesters would, on the dissenters'approach, be liable under $ 1985(3) because of their antimale animus.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT274 BRAY v. ALEXANDRIA WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINICOpinion of the CourtThe nature of the "invidiously discriminatory animus"Griffin had in mind is suggested both by the language usedin that phrase ("invidious . . . [t]ending to excite odium, illwill, or envy; likely to give offense; esp., unjustly and irritatingly discriminating," Webster's Second International Dic-tionary 1306 (1954)) and by the company in which the phraseis found ("there must be some racial, or perhaps otherwiseclass-based, invidiously discriminatory animus," Griffin, 403U. S., at 102 (emphasis added)). Whether one agrees or disagrees with the goal of preventing abortion, that goal in it-self (apart from the use of unlawful means to achieve it,which is not relevant to our discussion of animus) does notremotely qualify for such harsh description, and for such derogatory association with racism. To the contrary, we havesaid that "a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion" is proper and reasonable enough to be implemented bythe allocation of public funds, seeMaher, supra, at 474, andCongress itself has, with our approval, discriminated againstabortion in its provision of financial support for medical pro-cedures, seeHarris, supra, at 325. This is not the stuff outof which a $ 1985(3) "invidiously discriminatory animus" iscreated. BRespondents' federal claim fails for a second, independentreason: A $ 1985(3) private conspiracy "for the purpose ofdepriving . . . any person or class of persons of the equalprotection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunitiesunder the laws," requires an intent to deprive persons of aright guaranteed against private impairment. See Carpenters, 463 U. S., at 833. No intent to deprive of such a rightwas established here.Respondents, like the courts below, rely upon the right tointerstate travel--which we have held to be, in at least somecontexts, a right constitutionally protected against privateinterference. SeeGriffin, supra, at 105-106. But all thatrespondents can point to by way of connecting petitioners'506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT275Cite as: 506 U.

Supp., at 1489.That is not enough. As we said in a case involving 18U. S. C. $ 241, the criminal counterpart of $ 1985(3):"[A] conspiracy to rob an interstate traveler would not,of itself, violate $ 241. But if the predominant purposeof the conspiracy is to impede or prevent the exercise ofthe right of interstate travel, or to oppress a person because of his exercise of that right, then . . . the conspir-acy becomes a proper object of the federal law underwhich the indictment in this case was brought." UnitedStates v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 760 (1966).5Our discussion in Carpenters makes clear that it does notsuffice for application of $ 1985(3) that a protected right beincidentally affected. A conspiracy is not "for the purpose"of denying equal protection simply because it has an effectupon a protected right. The right must be "aimed at," 463U. S., at 833 (emphasis added); its impairment must be a conscious objective of the enterprise. Just as the "invidiouslydiscriminatory animus" requirement, discussed above, requires that the defendant have taken his action "at least inpart `because of,' not merely `in spite of,' its adverse effects5 Justice Stevens finds "most significant . . . the dramatic differencebetween the language of 18 U. S. C. $ 241" and that of $ 1985(3), in that theformer "includes an unequivocal `intent' requirement." Post, at 335. Hehas it precisely backwards. The second paragraph of $ 241 does containan explicit "intent" requirement, but the first paragraph, which was theonly one at issue in Guest, see 383 U. S., at 747, does not; whereas $ 1985(3)does explicitly require a "purpose." As for Justice Stevens' emphasisupon the fact that $ 1985(3), unlike $ 241, embraces "a purpose to depriveanother of a protected privilege `either directly or indirectly,' " post, at335: that in no way contradicts a specific intent requirement. The phrase"either directly or indirectly" modifies "depriving," not "purpose." Thedeprivation, whether direct or indirect, must still have been the purposeof the defendant's action.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT276 BRAY v.

Petitioners oppose abortion, and it is irrelevant to their opposition whether the abortion is performedafter interstate travel.Respondents have failed to show a conspiracy to violatethe right of interstate travel for yet another reason: Petitioners' proposed demonstrations would not implicate that right.The federal guarantee of interstate travel does not transformstate-law torts into federal offenses when they are intention6 To contradict the plain import of our cases on this point, Justice Stevens presses into service a footnote in Griffin. Post, at 335-336, n. 33.In addressing "[t]he motivation requirement introduced by the word`equal' into . . . $ 1985(3)," Griffin said that this was not to be confusedwith a test of "specific intent to deprive a person of a federal right madedefinite by decision or other rule of law"; $ 1985(3) "contains no specificrequirement of `wilfulness,' " and its "motivation aspect . . . focuses not onscienter in relation to deprivation of rights but on invidiously discriminatory animus." Griffin, 403 U. S., at 102, n. 10. This is supremely irrelevant to the present discussion, since (1) we are not considering "the motivation requirement introduced by the word `equal,' " but rather the intentrequirement introduced by the word "purpose," and (2) we are not asserting that the right in question must have been "made definite by decisionor other rule of law," but only that it must have been "aimed at," with orwithout knowledge that it is a federally protected right, cf. Screws v.United States, 325 U. S. 91, 103-107 (1945)--a requirement not of "wilfulness," in other words, but only of "purpose." The requisite "purpose"was of course pleaded in Griffin, as we specifically noted. See 403 U. S.,at 103. Justice Stevens makes no response whatever to the plain language of Carpenters, except to contend that the same irrelevant footnote10 reaches forward 12 years in time, to prevent Carpenters from meaningwhat it obviously says ("aimed at"). Although a few lower courts at onetime read the Griffin footnote as Justice Stevens does, see post, at 336-337, those cases were all decided years before this Court's opinion in Carpenters, which we follow.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:06 PAGES OPINPGT277Cite as: 506 U.

Rather, it pro-tects interstate travelers against two sets of burdens: "theerection of actual barriers to interstate movement" and"being treated differently" from intrastate travelers. Zobelv. Williams, 457 U. S. 55, 60, n. 6 (1982). See Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (1869) (Art. IV, $ 2, "inhibits discrimi-nating legislation against [citizens of other States and] givesthem the right of free ingress into other States, and egressfrom them"); Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 395 (1948)(Art. IV, $ 2, "insure[s] to a citizen of State A who venturesinto State B the same privileges which the citizens of State Benjoy"). As far as appears from this record, the only "actualbarriers to . . . movement" that would have resulted frompetitioners' proposed demonstrations would have been in theimmediate vicinity of the abortion clinics, restricting movement from one portion of the Commonwealth of Virginia toanother. Such a purely intrastate restriction does not impli-cate the right of interstate travel, even if it is applied intentionally against travelers from other States, unless it is applied discriminatorily against them. That would not be thecase here, as respondents conceded at oral argument.7The other right alleged by respondents to have been intentionally infringed is the right to abortion. The DistrictCourt declined to rule on this contention, relying exclusivelyupon the right-of-interstate-travel theory; in our view it also7 Justice Stevens expresses incredulity at the rule we have described.It is, he says, "unsupported by precedent or reason," post, at 333, both ofwhich show, he claims, that the right of interstate travel is violated evenby "conduct that evenhandedly disrupts both local and interstate travel,"post, at 337. We cite right-to-travel cases for our position; he cites nothingbut negative Commerce Clause cases for his. While it is always pleasantto greet such old Commerce Clause warhorses as Pike v. Bruce Church,Inc., 397 U. S. 137 (1970), Dean Milk Co. v. Madison, 340 U. S. 349 (1951),and Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761 (1945),cited post, at 337, surely they are irrelevant to the individual right of interstate travel we are here discussing. That right does not derive from thenegative Commerce Clause, or else it could be eliminated by Congress.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT278 BRAY v. ALEXANDRIA WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINICOpinion of the Courtis an inadequate basis for respondents' $ 1985(3) claim.Whereas, unlike the right of interstate travel, the assertedright to abortion was assuredly "aimed at" by the petitioners, deprivation of that federal right (whatever its contours)cannot be the object of a purely private conspiracy. In Carpenters, we rejected a claim that an alleged private conspiracy to infringe First Amendment rights violated $ 1985(3).The statute does not apply, we said, to private conspiraciesthat are "aimed at a right that is by definition a right onlyagainst state interference," but applies only to such conspiracies as are "aimed at interfering with rights . . . protectedagainst private, as well as official, encroachment." 463 U. S.,at 833. There are few such rights (we have hitherto recognized only the Thirteenth Amendment right to be free frominvoluntary servitude, United States v. Kozminski, 487 U. S.931, 942 (1988), and, in the same Thirteenth Amendmentcontext, the right of interstate travel, see United States v.Guest, 383 U. S., at 759, n. 17). The right to abortion is notamong them. It would be most peculiar to accord it thatpreferred position, since it is much less explicitly protectedby the Constitution than, for example, the right of freespeech rejected for such status in Carpenters. Moreover,the right to abortion has been described in our opinions asone element of a more general right of privacy, see Roe v.Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 152-153 (1973), or of Fourteenth Amendment liberty, see Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.,505 U. S., at 846-851; and the other elements of those moregeneral rights are obviously not protected against privateinfringement. (A burglar does not violate the FourthAmendment, for example, nor does a mugger violate theFourteenth.) Respondents' $ 1985(3) "deprivation" claimmust fail, then, because they have identified no right protected against private action that has been the object of thealleged conspiracy.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT279Cite as: 506 U.

Tr. of Oral Arg.27 ("the complaint did not make a hinder or prevent claim");Tr. of Reargument 33-34.8 Not surprisingly, therefore, nei-ther the District Court nor the Court of Appeals consideredthe application of that clause to the current facts. The"hindrance"-clause issue is not fairly included within thequestions on which petitioners sought certiorari, see Pet. forCert. i; this Court's Rule 14.1(a),9 which is alone enough toexclude it from our consideration.10 Nor is it true that "[t]he8 These admissions were accurate. The amended complaint alleged, inits two federal causes of action, that petitioners "have conspired to deprivewomen of their right to travel" and "have conspired . . . for the purposeof denying women seeking abortions . . . their rights to privacy." App.15-16. These are both "deprivation" claims; neither one makes any allusion to hindrance or prevention of state authorities.9 Justice Souter contends, post, at 290-291, that the "hindrance"-clause issue was embraced within question four, which asked: "Are respondents' claims under 42 U.

Thisargument founders on the hard (and admitted) reality that "respondents'claims" did not include a "hindrance" claim.10 Contrary to Justice Souter's suggestion, post, at 290-291, the provision of our Rules giving respondents the right, in their brief in opposition,to restate the questions presented, Rule 24.2, does not give them the powerto expand the questions presented, as the Rule itself makes clear. In anyevent, neither of the questions set forth in the Brief in Opposition fairly506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT280 BRAY v.

Post, at 291 (Souter,J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).To the contrary, neither party initiated even the slightestsuggestion that the "hindrance" question was an issue to beargued and decided here.11 That possibility was suggestedfor the first time by questions from the bench during argument, and was reintroduced, again from the bench, duringreargument. (Respondents sought to include a "hindrance"-clause section in their Supplemental Brief on Reargument,but the Court declined to accept that section for filing. See505 U. S. 1240 (1992).) In sum, the Justices reaching the"hindrance"-clause issue in this case must find in the complaint claims that the respondents themselves have admittedare not there; must resolve a question not presented to, orruled on by, any lower court; must revise the rule that it isthe petition for certiorari (not the brief in opposition andlater briefs) that determines the questions presented; andmust penalize the parties for not addressing an issue onraises the "hindrance" claim. And there is no support whatever for Justice Souter's reliance upon the formulation of the question in respondents' brief on the merits, post, at 290, as the basis for deeming the questionproperly presented--though on the merits, once again, the question referred to by Justice Souter is unhelpful.11 Respondents' brief asserted that, if the Court did not affirm the judgment on the basis of the "deprivation" clause, then a remand would benecessary, so that respondents could "present a number of contentionsrespecting [their right-to-privacy] claim" which had not been reachedbelow, including the contention that "petitioners, by means of their blockades, had hindered the police in securing to women their right to privacy."Brief for Respondents 43.

KelcoDisposal, Inc., 492 U.

It is far from that. Judging from thestatutory text, a cause of action under the "hindrance" clausewould seem to require the same "class-based, invidiously dis-criminatory animus" that the "deprivation" clause requires,and that we have found lacking here. We said in Griffinthat the source of the animus requirement is "[t]he languagerequiring intent to deprive of equal protection, or equalprivileges and immunities," 403 U. S., at 102 (emphasis inoriginal)--and such language appears in the "hindrance"clause as well.13 At oral argument, respondents concededapplicability of the animus requirement, though they with12 We are unable to grasp the logic whereby Justice Souter, whowould have us conclusively resolve the "hindrance"-clause legal issueagainst petitioners (despite their lack of opportunity to address it, bothhere and below), criticizes our opinion, see post, at 291-292, for merelysuggesting (without resolving the "hindrance"-clause issue) the difficultiesthat inhere in his approach.13 In straining to argue that the "hindrance" clause does not have thesame animus requirement as the first clause of $ 1985(3), Justice Stevensmakes an argument extrapolating from the reasoning of Kush v. Rutledge,460 U. S. 719 (1983), which held that the animus requirement expoundedin Griffin did not apply to a claim under the first clause of $ 1985(2). Post,at 340-342. But the heart of Kush--what the case itself considered "ofgreatest importance"--was the fact that Griffin's animus requirementrested on "the `equal protection' language" of $ 1985(3), which the firstclause of $ 1985(2) did not contain. 460 U. S., at 726. Since the "hindrance" clause of $ 1985(3) does contain that language, the straightforwardapplication of Kush to this case is quite the opposite of what JusticeStevens asserts.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT282 BRAY v.

Inthe very paragraph to which that footnote is appended, however, JusticeSouter purports to leave open the question whether the "hindrance"clause would apply when the conspiracy "amount[s] to a denial of policeprotection to individuals who are not attempting to exercise a constitutional right," post, at 304, n. 9--such as (presumably) the rights guaranteed by state trespass laws. Certainly the sit-ins violated such state-lawrights, or else there would have been no convictions. It is not true, inany case, that the sit-ins did not invade constitutional rights, if one usesthat term (as Justice Souter does) to include rights constitutionally protected only against official (as opposed to private) encroachment. Surelyproperty owners have a constitutional right not to have government physically occupy their property without due process and without justcompensation.Justice Souter's citation of Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U. S.609 (1984), post, at 305, n. 10, and Lane v. Cotton, 12 Mod. 472 (K. B. 1701),post, at 305, n. 10, requires no response. He cites Heart of Atlanta Motel,Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964), for the proposition that the 1964Civil Rights Act's elimination of restaurant-owners' right to exclude blacksfrom their establishments did not violate the Due Process or TakingsClauses. Assuredly not. But government regulation of commercial usethrough valid legislation is hardly comparable to government action thatwould have been the equivalent of what those conducting the sit-ins did:physically occupy private property, against the consent of the owner, without legal warrant. Justice Souter cites Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1(1948), post, at 306, n. 10, to establish (in effect) that there was, evenbefore the Civil Rights Act, legal warrant for the physical occupation.Any argument driven to reliance upon an extension of that volatile case isobviously in serious trouble.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT283Cite as: 506 U.

To the extent that case illuminates thisquestion at all, it is clearly contrary to the dissent's view,holding that the "deprivation" clause, at least, doesnot coverprivate conspiracies aimed at rights protected only againststate encroachment. Justice O'Connor simply assertswithout analysis that the "hindrance" clause nonethelessapplies to those rights, post, at 355-356--although the opera-tive language of the two clauses ("equal protection of thelaws") is identical. Justice Souter disposes of the rights-guaranteed-against-private-encroachment requirement, andthe class-based animus requirement as well, only by (1) un-dertaking a full-dress reconsideration ofGriffin and Carpen-ters, (2) concluding that both those cases were wrongly decided, and (3) limiting the damage of those supposed errorsby embracing an interpretation of the statute that concededly gives the same language in two successive clauses com-pletely different meanings.15 See post, at 292-303. This15 Justice Souter contends that even without the animus and rightsguaranteed-against-private-encroachment requirements, the "hindrance"clause will still be "significantly limit[ed]" in scope, covering only "conspiracies to act with enough force . . . to overwhelm the capacity of legal authority to act evenhandedly in administering the law," post, at 300 (emphasisadded). Justice Stevens discerns a similar limitation, see post, at 341-342. Only Justice Souter attempts to find a statutory basis for it. Heargues that since $ 1985(1) prohibits a conspiracy to prevent "any person"(emphasis added) from "discharging any duties," $ 1985(3)'s prohibition ofa conspiracy directed against "the constituted authorities" (emphasisadded) must be speaking of something that affects more than a singleofficial, post, at 300. This seems to us a complete non sequitur. The difference between "any person" and "constituted authorities" would containsuch a significant limitation (if at all) only if the remaining language ofthe two sections was roughly parallel. But it is not. Section 1985(1), forexample, speaks of categorically "prevent[ing]" a person's exercise of hisduties, whereas $ 1985(3) speaks of "preventing or hindering" the constituted authorities. (Emphasis added.) Obviously, one can "hinder" the506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT284 BRAY v.

They con-cede that this requires a finding that the protesters'purposewas to prevent or hinder law enforcement officers; but dis-cern such a finding in the District Court's footnote recitationthat "the rescuers outnumbered the . . . police officers" andthat "the police were unable to prevent the closing of theclinic for more than six (6) hours."National Organizationfor Women v. Operation Rescue, 726 F. Supp., at 1489, n. 4.See post, at 339 (Stevens, J., dissenting); post, at 356 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); post, at 306 (Souter, J., concurring injudgment in part and dissenting in part). This renders thedistinction between "purpose" and "effect" utterly meaningless. Here again, the dissenters (other than Justice Souter) would give respondents more than respondents themselves dared to ask. Respondents frankly admitted at theauthorities by "preventing" an individual officer. If these dissenters' interpretation of $ 1985(3) were adopted, conspiracies to prevent individualstate officers from acting would be left entirely uncovered. (Section1985(1) applies only to officers of the United States--which is, of course,the basic distinction between the two provisions.)Neither dissent explains why the application of enough force to impedelaw enforcement, though not to "overwhelm" or "supplant" it, does notconstitute a "hindering"; or, indeed, why only "force" and not bribery ormisdirection must be the means of hindrance or prevention. Nothing inthe text justifies these limitations. Justice Souter's faith in the "severely limited" character of the hindrance clause also depends upon histaking no position on whether the clause protects federal statutory rightsand state-protected rights, post, at 303-304, n. 9.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT285Cite as: 506 U. S. 263 (1993)Opinion of the Courtoriginal argument, and even at reargument, that the DistrictCourt never concluded that impeding law enforcement wasthe purpose of petitioners' protests, and that the "hindrance"claim, if valid in law, required a remand. They were obviously correct.16IIIBecause respondents were not entitled to relief under$ 1985(3), they were also not entitled to attorney's fees andcosts under 42 U. S. C. $ 1988. We therefore vacate thataward.Petitioners seek even more. They contend that respondents' $ 1985(3) claims were so insubstantial that the DistrictCourt lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the action, including the pendent state claims; and that the injunctionshould therefore be vacated and the entire action dismissed.We do not agree. While respondents' $ 1985(3) causes of action fail, they were not, prior to our deciding of this case,"wholly insubstantial and frivolous," Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S.678, 682-683 (1946), so as to deprive the District Court ofjurisdiction.It may be, of course, that even though the District Courthad jurisdiction over the state-law claims, judgment on thoseclaims alone cannot support the injunction that was entered.We leave that question for consideration on remand.16 Because of our disposition of this case, we need not address whetherthe District Court erred by issuing an injunction, despite the language in$ 1985(3) authorizing only "an action for the recovery of damages occasioned by such injury or deprivation." It is curious, however, that thedissenters, though quick to reach and resolve the unpresented "hindrance"issue, assume without analysis the propriety of the injunctive relief thatthey approve--though the contrary was asserted by the United Statesas amicus in support of petitioners, and the issue was addressed byboth parties in supplemental briefs on reargument.

ALEXANDRIA WOMEN'S HEALTH CLINICOpinion of the Court* * *Justice Stevens' dissent observes that this is "a caseabout the exercise of federal power to control an interstateconspiracy to commit illegal acts," post, at 344, and involves"no ordinary trespass," or "picketing of a local retailer," but"the kind of zealous, politically motivated, lawless conductthat led to the enactment of the Ku Klux Act in 1871 andgave it its name," post, at 313. Those are certainly evocative assertions, but as far as the point of law we have beenasked to decide is concerned, they are irrelevant. We construe the statute, not the views of "most members of thecitizenry." Post, at 344. By its terms, $ 1985(3) covers concerted action by as few as two persons, and does not requireeven interstate (much less nationwide) scope. It applies nomore and no less to completely local action by two part-timeprotesters than to nationwide action by a full-time force ofthousands.17 And under our precedents it simply does notapply to the sort of action at issue here.Trespassing upon private property is unlawful in allStates, as is, in many States and localities, intentionally obstructing the entrance to private premises. These offensesmay be prosecuted criminally under state law, and may alsobe the basis for state civil damages. They do not, however,give rise to a federal cause of action simply because theirobjective is to prevent the performance of abortions, anymore than they do so (as we have held) when their objectiveis to stifle free speech.17 Justice Stevens chides us for invoking text here, whereas (he says)we rely instead upon "statutory purpose" for our class-based animus requirement--"selectively employ[ing] both approaches to give [$ 1985(3)]its narrowest possible construction." Post, at 343, n. 37. That is notso. For our class-based animus requirement we rely, plainly and simply,upon our holding in Griffin, whatever approach Griffin may have used.That holding is (though Justice Stevens might wish otherwise) an integral part of our jurisprudence extending $ 1985(3) to purely privateconspiracies.506us2$u18 08-23-96 18:59:07 PAGES OPINPGT287Cite as: 506 U.
