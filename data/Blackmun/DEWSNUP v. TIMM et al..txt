We are confronted in this case with an issue concerning$ 506(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U. S. C. $ 506(d).1 May*Michael Fox Mivasair and Henry J. Sommer filed a brief for the Consumers Education and Protective Association, Inc., as amicus curiae urging reversal.1 Section 506 provides in full:"(a) An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property inwhich the estate has an interest, or that is subject to setoff under section553 of this title, is a secured claim to the extent of the value of suchcreditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property, or to the extentof the amount subject to setoff, as the case may be, and is an unsecuredclaim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest or the amount502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT412 DEWSNUP v. TIMMOpinion of the Courta debtor "strip down" a creditor's lien on real property tothe value of the collateral, as judicially determined, whenthat value is less than the amount of the claim secured bythe lien?IOn June 1, 1978, respondents loaned $119,000 to petitionerAletha Dewsnup and her husband, T. LaMar Dewsnup, sincedeceased. The loan was accompanied by a Deed of Trustgranting a lien on two parcels of Utah farmland owned bythe Dewsnups.Petitioner defaulted the following year. Under the termsof the Deed of Trust, respondents at that point could haveproceeded against the real property collateral by accelerating the maturity of the loan, issuing a notice of default, andselling the land at a public foreclosure sale to satisfy thedebt. See also Utah Code Ann. $$ 57-1-20 to 57-1-37 (1990and Supp. 1991).so subject to setoff is less than the amount of such allowed claim.

S. 410 (1992)Opinion of the CourtRespondents did issue a notice of default in 1981. Beforethe foreclosure sale took place, however, petitioner soughtreorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code,11 U. S. C. $ 1101et seq. That bankruptcy petition was dismissed, as was a subsequent Chapter 11 petition. In June1984, petitioner filed a petition seeking liquidation underChapter 7 of the Code, 11 U. S. C. $ 701et seq. Because ofthe pendency of these bankruptcy proceedings, respondentswere not able to proceed to the foreclosure sale. See 11U. S. C. $ 362 (1988 ed. and Supp. II).In 1987, petitioner filed the present adversary proceedingin the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Utah seeking,pursuant to $ 506, to "avoid" a portion of respondents' lien.App. 3. Petitioner represented that the debt of approximately $120,000 then owed to respondents exceeded the fairmarket value of the land and that, therefore, the BankruptcyCourt should reduce the lien to that value. According topetitioner, this was compelled by the interrelationship of thesecurity-reducing provision of $ 506(a) and the lien-voidingprovision of $ 506(d). Under $ 506(a) ("An allowed claim of acreditor secured by a lien on property in which the estatehas an interest . . . is a secured claim to the extent of thevalue of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest insuch property"), respondents would have an "allowed secured claim" only to the extent of the judicially determinedvalue of their collateral. And under $ 506(d) ("To the extentthat a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not anallowed secured claim, such lien is void"), the court wouldbe required to void the lien as to the remaining portion ofrespondents' claim, because the remaining portion was notan "allowed secured claim" within the meaning of $ 506(a).The Bankruptcy Court refused to grant this relief. In reDewsnup, 87 B. R. 676 (1988). After a trial, it determinedthat the then value of the land subject to the Deed of Trustwas $39,000. It indulged in the assumption that the property had been abandoned by the trustee pursuant to $ 554,502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT414 DEWSNUP v. TIMMOpinion of the Courtand reasoned that once property was abandoned it no longerfell within the reach of $ 506(a), which applies only to "property in which the estate has an interest," and therefore wasnot covered by $ 506(d).The United States District Court, without a supportingopinion, summarily affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's judgment of dismissal with prejudice. App. to Pet. for Cert. 12a.The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, in its turn,also affirmed. In re Dewsnup, 908 F. 2d 588 (1990). Start-ing from the "fundamental premise" of $ 506(a) that a claimis subject to reduction in security only when the estate hasan interest in the property, the court reasoned that becausethe estate had no interest in abandoned property, $ 506(a) didnot apply (nor, by implication, did $ 506(d)). Id., at 590-591.The court then noted that a contrary result would be incon-sistent with $ 722 under which a debtor has a limited rightto redeem certain personal property. Id., at 592.Because the result reached by the Court of Appeals wasat odds with that reached by the Third Circuit in Gaglia v.First Federal Savings & Loan Assn., 889 F. 2d 1304, 1306-1311 (1989), and was expressly recognized by the Tenth Circuit as being in conflict, see 908 F. 2d, at 591, we grantedcertiorari. 498 U. S. 1081 (1991).IIAs we read their several submissions, the parties and theiramici are not in agreement in their respective approachesto the problem of statutory interpretation that confronts us.Petitioner-debtor takes the position that $$ 506(a) and 506(d)are complementary and to be read together. Because, under$ 506(a), a claim is secured only to the extent of the judiciallydetermined value of the real property on which the lien isfixed, a debtor can void a lien on the property pursuant to$ 506(d) to the extent the claim is no longer secured and thusis not "an allowed secured claim." In other words, $ 506(a)bifurcates classes of claims allowed under $ 502 into secured502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT415Cite as: 502 U. S. 410 (1992)Opinion of the Courtclaims and unsecured claims; any portion of an allowed claimdeemed to be unsecured under $ 506(a) is not an "allowedsecured claim" within the lien-voiding scope of $ 506(d).Petitioner argues that there is no exception for unsecuredproperty abandoned by the trustee.Petitioner's amicus argues that the plain language of$ 506(d) dictates that the proper portion of an undersecuredlien on property in a Chapter 7 case is void whether or notthe property is abandoned by the trustee. It further arguesthat the rationale of the Court of Appeals would lead to evis-ceration of the debtor's right of redemption and the elimination of an undersecured creditor's ability to participate in thedistribution of the estate's assets.Respondents primarily assert that $ 506(d) is not, as petitioner would have it, "rigidly tied" to $ 506(a), Brief for Respondents 7. They argue that $ 506(a) performs the functionof classifying claims by true secured status at the time ofdistribution of the estate to ensure fairness to unsecuredclaimants. In contrast, the lien-voiding $ 506(d) is directedto the time at which foreclosure is to take place, and, wherethe trustee has abandoned the property, no bankruptcy distributional purpose is served by voiding the lien.In the alternative, respondents, joined by the UnitedStates as amicus curiae, argue more broadly that the words"allowed secured claim" in $ 506(d) need not be read as anindivisible term of art defined by reference to $ 506(a), whichby its terms is not a definitional provision. Rather, thewords should be read term-by-term to refer to any claim thatis, first, allowed, and, second, secured. Because there is noquestion that the claim at issue here has been "allowed" pursuant to $ 502 of the Code and is secured by a lien with recourse to the underlying collateral, it does not come withinthe scope of $ 506(d), which voids only liens corresponding toclaims that have not been allowed and secured. This reading of $ 506(d), according to respondents and the UnitedStates, gives the provision the simple and sensible function502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT416 DEWSNUP v. TIMMOpinion of the Courtof voiding a lien whenever a claim secured by the lien itselfhas not been allowed. It ensures that the Code's determination not to allow the underlying claim against the debtorpersonally is given full effect by preventing its assertionagainst the debtor's property.2Respondents point out that pre-Code bankruptcy law preserved liens like respondents' and that there is nothing inthe Code's legislative history that reflects any intent to alterthat law. Moreover, according to respondents, the "freshstart" policy cannot justify an impairment of respondents'property rights, for the fresh start does not extend to an inrem claim against property but is limited to a discharge ofpersonal liability.IIIThe foregoing recital of the contrasting positions of therespective parties and their amici demonstrates that $ 506of the Bankruptcy Code and its relationship to other provisions of that Code do embrace some ambiguities. See 3 Collier on Bankruptcy, ch. 506 and, in particular, || 506.07 (15thed. 1991). Hypothetical applications that come to mind andthose advanced at oral argument illustrate the difficulty ofinterpreting the statute in a single opinion that would applyto all possible fact situations. We therefore focus upon the2 Respondents expressly stated in their brief and twice again at oralargument that they adopted as an alternative position the United States'interpretation of $ 506(d). Brief for Respondents 40, n. 33; Tr. of OralArg. 14, 20. In dissent, however, Justice Scalia contends that respondents have not taken the same position as the United States on this issue.According to the dissent, the United States has taken the position that "alien only `secures' the claim in question up to the value of the security thatis the object of the lien--and only up to that value is the lien subject toavoidance under $ 506(d)." Post, at 424. In fact, the United States says:"Under [petitioner's] reading, Section 506(d) would operate to reduce thecreditor's lien to the value of the allowed secured claim described in Section 506(a). In our view, this reading makes no sense." Brief for UnitedStates as Amicus Curiae 5.502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT417Cite as: 502 U. S. 410 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcase before us and allow other facts to await their legal reso-lution on another day.We conclude that respondents' alternative position, es-poused also by the United States, although not without itsdifficulty, generally is the better of the several approaches.Therefore, we hold that $ 506(d) does not allow petitioner to"strip down" respondents' lien, because respondents' claim issecured by a lien and has been fully allowed pursuant to$ 502. Were we writing on a clean slate, we might be in-clined to agree with petitioner that the words "allowed secured claim" must take the same meaning in $ 506(d) as in$ 506(a).3 But, given the ambiguity in the text, we are notconvinced that Congress intended to depart from the pre-Code rule that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.1. The practical effect of petitioner's argument is to freezethe creditor's secured interest at the judicially determinedvaluation. By this approach, the creditor would lose thebenefit of any increase in the value of the property by thetime of the foreclosure sale. The increase would accrue tothe benefit of the debtor, a result some of the parties describe as a "windfall."We think, however, that the creditor's lien stays with thereal property until the foreclosure. That is what was bar-gained for by the mortgagor and the mortgagee. The voidness language sensibly applies only to the security aspect ofthe lien and then only to the real deficiency in the security.Any increase over the judicially determined valuation duringbankruptcy rightly accrues to the benefit of the creditor, notto the benefit of the debtor and not to the benefit of otherunsecured creditors whose claims have been allowed and whohad nothing to do with the mortgagor-mortgagee bargain.Such surely would be the result had the lienholder stayedaloof from the bankruptcy proceeding (subject, of course, to3 Accordingly, we express no opinion as to whether the words "allowedsecured claim" have different meaning in other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT418 DEWSNUP v. TIMMOpinion of the Courtthe power of other persons or entities to pull him into theproceeding pursuant to $ 501), and we see no reason why hisacquiescence in that proceeding should cause him to experi-ence a forfeiture of the kind the debtor proposes. It is truethat his participation in the bankruptcy results in his havingthe benefit of an allowed unsecured claim as well as his allowed secured claim, but that does not strike us as properrecompense for what petitioner proposes by way of the elimination of the remainder of the lien.2. This result appears to have been clearly established before the passage of the 1978 Act. Under the BankruptcyAct of 1898, a lien on real property passed through bankruptcy unaffected. This Court recently acknowledged thatthis was so. See Farrey v. Sanderfoot, 500 U. S. 291, 297(1991) ("Ordinarily, liens and other secured interests survivebankruptcy"); Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U. S. 78, 84(1991) ("Rather, a bankruptcy discharge extinguishes onlyone mode of enforcing a claim--namely, an action against thedebtor in personam--while leaving intact another--namely,an action against the debtorin rem").43. Apart from reorganization proceedings, see 11 U. S. C.$$ 616(1) and (10) (1976 ed.), no provision of the pre-Code4 Section 67d of the 1898 Act, 30 Stat. 564, made this explicit:"Liens given or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of or infraud upon this Act, and for a present consideration, which have beenrecorded according to law, if record thereof was necessary in order toimpart notice, shall not be affected by this Act."The Court, with respect to this statute, has said: "Section 67d . . . declaresthat liens given or accepted in good faith and not in contemplation of orin fraud upon this act, shall not be affected by it." City of Richmond v.Bird, 249 U. S. 174, 177 (1919).This precise statutory language did not appear in a reorganization of thesection in the Chandler Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 840. A respected bankruptcyauthority convincingly explained that this was done not to remove the ruleof validity but because "the draftsmen of the 1938 Act desired generally tospecify only what should be invalid." 4B Collier on Bankruptcy || 70.70,p. 771 (14th ed. 1978) (emphasis in original). The alteration had no substantive effect. Oppenheimer v. Oldham, 178 F. 2d 386, 389 (CA5 1949).502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT419Cite as: 502 U. S. 410 (1992)Opinion of the Courtstatute permitted involuntary reduction of the amount of acreditor's lien for any reason other than payment on the debt.Our cases reveal the Court's concern about this. In Long v.Bullard, 117 U. S. 617, 620-621 (1886), the Court held that adischarge in bankruptcy does not release real estate of thedebtor from the lien of a mortgage created by him beforethe bankruptcy. And inLouisville Joint Stock Land Bankv. Radford, 295 U. S. 555 (1935), the Court considered addi-tions to the Bankruptcy Act effected by the Frazier-LemkeAct, 48 Stat. 1289. There the Court noted that the latterAct's "avowed object is to take from the mortgagee rights inthe specific property held as security; and to that end `toscale down the indebtedness' to the present value of theproperty." 295 U. S., at 594. The Court invalidated thatstatute under the Takings Clause. It further observed: "Noinstance has been found, except under the Frazier-LemkeAct, of either a statute or decision compelling the mortgageeto relinquish the property to the mortgagor free of the lienunless the debt was paid in full." Id., at 579.Congress must have enacted the Code with a full understanding of this practice. See H. R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 357(1977) ("Subsection (d) permits liens to pass through thebankruptcy case unaffected").4. When Congress amends the bankruptcy laws, it doesnot write "on a clean slate." See Emil v. Hanley, 318 U. S.515, 521 (1943). Furthermore, this Court has been reluctantto accept arguments that would interpret the Code, howevervague the particular language under consideration might be,to effect a major change in pre-Code practice that is not thesubject of at least some discussion in the legislative history.See United Savings Assn. of Texas v. Timbers of InwoodForest Associates, Ltd., 484 U. S. 365, 380 (1988). See alsoPennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495U. S. 552, 563 (1990); United States v. Ron Pair Enterprises,Inc., 489 U. S. 235, 244-245 (1989). Of course, where the language is unambiguous, silence in the legislative history can502us2$27F 01-22-99 08:37:00 PAGES OPINPGT420 DEWSNUP v. TIMMScalia, J., dissentingnot be controlling. But, given the ambiguity here, to attrib-ute to Congress the intention to grant a debtor the broadnew remedy against allowed claims to the extent that theybecome "unsecured" for purposes of $ 506(a) without the newremedy's being mentioned somewhere in the Code itself orin the annals of Congress is not plausible, in our view, and iscontrary to basic bankruptcy principles.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
