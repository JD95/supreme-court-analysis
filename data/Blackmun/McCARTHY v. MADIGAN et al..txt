The issue in this case is whether a federal prisoner mustresort to the internal grievance procedure promulgated bythe Federal Bureau of Prisons before he may initiate a suit,pursuant to the authority ofBivens v. Six Unknown Fed.Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), solely for money damages.

MADIGANOpinion of the CourtIWhile he was a prisoner in the federal penitentiary atLeavenworth, petitioner John J. McCarthy filed a pro se com-plaint in the United States District Court for the District ofKansas against four prison employees: the hospital adminis-trator, the chief psychologist, another psychologist, and aphysician.

On the first page of his complaint, he wrote:"This Complaint seeks Money Damages Only."

MADIGANOpinion of the Courtinary fact-finding" to determine "whether there is a possibleBivens cause of action." Ibid. Accordingly, " `[a]lthoughthe administrative apparatus could not award money dam-ages . . . , administrative consideration of the possibility ofcorrective action and a record would have aided a court inmeasuring liability and determining theextent of the dam-ages.' " Ibid., quoting Goar v. Civiletti, 688 F. 2d 27, 29(CA6 1982) (emphasis in original). Exhaustion of the gen-eral grievance procedure was required notwithstanding thefact that McCarthy's request was solely for money damages.IIThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies isone among related doctrines--including abstention, finality,and ripeness--that govern the timing of federal-court deci-sionmaking. Of "paramount importance" to any exhaustioninquiry is congressional intent. Patsy v. Board of Regentsof Florida, 457 U. S. 496, 501 (1982). Where Congress specifically mandates, exhaustion is required. Coit Independ-ence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S. 561, 579 (1989);Patsy, 457 U. S., at 502, n. 4. But where Congress has notclearly required exhaustion, sound judicial discretion governs. McGee v. United States, 402 U. S. 479, 483, n. 6 (1971).See alsoPatsy, 457 U. S., at 518 (White, J., concurring inpart) ("[E]xhaustion is `a rule of judicial administration,' . . .and unless Congress directs otherwise, rightfully subject tocrafting by judges"). Nevertheless, even in this field of judicial discretion, appropriate deference to Congress' powerto prescribe the basic procedural scheme under which a claimmay be heard in a federal court requires fashioning of ex-haustion principles in a manner consistent with congressional intent and any applicable statutory scheme. Id., at501-502, and n. 4.AThis Court long has acknowledged the general rule thatparties exhaust prescribed administrative remedies before503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT145Cite as: 503 U. S. 140 (1992)Opinion of the Courtseeking relief from the federal courts. See, e. g., Myers v.Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U. S. 41, 50-51, and n. 9(1938) (discussing cases as far back as 1898). Exhaustionis required because it serves the twin purposes of protecting administrative agency authority and promoting judicialefficiency.As to the first of these purposes, the exhaustion doctrinerecognizes the notion, grounded in deference to Congress'delegation of authority to coordinate branches of Government, that agencies, not the courts, ought to have primaryresponsibility for the programs that Congress has chargedthem to administer. Exhaustion concerns apply with particular force when the action under review involves exercise ofthe agency's discretionary power or when the agency proceedings in question allow the agency to apply its specialexpertise. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S. 185, 194(1969). See also Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S. 467,484 (1986). The exhaustion doctrine also acknowledges thecommonsense notion of dispute resolution that an agencyought to have an opportunity to correct its own mistakeswith respect to the programs it administers before it ishaled into federal court. Correlatively, exhaustion principles apply with special force when "frequent and deliberate flouting of administrative processes" could weaken anagency's effectiveness by encouraging disregard of its procedures. McKart v. United States, 395 U. S., at 195.As to the second of the purposes, exhaustion promotes judicial efficiency in at least two ways. When an agency hasthe opportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial controversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal appeals maybe avoided. See, e. g., Parisi v. Davidson, 405 U. S. 34, 37(1972); McKart v. United States, 395 U. S., at 195. And evenwhere a controversy survives administrative review, exhaustion of the administrative procedure may produce a usefulrecord for subsequent judicial consideration, especially in acomplex or technical factual context. See, e. g., Weinberger503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT146 McCARTHY v. MADIGANOpinion of the Courtv. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 765 (1975) (exhaustion may allowagency "to compile a record which is adequate for judicialreview"). BNotwithstanding these substantial institutional interests,federal courts are vested with a "virtually unflagging obligation" to exercise the jurisdiction given them. ColoradoRiver Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U. S.800, 817-818 (1976). "We have no more right to decline theexercise of jurisdiction which is given, than to usurp thatwhich is not given." Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404(1821). Accordingly, this Court has declined to require ex-haustion in some circumstances even where administrativeand judicial interests would counsel otherwise. In deter-mining whether exhaustion is required, federal courts mustbalance the interest of the individual in retaining promptaccess to a federal judicial forum against countervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion. "[A]dministrativeremedies need not be pursued if the litigant's interests inimmediate judicial review outweigh the government's inter-ests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that theexhaustion doctrine is designed to further." West v. Berg-land, 611 F. 2d 710, 715 (CA8 1979), cert. denied, 449 U. S.821 (1980). Application of this balancing principle is "in-tensely practical," Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S., at484, citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U. S. 319, 331, n. 11(1976), because attention is directed to both the nature ofthe claim presented and the characteristics of the particularadministrative procedure provided.CThis Court's precedents have recognized at least threebroad sets of circumstances in which the interests of the individual weigh heavily against requiring administrative ex-haustion. First, requiring resort to the administrative remedy may occasion undue prejudice to subsequent assertion503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT147Cite as: 503 U. S. 140 (1992)Opinion of the Courtof a court action. Such prejudice may result, for example,from an unreasonable or indefinite timeframe for administrative action. See Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U. S. 564, 575, n. 14(1973) (administrative remedy deemed inadequate "[m]ostoften . . . because of delay by the agency"). See also CoitIndependence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U. S., at 587 ("Be-cause the Bank Board's regulations do not place a reasonabletime limit on FSLIC's consideration of claims, Coit cannot berequired to exhaust those procedures");Walker v. SouthernR. Co., 385 U. S. 196, 198 (1966) (possible delay of 10 years inadministrative proceedings makes exhaustion unnecessary);Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., 270 U. S. 587, 591-592(1926) (claimant "is not required indefinitely to await a decision of the rate-making tribunal before applying to a federalcourt for equitable relief "). Even where the administrativedecisionmaking schedule is otherwise reasonable and definite, a particular plaintiff may suffer irreparable harm if unable to secure immediate judicial consideration of his claim.Bowen v. City of New York, 476 U. S., at 483 (disabilitybenefit claimants "would be irreparably injured were theexhaustion requirement now enforced against them"); Aircraft & Diesel Equipment Corp. v. Hirsch, 331 U. S. 752, 773(1947) ("impending irreparable injury flowing from delay incident to following the prescribed procedure" may contributeto finding that exhaustion is not required). By the sametoken, exhaustion principles apply with less force when anindividual's failure to exhaust may preclude a defense tocriminal liability. Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494,497, n. 5 (1977) (plurality opinion); McKart v. United States,395 U. S., at 197.Second, an administrative remedy may be inadequate "because of some doubt as to whether the agency was empowered to grant effective relief." Gibson v. Berryhill, 411U. S., at 575, n. 14. For example, an agency, as a preliminarymatter, may be unable to consider whether to grant reliefbecause it lacks institutional competence to resolve the par503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT148 McCARTHY v. MADIGANOpinion of the Courtticular type of issue presented, such as the constitutionalityof a statute. See,e. g., Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S.,at 497, n. 5; Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U. S. 67, 76 (1976). Ina similar vein, exhaustion has not been required where thechallenge is to the adequacy of the agency procedure itself,such that " `the question of the adequacy of the administra-tive remedy . . . [is] for all practical purposes identical withthe merits of [the plaintiff 's] lawsuit.' " Barry v. Barchi, 443U. S. 55, 63, n. 10 (1979) (quotingGibson v. Berryhill, 411U. S., at 575). Alternatively, an agency may be competentto adjudicate the issue presented, but still lack authorityto grant the type of relief requested. McNeese v. Board ofEd. for Community Unit School Dist. 187, 373 U. S. 668,675 (1963) (students seeking to integrate public school neednot file complaint with school superintendent because the"Superintendent himself apparently has no power to ordercorrective action" except to request the Attorney General tobring suit); Montana National Bank of Billings v. Yellowstone County, 276 U. S. 499, 505 (1928) (taxpayer seekingrefund not required to exhaust where "any such application[would have been] utterly futile since the county board ofequalization was powerless to grant any appropriate relief "in face of prior controlling court decision).Third, an administrative remedy may be inadequate wherethe administrative body is shown to be biased or has otherwise predetermined the issue before it. Gibson v. Berryhill, 411 U. S., at 575, n. 14; Houghton v. Shafer, 392U. S. 639, 640 (1968) (in view of Attorney General's submission that the challenged rules of the prison were "validlyand correctly applied to petitioner," requiring administrativereview through a process culminating with the AttorneyGeneral "would be to demand a futile act"); Association ofNational Advertisers, Inc. v.

Patsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S.496 (1982). IIIIn light of these general principles, we conclude that peti-tioner McCarthy need not have exhausted his constitutionalclaim for money damages. As a preliminary matter, we findthat Congress has not meaningfully addressed the appropriateness of requiring exhaustion in this context. Althoughrespondents' interests are significant, we are left with a firmconviction that, given the type of claim McCarthy raises andthe particular characteristics of the Bureau's general grievance procedure, McCarthy's individual interests outweighcountervailing institutional interests favoring exhaustion.ATurning first to congressional intent, we note that the gen-eral grievance procedure was neither enacted nor mandatedby Congress. Respondents, however, urge that Congress,in effect, has acted to require exhaustion by delegatingpower to the Attorney General and the Bureau of Prisonsto control and manage the federal prison system. See 18U. S. C. $$ 4001(b) and 4042. Brief for Respondents 3, 16;Tr. of Oral Arg. 41-42. We think respondents confuse whatCongress could be claimed to allow by implication with whatCongress affirmatively has requested or required. By delegating authority, in the most general of terms, to the Bureauto administer the federal prison system, Congress cannot besaid to have spoken to the particular issue whether prisonersin the custody of the Bureau should have direct access to thefederal courts.Respondents next argue that Congress, by enactment of$ 7 of the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 94Stat. 352, 42 U. S. C. $ 1997e, has articulated a policy favoring503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT150 McCARTHY v. MADIGANOpinion of the Courtexhaustion of the prison grievance procedure prior to thefiling of a constitutional claim against prison officials. Section 1997e imposes a limited exhaustion requirement for aclaim brought by a state prisoner under Rev. Stat. $ 1979,42 U. S. C. $ 1983, provided that the underlying state prisonadministrative remedy meets specified standards. SeePatsy v. Board of Regents of Florida, 457 U. S., at 507-512.Section 1997e has no direct application in this case, becauseat issue here is a Bivens claim by a federal prisoner againstfederal prison officials. We find it significant that Congress,in enacting $ 1997e, stopped short of imposing a parallel requirement in the federal prison context.Section 1997e is not only inapplicable to Bivens claims,but--by its own terms--cuts against respondents' claim thatthe particular procedure now at issue need be exhausted.First, unlike the rule of exhaustion proposed here, $ 1997edoes not authorize dismissal of an action for failure to exhaust. Instead, it provides that the action is to be stayedfor a maximum of 90 days. See $ 1997e(a)(1). Second,$ 1997e does not mechanically require exhaustion in everycase where an acceptable state procedure is in place.Rather, it directs federal courts to abstain "if the courtbelieves that such a [waiting] requirement would be appropriate and in the interests of justice." $ 1997e(a)(1). Inother words, if an inmate fails to meet filing deadlines underan administrative scheme, a court has ample discretion todetermine that exhaustion nonetheless should be forgone.Third, in contrast to the absence of any provision for theaward of money damages under the Bureau's general grievance procedure, the statute conditions exhaustion on the existence of "effective administrative remedies." 4 It is diffi4 The Conference Committee Report states: "It is the intent of the Congress that the court not find such a requirement [of exhaustion] appropriate in those situations in which the action brought . . . raises issues503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT151Cite as: 503 U. S. 140 (1992)Opinion of the Courtcult to see why a stricter rule of exhaustion than Congressitself has required in the state prison context should applyin the federal prison context.Respondents also argue that requiring exhaustion is appropriate because Bivens relief gives way when necessaryto accommodate either the effective functioning of Government or an articulated congressional policy. Brief for Re-spondents 15. We have recognized that aBivens remedydoes not lie in two situations: (1) where Congress has provided an equally effective alternative remedy and declaredit to be a substitute for recovery under the Constitution, and(2) where, in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,special factors counsel hesitation.Carlson v. Green, 446U. S. 14, 18-19 (1980). As to the first exception, Congressdid not create the remedial scheme at issue here and thatscheme, in any case, as noted above, cannot be considered tobe equally effective with respect to a claim for money dam-ages. As to the second exception, respondents appear toconfuse the presence of special factors with any factorscounseling hesitation. InCarlson, the Court held that "spe-cial factors" do not free prison officials from Bivens liability,because prison officials do not enjoy an independent statusin our constitutional scheme, nor are they likely to be undulyinhibited in the performance of their duties by the assertionof a Bivens claim. Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S., at 19.Interpreting the "special factors" exception in Schweikerv.Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412 (1988), and in Bush v. Lucas, 462which cannot, in reasonable probability, be resolved by the grievance resolution system . . . ." H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 96-897, p. 15 (1980).The Attorney General, charged under the statute with certifying theadequacy of state administrative remedial schemes, has provided by regulation: "The [state] grievance procedure shall afford a successful grievanta meaningful remedy." 28 CFR $ 40.6 (1991) (emphasis added). At thetime of promulgating these regulations, the Department of Justice observed on the public record: "Presumably, where monetary relief was thesole adequate remedy and could not be obtained through a grievance procedure, exhaustion would not be appropriate." 46 Fed. Reg. 3845 (1981).503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT152 McCARTHY v. MADIGANOpinion of the CourtU. S. 367 (1983), the Court found the Bivens remedy dis-placed because Congress had legislated an elaborate andcomprehensive remedial scheme. Schweiker, 487 U. S., at425; Bush, 462 U. S., at 388. "When the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what itconsiders adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutionalviolations that may occur in the course of its administra-tion, we have not created additionalBivens remedies."Schweiker, 487 U. S., at 423. Here Congress has enactednothing. BBecause Congress has not required exhaustion of a federalprisoner's Bivens claim, we turn to an evaluation of the individual and institutional interests at stake in this case. Thegeneral grievance procedure heavily burdens the individualinterests of the petitioning inmate in two ways. First, theprocedure imposes short, successive filing deadlines that create a high risk of forfeiture of a claim for failure to comply.Second, the administrative "remedy" does not authorize anaward of monetary damages--the only relief requested byMcCarthy in this action. The combination of these featuresmeans that the prisoner seeking only money damages haseverything to lose and nothing to gain from being requiredto exhaust his claim under the internal grievance procedure.The filing deadlines for the grievance procedure requirean inmate, within 15 days of the precipitating incident, notonly to attempt to resolve his grievance informally but alsoto file a formal written complaint with the prison warden.28 CFR $ 542.13 (1991). Then, he must successively hurdle20-day and 30-day deadlines to advance to the end of thegrievance process. $ 542.15. Other than the Bureau's general and quite proper interest in having early notice of anyclaim, we have not been apprised of any urgency or exigencyjustifying this timetable. Cf. Yakus v. United States, 321U. S. 414, 435 (1944) ("The sixty days' period allowed for protest of the Administrator's regulations cannot be said to be503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT153Cite as: 503 U. S. 140 (1992)Opinion of the Courtunreasonably short in view of the urgency and exigencies ofwartime price regulation"). As a practical matter, the filingdeadlines, of course, may pose little difficulty for the knowledgeable inmate accustomed to grievances and court actions.But they are a likely trap for the inexperienced and unwaryinmate, ordinarily indigent and unrepresented by counsel,with a substantial claim.Respondents argue that the deadlines are not jurisdictional and may be extended for any "valid" reason. See 28CFR $$ 542.13(b) and 542.15 (1991). Yet the regulations donot elaborate upon what a "valid" reason is. Moreover,it appears that prison officials--perhaps the very officialssubject to suit--are charged with determining what is a"valid" reason.All in all, these deadlines require a good deal of an inmateat the peril of forfeiting his claim for money damages. The"first" of "the principles that necessarily frame our analysisof prisoners' constitutional claims" is that "federal courtsmust take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims ofprison inmates." Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987).Because a prisoner ordinarily is divested of the privilegeto vote, the right to file a court action might be said to behis remaining most "fundamental political right, becausepreservative of all rights." Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U. S.356, 370 (1886). The rapid filing deadlines counsel stronglyagainst exhaustion as a prerequisite to the filing of a federalcourt action.55 Petitioner concedes that if his complaint contained a prayer for injunctive relief, exhaustion principles would apply differently. Brief for Petitioner 20, n. 20. Were injunctive relief sought, the grievance procedureprobably would be capable of producing the type of corrective action desired. Additionally, because of the continuing nature of conduct subjectto injunctive relief, the short filing deadlines would pose less difficultybecause the limitations period would be triggered anew by ongoingconduct.503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT154 McCARTHY v. MADIGANOpinion of the CourtAs we have noted, the grievance procedure does not in-clude any mention of the award of monetary relief. Respondents argue that this should not matter, because "in mostcases there are other things that the inmate wants." Tr. ofOral Arg. 30. This may be true in some instances. But wecannot presume, as a general matter, that when a litiganthas deliberately forgone any claim for injunctive relief andhas singled out discrete past wrongs, specifically requestingmonetary compensation only, that he is likely interested in"other things." The Bureau, in any case, is always free tooffer an inmate administrative relief in return for with-drawal of his lawsuit. We conclude that the absence of anymonetary remedy in the grievance procedure also weighsheavily against imposing an exhaustion requirement.In the alternative, respondents argue that, despite the ab-sence of any provision in the general grievance procedure forthe award of money damages, such damages in fact are avail-able for most prisoners asserting Bivens claims. As to Bivens claims that could have been brought under the FederalTort Claims Act (FTCA),6 respondents contend that a grievance asking for money damages can be "converted" by prisonofficials to a FTCA claim for which prison officials are au6 Respondents contend that Bivens claims are almost always categorizable as FTCA claims, especially in view of the Attorney General's concession that corrections guards are "law enforcement" officers within themeaning of the exception to the intentional-tort exception of the FTCA.Tr. of Oral Arg. 41. As to those claims that are not categorizable asFTCA claims, respondents concede that the Bureau of Prisons has no authority to offer a monetary settlement. Id., at 40. Instead, they contendthat the Department of Justice has a general settlement authority underthe federal regulations that might be exercised to dispose of general grievance claims. 28 CFR $ 50.15(c)(2) (1991). Nothing in the record indicatesthat this authority has ever been exercised to recompense a prisoner witha Bivens claim. Moreover, it is highly unlikely that a monetary settlement would be made in the course of an administrative proceeding, because the regulation provides that "[a]bsent exceptional circumstances" amonetary settlement will not be paid "before entry of an adverse verdict,judgment, or award." $ 50.15(c)(3).503us1$40F 11-13-95 22:14:51 PAGES OPINPGT155Cite as: 503 U. S. 140 (1992)Opinion of the Courtthorized, under 28 CFR $ 543.30 (1991), to award money dam-ages. This "conversion" authority does not appear in theregulations having to do with the grievance procedure,which raises substantial doubt that an inmate would havesufficient notice as to how his claim would be treated. Inany event, respondents have not pointed to anything in therecord showing that prison officials have a practice of converting a claim filed under the general grievance procedureto a claim under the FTCA procedure. We agree with petitioner that it is implausible to think that they do. The avail-ability of a money damages remedy is, at best, uncertain, andthe uncertainty of the administrative agency's authority toaward relief counsels against requiring exhaustion. SeeHillsborough v. Cromwell, 326 U. S. 620, 626 (1946); UnionPacific R. Co. v. Board of Comm'rs of Weld County, 247 U. S.282, 287 (1918).We do not find the interests of the Bureau of Prisons toweigh heavily in favor of exhaustion in view of the remedialscheme and particular claim presented here. To be sure, theBureau has a substantial interest in encouraging internalresolution of grievances and in preventing the underminingof its authority by unnecessary resort by prisoners to thefederal courts. But other institutional concerns relevant toexhaustion analysis appear to weigh in hardly at all. TheBureau's alleged failure to render medical care implicatesonly tangentially its authority to carry out the control andmanagement of the federal prisons. Furthermore, the Bureau does not bring to bear any special expertise on the typeof issue presented for resolution here.The interests of judicial economy do not stand to be advanced substantially by the general grievance procedure.No formal factfindings are made.

Even without fur-ther action by Congress, we do not foreclose the possibilitythat the Bureau itself may adopt an appropriate administra-tive procedure consistent with congressional intent.The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.
