Id., at 6. Petitioner contended that thedesignation of nonemployee UMWA "representatives" violated the principles of collective-bargaining representationunder the NLRA as well as the company's NLRA rights toexclude union organizers from its property. Id., at 9-10.Petitioner argued then, as it does here, that deprivation ofthese rights would harm the company irreparably by "giv[ing] the union organizing advantages in terms of access, personal contact and knowledge that would not be availableunder the labor laws, as well as enhanced credibility flowingfrom the appearance of government imprimatur." ReplyBrief for Petitioner 14.Petitioner additionally alleged that requiring it to challenge the MSHA's interpretation of 30 U. S. C. $ 813(f) and30 CFR pt. 40 through the statutory-review process wouldviolate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,since the company would be forced to choose between violating the Act and incurring possible escalating daily penalties,6or, on the other hand, complying with the designations andsuffering irreparable harm. The District Court enjoinedrespondents from enforcing 30 CFR pt. 40, finding that6 Petitioner relied for this proposition on a similar case in which a mineoperator refused to post the designation of a UMWA employee, a citationwas issued, and the MSHA ordered abatement within 24 hours and threatened to impose daily civil penalties. See Kerr-McGee Coal Corp. v. Secretary, 15 F. M. S. H. R. C. 352 (1993), appeal pending, No. 93-1250 (CADC).Kerr-McGee complied but contested the citation.

Thecourt stated:"[T]he gravamen of Thunder Basin's case is a disputeover an anticipated citation and penalty . . . .

Whether a statute is intended to preclude initial judicial review is determined fromthe statute's language, structure, and purpose, its legislativehistory, Block, 467 U.

TheAct establishes a detailed structure for reviewing violationsof "any mandatory health or safety standard, rule, order, orregulation promulgated" under the Act. $ 814(a). A mineoperator has 30 days to challenge before the Commission anycitation issued under the Act, after which time an uncontested order becomes "final" and "not subject to reviewby any court or agency." $$ 815(a) and (d).

The court of appeals must uphold findings of the Commission that are substantially supported by the record, ibid.,but may grant temporary relief pending final determinationof most proceedings, $ 816(2).Although the statute establishes that the Commission andthe courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to agency enforcement proceedings, the Act is faciallysilent with respect to pre-enforcement claims. The structure of the Mine Act, however, demonstrates that Congressintended to preclude challenges such as the present one.The Act's comprehensive review process does not distinguishbetween pre-enforcement and postenforcement challenges,9 30 U.

The Commission exercises discretionary reviewover any case involving, among others, a "substantial question of law, policy or discretion," $ 823(d)(2)(A)(ii)(IV), and may review on its own initiative any decision "contrary to law or Commission policy" or in which "anovel question of policy has been presented," $ 823(d)(2)(B). Any ALJdecision not granted review by the Commission within 40 days becomes a"final decision of the Commission." $ 823(d)(1).10 The statutory criteria are "the operator's history of previous violations, the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business ofthe operator charged, whether the operator was negligent, the effect onthe operator's ability to continue in business, the gravity of the violation,and the demonstrated good faith of the person charged in attempting toachieve rapid compliance." 30 U.

Contrary to petitioner's suggestion, Reply Brieffor Petitioner 3, actions before the Commission are initiatednot by the Secretary but by a mine operator who claims tobe aggrieved. See $ 815(a). The Act expressly authorizesdistrict court jurisdiction in only two provisions, $$ 818(a)and 820( j), which respectively empower the Secretary to en-join habitual violations of health and safety standards and tocoerce payment of civil penalties. Mine operators enjoy nocorresponding right11 but are to complain to the Commissionand then to the court of appeals.BThe legislative history of the Mine Act confirms this inter-pretation. At the time of the Act's passage, at least 1worker was killed and 66 miners were disabled every work-ing day in the Nation's mines. See S. Rep. No. 95-181, p. 4(1977), Legislative History of the Federal Mine Safety andHealth Act of 1977 (Committee Print prepared for the Subcommittee on Labor of the Senate Committee on Human Re-sources), Ser.

Petitioner misconstrues $ 960, which bars acertain form of relief but says nothing about the appropriate forum for achallenge. Section 815(a) similarly provides only that failure timely tochallenge a citation precludes review before the Commission and court ofappeals; it does not suggest that district court review is otherwise available. In light of the Act's other provisions granting district courts jurisdiction over challenges brought only by the Secretary, $$ 818(a) and 820(j),petitioner's argument based on the maxim expressio unius est exclusioalterius is unpersuasive.510us1$14F 06-18-97 17:31:47 PAGES OPINPGT210 THUNDER BASIN COAL CO. v. REICHOpinion of the Courtthen-existing enforcement measures.12 Under existing leg-islation,13 civil penalties were not always mandatory andwere too low to compel compliance, and enforcement washobbled by a cumbersome review process.14Congress expressed particular concern that under the pre-vious Coal Act mine operators could contest civil-penalty assessments de novo in federal district court once the adminis-trative review process was complete, thereby "seriouslyhamper[ing] the collection of civil penalties." 15 Concluding12 In February 1972, for example, 125 persons were killed when a minedam broke at Buffalo Creek in West Virginia. Leg. Hist. 592. See generally G. Stern, The Buffalo Creek Disaster (1976). Ninety-one miners diedof carbon monoxide asphyxiation in May 1972 at the Sunshine Silver Minein Idaho. In July 1972, nine miners were killed in a mine fire in Blacksville, W. Va., and in March 1976, 23 miners and 3 federal inspectors diedin methane gas explosions at the Scotia coal mine in Kentucky. Ibid.The House and Senate Committee Reports observed that these accidents resulted from hazards that were remediable and that in many casesalready had been the object of repeated enforcement efforts. See generally Leg. Hist. 362, 371, 592-593, 637. The 1972 Buffalo Creek disaster,for example, occurred after the mine had been assessed over $1.5 million inpenalties, "not one cent of which had been paid." Id., at 631. Sixty-twoventilation violations were noted in the two years prior to the Scotia gasexplosions, but the imposed penalties failed to coerce compliance. Id.,at 629-630.13 The 1977 Mine Act renamed and amended the Federal Coal MineHealth and Safety Act of 1969 (Coal Act), 91 Stat. 1290, and repealed theFederal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act of 1966, id., at 1322.14 The Senate Report found it "unacceptable that years after enactmentof these mine safety laws . . . [m]ine operators still find it cheaper to payminimal civil penalties than to make the capital investments necessary toadequately abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions, and there is still nomeans by which the government can bring habitual and chronic violatorsof the law into compliance." Leg. Hist. 592; see also id., at 597.15 Id., at 633. The Senate Report explained:"The Committee firmly believes that to effectively induce compliance,the penalty must be paid by the operator in reasonably close time proximity to the occurrence of the underlying violation. A number of problemswith the current penalty assessment and collection system interfere withthis.

S. District Courts.This encourages operators who are not pre-disposed to voluntarily payassessed penalties to pursue cases through the elaborate administrativeprocedure and then to seek redress in the Courts. Since the DistrictCourts are still reluctant to schedule trials on these cases, and the Department of Justice has been reluctant to pursue such cases in the courts, thematters generally languish at that stage, and the penalties go uncollected."Id., at 604.16 The Senate Report's citation, see Leg.

Secretary of Interior, 547 F. 2d 240 (CA4 1977) (holding that pre-enforcement district court challenges were not precludedunder the 1969 Coal Act), does not support petitioner's claim that Congress intended to preserve district court jurisdiction over pre-enforcementsuits.

In that case, this Court held that statutoryreview of certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, andCosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended by the DrugAmendments of 1962, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U. S. C. $ 301 et seq.,did not preclude district court jurisdiction over a preenforcement challenge to regulations promulgated underseparate provisions of that Act. In so holding, the Courtfound that the presence of a statutory saving clause, see 387U. S., at 144, and the statute's legislative history demonstrated "rather conclusively that the specific review provi-sions were designed to give an additional remedy and not tocut down more traditional channels of review," id., at 142.It concluded that Congress' primary concern in adopting theadministrative-review procedures was to supplement reviewof specific agency determinations over which traditionalforms of review might be inadequate. Id., at 142-144. Con-trary to petitioner's contentions, no comparable statutorylanguage or legislative intent is present here. Indeed, asdiscussed above, the Mine Act's text and legislative historysuggest precisely the opposite. The prospect that federaljurisdiction might thwart effective enforcement of the statute also was less immediate in Abbott Laboratories, sincetheAbbott petitioners did not attempt to stay enforcementof the challenged regulation pending judicial review, as petitioner did here.

Eldridge, for example, it was held that 42U. S.

C.1165 (1988), does not suggest otherwise, but simply held that declaratoryrelief from the Commission was unavailable for a question already underconsideration in the Court of Appeals.20 Cf. Weinberger v. Salfi, 422 U. S. 749, 762 (1975). This case thus doesnot present the "serious constitutional question" that would arise if anagency statute were construed to preclude all judicial review of a constitutional claim. See Bowen v. Michigan Academy of Family Physicians,476 U. S. 667, 681, n. 12 (1986).510us1$14F 06-18-97 17:31:47 PAGES OPINPGT216 THUNDER BASIN COAL CO. v. REICHOpinion of the CourtWe conclude that the Mine Act's comprehensive enforce-ment structure, combined with the legislative history's clearconcern with channeling and streamlining the enforcementprocess, establishes a "fairly discernible" intent to precludedistrict court review in the present case. See Block v. Community Nutrition Institute, 467 U. S., at 351. Petitioner'sclaims are "pre-enforcement" only because the company suedbefore a citation was issued, and its claims turn on a questionof statutory interpretation that can be meaningfully reviewed under the Mine Act. Had petitioner persisted in itsrefusal to post the designation, the Secretary would havebeen required to issue a citation and commence enforcementproceedings. See 30 U. S. C. $$ 815(a) and 820 (1988 ed. andSupp. IV). Nothing in the language and structure of theAct or its legislative history suggests that Congress intendedto allow mine operators to evade the statutory-review proc-ess by enjoining the Secretary from commencing enforcement proceedings, as petitioner sought to do here. To up-hold the District Court's jurisdiction in these circumstanceswould be inimical to the structure and the purposes of theMine Act.IVPetitioner finally contends, in the alternative, that dueprocess requires district court review because the absence ofpre-enforcement declaratory relief before the Commissionwill subject petitioner to serious and irreparable harm. Weneed not consider this claim, however, because neither compliance with, nor continued violation of, the statute will sub-ject petitioner to a serious prehearing deprivation.The record before us contains no evidence that petitionerwill be subject to serious harm if it complies with 30 U. S. C.$ 813(f) and 30 CFR pt. 40 by posting the designations, andthe potential for abuse of the miners' representative positionappears limited.

S. 200 (1994)Opinion of the Courtdoes not convey "an uncontrolled access right to the mineproperty to engage in any activity that the miners' representative wants." App. 49. Statutory inspections ofpetitioner's mine need occur only twice annually and areconducted with representatives of the Secretary and theoperator. Because the miners' representative cannot receive advance notice of an inspection, the ability of the nonemployee UMWA designees to exercise these limited walkaround rights is speculative. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; Brieffor International Union, UMWA, as Amicus Curiae 11, n. 2.Although it is possible that a miners' representative couldabuse his privileges, we agree with the Court of Appealsthat petitioner has failed to demonstrate that such abuse,entirely hypothetical on the record before us, cannot be remedied on an individual basis under the Mine Act. See 969F. 2d, at 976-977, and n. 6; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Secretary of Labor, 897 F. 2d 447, 452 (CA10 1990); Kerr-McGeeCoal Corp. v. Secretary, 15 F. M. S. H. R. C. 352, 361-362(1993).21Nor will petitioner face any serious prehearing deprivation if it refuses to post the designations while challenging21 Without addressing the merits of petitioner's underlying claim, wenote that petitioner appears to misconstrue Lechmere, Inc. v. NLRB, 502U. S. 527 (1992). The right of employers to exclude union organizers fromtheir private property emanates from state common law, and while thisright is not superseded by the NLRA, nothing in the NLRA expresslyprotects it. To the contrary, this Court consistently has maintained thatthe NLRA may entitle union employees to obtain access to an employer'sproperty under limited circumstances. See id., at 537; NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105, 112 (1956). Moreover, in a related context, the Court has held that Congress' interest in regulating the miningindustry may justify limiting the private property interests of mine operators. See Donovan v. Dewey, 452 U. S. 594 (1981) (unannounced Mine Actinspections do not violate the Fourth Amendment).510us1$14F 06-18-97 17:31:47 PAGES OPINPGT218 THUNDER BASIN COAL CO. v. REICHOpinion of the Courtthe Secretary's interpretation.22 Although the Act's civilpenalties unquestionably may become onerous if petitionerchooses not to comply, the Secretary's penalty assessmentsbecome final and payable only after full review by both theCommission and the appropriate court of appeals. 30U. S. C. $$ 820(i) and 816. A mine operator may request thatthe Commission expedite its proceedings, $ 815(d), and temporary relief of certain orders is available from the Commission and the court of appeals. $$ 815(b)(2) and 816(a)(2).Thus, this case does not present the situation confronted inEx parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 148 (1908), in which the practical effect of coercive penalties for noncompliance was toforeclose all access to the courts. Nor does this approacha situation in which compliance is sufficiently onerous andcoercive penalties sufficiently potent that a constitutionallyintolerable choice might be presented.VWe conclude that the Mine Act's administrative structurewas intended to preclude district court jurisdiction over petitioner's claims and that those claims can be meaningfully reviewed through that structure consistent with due process.23The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.
