C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7).1 Austin filed a claim and ananswer to the complaint.On February 4, 1991, the United States made a motion,supported by an affidavit from Sioux Falls Police OfficerDonald Satterlee, for summary judgment. According toSatterlee's affidavit, Austin met Keith Engebretson at Austin's body shop on June 13, 1990, and agreed to sell cocaineto Engebretson. Austin left the shop, went to his mobilehome, and returned to the shop with two grams of cocainewhich he sold to Engebretson. State authorities executed asearch warrant on the body shop and mobile home the follow-ing day. They discovered small amounts of marijuana andcocaine, a .22 caliber revolver, drug paraphernalia, and ap-proximately $4,700 in cash. App. 13. In opposing summaryjudgment, Austin argued that forfeiture of the propertieswould violate the Eighth Amendment.2 The District Courtrejected this argument and entered summary judgment forthe United States.Id., at 19.The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit"reluctantly agree[d] with the government" and affirmed.1 These statutes provide for the forfeiture of:"(4) All conveyances, including aircraft, vehicles, or vessels, which areused, or are intended for use, to transport, or in any manner to facilitatethe transportation, sale, receipt, possession, or concealment of [controlledsubstances, their raw materials, and equipment used in their manufactureand distribution]. . . . ."(7) All real property, including any right, title, and interest (including any leasehold interest) in the whole of any lot or tract of land andany appurtenances or improvements, which is used, or intended to beused, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commissionof, a violation of this subchapter punishable by more than one year'simprisonment . . . ."Each provision has an "innocent owner" exception.

Although it thought that "the principle of proportionality should be applied in civil actions that result in harshpenalties," ibid., and that the Government was "exacting toohigh a penalty in relation to the offense committed," id., at818, the court felt constrained from holding the forfeitureunconstitutional. It cited this Court's decision in CaleroToledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.

We have had occasion toconsider this Clause only once before. In Browning-FerrisIndustries of Vt., Inc. v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.

S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the Courtopinion, concurring in part and dissenting in part, reviewedin some detail the history of the Excessive Fines Clause.See id., at 264-268, 286-297. The Court concluded that boththe Eighth Amendment and $ 10 of the English Bill of Rightsof 1689, from which it derives, were intended to prevent thegovernment from abusing its power to punish, see id., at266-267, and therefore that "the Excessive Fines Clause wasintended to limit only those fines directly imposed by, andpayable to, the government," id., at 268.3We found it unnecessary to decide in Browning-Ferriswhether the Excessive Fines Clause applies only to criminalcases. Id., at 263. The United States now argues that"any claim that the government's conduct in a civil pro-ceeding is limited by the Eighth Amendment generally,or by the Excessive Fines Clause in particular, must failunless the challenged governmental action, despite itslabel, would have been recognized as a criminal punish-ment at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted."Brief for United States 16 (emphasis added).It further suggests that the Eighth Amendment cannotapply to a civil proceeding unless that proceeding is so punitive that it must be considered criminal under Kennedy v.Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963), and United Statesv. Ward, 448 U. S. 242 (1980). Brief for United States 26-27.We disagree.Some provisions of the Bill of Rights are expresslylimited to criminal cases. The Fifth Amendment's SelfIncrimination Clause, for example, provides: "No person . . .shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness3 In Browning-Ferris, we left open the question whether the ExcessiveFines Clause applies to qui tam actions in which a private party bringssuit in the name of the United States and shares in the proceeds. See492 U. S., at 276, n. 21. Because the instant suit was prosecuted by theUnited States and because Austin's property was forfeited to the UnitedStates, we have no occasion to address that question here.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT608 AUSTIN v.

S., at 248.4 The text ofthe Eighth Amendment includes no similar limitation. Seen. 2, supra.Nor does the history of the Eighth Amendment requiresuch a limitation. Justice O'Connor noted in BrowningFerris: "Consideration of the Eighth Amendment imme-diately followed consideration of the Fifth Amendment.4 As a general matter, this Court's decisions applying constitutional protections to civil forfeiture proceedings have adhered to this distinctionbetween provisions that are limited to criminal proceedings and provisionsthat are not. Thus, the Court has held that the Fourth Amendment'sprotection against unreasonable searches and seizures applies in forfeitureproceedings, see One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, 380 U. S.693, 696 (1965); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 634 (1886), but thatthe Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause does not, see United Statesv. Zucker, 161 U. S. 475, 480-482 (1896). It has also held that the dueprocess requirement that guilt in a criminal proceeding be proved beyonda reasonable doubt, see In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970), does not applyto civil forfeiture proceedings. See Lilienthal's Tobacco v. United States,97 U. S. 237, 271-272 (1878).The Double Jeopardy Clause has been held not to apply in civil forfeiture proceedings, but only in cases where the forfeiture could properly becharacterized as remedial. See United States v. One Assortment of 89Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 364 (1984); One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v.United States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972); see generally United States v.Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 446-449 (1989) (Double Jeopardy Clause prohibitssecond sanction that may not fairly be characterized as remedial). Conversely, the Fifth Amendment's Self-Incrimination Clause, which is textually limited to "criminal case[s]," has been applied in civil forfeiture proceedings, but only where the forfeiture statute had made the culpabilityof the owner relevant, see United States v. United States Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715, 721-722 (1971), or where the owner faced the possibility of subsequent criminal proceedings, see Boyd, 116 U. S., at 634; seealso United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 253-254 (1980) (discussing Boyd).And, of course, even those protections associated with criminal casesmay apply to a civil forfeiture proceeding if it is so punitive that theproceeding must reasonably be considered criminal. See Kennedy v.Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963); Ward, supra.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT609Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the CourtAf ter deciding to confine the benefits of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment to criminalproceedings, the Framers turned their attention to theEighth Amendment. There were no proposals to limit thatAmendment to criminal proceedings . . . ." 492 U. S., at 294.Section 10 of the English Bill of Rights of 1689 is not expressly limited to criminal cases either. The original draftof $ 10 as introduced in the House of Commons did containsuch a restriction, but only with respect to the bail clause:"The requiring excessive Bail of Persons committed in criminal Cases, and imposing excessive Fines, and illegal Punish-ments, to be prevented." 10 H. C. Jour. 17 (1688). Theabsence of any similar restriction in the other two clausessuggests that they were not limited to criminal cases. Inthe final version, even the reference to criminal cases in thebail clause was omitted. See 1 W. & M., 2d Sess., ch. 2, 3Stat. at Large 441 (1689) ("That excessive Bail ought not tobe required, nor excessive Fines imposed; nor cruel and unusual Punishments inflicted"); see also L. Schwoerer, TheDeclaration of Rights, 1689, p. 88 (1981) ("But article 10 contains no reference to `criminal cases' and, thus, would seemto apply . . . to all cases").5The purpose of the Eighth Amendment, putting the BailClause to one side, was to limit the government's power topunish. See Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S., at 266-267, 275.The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause is self-evidentlyconcerned with punishment. The Excessive Fines Clauselimits the government's power to extract payments, whether5 In Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977), we concluded that theomission of any reference to criminal cases in $ 10 was without substantivesignificance in light of the preservation of a similar reference to criminalcases in the preamble to the English Bill of Rights. Id., at 665. Thisreference in the preamble, however, related only to excessive bail. See 1W. & M., 2d Sess., ch. 2, 3 Stat. at Large 440 (1689). Moreover, the preamble appears designed to catalog the misdeeds of James II, see ibid., ratherthan to define the scope of the substantive rights set out in subsequentsections.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT610 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtin cash or in kind, "as punishment for some offense." Id.,at 265 (emphasis added). "The notion of punishment, as wecommonly understand it, cuts across the division betweenthe civil and the criminal law." United States v. Halper, 490U. S. 435, 447-448 (1989). "It is commonly understood thatcivil proceedings may advance punitive as well as remedialgoals, and, conversely, that both punitive and remedial goalsmay be served by criminal penalties."Id., at 447. See alsoUnited States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 554 (1943)(Frankfurter, J., concurring). Thus, the question is not, asthe United States would have it, whether forfeiture under$$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) is civil or criminal, but rather whetherit is punishment.6In considering this question, we are mindful of the factthat sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose. Weneed not exclude the possibility that a forfeiture serves re-medial purposes to conclude that it is subject to the limitations of the Excessive Fines Clause. We, however, must de-termine that it can only be explained as serving in part topunish. We said in Halper that "a civil sanction that cannotfairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rathercan only be explained as also serving either retributive ordeterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come to understand the term." 490 U. S., at 448. We turn, then, toconsider whether, at the time the Eighth Amendment wasratified, forfeiture was understood at least in part as punish6 For this reason, the United States' reliance on Kennedy v. MendozaMartinez and United States v. Ward is misplaced. The question in thosecases was whether a nominally civil penalty should be reclassified as criminal and the safeguards that attend a criminal prosecution should be required. See Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S., at 167, 184; Ward, 448 U. S., at248. In addressing the separate question whether punishment is beingimposed, the Court has not employed the tests articulated in MendozaMartinez and Ward. See, e. g., United States v. Halper, 490 U. S., at 447.Since in this case we deal only with the question whether the EighthAmendment's Excessive Fines Clause applies, we need not address theapplication of those tests.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT611Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the Courtment and whether forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)should be so understood today.IIIAThree kinds of forfeiture were established in England atthe time the Eighth Amendment was ratified in the UnitedStates: deodand, forfeiture upon conviction for a felony ortreason, and statutory forfeiture. SeeCalero-Toledo, 416U. S., at 680-683. Each was understood, at least in part, asimposing punishment."At common law the value of an inanimate object di-rectly or indirectly causing the accidental death of aKing's subject was forfeited to the Crown as a deodand.The origins of the deodand are traceable to Biblical andpre-Judeo-Christian practices, which reflected the viewthat the instrument of death was accused and that religious expiation was required. See O. Holmes, TheCommon Law, c. 1 (1881). The value of the instrumentwas forfeited to the King, in the belief that the Kingwould provide the money for Masses to be said for thegood of the dead man's soul, or insure that the deodandwas put to charitable uses. 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *300. When application of the deodand to reli-gious or eleemosynary purposes ceased, and the deodandbecame a source of Crown revenue, the institution wasjustified as a penalty for carelessness."Id., at 680-681(footnotes omitted).As Blackstone put it, "such misfortunes are in part owing tothe negligence of the owner, and therefore he is properlypunished by such forfeiture." 1 W. Blackstone, Commentar-ies *301.The second kind of common-law forfeiture fell only uponthose convicted of a felony or of treason. "The convictedfelon forfeited his chattels to the Crown and his lands es509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT612 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtcheated to his lord; the convicted traitor forfeited all of hisproperty, real and personal, to the Crown." Calero-Toledo,416 U. S., at 682. Such forfeitures were known as forfeitures of estate. See 4 W. Blackstone, at *381. These forfeitures obviously served to punish felons and traitors, see ThePalmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14 (1827), and were justified on theground that property was a right derived from society whichone lost by violating society's laws, see 1 W. Blackstone, at*299; 4 id., at *382.Third, "English Law provided for statutory forfeitures ofoffending objects used in violation of the customs and revenue laws." Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 682. The most notable of these were the Navigation Acts of 1660 that requiredthe shipping of most commodities in English vessels. Violations of the Acts resulted in the forfeiture of the illegallycarried goods as well as the ship that transported them.See generally L. Harper, English Navigation Laws (1939).The statute was construed so that the act of an individualseaman, undertaken without the knowledge of the masteror owner, could result in forfeiture of the entire ship. SeeMitchell v. Torup, Park. 227, 145 Eng. Rep. 764 (Ex. 1766).Yet Blackstone considered such forfeiture statutes "penal."3 W. Blackstone, at *261.In Calero-Toledo, we observed that statutory forfeitureswere "likely a product of the confluence and merger of thedeodand tradition and the belief that the right to own property could be denied the wrongdoer." 416 U. S., at 682.Since each of these traditions had a punitive aspect, it is notsurprising that forfeiture under the Navigation Acts was justified as a penalty for negligence: "But the Owners of Shipsare to take Care what Master they employ, and the Masterwhat Mariners; and here Negligence is plainly imputable tothe Master; for he is to report the Cargo of the Ship, and ifhe had searched and examined the Ship with proper care,according to his Duty, he would have found the Tea . . . and509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT613Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the Courtso might have prevented the Forfeiture." Mitchell, Park.,at 238, 145 Eng. Rep., at 768.BOf England's three kinds of forfeiture, only the third tookhold in the United States. "Deodands did not become partof the common-law tradition of this country." CaleroToledo, 416 U. S., at 682. The Constitution forbids forfeitureof estate as a punishment for treason "except during the Lifeof the Person attainted," U. S. Const., Art. III, $ 3, cl. 2, andthe First Congress also abolished forfeiture of estate as apunishment for felons. Act of Apr. 30, 1790, ch. 9, $ 24, 1Stat. 117. "But `[l]ong before the adoption of the Constitution the common law courts in the Colonies--and later in thestates during the period of Confederation--were exercisingjurisdiction in rem in the enforcement of [English and local]forfeiture statutes.' "Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 683, quot-ing C. J. Hendry Co. v. Moore, 318 U. S. 133, 139 (1943).The First Congress passed laws subjecting ships and car-gos involved in customs offenses to forfeiture. It does notfollow from that fact, however, that the First Congressthought such forfeitures to be beyond the purview of theEighth Amendment. Indeed, examination of those lawssuggests that the First Congress viewed forfeiture as punishment. For example, by the Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5,$ 12, 1 Stat. 39, Congress provided that goods could not beunloaded except during the day and with a permit."[A]nd if the master or commander of any ship or vesselshall suffer or permit the same, such master and commander, and every other person who shall be aiding orassisting in landing, removing, housing, or otherwise securing the same, shall forfeit and pay the sum of fourhundred dollars for every offence; shall moreover be disabled from holding any office of trust or profit under theUnited States, for a term not exceeding seven years; andit shall be the duty of the collector of the district, to509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT614 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtadvertise the names of all such persons in the publicgazette of the State in which he resides, within twentydays after each respective conviction. And all goods,wares and merchandise, so landed or discharged, shallbecome forfeited, and may be seized by any officer of thecustoms; and where the value thereof shall amount tofour hundred dollars, the vessel, tackle, apparel and fur-niture, shall be subject to like forfeiture and seizure."Forfeiture of the goods and vessel is listed alongside theother provisions for punishment. It is also of some interestthat "forfeit" is the word Congress used for fine. See ibid.("shall forfeit and pay the sum of four hundred dollars forevery offence").7 Other early forfeiture statutes follow thesame pattern. See,e. g., Act of Aug. 4, 1790, ch. 34, $$ 13,22, 27, 28, 1 Stat. 157, 161, 163.COur cases also have recognized that statutory in rem for-feiture imposes punishment. In Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch347 (1808), for example, the Court held that goods removedfrom the custody of a revenue officer without the paymentof duties should not be forfeitable for that reason unless theywere removed with the consent of the owner or his agent.Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion for a unani-mous Court:"The court is also of opinion that the removal forwhich the act punishes the owner with a forfeiture of7 Dictionaries of the time confirm that "fine" was understood to include"forfeiture" and vice versa. See 1 T. Sheridan, A General Dictionary ofthe English Language (1780) (unpaginated) (defining "fine" as: "A mulct, apecuniary punishment; penalty; forfeit, money paid for any exemption orliberty"); J. Walker, A Critical Pronouncing Dictionary (1791) (unpaginated) (same); 1 Sheridan, supra (defining "forfeiture" as: "The act of forfeiting; the thing forfeited, a mulct, a fine"); Walker, supra (same); J. Kersey, A New English Dictionary (1702) (unpaginated) (defining "forfeit" as:"default, fine, or penalty").509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT615Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the Courtthe goods must be made with his consent or connivance,or with that of some person employed or trusted by him.If, by private theft, or open robbery, without any faulton his part, his property should be invaded, while in thecustody of the officer of the revenue, the law cannot beunderstood to punish him with the forfeiture of thatproperty." Id., at 364.8The same understanding of forfeiture as punishment runsthrough our cases rejecting the "innocence" of the owner as acommon-law defense to forfeiture. See, e. g., Calero-Toledo,416 U. S., at 683;J. W. Goldsmith, Jr.-Grant Co. v. UnitedStates, 254 U. S. 505 (1921); Dobbins's Distillery v. UnitedStates, 96 U. S. 395 (1878); Harmony v. United States, 2 How.210 (1844); The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1 (1827). In thesecases, forfeiture has been justified on two theories--that theproperty itself is "guilty" of the offense, and that the ownermay be held accountable for the wrongs of others to whomhe entrusts his property. Both theories rest, at bottom, onthe notion that the owner has been negligent in allowing hisproperty to be misused and that he is properly punished forthat negligence.The fiction that "the thing is primarily considered the of-fender,"Goldsmith-Grant Co., 254 U. S., at 511, has a venera-ble history in our case law.9 See The Palmyra, 12 Wheat.,8 In Peisch, the removal of the goods from the custody of the revenueofficer occurred not by theft or robbery, but pursuant to a writ of replevinissued by a state court. See 4 Cranch, at 360. Thus, Peisch stands forthe general principle that "the law is not understood to forfeit the property of owners or consignees, on account of the misconduct of mere strangers, over whom such owners or consignees could have no control." Id.,at 365.9 The Government relies heavily on this fiction. See Brief for UnitedStates 18. We do not understand the Government to rely separately onthe technical distinction between proceedings in rem and proceedings inpersonam, but we note that any such reliance would be misplaced. "Thefictions of in rem forfeiture were developed primarily to expand the reachof the courts," Republic Nat. Bank of Miami v. United States, 506 U. S.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT616 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtat 14 ("The thing is here primarily considered as the of-fender, or rather the offence is attached primarily to thething"); Harmony, 2 How., at 233 ("The vessel which com-mits the aggression is treated as the offender, as the guiltyinstrument or thing to which the forfeiture attaches, withoutany reference whatsoever to the character or conduct of theowner"); Dobbins's Distillery, 96 U. S., at 401 ("[T]he offence. . . is attached primarily to the distillery, and the real andpersonal property used in connection with the same, withoutany regard whatsoever to the personal misconduct or responsibility of the owner"). Yet the Court has understood thisfiction to rest on the notion that the owner who allows hisproperty to become involved in an offense has been negli-gent. Thus, in Goldsmith-Grant Co., the Court said that"ascribing to the property a certain personality, a power ofcomplicity and guilt in the wrong," had "some analogy to thelaw of deodand." 254 U. S., at 510. It then quoted Black-stone's explanation of the reason for deodand: that " `suchmisfortunes are in part owing to the negligence of the owner,and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture.' "Id., at 510-511, quoting 1 W. Blackstone, at *301.In none of these cases did the Court apply the guiltyproperty fiction to justify forfeiture when the owner haddone all that reasonably could be expected to prevent theunlawful use of his property. In The Palmyra, it did nomore than reject the argument that the criminal convictionof the owner was a prerequisite to the forfeiture of his prop-erty. See 12 Wheat., at 15 ("[N]o personal conviction of theoffender is necessary to enforce a forfeiture in rem in casesof this nature"). In Harmony, the owners' claim of "innocence" was limited to the fact that they "never contemplated80, 87 (1992), which, particularly in admiralty proceedings, might havelacked in personam jurisdiction over the owner of the property. See alsoHarmony v. United States, 2 How. 210, 233 (1844). As is discussed in thetext, forfeiture proceedings historically have been understood as imposingpunishment despite their in rem nature.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT617Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the Courtor authorized the acts complained of." 2 How., at 230. Andin Dobbins's Distillery, the Court noted that some responsibility on the part of the owner arose "from the fact that heleased the property to the distiller, and suffered it to be occupied and used by the lessee as a distillery." 96 U. S., at 401.The more recent cases have expressly reserved the questionwhether the fiction could be employed to forfeit the propertyof a truly innocent owner. See, e. g., Goldsmith-Grant Co.,254 U. S., at 512;Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 689-690 (notingthat forfeiture of a truly innocent owner's property wouldraise "serious constitutional questions").10 If forfeiture hadbeen understood not to punish the owner, there would havebeen no reason to reserve the case of a truly innocent owner.Indeed, it is only on the assumption that forfeiture serves inpart to punish that the Court's past reservation of that question makes sense.The second theory on which the Court has justified theforfeiture of an "innocent" owner's property is that theowner may be held accountable for the wrongs of others towhom he entrusts his property. InHarmony, it reasonedthat "the acts of the master and crew, in cases of this sort,bind the interest of the owner of the ship, whether he beinnocent or guilty; and he impliedly submits to whatever thelaw denounces as a forfeiture attached to the ship by reasonof their unlawful or wanton wrongs." 2 How., at 234. Itrepeated this reasoning in Dobbins's Distillery:"[T]he unlawful acts of the distiller bind the owner ofthe property, in respect to the management of the same,as much as if they were committed by the owner himself.Power to that effect the law vests in him by virtue ofhis lease; and, if he abuses his trust, it is a matter to besettled between him and his lessor; but the acts of viola10 Because the forfeiture provisions at issue here exempt "innocent owners," we again have no occasion to decide in this case whether it wouldcomport with due process to forfeit the property of a truly innocent owner.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT618 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courttion as to the penal consequences to the property are tobe considered just the same as if they were the acts ofthe owner." 96 U. S., at 404.Like the guilty-property fiction, this theory of vicarious lia-bility is premised on the idea that the owner has been negligent. Thus, in Calero-Toledo, we noted that application offorfeiture provisions "to lessors, bailors, or secured creditorswho are innocent of any wrongdoing . . . may have the desir-able effect of inducing them to exercise greater care in transferring possession of their property." 416 U. S., at 688.11In sum, even though this Court has rejected the "innocence" of the owner as a common-law defense to forfeiture,it consistently has recognized that forfeiture serves, at leastin part, to punish the owner. See Peisch v. Ware, 4 Cranch,at 364 ("[T]he act punishes the owner with a forfeiture of thegoods"); Dobbins's Distillery, 96 U. S., at 404 ("[T]he acts ofviolation as to the penal consequences to the property are tobe considered just the same as if they were the acts of theowner");Goldsmith-Grant Co., 254 U. S., at 511 (" `[S]uchmisfortunes are in part owing to the negligence of the owner,and therefore he is properly punished by such forfeiture' ").More recently, we have noted that forfeiture serves "punitiveand deterrent purposes," Calero-Toledo, 416 U. S., at 686,and "impos[es] an economic penalty,"id., at 687. We con-clude, therefore, that forfeiture generally and statutory inrem forfeiture in particular historically have been under-stood, at least in part, as punishment.1211 In the criminal context, we have permitted punishment in the absenceof conscious wrongdoing, so long as the defendant was not " `powerless' toprevent or correct the violation." United States v. Park, 421 U. S. 658,673 (1975) (corporate officer strictly liable under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). There is nothing inconsistent, therefore, in viewing forfeitureas punishment even though the forfeiture is occasioned by the acts of aperson other than the owner.12 The doubts that Justice Scalia, see post, at 625-627, and JusticeKennedy, see post, at 629, express with regard to the historical understanding of forfeiture as punishment appear to stem from a misunder509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT619Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIVWe turn next to consider whether forfeitures under 21U. S. C. $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are properly considered pun-ishment today. We find nothing in these provisions or theirlegislative history to contradict the historical understandingof forfeiture as punishment. Unlike traditional forfeiturestatutes, $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) expressly provide an "inno-cent owner" defense. See $ 881(a)(4)(C) ("[N]o conveyanceshall be forfeited under this paragraph to the extent of aninterest of an owner, by reason of any act or omission established by that owner to have been committed or omittedwithout the knowledge, consent, or willful blindness of theowner"); $ 881(a)(7) ("[N]o property shall be forfeited underthis paragraph, to the extent of an interest of an owner, byreason of any act or omission established by that owner tohave been committed or omitted without the knowledge orconsent of that owner"); see also United States v. Parcel ofRumson, N. J., Land, 507 U. S. 111, 122-123 (1993) (pluralityopinion) (noting difference from traditional forfeiture statutes). These exemptions serve to focus the provisions onthe culpability of the owner in a way that makes them lookmore like punishment, not less. In United States v. UnitedStates Coin & Currency, 401 U. S. 715 (1971), we reasonedthat 19 U. S. C. $ 1618, which provides that the Secretary ofthe Treasury is to return the property of those who do notintend to violate the law, demonstrated Congress' intent "toimpose a penalty only upon those who are significantly involved in a criminal enterprise." 401 U. S., at 721-722.The inclusion of innocent-owner defenses in $$ 881(a)(4) and(a)(7) reveals a similar congressional intent to punish onlythose involved in drug trafficking.standing of the relevant question. Under United States v. Halper, 490U. S. 435, 448 (1989), the question is whether forfeiture serves in part topunish, and one need not exclude the possibility that forfeiture servesother purposes to reach that conclusion.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT620 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the CourtFurthermore, Congress has chosen to tie forfeiture directly to the commission of drug offenses. Thus, under$ 881(a)(4), a conveyance is forfeitable if it is used or intendedfor use to facilitate the transportation of controlled substances, their raw materials, or the equipment used to manufacture or distribute them. Under $ 881(a)(7), real propertyis forfeitable if it is used or intended for use to facilitate thecommission of a drug-related crime punishable by more thanone year's imprisonment. See n. 1, supra.The legislative history of $ 881 confirms the punitive nature of these provisions. When it added subsection (a)(7)to $ 881 in 1984, Congress recognized "that the traditionalcriminal sanctions of fine and imprisonment are inadequateto deter or punish the enormously profitable trade in dangerous drugs." S. Rep. No. 98-225, p. 191 (1983).13 Itcharacterized the forfeiture of real property as "a powerfuldeterrent." Id., at 195. See also Joint House-Senate Explanation of Senate Amendment to Titles II and III of thePsychotropic Substances Act of 1978, 124 Cong. Rec. 34671(1978) (noting "the penal nature of forfeiture statutes").The Government argues that $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) are notpunitive but, rather, should be considered remedial in tworespects. First, they remove the "instruments" of the drugtrade "thereby protecting the community from the threat ofcontinued drug dealing." Brief for United States 32. Second, the forfeited assets serve to compensate the Government for the expense of law enforcement activity and for itsexpenditure on societal problems such as urban blight, drugaddiction, and other health concerns resulting from the drugtrade. Id., at 25, 32.13 Although the United States omits any reference to this legislative history in its brief in the present case, it quoted the same passage with approval in its brief in United States v. Parcel of Rumson, N. J., Land, 507U. S. 111 (1993). See Brief for United States, O. T. 1992, No. 91-781,pp. 41-42.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT621Cite as: 509 U. S. 602 (1993)Opinion of the CourtIn our view, neither argument withstands scrutiny. Con-cededly, we have recognized that the forfeiture of contrabanditself may be characterized as remedial because it removesdangerous or illegal items from society. SeeUnited Statesv. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 364 (1984).The Court, however, previously has rejected government'sattempt to extend that reasoning to conveyances used totransport illegal liquor. See One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v.Pennsylvania, 380 U. S. 693, 699 (1965). In that case itnoted: "There is nothing even remotely criminal in possess-ing an automobile."Ibid. The same, without question, istrue of the properties involved here, and the Government'sattempt to characterize these properties as "instruments"of the drug trade must meet the same fate as Pennsylvania's effort to characterize the 1958 Plymouth sedan as"contraband."The Government's second argument about the remedialnature of this forfeiture is no more persuasive. We previously have upheld the forfeiture of goods involved in customs violations as "a reasonable form of liquidated damages." One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409U. S. 232, 237 (1972). But the dramatic variations in thevalue of conveyances and real property forfeitable under$$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) undercut any similar argument withrespect to those provisions. The Court made this very pointin Ward: The "forfeiture of property . . . [is] a penalty thatha[s] absolutely no correlation to any damages sustained bysociety or to the cost of enforcing the law." 448 U. S., at 254.Fundamentally, even assuming that $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7)serve some remedial purpose, the Government's argumentmust fail. "[A] civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solelyto serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explainedas also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, ispunishment, as we have come to understand the term."Halper, 490 U. S., at 448 (emphasis added). In light of thehistorical understanding of forfeiture as punishment, the509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT622 AUSTIN v. UNITED STATESOpinion of the Courtclear focus of $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) on the culpability of theowner, and the evidence that Congress understood those provisions as serving to deter and to punish, we cannot concludethat forfeiture under $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) serves solely aremedial purpose.14 We therefore conclude that forfeitureunder these provisions constitutes "payment to a sovereignas punishment for some offense," Browning-Ferris, 492 U. S.,at 265, and, as such, is subject to the limitations of the EighthAmendment's Excessive Fines Clause.VAustin asks that we establish a multifactor test for determining whether a forfeiture is constitutionally "excessive."See Brief for Petitioner 46-48. We decline that invitation.Although the Court of Appeals opined that "the governmentis exacting too high a penalty in relation to the offense committed," 964 F. 2d, at 818, it had no occasion to consider whatfactors should inform such a decision because it thought itwas foreclosed from engaging in the inquiry. Prudence dictates that we allow the lower courts to consider that question14 In Halper, we focused on whether "the sanction as applied in the individual case serves the goals of punishment." 490 U. S., at 448. In thiscase, however, it makes sense to focus on $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) as a whole.Halper involved a small, fixed-penalty provision, which "in the ordinarycase . . . can be said to do no more than make the Government whole."Id., at 449. The value of the conveyances and real property forfeitableunder $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7), on the other hand, can vary so dramaticallythat any relationship between the Government's actual costs and theamount of the sanction is merely coincidental. See Ward, 448 U. S., at254. Furthermore, as we have seen, forfeiture statutes historically havebeen understood as serving not simply remedial goals but also those ofpunishment and deterrence. Finally, it appears to make little practicaldifference whether the Excessive Fines Clause applies to all forfeituresunder $$ 881(a)(4) and (a)(7) or only to those that cannot be characterizedas purely remedial. The Clause prohibits only the imposition of "excessive" fines, and a fine that serves purely remedial purposes cannot beconsidered "excessive" in any event.509us3115K 03-27-97 17:49:14 PAGES OPINPGT623Cite as: 509 U.
